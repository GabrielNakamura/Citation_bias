AB Background
   Tropical mountain forests are hotspots of biodiversity hosting a huge but little known diversity of insects that is endangered by habitat destruction and climate change. Therefore, rapid assessment approaches of insect diversity are urgently needed to complement slower traditional taxonomic approaches. We empirically compare different DNA-based species delimitation approaches for a rapid biodiversity assessment of hyperdiverse leaf beetle assemblages along an elevational gradient in southern Ecuador and explore their effect on species richness estimates.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Based on a COI barcode data set of 674 leaf beetle specimens (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) of 266 morphospecies from three sample sites in the Podocarpus National Park, we employed statistical parsimony analysis, distance-based clustering, GMYC- and PTP-modelling to delimit species-like units and compared themtomorphology-based (parataxonomic) species identifications. The four different approaches for DNA-based species delimitation revealed highly similar numbers of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) (n = 284-289). Estimated total species richness was considerably higher than the sampled amount, 414 for morphospecies (Chao2) and 469-481 for the different MOTU types. Assemblages at different elevational levels (1000 vs. 2000 m) had similar species numbers but a very distinct species composition for all delimitation methods. Most species were found only at one elevation while this turnover pattern was even more pronounced for DNA-based delimitation.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Given the high congruence of DNA-based delimitation results, probably due to the sampling structure, our study suggests that when applied to species communities on a regionally limited level with high amount of rare species (i.e. similar to 50% singletons), the choice of species delimitation method can be of minor relevance for assessing species numbers and turnover in tropical insect communities. Therefore, DNA-based species delimitation is confirmed as a valuable tool for evaluating biodiversity of hyperdiverse insect communities, especially when exact taxonomic identifications are missing.

AB Globally, mature forests appear to be increasing in biomass density (BD). There is disagreement whether these increases are the result of increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations or a legacy effect of previous land-use. Recently, it was suggested that a threshold of 450 years should be used to define mature forests and that many forests increasing in BD may be younger than this. However, the study making these suggestions failed to account for the interactions between forest age and climate. Here we revisit the issue to identify: (1) how climate and forest age control global forest BD and (2) whether we can set a threshold age for mature forests. Using data from previously published studies we modelled the impacts of forest age and climate on BD using linear mixed effects models. We examined the potential biases in the dataset by comparing how representative it was of global mature forests in terms of its distribution, the climate space it occupied, and the ages of the forests used. BD increased with forest age, mean annual temperature and annual precipitation. Importantly, the effect of forest age increased with increasing temperature, but the effect of precipitation decreased with increasing temperatures. The dataset was biased towards northern hemisphere forests in relatively dry, cold climates. The dataset was also clearly biased towards forests <250 years of age. Our analysis suggests that there is not a single threshold age for forest maturity. Since climate interacts with forest age to determine BD, a threshold age at which they reach equilibrium can only be determined locally. We caution against using BD as the only determinant of forest maturity since this ignores forest biodiversity and tree size structure which may take longer to recover. Future research should address the utility and cost-effectiveness of different methods for determining whether forests should be classified as mature.

AB Monitoring the rhythm of tree growth associated with the growth rings can contribute substantially to understanding forest dynamics and the management of tropical forests. In this study, we monitored the girth increment rhythm and described the wood characteristics (anatomy of growth rings, wood specific gravity) in 10 tropical tree species (103 individuals) naturally occurring in a wet and weakly seasonal region of Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. We aimed to verify whether tree growth dynamics are associated with climate and woody anatomy in tropical trees with contrasting ecological characteristics. We installed permanent dendrometer bands and monthly assessed the girth increment for 22 months. We collected wood samples (non-destructive method), measured wood specific gravity and prepared permanent slides to characterize the growth ring markers. We found growth rings in all species (distinct in six species); deciduous species produced more distinguishable tree rings compared with semi-deciduous and evergreen tree species. Species varied in their accumulated girth growth (in average, from 1.83 to 62.64 mm), growth rates (1-15 %), and annual radial increment (0.16-5.44 mm). Girth increment was positively related to temperature and day length in five out of ten tree species, indicating the possible effects of these climatic variables in triggering cambial activity in these species. The growth pattern varied among species and was marginally associated to the tree deciduousness. We concluded that even in wet and less seasonal climates, there can be an association in the cambium activity and stem growth with the hotter and longer days of summer months.

AB Despite enormous significance in coastal protection, biodiversity conservation and livelihood support to the local communities, mangrove ecosystems have been continuously degrading mainly due to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. Time series based on dated tree ring is an option to identify the causes of forest dilapidation. In this study, we investigated the structure and periodicity of the growth ring in Heritiera fomes, the flagship tree species of the Bangladesh Sundarbans, combining cambial marking experiment and cambial activity analysis. Distinct growth rings were found which are delineated by a band of marginal parenchyma, predominantly one cell wide but up to three and occasionally interrupted with fiber. Of the 13 trees with cambium marking experiment, one growth ring was found in each tree during a year. The dormant cambium was characterized by the abrupt boundary between xylem and cambial zone, absence of enlarging or differentiating cambial derivatives, lower number of cambial cells and thicker radial walls in cambial cells. Growth ring anomalies, i.e., wedging and partially missing rings were also found. In most of the cases, the lower part of the eccentric discs had low radial increment (<0.75 mm) and therefore the growth ring in that area merged with previous one and produced wedging or partially missing ring. However, the existence of annual rings suggests its great potential for future dendrochronological applications to reveal the dynamics of vegetation and climate in Sundarbans.

AB Aim We used chelonian distribution data to (1) predict suitable areas of the occurrence for freshwater turtle species using species distribution models and (2) evaluate whether these species are protected by the current network of protected areas (PAs).
   Location The Brazilian Amazon.
   Methods We generated predictions of suitable areas for chelonian occurrence based on BIOCLIM, SVM, GLM and maximum entropy modelling procedures. We used maximum entropy to run the gap analysis and compared the effectiveness of three kinds of protected areas with different levels of protection: (1) integral protection areas (IPA) only; (2) integral protection areas + sustainable use areas (IPA+ SUA); and (3) integral protection areas + sustainable use areas + indigenous lands (IPA + SUA + IL).
   Results We identified only one full gap species, Mesoclemmys nasuta, whose distribution is not included in any PAs. Other chelonian species have at least a portion of their distribution included in PAs. Some protected species and partial gap species occur in areas with high rates of deforestation. Considering PAs with the highest level of protection (IPA), only Rhinoclemmys punctularia and Kinosternon scorpioides achieve their conservation targets. In the IPA + SUA scenario, conservation targets of some species with small range sizes are not achieved. When all PA types were considered (IPA + SUA + IL), only two species fail to achieve their conservation targets, Acanthochelys macrocephala and M. nasuta.
   Main conclusions Despite the large number of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon, IPAs alone are not sufficient for capturing suitable areas for freshwater turtles. The inclusion of SUA and IL is crucial for achieving coverage targets for most species. However, chelonians may be overharvested in SUAs and ILs, due to their importance as a food resource. Areas that have high turtle richness next to existing PAs and the needs of traditional cultures should be considered in management planning for freshwater turtles.

AB Nutrients have been hypothesized to influence the distribution of the savanna biome through two possible mechanisms. Low nutrient availability may restrict growth rates of trees, thereby allowing for intermittent fires to maintain low tree cover; alternatively, nutrient deficiency may even place an absolute constraint on the ability of forests to form, independent of fire. However, we have little understanding of the scales at which nutrient limitation operates, what nutrients are limiting, and the mechanisms that influence how nutrient limitation regulates savanna-forest transitions. Here, I review literature, synthesize existing data, and present a simple calculation of nutrient demand to evaluate how nutrient limitation may regulate the distribution of the savanna biome. The literature primarily supports the hypothesis that nutrients may interact dynamically with fire to restrict the transition of savanna into forest. A compilation of indirect metrics of nutrient limitation suggest that nitrogen and phosphorus are both in short supply and may limit plants. Nutrient demand calculations provided a number of insights. First, trees required high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus supply relative to empirically determined inputs. Second, nutrient demand increased as landscapes approached the transition point between savanna and forest. Third, the potential for fire-driven nutrient losses remained high throughout transitions, which may exaggerate limitation and could be a key feedback stabilizing the savanna biome. Fourth, nutrient limitation varied between functional groups, with fast-growing forest species having substantially greater nutrient demand and a higher susceptibility to fire-driven nutrient losses. Finally, African savanna trees required substantially larger amounts of nutrients supplied at greater rates, although this varied across plant functional groups. In summary, the ability of nutrients to control transitions emerges at individual and landscape scales, and is regulated through different mechanisms based on spatial (differences in underlying geology), temporal (stage in biome transition) and biological (species traits and community composition) variability.

AB Termites are ubiquitous detritivores and are a key influence on soil function and nutrient cycles, particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Locust control presents a unique hazard to termites and the effective functioning of ecosystems as a consequence of the overlap between pesticide applications and termite populations in grassland and desert landscapes. We monitored the effects of locust control methods using ultra-low-volume (ULV) barrier application of a chemical pesticide, fipronil, and a blanket application of a fungal biopesticide, Metarhizium acridum, on wood-eating termites in arid western New South Wales, Australia. We tested the hypothesis that spray applications decrease termite activity at wood baits using a BACI designed field experiment over 2 years. Our replicated control and treatment sites represented the spatial scale of Australian locust control activities. There was no detectable impact of either locust control treatment on termite activity, bait mass loss or termite community composition measures. Non-significant differences in termite survey measures among sites suggested that climate and environmental conditions were stronger drivers of our termite measures than the single, localized and unreplicated application of pesticides more commonly used in locust control operations in arid Australia. A lack of evidence for an impact of our fipronil or Metarhizium application methods supports their use as low hazard locust control options with minimal large scale and longer-term effects on termites in Australian arid rangelands. Future research would be necessary to determine the probable short-term impacts of treatments on individual termite colonies and the possible impacts on non-wood eating termite species in the arid-zone.

AB Background and Aims Global pollinator declines and continued habitat fragmentation highlight the critical need to understand reproduction and gene flow across plant populations. Plant size, conspecific density and local kinship (i.e. neighbourhood genetic relatedness) have been proposed as important mechanisms influencing the reproductive success of flowering plants, but have rarely been simultaneously investigated.
   Methods We conducted this study on a continuous population of the understorey tree Miconia affinis in the Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island in central Panama. We used spatial, reproductive and population genetic data to investigate the effects of tree size, conspecific neighbourhood density and local kinship on maternal and paternal reproductive success. We used a Bayesian framework to simultaneously model the effects of our explanatory variables on the mean and variance of maternal viable seed set and siring success.
   Key Results Our results reveal that large trees had lower proportions of viable seeds in their fruits but sired more seeds. We documented differential effects of neighbourhood density and local kinship on both maternal and paternal reproductive components. Trees in more dense neighbourhoods produced on average more viable seeds, although this positive density effect was influenced by variance-inflation with increasing local kinship. Neighbourhood density did not have significant effects on siring success.
   Conclusions This study is one of the first to reveal an interaction among tree size, conspecific density and local kinship as critical factors differentially influencing maternal and paternal reproductive success. We show that both maternal and paternal reproductive success should be evaluated to determine the population-level and individual traits most essential for plant reproduction. In addition to conserving large trees, we suggest the inclusion of small trees and the conservation of dense patches with low kinship as potential strategies for strengthening the reproductive status of tropical trees.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are considered the main causes of species extinctions, particularly in tropical ecosystems. The objective of this work was to evaluate the temporal dynamics of tropical bird communities in landscapes with different levels of fragmentation in eastern Guatemala. We evaluated five bird community dynamic parameters for forest specialists and generalists: (1) species extinction, (2) species turnover, (3) number of colonizing species, (4) relative species richness, and (5) a homogeneity index. For each of 24 landscapes, community dynamic parameters were estimated from bird point count data, for the 1998-1999 and 2008-2009 periods, accounting for species' detection probability. Forest specialists had higher extinction rates and a smaller number of colonizing species in landscapes with higher fragmentation, thus having lower species richness in both time periods. Alternatively, forest generalists elicited a completely different pattern, showing a curvilinear association to forest fragmentation for most parameters. Thus, greater community dynamism for forest generalists was shown in landscapes with intermediate levels of fragmentation. Our study supports general theory regarding the expected negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on the temporal dynamics of biotic communities, particularly for forest specialists, providing strong evidence from understudied tropical bird communities.

AB Market instruments such as Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) emerged as a concept to compensate and encourage landowners to improve land management practices for the maintenance and provision of ecosystem services. Since the early 1990s hundreds of PES schemes have been implemented around the world with varying levels of success. The high investments required to implement such schemes, and the stakes involved, argue for an analysis of PES cases to determine factors that contribute to a particular outcome. The paper analyses 40 PES cases in Latin America providing insights that will inform policy and decision makers in designing future PES initiatives with higher chances of success. In this study we analyse each case using a set of criteria (related to ecosystem type, compensation package and incentives, spatial and temporal scales, institutional arrangements, and policy frameworks) to determine those most important for a particular outcome. These insights provide information on programme factors that contribute to the potential for success of a given PES scheme. Although this classification can be further improved, it provides a useful reference for decision-makers on what might be considered best practice on the ground concerning PES schemes.

AB The effect of competition on species that coexist with similar ecological niches is an important theme in ecology. Furthermore, species displacement by introduced or invaded species is also an important environmental problem for biological control and conservation ecology. We tested whether two species of phytoseiids could coexist in closed cages with ample quantities of the extraguild prey species Carpoglyphus lactis (L.). Three species of phytoseiid mites-Amblyseius eharai Amitai & Swirski (a species native to China), Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) and Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) (both species were introduced from outside of China)-were tested under experimental conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 90 +/- 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 14:10 [L:D] h). With extraguild prey, we found that the numbers of a single population of each phytoseiid species (initial density of 10 females per cage) reached a plateau between 18 and 25 d after introduction into the experimental cages, suggesting that density-dependent factors were operating. In closed environments, one of these density-dependent factors might be cannibalism by these species. With regression analyses, Lotka-Volterra equations estimated the rate of population increase (r) and the carrying capacity (K) of each species with the data from observations on population dynamics. We next observed the interactions of two phytoseiid species with abundant extraguild prey. In all species combinations, one species went extinct and the other increased in population size, despite the availability of sufficient extraguild prey, suggesting some type of competition must have caused the extinctions. We suggested that intraguild predation is the most plausible hypothesis to explain the results.

AB Clonal growth may increase the likelihood for alien plants becoming invasive, as it is an efficient foraging and spatial exploration strategy. Here, we investigated the effect of artificial herbivory on organs of clonal growth and its potential to drive post-introduction evolutionary change. Based on the assumption that tolerance traits are costly and that clonal alien species may benefit from investing freed resources into growth, fecundity or nutrient acquisition, we tested the hypothesis of lower tolerance to herbivory on organs of clonal growth in alien plants. In a common-garden experiment we studied divergence in plants from native German and alien New Zealand populations of six species with different clonal growth forms. A nutrient treatment testing the plant's acquisition abilities, was combined with artificial herbivory on clonal organs. We investigated origin-dependent differences in sexual reproduction, plant growth and the production of clonal organs. For aboveground and clonal organ biomass, alien plants showed lower tolerance to artificial herbivory on clonal organs than native plants. In the combined herbivory and nutrient treatment, alien plants of four species grew fewer clonal organs when compared to the nutrient treatment alone. Alien plants of the other two species produced more clonal organs, regardless of treatment. All species revealed significant differences in flower production between origins, with five of them producing more flowers on alien than on native plants. The results support the hypothesis that a release of herbivory on clonal organs has lead to subtle evolutionary changes in tolerance of alien plants and to a species-dependent increase in plant vigour, clonal growth and/or sexual reproduction that may enhance their invasive success.

AB Population fluctuations are the result of the combined action of endogenous (feedback structure) and exogenous factors (large-and local-scale climate variables). In this paper, we used a 13-year time series to identify the feedback structure in a population of the brown 4-eyed opossum Metachirus nudicaudatus and to test a hypothesis on the effects of El Nino Southern Oscillation and rainfall using Royama's theoretical framework. Metachirus nudicaudatus was regulated by a strong 1st-order negative feedback, with intraspecific competition for food resources as the probable factor governing the endogenous system. Contrary to our expectations, El Nino did not explain the marsupial dynamics better than 1-year lagged rainfall, that may operate in 2 different manners: as a nonlinear perturbation effect influencing the strength of density dependence (intraspecific competition and intraguild predation) or as a lateral perturbation effect influencing the carrying capacity of the environment.

AB The rocky intertidal zone is among one of the most highly variable environments on Earth, with rapid and unpredictable changes in temperature on a daily basis. Numerous studies have investigated the thermal physiology of intertidal animals; however, few have focused on an organism's capacity to withstand repeated heat stress during the emersion of low-tide periods and how previous exposures to sublethal increases in temperature may modulate the capacity to withstand severe heat stress. Lottia digitalis, a species of limpet ubiquitous along the Pacific coast of North America, were acclimated under ambient ocean conditions in the laboratory during the summer and winter months. Limpets were aerially exposed with or without preliminary heat exposures of varying magnitudes (15-35 degrees C for 2 h) the day before being challenged to a lethal temperature increase to investigate how sequential low-tide-period conditions affect upper thermal tolerance and temperature sensitivity. Limpets with a preliminary aerial exposure of 25-35 degrees C (summer) and 20 degrees C (winter) had greater upper critical thermal limits of cardiac performance as determined by final breakpoint temperature (similar to 1.5-6 degrees C increase) and flatline temperature (similar to 1-2 degrees C increase) than limpets with no previous exposure. The magnitude of temperature increase that conferred significant increases in thermal tolerance differed in summer and winter, reflecting seasonal differences in the thermal environment in nature. Fingered limpets' upper thermal tolerance is plastic and likely modulated by the previous day's low-tide exposure, demonstrating the importance of incorporating the repeated nature of stress into thermal physiology research in intertidal organisms.

AB Habitat fragmentation reduces the available habitat area and increases both the distance between fragments and the amount of fragment edges. Therefore, there are more probabilities of plant population size reduction and species extinction. In the same way, biotic and abiotic changes associated with forest fragmentation can dramatically alter plant growth and phenological patterns. We conducted a 3-year study to analyze effects of habitat fragmentation and seasonal variation on host plant quality (quantity of leaves, diameter at breast height, tree height), gall abundance and species richness in a temperate oak forest. Our results show that host plant quality was significantly higher in isolated oaks and small fragments, increasing the abundance and species richness of oak gall wasp species in most fragmented habitats. Oak canopy cover is altered by forest fragmentation, there being higher production of leaves on trees that are more exposed to fragmentation, and can provide important resources for maintaining gall wasp species diversity in a fragmented landscape. We found higher gall wasp richness and abundance in autumn than in the spring, which matches with the higher quantity of leaves in this season.

AB Understanding how animals move in a complex habitat mosaic is critical to biodiversity conservation as deforested lands and secondary rainforests accumulate in landscapes previously dominated by primary forests. To visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of secondary forest recovery after pasture abandonment, we formed a conceptual model predicting avian space use during a temporal sequence beginning with deforestation and continuing through regrowth of old secondary forest. We tested five predictions of the model at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil, using 73 radio-tagged understory insectivores of three species: two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, Xiphorhynchus pardalotus) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius colma). Both woodcreepers provided evidence to support all predictions except that of greater path tortuosity in primary forest. Woodcreepers using secondary forest had larger home ranges, larger core areas, and faster movement rates than in primary forest Further, the proportion of all species' core areas in primary forest exceeded the proportion of home ranges in primary forest. Formicarius colma showed a fundamentally different pattern than the woodcreepers: it essentially avoided secondary forest until 27-31 years after pasture abandonment, at which point movements were indistinguishable from those in primary forest. Formicarius colma and other terrestrial insectivores show implastic spatiotemporal responses to recovering secondary growth, which we suspect contributes to the sensitivity of this guild to forest disturbance. Quantifying the value of marginal (and economically inconsequential) habitats such as secondary forest will be essential as land managers strive to maintain species persistence and connectivity in increasingly heterogeneous tropical landscapes.

Our findings provide novel evidence that human psychology, measured by nation-IQ is negatively related with deforestation. This paper documents that, on average moving from a country with the lowest IQ score (61) to the one with highest (107.1) is associated with a 1.15 percentage point reduction in the rate of deforestation. The negative link between intelligence and deforestation remains robust when we account for the feedback from environment to intelligence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper uses portfolio analysis to study how the Ecuadorian incentive programme for forest conservation and restoration (Socio Bosque), and an incentive programme for timber plantations, may reduce income risk and/or maximise returns for a given level of risk for farmers in the municipality of Loja. The main existing land use in the research area is milk production on pasture, with some farmers having forest land. Our results suggest that most farmers would significantly increase the area under conservation and/or restoration as part of their risk reduction strategies, compared to a decision based solely on expected returns. However, in land use allocations that maximise the return per unit of risk, a small group of milk producers without forest would continue milk production on most of their land. In addition, milk producers with forest would significantly decrease deforestation under the land use allocations made when conservation incentives are available. Against this we also identify a likely shift of milk production from existing pasture to new pasture established on deforested land, which provides evidence of a potential 'leakage effect'. In addition, the incentive programmes would only lead to small areas of tree plantations being established. None of the land use combinations (portfolios) analysed would increase the income of all households to above the poverty line, as the monetary incentives are too low and many farms are too small. For forest holders all the land use combinations we studied would have a positive impact on income, but we observed a negative impact on household income for milk producers without forest. For producers without any forest, there seems to be a trade-off between maximising household income and risk reduction through combining incentives for restoration and tree plantations.

AB Long-term human-induced impacts have significantly changed the Amazonian landscape. The most dramatic land cover and land use (LCLU) changes began in the early 1970s with the establishment of the Trans-Amazon Highway and large government projects associated with the expansion of agricultural settlement and cattle ranching, which cleared significant tropical forest cover in the areas of new and accelerated human development. Taking the changes in the LCLU over the past four decades as a basis, this study aims to determine the consequences of land cover (forest and savanna) and land use (pasturelands, mining and urban) changes on the hydroclimatology of the Itacaitinas River watershed area of the located in the southeastern Amazon region. We analyzed a multi-decadal Landsat dataset from 1973, 1984,1994, 2004 and 2013 and a 40-yr time series of water discharge from the Itacaitinas River, as well as air temperature and relative humidity data over this drainage area for the same period. We employed standard Landsat image processing techniques in conjunction with a geographic object-based image analysis and multi-resolution classification approach. With the goal of detecting possible long-term trends, non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied, based on a Sen slope estimator on a 40-yr annual PREC, TMED and RH time series, considering the spatial average of the entire watershed. In the 1970s, the region was entirely covered by forest (99%) and savanna (similar to 0.3%). Four decades later, only similar to 48% of the tropical forest remains, while pasturelands occupy approximately 50% of the watershed area. Moreover, in protected areas, nearly 97% of the tropical forest remains conserved, while the forest cover of non-protected areas is quite fragmented and, consequently, unevenly distributed, covering an area of only 30%. Based on observational data analysis, there is evidence that the conversion of forest cover to extensive and homogeneous pasturelands was accompanied by systematic modifications to the hydro climatology cycle of the Itacaignas watershed, thus highlighting drier environmental conditions due to a rise in the region's air temperature, a decrease in the relative humidity, and an increase in river discharge.

AB Recent theory predicts that stochastic dilution effects may result in species-rich communities with statistically independent species spatial distributions, even if the underlying ecological processes structuring the community are driven by deterministic niche differences. Stochastic dilution is a consequence of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity where the identities of the nearest neighbors of individuals of a given species are largely unpredictable. Under such circumstances, the outcome of deterministic species interactions may vary greatly among individuals of a given species. Consequently, nonrandom patterns in the biotic neighborhoods of species, which might be expected from coexistence or community assembly theory (e.g., individuals of a given species are neighbored by phylogenetically similar species), are weakened or do not emerge, resulting in statistical independence of species spatial distributions. We used data on phylogenetic and functional similarity of tree species in five large forest dynamics plots located across a gradient of species richness to test predictions of the stochastic dilution hypothesis. To quantify the biotic neighborhood of a focal species we used the mean phylogenetic (or functional) dissimilarity of the individuals of the focal species to all species within a local neighborhood. We then compared the biotic neighborhood of species to predictions from stochastic null models to test if a focal species was surrounded by more or less similar species than expected by chance. The proportions of focal species that showed spatial independence with respect to their biotic neighborhoods increased with total species richness. Locally dominant, high-abundance species were more likely to be surrounded by species that were statistically more similar or more dissimilar than expected by chance. Our results suggest that stochasticity may play a stronger role in shaping the spatial structure of species rich tropical forest communities than it does in species poorer forests. These findings represent an important step towards understanding the factors that govern the spatial configuration of local biotic communities. The stochastic dilution effect is a simple geometric mechanism that can explain why species' spatial distributions in species-rich communities approximate independence from their biotic neighborhood, even if deterministic niche processes are in effect.

AB Some plant functional groups such as nonnative invasive and nitrogen (N)-fixing plants are widely thought to have consistent, coordinated differences in their functional traits relative to other groups such as native and non -N-fixing plants. Recent evidence suggests that these trait differences between groups can be context dependent, varying with environmental factors such as resource availability and disturbance. However, many previous comparisons among plant groups differing in invasion status have not standardized growth form between groups or have compared species that do not co-occur, which could result in invasion status per se being confounded with other factors. We determined growth and leaf functional trait responses of 20 co-occurring woody species, that is, five species within each of four functional groups (native N-fixers, native non -N-fixers, nonnative [invasive] N-fixers and nonnative [invasive] non-N-fixers), to factorial combinations of soil fertility and defoliation treatments in a mesocosm experiment to test each of two hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that nonnative invasive and N-fixing species will have functional traits associated with rapid resource acquisition whereas natives and non -N-fixing species will have traits linked to resource conservation. Second, we hypothesized that plant growth and leaf traits of nonnative and N-fixing species will be more strongly influenced by environmental factors (i.e., soil fertility and disturbance) than will natives and non-N-fixers. Plant growth, foliar nutrients, and leaf structural traits varied among plant functional groups in a manner consistent with our first hypothesis. Support for our second hypothesis was mixed; origin (native vs. nonnative) and soil fertility rarely interacted to determine plant growth or variation in leaf traits whereas interactions involving N-fixing ability and soil fertility were common. Further, there were no consistent interactive effects between plant groupings and disturbance. Our results demonstrate that variation in growth and functional traits among plant species were driven primarily by the relatively large responses of nonnative N-fixers to soil fertility, rather than by consistent differences between other plant functional groups. These findings highlight the importance of resource availability in determining trait or performance differences among plant functional groups, and provide insights into the assembly of plant functional traits in novel communities of co-occurring native and nonnative species.

AB Analysing functional traits along environmental gradients can improve our understanding of the mechanisms structuring plant communities. Within forests, vertical gradients in light intensity, temperature and humidity are often pronounced. Vascular epiphytes are particularly suitable for studying the influence of these vertical gradients on functional traits because they lack contact with the soil and thus individual plants are entirely exposed to different environmental conditions, from the dark and humid understorey to the sunny and dry outer canopy. In this study, we analysed multiple aspects of the trait-based ecology of vascular epiphytes: shifts in trait values with height above ground (as a proxy for vertical environmental gradients) at community and species level, the importance of intra- vs. interspecific trait variability, and trait differences among taxonomic groups. We assessed ten leaf traits for 1151 individuals belonging to 83 epiphyte species of all major taxonomic groups co-occurring in a Panamanian lowland forest. Community mean trait values of many leaf traits were strongly correlated with height and particularly specific leaf area and chlorophyll concentration showed nonlinear, negative trends. Intraspecific trait variability was pronounced and accounted for one-third of total observed trait variance. Intraspecific trait adjustments along the vertical gradient were common and seventy per cent of all species showed significant trait-height relationships. In addition, intraspecific trait variability was positively correlated with the vertical range occupied by species. We observed significant trait differences between major taxonomic groups (orchids, ferns, aroids, bromeliads). In ferns, for instance, leaf dry matter content was almost twofold higher than in the other taxonomic groups. This indicates that some leaf traits are taxonomically conserved. Our study demonstrates that vertical environmental gradients strongly influence functional traits of vascular epiphytes. In order to understand community composition along such gradients, it is central to study several aspects of trait-based ecology, including both community and intraspecific trends of multiple traits.

AB The Cerrado is a fire-dependent savanna requiring a clear and urgent fire management policy. The extensive misuse of fire for deforestation or pasture management in Brazil has created an overall perception that its use is always deleterious. This view, reinforced by threats of global warming and climatic change, has lead to current policies of fire suppression.
   2. Cerrado ecosystems depend on the historical fire regime to maintain their structure, biodiversity and functioning. The suppression of fire has transformed savanna vegetation into forests, causing biodiversity losses and drastic changes in ecological processes.
   3. Policy implications. The National Fire Policy required by law must be urgently implemented in Brazil, including use of fire for Cerrado conservation in public and private lands on the basis of existing knowledge of indigenous people and scientists. Objective regulations on prescribed burning, land manager training, incentives for fire research and experimentation and a broad campaign to disseminate the benefits of fire for Cerrado conservation should be the cornerstones of the policy. If implemented, the policy can give the biodiversity of the Cerrado a future that has previously been severely threatened by fire suppression.

AB Central European calcareous grasslands are considered biodiversity hotspots, but are severely threatened by the change in land-use and by habitat fragmentation. Coniferous forests are typical adjacent habitats to calcareous grasslands, as abandoned calcareous grasslands are often afforested or develop into coniferous forests by succession. To investigate spillover between calcareous grasslands and coniferous forests, a total of 144 pitfall traps for carabid beetles were placed at three different distances (1, 5, 20 m) from the edge in both habitats at eight locations from April to late August. We found that both habitats had a distinct species assemblage and a decrease in spillover with increasing distance from the habitat edge into the adjacent habitat. Calcareous grasslands were more affected by spillover from the adjacent coniferous forests than vice versa because more forest specialists penetrated into calcareous grasslands than grassland specialists penetrated into coniferous forests. We conclude that spillover into small and isolated habitats can severely change species assemblages, which has to be considered in conservation measures. The protection of large sites with small edge-interior ratios can reduce negative effects on species assemblages in endangered calcareous grasslands.

AB Goldenrods (Solidago sp.) are currently one of the most invasive plant species in Central Europe. They threaten abandoned semi-natural wet grasslands which are extremely vulnerable to plant succession and invasions. We assessed whether Solidago invasion affects ants, keystone organisms essential to proper ecosystem functioning and to the existence of myrmecophilous Phengaris butterflies. Ten meadows containing 60 plots with and without goldenrods were studied. We found a strong, negative dependence between the presence of goldenrod cover and the number of ant nests (more than 50 % reduction compared to control) as well as the number of species, and changes in species composition. Myrmica ants, essential hosts for Phengaris larvae, were among the most affected species by goldenrod invasion.

AB Fragment size, isolation, and matrix properties have received considerable attention as predictors of species richness, abundance, and composition in habitat patches. However, measurements of habitat attributes or habitat quality are more directly related to the proximate effects of habitat fragmentation and may be more determinant of assemblages than traditional explanatory variables at local scales. We determine how habitat structure in fragments-a measure of habitat quality-compares to fragment size, isolation, and matrix properties as determinants of richness, abundance, and composition of non-volant small mammals in a fragmented landscape of Atlantic Forest. Small mammals were surveyed once in 25 fragments in the Macacu River watershed, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1999 to 2001 and 2005 to 2009. A total of 83 candidate models were formulated and compared by Akaike Information Criteria. Habitat structure was one of the main determinants of small mammal assemblages in fragments, as important as fragment isolation for species composition and climatic season for species richness. Rodents were more abundant in fragments with increased overstory and understory vegetation density and more fallen logs. The contrary pattern was found for overall species richness and for species of terrestrial habit, which were more abundant in fragments with more open forest: decreased overstory and understory vegetation density and less fallen logs. Habitat quality in fragments may be a more important determinant of assemblages of small mammals and other vertebrates than previously considered in landscape and land use studies.

AB Aims
   Theory suggests that species perform best at intermediate densities, where density-dependent facilitation and antagonism are balanced, but empirical evidence is scarce, particularly in plants. In a self-incompatible perennial herb (Saussurea nigrescens), whose recruitment heavily relies on seed output, we test whether both intraspecific facilitation and antagonism significantly affect seed production, resulting in highest seed yield at an intermediate capitulum density.
   Methods
   Plots with different S. nigrescens densities were sampled in an Eastern Tibetan meadow during the growing season of 2012 to investigate the relationships between capitulum density and pollinator visitation rate, seed set ratio, parasite ratio, seed damage ratio, and capitulum size. Both simple linear and quadratic models were employed to determine the shape of relationships.
   Important Findings
   In line with general theory, hump-shaped relationships of capitulum density versus seed set ratio and number of florets per capitulum indicate intraspecific facilitation in sparse populations, which can be attributed to positive density-dependent pollinator visitation and the amelioration of detrimental physical factors. However, the proportion of seeds damaged by pre-dispersal predators increased monotonically with capitulum density, which may have-in combination with increased intraspecific competition for light and soil nutrients-resulted in density-dependent antagonism. Both positive and negative density-dependent agents acted simultaneously throughout the density range investigated and led to the highest seed yield at intermediate density levels in the Tibetan lotus. More efforts concurrently exploring the two effects are needed to facilitate understanding species abundance and community structure.

AB Subordinate species composition and distribution are regarded as a result of the dominant species structure. However, the spatial organization of subordinate species can also be related to dispersal abilities and interactions (competition and facilitation) within subordinate species. Here, we tested the influence of dominant species on subordinate species and examined traits of subordinate species together with their spatial patterns within a tropical coastal plant community. We hypothesized that the identity of dominant species determines subordinate abundance, and dispersal and persistence trait values variation, within coexisting subordinate species. Moreover, we expected that functionally similar subordinate species aggregate in space, regarding these values. We used the relative abundance of shrubs and trees from 83 vegetation patches in 2 ha of Restinga vegetation in southeastern Brazil. We determined trait value dissimilarities between dominant and subordinate species and within subordinates, and tested for the effect of the dominant species on subordinate abundance and trait values variation. Spatial cross-correlation functions were estimated for the four most abundant subordinate species with spline and Moran's I cross-correlograms. Our results showed that dominant and subordinate species exhibit contrasted trait values for dispersal and persistence. However, the composition of subordinate species in patches and the variation in their functional traits were not controlled by the identity of dominant species. Surprisingly, subordinate species segregated in space. Spatial segregation was related to dissimilar trait values within subordinates. However, the identity of dominants and patch size had no control over subordinates' abundance. We suggest that such spatial segregation can result from competitive interactions. Dissimilar functional trait values within subordinate species seem to explain the spatial segregation of these species, principally led by differences in seed production and potential allelopathic interactions (e.g. Myrtaceae species). Therefore, independently of the identity of dominant species, subordinate species have a direct effect on the community composition of the Restinga vegetation. Together, our findings considerably increase knowledge on subordinate species in tropical plant communities and provide new insight into the potential role of subordinate species in community assembly.

AB In stream ecosystems, coarse organic matter from the riparian vegetation, a key food resource, is often retained in the floodplains before reaching the channel. During floodplain exposure, organic matter can be affected by abiotic and biotic processes ("preconditioning"), which alter its quality and affect its subsequent decomposition in streams. We analyzed the effect of floodplain preconditioning on wood quality (lignin, C,N, P, K, among others), and its subsequent aquatic breakdown, paying special attention to microbial activity. We simulated preconditioned standard wooden sticks on one arid stream floodplain for 3 and 4 months, and then monitored their breakdown in three different streams, together with control (non-preconditioned) sticks. Preconditioning reduced lignin mass and C:N and lignin:N ratios, caused the leaching of soluble nutrients such as P and K, as well as N immobilization by microbes. These changes enhanced the breakdown of wood in the first week of immersion, but had no effect on breakdown rates after 4 months of incubation in the streams, although N immobilization was diminished. Our results suggest that terrestrial preconditioning could alter the role of wood as a long-lasting nutrients and energy source for freshwater ecosystem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biologists are often confronted with high levels of unexplained variation when studying the processes that determine genetic and species diversity. Here, we argue that eco-evolutionary interactions might often play an important role during colonization and have longstanding effects on populations and communities. Adaptation following colonization can produce a strong positive feedback loop that promotes priority effects and context-dependent trajectories of population or species assembly. We establish how monopolization, and more generally evolution-mediated priority effects, influence ecological patterns at multiple scales of space, time, and biological organization. We then highlight the underappreciated implications for our understanding of population and landscape genetics, adaptive evolution, community diversity, biogeography, and conservation biology. We indicate multiple future directions for research, including extending theory beyond competition.

AB Research on herbivore-induced plant defence and research on pollination ecology have had a long history of separation. Plant reproduction of most angiosperm species is mediated by pollinators, and the effects of herbivore induced plant defences on pollinator behaviour have been largely neglected. Moreover, there is expected to be a trade-off between plant reproductive strategies and defence mechanisms. To investigate this trade-off, it is essential to study herbivore-induced plant resistance and allocation of resources by plants, within the same system, and to test if indirect plant resistance can conflict with pollinator attraction. Here, I review the key literature highlighting connection between plant defence and reproduction, and propose to exploit natural variation among plant species to assess the ecological costs of plant responses to herbivores and pollinators.

AB Tropical biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions have become heavily eroded through habitat loss. Animal-mediated pollination is required in more than 94% of higher tropical plant species and 75% of the world's leading food crops, but it remains unclear if corridors avert deforestation-driven pollination breakdown in fragmented tropical landscapes. Here, we used manipulative resource experiments and field observations to show that corridors functionally connect neotropical forest fragments for forest-associated hummingbirds and increase pollen transfer. Further, corridors boosted forest-associated pollinator availability in fragments by 14.3 times compared with unconnected equivalents, increasing overall pollination success. Plants in patches without corridors showed pollination rates equal to bagged control flowers, indicating pollination failure in isolated fragments. This indicates, for the first time, that corridors benefit tropical forest ecosystems beyond boosting local species richness, by functionally connecting mutualistic network partners. We conclude that small-scale adjustments to landscape configuration safeguard native pollinators and associated pollination services in tropical forest landscapes.

AB Two new species of the largely Brazilian Didymopanax clade of Schefflera (Araliaceae) are here described, illustrated, and compared to similar taxa. Both are from poorly sampled areas in the Brazilian Amazon Basin. Schefflera prancei is known only from the Serra do Divisor National Park, at the border between Brazil and Peru. It differs from the similar S. confusa by its leaflets with narrowly elliptic to oblanceolate blades, with an acuminate to cuspidate apex, and the light brown to grayish sericeous indument on the abaxial blade surface. The second new species, Schefflera pubicarpa, is found in central Amazonian forests, and differs from similar species of the clade by a combination of characters, including a large-tree habit, leaves with 8 to 10 leaflets, inflorescences with ascending secondary branches and lacking tertiary branches, flowers with trichomes along the styles, and pubescent fruits. While this species appears to have a restricted distribution in Brazil, a westward extension reaching into Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador may be likely as new collections from intermediate areas become available.

AB Herbivory has been long considered an important component of plant-animal interactions that influences the success of invasive species in novel habitats. One of the most important hypotheses linking herbivory and invasion processes is the enemy-release hypothesis, in which exotic plants are hypothesized to suffer less herbivory and fitness-costs in their novel ranges as they leave behind their enemies in the original range. Most evidence, however, comes from studies on leaf herbivory, and the importance of flower herbivory for the invasion process remains largely unknown. Here we present the results of a meta-analysis of the impact of flower herbivory on plant reproductive success, using as moderators the type of damage caused by floral herbivores and the residence status of the plant species. We found 51 papers that fulfilled our criteria. We also included 60 records from unpublished data of the laboratory, gathering a total of 143 case studies. The effects of florivory and nectar robbing were both negative on plant fitness. The methodology employed in studies of flower herbivory influenced substantially the outcome of flower damage. Experiments using natural herbivory imposed a higher fitness cost than simulated herbivory, such as clipping and petal removal, indicating that studies using artificial herbivory as surrogates of natural herbivory underestimate the real fitness impact of flower herbivory. Although the fitness cost of floral herbivory was high both in native and exotic plant species, floral herbivores had a three-fold stronger fitness impact on exotic than native plants, contravening a critical element of the enemy-release hypothesis. Our results suggest a critical but largely unrecognized role of floral herbivores in preventing the spread of introduced species into newly colonized areas.

AB Selective logging can alter the biota (presence of seed source) and distribution of resources (light and soil factors), modifying the performance of seedlings. To evaluate these effects on forest regeneration processes is of critical importance, since reduced impact logging (Rh) has been advocated as a potential tool for conservation. We describe the abiotic alterations caused by selective logging and examine the effect of disturbances on the abundance and performance of seedlings of seven trees species. To test long-term effects we evaluated the regeneration process in a chronosequence spanning 11-years after logging in which 144 plots were sampled, representing an area of 300,000 ha in the central Amazonia. Seedling performance was affected by habitat alterations caused by logging. Growth is enhanced in logged sites for up to three years after logging for all species. However, in five out of seven species, the mortality rates found in logged were higher than the ones in control sites up to 11 years after logging. For most species the presence of a seed source is the most important factor determining the number of regenerating individuals. This effect of dispersal limitation on seedlings can affect tree regeneration on logged areas, since no rules limit the number of individuals per species that can be harvested per hectare. Demographic responses to abiotic alterations resulting from selective logging affect tree species regeneration patterns, and in a long term can influence the structure of tropical forest communities. We concluded that over time the habitat becomes less suitable for species regeneration on logged areas. These results indicate that RIL can have more effects on tree regeneration than previously supposed. Methods to minimize these effects (mainly on survivorship rates) should be considered in future management plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In marine benthic ecosystems, larval connectivity is a major process influencing the maintenance and distribution of invertebrate populations. Larval connectivity is a complex process to study as it is determined by several interacting factors. Here we use an individual-based, biophysical model, to disentangle the effects of such factors, namely larval vertical migration, larval growth, larval mortality, adults fecundity, and habitat availability, for the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas (loco) in Chile. Lower transport success and higher dispersal distances are observed including larval vertical migration in the model. We find an overall decrease in larval transport success to settlement areas from northern to southern Chile. This spatial gradient results from the combination of current direction and intensity, seawater temperature, and available habitat. From our simulated connectivity patterns we then identify subpopulations of loco along the Chilean coast, which could serve as a basis for spatial management of this resource in the future.

AB Background: Currently, many species are facing serious conservation problems due to habitat loss. The impact of the potential loss of biodiversity associated with habitat loss is difficult to measure. This is particularly the case with inconspicuous species such as the threatened pudu (Pudu puda), an endemic Cervidae of temperate forests of Chile and Argentina. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Chilean protected-area system in protecting the habitat of the pudu, we measured the congruence between this specie's potential distribution and the geographical area occupied by the protected areas in central and southern Chile. The measurements of congruency were made using the Maxent modeling method.
   Results: The potential habitat of the pudu was found to be poorly represented in the system (3-8 %) and even the most suitable areas for the species are not currenly protected. According to these results, the protected area network cannot be considered as a key component of the conservation strategy for this species.
   Conclusions: The results presented here also serve as a guide for the reevaluation of current pudu conservation strategies, for the design of new field studies to detect the presence of this species in human-disturbed areas or remaining patches of native forest, and for the implementation of corridors to maximize the success of conservation efforts.

AB We describe an integrated modeling framework for understanding strain coexistence in polymorphic pathogen systems. Previous studies have debated the utility of neutral formulations and focused on cross-immunity between strains as a major stabilizing mechanism. Here we convey that direct competition for colonization mediates stable coexistence only when competitive abilities amongst pathogen clones satisfy certain pairwise asymmetries. We illustrate our ideas with nested SIS models of single and dual colonization, applied to polymorphic pneumococcal bacteria. By fitting the models to cross-sectional prevalence data from Portugal (before and after the introduction of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), we are able to not only statistically compare neutral and non-neutral epidemiological formulations, but also estimate vaccine efficacy, transmission and competition parameters simultaneously. Our study highlights that the response of polymorphic pathogen populations to interventions holds crucial information about strain interactions, which can be extracted by suitable nested modeling.

AB Seaweed-dominated coral reefs are becoming increasingly common as environmental conditions shift away from those required by corals and toward those ideal for rampant seaweed growth. How coral-associated organisms respond to seaweed will not only impact their fate following environmental change but potentially also the trajectories of the coral communities on which they rely. However, behavioral responses by coral-associated organisms to seaweeds are poorly understood. This study examined interactions between a guild of obligate and opportunistic coral-feeding butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) and scleractinian corals to determine whether fishes continue to interact with corals in contact with seaweed or if they are avoided. Under natural conditions, all species interacted almost exclusively with seaweed-free corals. In a controlled patch reef experiment, fishes avoided corals in physical contact with seaweed, irrespective of dietary preferences. When visual seaweed cues were removed, butterflyfish continued to avoid corals that had been in contact with the allelopathic Galaxaura filamentosa, suggesting that chemical cues produced by coral-seaweed interactions are repellent. These findings suggest that, due to deleterious visual and chemical cues produced by coralseaweed interactions, coral-associated organisms may struggle to locate resources as seaweed-free corals decline in abundance.

AB A new species of Sparassodonta (Mammalia, Metatheria), Lycopsis padillai, sp. nov., is described on the basis of a partial left maxilla with M1-M4 and fragments of lacrimal and jugal. The material comes from the early to early middle Miocene Castilletes Formation, La Guajira Peninsula, Colombia. This specimen represents the northernmost record of a fossil metatherian in South America and integrates a highly diverse vertebrate association, recently discovered in the north of Colombia. The La Guajira specimen is referred to the genus Lycopsis, as supported by the results of our phylogenetic analysis. This analysis also demonstrates that species of Lycopsis (L. torresi, L. longirostrus, L. viverensis, and L. padillai) constitute a monophyletic group and are placed as the basal taxon of Borhyaenoidea. Lycopsis padillai is a large-sized sparassodont with a body mass of about 22 kg. The presence of Lycopsis from La Guajira extends the geographical distribution of the genus to the entire South America, representing the sparassodont with the widest latitudinal distribution.

AB The dry forests of the Chaco in South America are under great land conversion pressure, mostly for establishing pastures and soybean fields. Taking recent estimates into account, the rates at which forests are disappearing are similar to those of the Amazon, but compared to the Amazon, the Chaco remains fairly understudied. The land transformations during the past decades went along with a substantial change in the type of actors dominating the Chaco landscape. In this chapter, we discuss the land changes in the Chaco during the past 30 years with emphasis on the actors driving these changes, as outlined in the conceptual chapter of this book section. In the Chaco, it appears that the competition over land is a competition in which the actors are endowed with varying degrees of power, resulting in highly unbalanced competition. This chapter highlights these differences and discusses the potential role of the state as an actor in the competition for land that may help to slow down deforestation in the area and guide the Chaco toward more sustainable land-use futures.

AB Tropical forest in Brazil, as in other countries, faces threats stemming from decision making that favors destructive development and gives only token consideration to lost environmental services and other impacts. History, particularly the most relevant period covering the recent years of rapid development in Amazonia, is a source of useful lessons for changing the decision-making process to favor outcomes that are less destructive and more sustainable. Development decisions set processes in motion with consequences extending far into the future, adding urgency to the task of assimilating these lessons. Decisions in the coming decade will determine the fate of Brazils Amazon forest, as is also the case for other countries that could benefit from the lessons of recent history in Brazil.

AB Tropical forest regions are in constant transformation, partly resulting from management by traditional populations where shifting cultivation systems (swidden-fallow and slash and burn agriculture) play an important role. However, along with these discussions, the impacts and sustainability of these farming systems and its contribution to deforestation are often called into question. Therefore, this research sought to generate information on the practice of shifting cultivation by studying the conversion of forest habitat to agricultural areas located in two traditional communities in upland areas of Central Amazonia. We conclude that the sustainability of this system is based on its character of being integrated into surrounding forests and the length of the fallow period maintained by farmers who engage in this practice.

AB There is an increasing need for reliable information on bird populations in Asia and several methods have been used for population estimation: some were based on the way that species were detected (e.g. calling or territorial display) in field surveys and others have been developed from an understanding of sampling theory. Many bird species in Asia inhabit areas that are challenging to survey; we consider the basis of some of the more widely used methods in order to assess which are likely to be useful for providing data on populations. We review four methods: 1) spot napping; 2) triangulation; 3) distance sampling (using line transects and point counts); and 4) camera trap sampling. Four aspects were assessed: What has it been used,for? What are the method's assumptions? What field protocol is, required? What analytical methods should be used? Spot mappin6 and triangulation are bOth based on the ability to detect individuals of the target species in the field, but lack a statistical basis for converting this into a meaningful estimate about the population surveyed. Distance sampling is, in contrast, based on sampling theory and meeting some of the assumptions for detecting individuals in the field can be difficult. Nonetheless, it is increasingly widely used and considered reliable for making estimates about bird populations. Finally, camera trapping is a useful method for rare and cryptic species and the analytical techniques that cover the wide range of contexts in which it may be used are being developed.

AB The development of approaches to quantify and spatialize ecosystem services (ES) are greatly encouraged by the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) and the REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation). Such approaches could allow the establishment of more appropriate and effective practices and policies for environmental management. Mapping of ES can be seen as a major management tool for places with high environmental issues. A study is conducted at the scale of three areas in the Brazilian Amazon affected by the deforestation front. Two biophysical processes delivering ES, water infiltration in soil and carbon storage in vegetation, were mapped with a spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m. Statistical models were developed in aim to link field measurements of biomass and infiltration rate in 135 sampling points and remote sensing data. These models provide an estimation of the processes for the sites and able us to identify the factors that influence them. The resulting maps facilitate the understanding of the spatial distribution of these processes and can be used as a basis to map and/or study trade-offs and synergies between the ES.

AB Forest conservation is entering a critical and challenging period due to a shifting mosaic of threats, policies, and actors. In this chapter we: (i) provide a brief summary of the history of forest conservation; (ii) identify the main threats to the preservation and biological integrity of the World's forests; and (iii) outline the key strategies that have been developed to address these challenges. We specifically highlight the development of macroeconomic mechanisms for forest conservation, many of which are a consequence of the recent alignment of forest conservation with the international agenda of climate change. Such approaches include market-based mechanisms such as the certification of forest products, payments for ecosystem services, carbon credits, clean development mechanisms, and REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). Another promising financial tool for forest conservation is debt for nature swaps, which have enormous potential in much of the developing world. We conclude by identifying the key challenges for the conservation of forests in the 21st century, the most important of which will be to halt the continuing loss of habitat from the biodiverse tropical forests of the developing world.

AB Background: Acclimation to light is a driver of tropical forest dynamics and key to understanding the coexistence of dipterocarps, and how their demographic rates and traits trade-off.
   Aims: We examined light niche divergence in six dipterocarp species and hypothesised that seedlings can be functionally grouped, and allocate resources to either growth or storage in response to light changes.
   Methods: A pot experiment was performed to measure size-specific growth rate, wood density and total non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations of dipterocarp seedlings exposed to a simulated gap opening.
   Results: Light-demanding species responded to a gap opening with increased growth and decreased wood density, whereas shade-tolerant species showed a greater relative increase in NSC concentration. Iditol -an alditol - was identified, and Dryobalanops lanceolata responded to a gap opening with a significantly smaller increase in alditol concentration compared to other species.
   Conclusions: We group light-demanding and shade-tolerant species based on their acclimation to light and show that a generalist species is unique based on its response of NSC concentration to a gap opening. Our findings emphasise that the ecology of these species needs to be further studied in the context of their physiology to support their effective use in large-scale forest restoration efforts.

AB Background: Tree species composition at the landscape scale is often tightly associated with underlying soil type in tropical forests. Changes in soil type may have effects on forest structure that drive changes in both light and soil resource availability, since light availability in the understorey tends to be lower in more fertile sites. Plant functional traits may determine species distributions across gradients of light and soil resource availability.
   Aims: To test whether tree species with contrasting distributions exhibit leaf traits that reflect adaptation to the resources most limiting in their native environment.
   Methods: We measured foliar nutrient concentrations, stomatal density, leaf delta C-13 values, leaf mass per area, and leaf lifespan for saplings of nine common dipterocarp species at Sepilok Forest Reserve, Malaysian Borneo, possessing varying associations to soil resource habitats.
   Results: Species specialised in their adult distribution to nutrient-poor sandstone soils had traits indicative of a nutrient conservation strategy. Species specialised to more fertile alluvial soils had a wider spectrum of leaf N and P concentrations and LL, reflecting greater variance in strategies for resource acquisition and use among species in this habitat.
   Conclusions: Understorey light regimes co-vary with soil type, and both light and soil resource availability influence leaf trait adaptations that may contribute to species-habitat associations.

AB Tropical forest fragmentation increases the size of the edges and make micro environmental gradients between zones of the same fragment (border and interior), altering biotic and abiotic interactions necessary for the establishment of plants. After fragmentation processes, the juvenile stages of plants, such as germination and recruitment are the most vulnerable and crucial for the establishment of populations. In this study, the incidence of the edges and the inside was evaluated in a fragment of tropical forest on the germination and recruitment of Clusia spp. naturally present along eight transects on the interior and edge of a fragment. higher germination and recruitment was found on the edge than on the inside of the fragment. The results are mainly attributed to increased availability of light at the edge due to loss of canopy density over the death of trees by wind buffeting, and a higher concentration of nutrients too, as it is a buffer zone. However, variables act jointly and simultaneously complicating the individual analysis is done on them.

AB The Northern-Indian Shivalik mountain range has recently come under strong anthropogenic pressure. Ants were used as bioindicators to assess ecosystem health of the area. We measured diversity, community patterns, species composition and the influence of invasive species of Formicidae by collecting at 75 sites from 44 locations in three habitats: primary forest (PF), secondary forest (SF) and non-forest areas (NF) using six collection techniques. We obtained the most comprehensive dataset compiled for Indian ants to date (sample coverage 94 % to 97 %) and sampled 31,487 ant specimens, representing 181 species from 59 genera and 9 ant families. Thirty of the 59 genera were represented by a single species, 12 genera by more than five species and 26 species were new to science. Species richness differed significantly between habitats, with 151 in SF, 120 in PF and 110 in NF. Species richness rose with altitude and was influenced by precipitation, northern latitude and eastern longitude. As demonstrated by redundancy analysis and beta diversity, habitats also differed in species composition. Nineteen invasive/tramp species, comprising ca. 13% of total abundance, were distributed among the three habitats (including PF). Our findings point towards a disrupted, degraded ecosystem with high anthropogenic impact and reduced ecosystem health, even in the primary and protected forest areas. Invasive species pose a serious threat to the native species of Himalaya. At present the ant invasions are limited to lower mountain ranges, but with increases in global temperatures invasive species will soon spread to Himalayan highlands.

AB Understanding the distribution of traits across the angiosperm phylogeny helps map the nested hierarchy of features that characterize key nodes. Finding that Amborella is sister to the rest of the angiosperms has raised the question of whether it shares certain key functional trait characteristics, and plastic responses apparently widespread within the angiosperms at large. With this in mind, we test the hypothesis that local canopy openness induces plastic responses. We used this variation in morphological and functional traits to estimate the pervasiveness of trait scaling and leaf and stem economics. We studied the architecture of Amborella and how it varies under different degrees of canopy openness. We analyzed the coordination of 12 leaf and stem structural and functional traits, and the association of this covariation with differing morphologies. The Amborella habit is made up of a series of sympodial modules that vary in size and branching pattern under different canopy openness. Amborella stems vary from self-supporting to semi-scandent. Changes in stem elongation and leaf size in Amborella produce distinct morphologies under different light environments. Correlations were found between most leaf and stem functional traits. Stem tissue rigidity decreased with increasing canopy openness. Despite substantial modulation of leaf size and leaf mass per area by light availability, branches in different light environments had similar leaf area-stem size scaling. The sympodial growth observed in Amborella could point to an angiosperm synapomorphy. Our study provides evidence of intraspecific coordination between leaf and stem economic spectra. Trait variation along these spectra is likely adaptive under different light environments and is consistent with these plastic responses having been present in the angiosperm common ancestor.

AB Light environments can have a considerable influence on how plants respond to defoliation through influencing the biomass allocation patterns and internal C/N ratio. Seedlings of Lolium perenne, a common perennial grass species, were grown for eight weeks under three different light environments (natural light, red light and shading) and two different defoliation treatments (no defoliation versus 50% aboveground biomass removal). This study was conducted to examine (1) the effects of light regimes and defoliation on biomass accumulation, biomass allocation and internal C/N ratio status in plants; (2) how the light regimes influence the pattern of compensatory growth after defoliation; and (3) the relationship between compensatory growth and the internal C/N ratio status. We found that red light altered the shoot-to root allometry, enhanced the leaf C concentrations and induced N deficiency. By contrast, the leaf N concentrations of L. perenne were greater during shading treatment, which simultaneously enhanced shoot growth and stopped root growth. Under defoliation, red light increased shoot growth, not at the expense of root growth, which was not the same as in natural light and shading treatment. Moreover, regardless of the unclipped (no defoliation) and defoliation conditions, the L. perenne biomass partitioning between roots and shoots was significantly correlated with the leaf N concentrations and C/N ratio, indicating that allometric biomass allocation can be largely modulated by signals related to the C and N status of the plants. These results demonstrated that the leaf C and N status would be an appropriate indicator of compensatory growth after defoliation.

AB An ability to tolerate recurrent defoliation likely plays a role in the compositional shift from decreaser to increaser species with overgrazing of mesic grassland, but the grazing tolerance of local species has not been extensively studied. The growth response of two decreasers, three Increaser II grasses, and an Increaser III species to frequent, severe defoliation under three levels of competition from neighbours and two levels of soil nutrients was examined in a pot trial. The effects of competition and especially nutrients markedly modified the defoliation tolerance of different species, and grazing response groups varied in the manner in which their defoliation responses were mediated by these interactions. Contrary to expectation, defoliation constrained potential productivity most in nutrient-rich, competition-free environments, probably because it exacerbates a carbon limitation on growth. However, nutrient enrichment did enable Increaser II grasses, but not other species, to better tolerate intense defoliation, explaining why they can persist on intensively grazed fertile patches and in heavily stocked grassland, such as in communal areas, where nutrients are more available. It is concluded that grazing tolerance is not a fixed property of species or grazing response groups but depends on biotic and abiotic environmental factors.

AB Predation influences changes in the abundance and the limits of spatial distribution of organisms on rocky shores. We quantified the effect of the predation pressure of the gastropod Trophon geversianus on the mytilid Mytilus chilensis in a rocky intertidal community of the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego. We quantified the density of T. geversianus along with the density of T. geversianus preying on M. chilensis and examined the potential relationship between sizes of both T. geversianus and M. chilensis. Additionally, we carried out laboratory experiments to quantify the drilling and ingestion rates of T. geversianus on M. chilensis at different aerial exposure times. At mid intertidal levels, unlike at low intertidal levels, T. geversianus consumed more frequently the available size range of mussels. On average, sizes of predator and prey consumed were positively correlated. The drilling rate decreased with increasing time of aerial exposure. Additionally, permanently submerged predators invested less time consuming the same amount of food than individuals exposed for 4 out of 12 h (4/12 h). Predators exposed for 9/12 h invested less time and consumed less food than those exposed 4/12 h. Our results suggest that T. geversianus is an efficient predator of M. chilensis, due to both its high density and feeding rate. Our results suggest that the strong predation pressure of T. geversianus on M. chilensis prevents this key competitor from monopolizing space at the low level through controlling their abundance, and further limits their vertical distribution.

AB Ultrasociality refers to the social organization of a few species, including humans and some social insects, having a complex division of labor, city-states, and an almost exclusive dependence on agriculture for subsistence. We argue that the driving forces in the evolution of these ultrasocial societies were economic. With the agricultural transition, species could directly produce their own food and this was such a competitive advantage that those species now dominate the planet. Once underway, this transition was propelled by the selection of within-species groups that could best capture the advantages of (1) actively managing the inputs to food production, (2) a more complex division of labor, and (3) increasing returns to larger scale and larger group size. Together these factors reoriented productive life and radically altered the structure of these societies. Once agriculture began, populations expanded as these economic drivers opened up new opportunities for the exploitation of resources and the active management of inputs to food production. With intensified group-level competition, larger populations and intensive resource exploitation became competitive advantages, and the "social conquest of Earth" was underway. Ultrasocial species came to dominate the earth's ecosystems. Ultrasociality also brought a loss of autonomy for individuals within the group. We argue that exploring the common causes and consequences of ultrasociality in humans and the social insects that adopted agriculture can provide fruitful insights into the evolution of complex human society.

AB The tropical rainforests are essential for sustainable development of earth's ecosystem. The rainforests are rich storehouse of biodiversity, natural pharmaceutical products, source of sustained water resources and manage microclimate of their region. The forest regimes in Amazonian, Congo basin and South East Asian forest regions are under constant threat of degradation. The carbon dioxide concentration in the earth's atmosphere has reached the highest ever seen by the human beings to 400 ppm level and mean surface temperature of earth has increased by 1 degrees C in last 50 years. This study explores statistical relations for rainforest remaining in the earth and carbon dioxide concentration in the earth's atmosphere as function of widespread human farm activities such as soya bean, corn and palm oil production as factors. The response surface methodology is used to analyse data from year 2000 to 2013 which shows that rate of world tropical rainforest degradation and CO2 concentration in the earth's atmosphere increases with increase in world soy, corn and palm production and mathematical models predicting these relations were developed.

ID TROPICAL FORESTS
AB The interdisciplinary science of conservation biology provides undergraduate biology students with the opportunity to connect the biological sciences with disciplines including economics, social science and philosophy to address challenging conservation issues. Because of its complexity, students do not often have the opportunity to practise conservation biology. To increase exposure to this science, this paper describes a virtual rainforest island on which students collect data related to forest carbon storage, while also confronting ethical issues. Students are asked to independently make decisions, collect data and explore the island before writing a research report with recommendations for the future management of the island's forests. The ethics of decision-making are addressed in the students' research reports and are reinforced through guided class discussion. Students will complete this activity with increased ethical awareness, as well as a better understanding of the challenges associated with the practise of conservation biology.

AB Wave exposure has strong influences on population density, morphology and behaviour of intertidal species in temperate zones, but little is known about how intertidal organisms in tropical regions respond to gradients in wave exposure. We tested whether dislodgement force and shell shape of a tropical gastropod, Cittarium pica, differs among shores that vary in wave exposure. After adjusting for body size, we found that C. pica from exposed shores required greater dislodgement force to remove them from the shore, had slightly larger opercula (the closure to the shell aperture), and were slightly squatter in shape (reduced in shell height relative to shell width) than C. pica from sheltered shores. These morphological adjustments are consistent with those observed in temperate gastropods, which are argued to represent adaptive responses to the risk of mortality associated with dislodgement.

AB Although many studies have investigated the benthic environment of temperate marine waters, little is known about the acoustic behaviour of the organisms in these habitats, particularly crustaceans. This study focused on the acoustic behaviour of large crustaceans in NE Atlantic coastal regions. A total of 11 crustacean species were recorded in tank-based experiments to identify sound-producing species and the behaviours associated with their sounds as well as to quantitatively characterise and compare the sounds. A total of 34 sounds were associated with behaviours such as moving, feeding, mandible rubbing, swimming, species-specific behaviour and other unidentified behaviours. The sounds included single pulse and pulse train signals that were distributed across a peak frequency spectrum of 3 to 45 kHz with received levels between 93 and 142 dB re 1 mu Pa (peak to peak). The results demonstrated that Brachyura had the most diverse sound types. Using a combination of several acoustic features, 24% of the recorded sounds appeared to have a high potential to be differentiated in field recordings: the feeding sound of Cancer pagurus, Carcinus maenas, Necora puber and Pachygrapsus marmoratus; the species-specific sound of C. pagurus and Galathea squamifera; and the pulse train sound associated with unidentified behaviours of Lophozozymus incisus and N. puber. These findings extend the existing crustacean acoustic library in marine ecosystems and contribute to our understanding of in situ acoustic recordings in temperate regions.

AB In this study, we investigated responses of the mid-successional species Acer truncatum Bunge and the late-successional species Quercus variabilis Blume to three solar illumination conditions: (1) constant low light (CL), (2) constant high light (CH) and (3) low light first and high light afterwards (LH). The last treatment was to simulate a canopy opening. Both species exhibited increases in biomass, totally and in part, and decreases in leaf water content, specific leaf area and chlorophyll concentrations in LH treatment compared to CL treatment. For A. truncatum, exposure to high light condition (LH) increased crown area, and decreased root to shoot ratio, stem mass ratio and leaf perimeter. However, for Q. variabilis, LH treatment increased stem diameter at ground height, effective quantum yield, photochemical quenching and decreased maximum photosystem II quantum yield. The biomass allocation pattern did not change in Q. variabilis among three light conditions. With respect to newly developed leaves, no significant differences were found in leaf size of Q. variabilis between LH treatment and CH treatment while that of A. truncatum decreased in LH treatment. All chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in newly developed oak leaves in LH treatment increased compared to those of CH treatment while no difference was found for A. truncatum between LH and CH treatment. A. truncatum displayed a greater overall plasticity than Q. variabilis although the oak seedlings have a greater plasticity with respect to chlorophyll concentration and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. A. truncatum should be a better candidate for vegetation recovery, especially in places with heterogeneous light conditions.

AB Forest fragments and their tree canopies may act as important reservoirs for biodiversity, but their role in supporting diversity is poorly understood in the context of their spatial arrangement. We examine the influence of landscape configuration and location within forest patches (e.g. canopy, edge or patch interior) on patterns of arthropod biodiversity associated with sugar maple trees across an agricultural landscape in southern Quebec (Canada). We sampled arthropods from sugar maples in 20 sugar maple-beech-dominated forest patches that varied in size and isolation from other forest patches. Within each patch, arthropods were collected in the interior, edge and canopy of patches over two seasons. Size and isolation of forest patches did not affect arthropod family or functional group diversity, but patch canopies supported a higher diversity than understories. Both configuration and within-patch location affected taxonomic and functional composition of arthropods. For example, phytophages and saprophages were found in greatest abundance in canopies and large patches, while entomophages were in highest abundance in interiors. We conclude that even in relatively small (e.g. 5-10 ha) forest patches, canopies are providing critical reservoirs for arthropod diversity, and draw our attention to the conservation value of small patches in fragmented forest landscapes.

AB Rice is one of the most important food sources for humans, and its global cultivated surface reaches ten millions of hectares. Many natural ecosystems, especially wetlands, have been modified or destroyed due to conversion to rice fields. However, rice crops require flooding, and the wetlands thus created can provide food for several organisms including shorebirds. In the organic rice fields of Valle del Cauca, in Colombia, twelve species of Nearctic migrant shorebirds have been recorded, including the highest numbers of Least Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla) in Colombia. On their breeding grounds in North America, Least Sandpipers feed on benthic and terrestrial invertebrates, while on the wintering grounds they ingest a wider range of prey. To determine the diet of Least Sandpipers in this type of cultivation in Valle del Cauca, from October 2012 to December 2012 we caught 50 individuals using mist netting and obtained regurgitates induced with saline solution. The identification of prey found in regurgitates indicates that Least Sandpipers feed on insects, spiders, and vegetable material in the study site. In addition, they use small stones to crush prey with hard exoskeleton, such as Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Given the relatively high levels of consumption of beetle larvae and adults, which are considered pests for rice crops, Least Sandpipers could be one of the main bio-control agents of these insects. This information contributes to understand why Least Sandpipers use organic rice fields and highlights the importance of this agroecosystem for the migration of this shorebird.

AB Payment for Environmental Services in Cidanau watershed is part of the effort to maintain the stand as water management services. The requirement of Payment for Environmental Service (PES) in Cidanau Watershed is that the number of stand exist and grow well should not be less than 500 (five hundred) stands per hectare until the contract period expires. At the moment, monitoring of the number of stands in PES area in Cidanau Watershed is carried out using direct counting of the number of stands per hectare per area. Monitoring using such method is time consuming and costly. A more efficient method to monitor the number of stands in PES land in Cidanau Watershed is needed. The best model with high accuracy was proven to be the model of stand density prediction using Leaf Area Index (LAI). The implementation of PES is able to encourage Forest community Group to conserve these forest stands in Cidanau Watershed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) are known to be effective in enhancing the mobilization of inorganic P, thus increasing plant-available P in soils. But little is known about their effect on organic P, especially in agricultural soils. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of three common organic acids (oxalic, citric and malic acids) and their mixture (ratio, 1: 1: 1) in the mobilization of soluble inorganic (SIP), soluble organic P (SOP) and available P in a calcareous, neutral and acid agricultural soil. All the three organic acids and their mixture at 10 mmol kg(-1) soil enhanced the mobilization of SIP, SOP and available P in soils as compared with water, but no evident combined effects among the three organic acids were observed. The ability of LMWOAs to mobilize SIP was ascribed to its ability to complex or precipitate with cations (e.g. Fe, Al and Ca) bound to P, whereas the release of SOP was linked to the shift in pH values. The results of this study suggested that LMWOAs might have potential as amendments to increase plant available P due to their effectiveness to mobilize SIP, SOP and available P in agricultural soils.

AB Green roofs can provide environmental benefits that include increased building insulation, mitigating urban heat islands, providing aesthetic value, reducing runoff and storm water flooding in urban environments, improving air quality by sequestering pollutants, cooling photovoltaic panels to improve their function, and providing habitat for fauna and flora. Until very recently, improvements of green-roof environmental services had been achieved largely by horticulturalists, engineers, and architects. In recent years, ecologists have increased their participation, implementing ecological theory for enhancing biodiversity, and selecting specific plant assemblages for other environmental services such as carbon sequestration and for providing cooler roofs. Moreover, ecologists can use green roofs as relatively novel habitats for testing and developing ecological theory. This special issue is devoted to fostering input from ecologists for advancing the environmental and ecosystem services of green roofs. A wide range of ecologists can explore the topic of the ecological aspects of green roof design and implementation including island biogeography theory, niche theory and null models, the role of environmental heterogeneity, invasion ecology, and plant selection. They can contribute ecological methodology and study design for strong inference.

AB The growing phenomenon of green roofs throughout the world mostly results in the establishment of extensive green roofs with low species diversity. However, research from the last few decades has shown that several advantages can accrue from diverse ecological systems, such as increased faunal diversity, storm water retention, thermal stability, pollution mitigation, and visual appeal. The maintenance of diversity on extensive green roofs has not been closely examined and few studies incorporate methods to ensure long-term coexistence into green roof design. Theoretical work has placed much focus on the niche and neutral theories that attempt to explain diversity as a result of the existence of different habitats or of demographic and dispersal patterns, respectively. These theories have resulted in several theoretical and practical recommendations for the maintenance of diversity in ecological systems and could suggest additional practices that would support biodiverse green roofs. We hereby review and discuss relevant theory and supporting research to provide suggestions regarding future research in the field as well as practical green roof construction recommendations and species selection.

AB Woody hemiepiphytes that have an epiphytic juvenile growth stage differ crucially in physiology and ecology from common trees. A relatively high degree of ontogenetic plasticity confers these plants stress tolerance during the epiphytic stage and sufficient competitiveness later as independent trees. The genus Ficus consists of about 500 hemiepiphytic and about 300 non-hemiepiphytic woody species. Ecophysiological comparative studies between hemiepiphytic (Hs) and non-hemiepiphytic (NHs) Ficus tree species reveal that the existence of an epiphytic growth habit even only for a part of their life cycle involves profound changes that persist to a large degree in their terrestrial growth stage. When growing under similar conditions, both as saplings and mature trees, the Hs have physiological traits resulting in conservative water use and drought tolerance contrasting with more prodigal water use and drought sensitivity in NHs. Divergence in water related functional traits between the two groups are centrally associated with a trade-off between xylem water flux capacity and drought tolerance. Two distinct groups of life history traits for Hs and NHs have evolved-epiphytic regeneration with a slow starting growth rate but enhanced ability to tolerate water deficits in the upper canopy environment and regeneration in the forest understory with an initial burst of growth to rapidly gain a relatively large seedling size that can better survive risks related to terrestrial regeneration. Evidence shows that the underlying physiology distinguishing these two growth forms mostly involves divergences in adapting to contrasting water regimes but not light conditions, contrary to the conventional hypothesis that hemiepiphytism evolved for gaining access to higher irradiance in the canopy than on the forest floor.

AB Light is critical for plant establishment, growth, and survival in wet tropical forests. The objective of this chapter is to analyze paradigms of photosynthetic performance and life history traits of tropical forest trees to contrasting light environments across the forest floor, gaps and upper canopy. Physiological and morphological plasticity as well as genetically fixed adaptive traits are analyzed, including leaf optical properties and photoprotection from high irradiance. Photosynthetic adaptations to contrasting light environments of closely related species are discussed. This approach has the advantage among comparative studies of adaptations across species in that genetic relationships among species are known. Species-specific variations in maximum photosynthetic rates, which reflect the degree of adaptation to growth irradiance, are shown to be gradual, suggesting that classification into two distinct functional groups in terms of light requirements is somewhat arbitrary. Trees growing in gaps or in the upper canopy rely strongly on biochemical mechanisms to dissipate excess energy and to avoid damage to the light reaction centers and photosystems. Consistent with their high photosynthetic capacity, light demanding species are capable of plastic changes in hydraulic architecture, such as increases in hydraulic conductivity under high irradiance, which makes them more competitive in open habitats.

AB Tree-ring studies provide important contributions to understanding the climate sensitivity of tropical trees and the effects of global change on tropical forests. This chapter reviews recent advances in tropical tree-ring research. In tropical lowlands, tree ring formation is mainly driven by seasonal variation in precipitation or flooding, and not in temperature. Annual ring formation has now been confirmed for 230 tropical tree species across continents and climate zones. Tree-ring studies indicate that lifespans of tropical tree species average c. 200 years and only few species live >500 years; these values are considerably lower than those based on indirect age estimates. Size-age trajectories show large and persistent growth variation among trees of the same species, due to variation in light, water and nutrient availability. Climate-growth analyses suggest that tropical tree growth is moderately sensitive to rainfall (dry years reduce growth) and temperature (hot years reduce growth). Tree-ring studies can assist in evaluating the effects of gradual changes in climatic conditions on tree growth and physiology but this requires that sampling biases are dealt with and ontogenetic changes are disentangled from temporal changes. This remains challenging, but studies have reported increases in intrinsic water use efficiency based on delta C-13 measurements in tree rings, most likely due to increasing atmospheric CO2. We conclude that tree-ring studies offer important insights to global change effects on tropical trees and will increasingly do so as new techniques become available and research efforts intensify.

AB The characterization of species' functional traits is a major step in the understanding and description of communities in natural habitats. The classification of species into functional groups is a useful tool to identify redundancy and uniqueness. We studied the fish community of a pristine freshwater wetland in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve by analysing two multidimensional functions: food acquisition and locomotion. We investigated changes in the functional group structure between habitats (permanent and temporary pools) and seasons (dry and wet). Six functional groups with different ecological characteristics were detected, two of which had high functional redundancy and three of them were represented by single species with unique ecological functions. In permanent pools during the dry season, functional group richness and diversity were lower, while evenness was higher. During the wet season, all functional groups were detected and similar functional group structure was found between habitats. These results suggest an effect of environmental filtering during the dry season and niche complementarity during the wet season.

AB A key research frontier in global change research lies in understanding processes of land change to inform predictive models of future land states. We believe that significant advances in the field are hampered by limited attention being paid to critical points of change termed land-use regime shifts. We present an analytical framework for understanding land-use regime shifts. We survey historical events of land change and perform in-depth case studies of soy and shrimp development in Latin America to demonstrate the role of preconditions, triggers, and self-reinforcing processes in driving land-use regime shifts. Whereas the land-use literature demonstrates a good understanding of within-regime dynamics, our understanding of the drivers of land-use regime shifts is limited to ex post facto explications. Theoretical and empirical advances are needed to better understand the dynamics and implications of land-use regime shifts. We draw insights from the regime-shifts literature to propose a research agenda for studying land change.

AB Analysing extinction within a phylogenetic framework may seem counter-intuitive because extinction is a priori a non-heritable trait. However, extinction risk is correlated with other traits, such as body size, that show a strong phylogenetic signal. Further, there has been much effort in identifying key traits important for diversification, and recent evidence has demonstrated that the processes of speciation and extinction may be inextricably linked. A phylogenetic approach also allows us to quantify the impact of extinction, for example, as the loss of branches from the tree-of-life. Early work suggested that extinctions might result in little loss of evolutionary history, but subsequent studies indicated that non-random extinctions might prune more of the evolutionary tree. Loss of phylogenetic diversity might have ecosystem consequences because functional differences between species tend to be correlated with the evolutionary distances between them. Here we explore how extinction prunes the tree-of-life. Our review indicates that the loss of evolutionary history under non-random extinction (the emerging pattern in extinction biology) might be less pronounced than some previous studies have suggested. However, the loss of functional diversity might still be large, depending on the evolutionary model of trait change. Under a punctuated model of evolution, in which trait differences accrue in bursts at speciation, the number of branches lost is more important than their summed lengths. We suggest that evolutionary models need to be incorporated more explicitly into measures of phylogenetic diversity if we are to use phylogeny as a proxy for functional diversity.

   HISTOLOGY
AB Sauropod dinosaurs are rare in the Cretaceous North American fossil record in general and are absent from that record for most of the Late Cretaceous. Sonorasaurus thompsoni from the Turney Ranch Formation of the Bisbee Group of Arizona, USA, potentially represents one of the youngest sauropods before their ca. 30-million-yearlong hiatus from the record. The anatomy of Sonorasaurus has only been briefly described, its taxonomic validity has been questioned, several hypotheses have been proposed regarding its phylogenetic relationships, and its life history, geologic age, and reported paleoenvironment are ambiguous.
   Herein we assess the systematics, paleoenvironment, life history, and geologic age of Sonorasaurus based on firsthand observation, bone histology, and fieldwork in the holotypic quarry and environs. The validity of S. thompsoni is substantiated by autapomorphies. Cladistic analysis firmly places it within the Brachiosauridae, in contrast to results of some recent analyses. Bone histology suggests that the only known exemplar of Sonorasaurus grew slowly and sporadically compared to other sauropods and was approaching its adult size. In contrast with previous assessments of a coastal/estuarine paleoenvironment for the Turney Ranch Formation, our sedimentological and plant macrofossil data indicate that Sonorasaurus lived in a semiarid, low relief evergreen woodland that received highly variable (perhaps seasonal) precipitation. We obtained detrital zircons from the holotypic quarry for U-Pb dating, which only yielded Barremian-aged and older grains, whereas other radiometric and biostratigraphic data suggest that the sediments at the quarry were deposited near the Albian-Cenomanian boundary.
   Sonorasaurus is taxonomically valid, represents one of the geologically youngest brachiosaurid sauropods, and inhabited a harsh inland evergreen-dominated woodland environment that limited its growth. A review of other Bisbee Group dinosaurs suggests that its fauna, although poorly sampled, exhibits broad similarity to those from coeval North American horizons, reinforcing the apparent faunal homogeneity at the time.

AB The phenomenon of distinct, absent or indistinct growth rings is a highly variable feature used for wood identification and a wide range of tree-ring studies. Causes for its variability are not yet fully understood. There is also a lack of consensus within the scientific community about how distinct and indistinct tree rings should be defined and classified. We use a selection of 103 Central African rainforest trees to analyse the anatomy of growth-ring boundaries of 103 Central African rainforest species and assessed the influence of the climate, tree organ and leaf shedding behaviour on growth-ring distinctness and anatomy. We observed a high variability of tree-ring boundaries anatomy and distinctness within and among individuals and species. Although, for some semi-deciduous species, higher incidence of distinct growth rings appears to be related with a more pronounced seasonal climate, no general trends are observed for the assembly of studied species. Growth rings are variable within individuals depending on the considered organ: trunks tend to show more distinct rings than branches. Growth-ring distinctness is difficult to implement as a trait to measure tree performance when only based on abrupt changes in fibre size and cell wall thickness. From the potential growth-ring markers identified in the IAWA list of hardwood features, those applying to vessel and parenchyma density and distended rays appear to be more useful in tropical trees than abruptly flattened latewood fibres or abrupt changes in vessel diameter.

AB The cerrado rupestre is a physiognomy of the Cerrado biome with a prominent ground layer. It is characterized by rocky outcrops; acidic, nutrient-poor soil; and water shortage due to climatic seasonality. Species of this biome have several mechanisms to survive these adverse conditions. This study aimed to investigate morpho-anatomical characteristics and soluble carbohydrates in underground systems of Apopyros warmingii and Ichthyothere terminalis (Asteraceae), and to evaluate the potentially adaptive roles of these structures under the environmental stressors of the cerrado rupestre. Samples of underground organs were fixed, dehydrated in graded ethylic ethanol, embedded in historesin, and sectioned. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of soluble carbohydrates were performed in distinct portions of the underground systems. Thickened underground systems of both species are composed of stem and root portions with buds in the proximal region. Vascular and cortical parenchymas are abundant and accumulate inulin, which can be visualized as spherocrystals. Secretory structures have lipophilic secretion. High fructan amounts in the parenchyma indicate their use to support resprouting. These carbohydrates may be mobilized to meet the increased demands of phenology and abiotic factors. Secretory structures and sclereids in both species and raphides in A. warmingii may assist the protection of the underground system against herbivores.

AB The analyses of geographic variation and the detection of discontinuities among populations of a given taxa is a fundamental step on evolutionary studies. Some recent studies have demonstrated that along the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil there are some phylogenetic and phylogeographic discontinuities recovered with molecular markers for several groups of organisms, granting the proposition of biogeographic hypothesis for species diversification in this biome. For instance, a phylogeographic study using cytochrome b sequences demonstrated geographic pattern of genetic variation in the oryzomyine rodent Euryoryzomys russatus. Considering the widespread occurrence of E. russatus, its susceptibility to fragmentation, and the existence of geographic structure in the genetic variation mentioned above, E. russatus stands as an interesting species to describe the geographic pattern of craniodental variation. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the morphometric variation patterns coupled with the actual knowledge regarding the evolution of the Atlantic Forest biota, in order to test the hypothesis that the phenotype of E. russatus exhibits a structured pattern of variation along the Atlantic Forest similar to that described for the cytochrome b gene on continental and coastal islands samples. Our results showed that there is congruence between the gaps here described on morphometric data and the genetic data described in literature. We also detected important variation in size between some insular populations and the continent. Geographic patterns of morphometric variation observed for E. russatus were compared to other patterns of diversity for the Atlantic biome, and discussed under historical biogeographic context. We concluded that study of morphometric variation might offer important support to phylogeographic and biogeographic hypothesis based on molecular markers and provide a better scenario on the expression of the phenotypic variation.

Based on a representative sample survey, the analysis focuses on identifying specific visitor segments, their respective spending patterns, and the service sectors that profit. Results highlight that visitor spending generates a considerable gross turnover of just under $ 3,000,000 USD, benefitting mostly local tourism businesses. In order to increase the economic benefits of whale watching as a means of fostering sustainable regional economic development, it is crucial to focus tourism planning and marketing tools on well-defined visitor segments to satisfy their specific needs and expectations.

AB This study was conducted to characterise the pattern of disturbance caused by windthrow in the forest of Ipassa (Gabon) and to analyze the links between types of windthrow and the regeneration of different tree species. The pattern of windthrow disturbance was studied in a permanent 38 hectares plot. Windthrow was monitored annually for five years from 2005 to 2009. We also assessed the natural regeneration of trees according to different types of windthrow. The study results show that 72% of windthrown trees in the forest of Ipassa are partially fallen or single trees. Each year, these occupied 1.3% of the surface area studied. The scale of windthrow varied on average from 52 +/- 13 m(2) to 625 +/- 220 m(2), with a half-life of about 53 years. Multiple Correspondence Analysis showed that in 47 species (25.7%), regeneration is associated with the different types of windthrow. Twelve species of sun-loving trees regenerate exclusively in multiple or complex windthrow situations, while 35 shade-tolerant species tend to regenerate in partial and single-tree windthrow situations. In several tree species, there is no obvious link between regeneration and windthrow patterns. This suggests that other factors besides windthrow, such as limited dispersal, influence the regeneration of tree species.

AB Indocaris gen. nov. with two new species, Indocaris imbricata sp. nov. and Indocaris inopinata sp. nov., and also for the already known Indocaris tirupatiensis (Ranga Reddy 2011a) comb. nov. all from the groundwaters in peninsular India. The highly diagnostic synapomorphy of the new genus is a composite character associated with the male leg 4 basis: five or six prominent, imbricate, enlarged, petal-like spinules, arranged as a semiwhorl at the insertion of the endopod and increasing in size from internal to external. Another distinctive feature of the same appendage is that its one-segmented endopod is dilated or bulbous in the proximal half, produced distally into an incurved spiniform or horn-like structure about as long as the corresponding first exopodal segment, and ornamented with three or four fine spinules on the subproximal outer margin. The three species also share a unique constellation of other salient morphologic features, which along with the phylogenetic position of Indocaris gen. nov. within the family Parastenocarididae are discussed. Indocaris gen. nov. has closest phylogenetic affinity with the Neotropical Remaneicari Jakobi, 1972. A short note on the ecology and biogeography of the parastenocaridid species of the Indian subcontinent is provided besides a key for their identification.

AB Introducing nitrogen-fixing legumes in desert land could enhance rangeland productivity and help in soil reclamation. However, detailed information about germination and seedling performance of many desert legumes species is still lacking. We investigated these plant characteristics for five native legumes of the Arabian Desert in Qatar: Crotalaria aegyptiaca, Crotalaria persica, Rhynchosia minima, Senna alexandrina and Senna italica. Germination of the species was tested under laboratory conditions using different temperature and light treatments: 15/25,20/30 and 25/35 degrees C, in either continuous darkness or cycles of 12 h light/12 h darkness. The germination percentage recorded under the different temperature and light conditions was very low. Therefore, four scarification treatments, water soaking (12 and 24h) and concentrated sulfuric acid application (5 and 10 min), were applied. The scarification treatments improved the germination of all the species. However, the different species did not equally respond to the scarification treatments tested. In general, the treatments with sulfuric acid were the most effective. Subsequent seedling survival and growth were evaluated under greenhouse and field (nursery) conditions. All the studied species exhibited higher seedling survival inside (69-96%) than outside the greenhouse (53-89%). Regarding growth, these species did not show much difference in terms of shoot and root length when placed in the greenhouse or the nursery. However, the species showed differences in biomass allocation (aboveground vs. belowground biomass) between greenhouse and nursery but with species-specific responses. The information provided here on scarification requirements and seedling survival and biomass allocation as dependent on the growth environment is helpful for conservation and landscape agencies interested in using these species for conservation, restoration and landscaping projects.

AB The occurrence of an invasive plant across a continent is generally not homogeneous; typically, some areas are highly invaded whereas others show moderate or low invasion levels. This situation might be a snapshot of an ongoing spread, but it could also remain stable under the pressure of factors that constrain the invasion. Among those factors, plant performance variation among invasion levels can explain an invasion slowdown. However, few studies have investigated the large-scale variation of invasive plant performance in the field. Ambrosia artemisiifolia L in Western Europe represents a good opportunity to address this issue, with areas of high, moderate and low invasion levels being documented across a ca. 1000 km transect. In this study, we compared in situ plant performance-related traits in 12 populations from areas of contrasting invasion levels. We also tested whether performance-related traits were influenced by the intra-and inter-specific competition, by the local climatic conditions or by latitude (a proxy for growing season length). Overall, we did not find differences in performance-related traits across invasion levels, and intra-and inter-specific competition had low effects on plant performance. This study highlights the fact that A. artemisiifolia individuals express similar performance across invasion levels, even beyond what can be considered the present invasion front. Further research has to expand this study northwards, and assess other factors that could constrain the invasion in order to highlight if the species invasion northward is constrained or if it has the potential to invade new areas.

AB Fragmentation of natural habitats is considered one of the greatest threats to the maintenance of global biodiversity. In this study, we tested the importance of forest patch size and vegetation structure on the richness, diversity, abundance, and composition of the orb-weaving spider guild in an area of the Atlantic Forest (State of Sao Paulo, Brazil). We sampled 16 sites, grouped into the following categories composed of four sites each: continuous mature forest, continuous secondary forest, large (52-175 ha) secondary forest fragments, and small secondary forest fragments (14-28 ha). The richness ranged from 29 to 55 species per site, but was unrelated to forest size or vegetation structure. The communities from the continuous mature forests were more abundant and less diverse than those from the other categories, but this was due to a few dominant species. The changes in composition were related to the vegetation structure, suggesting that this variable is more important to the composition of orb-weaving communities than the size of the forest patch. Overall, the results indicate that the orb-weaving spider community in this region, even in the fragments, is still rich and diverse, which may be attributable to some characteristics of spiders, such as generalist behaviour and a good dispersal capacity. Nonetheless, our results also highlight the importance of continuous areas, especially those with mature vegetation that harbor a characteristic orb-weaving community that can serve as a source for the fragments.

AB The cambial activity and periodicity of secondary xylem and phloem formation have been less studied in tropical tree species than in temperate ones. Cambium activity is the only source of timber production. Studies on its activity and xylem formation can provide helpful data for dendrochronology and possible factors that control tree growth, the yield and quality of wood. Cinnamomum camphora is an important fast-growing tree for furniture and sculpture wood in South China. Its dynamics of cambial activity was not reported. During the growth season in 2011, five trees of Cinnamomum camphora plantation were monitored on the campus of Huazhong Agricultural University in central china (located on 113 degrees 41' to 115 degrees 05' E and 29 degrees 58' to 31 degrees 22' N). Sampling time was from 13, February 2011 to 13, February 2012. Some small stems of 15-20 cm length were selected to sample in the middle of 2-3 years old health branches in the central crown of these trees. The observational study found that the cambium of camphor trees was active from March to October and dormant from November to February. Onset of cambial cell division was observed in early March, one week after sprouting of new buds. The morphology of the cells and number of cell layers in the cambium zone varied throughout the year. In early March, cambium reactivated with the rising of temperature, the cell wall was relative thick. The number of cell layers increased from 2-3 in middle Feb. to 3-5. In June, the number of cell layers in cambium reached the maximum of 5-7 in a radial direction. In mid March, phloem cells began to differentiate, followed by xylem three weeks later. The number of cell layers in immature phloem and xylem increased dramatically before mid June and the increment of cell layers in xylem was almost fifth times of phloem in the differentiating process. The phloem cells mainly stopped dividing new cells in end of October, but xylem cells were still in the activity a week later. The annual activities of cambium was in accordance with the air mean temperature change in 2011-2012. The results showed that the cambial activity and formation of xylem and phloem were related to the environmental factors, especially the temperature.

AB Conflicts in conservation may arise if two or more threatened species are involved in prey-predator interaction. Predators may have a profound effect on small prey populations, thus conservation actions must consider inter-specific interactions involving threatened species. Here we report nest predation events on a wild population of the Endangered red-billed curassow Crax blumenbachii Spix, 1825 by a group of the Critically Endangered yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys Sapajus xanthosternos Wied-Neuwied, 1820 in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This is the first study to report egg predation of an threatened gamebird by an threatened primate. We recommend that systematic conservation planning for these threatened species consider interactions, especially considering upcoming reintroduction programs indicated in the National Action Plans for these species conservation.

AB Aim of study: The objective of this work is to compare tree diversity and richness among one grown-shade coffee plantation (CAE) and two sites of montane cloud forests, one preserved (MCF1) and other perturbed (MCF2). We also develop an analysis of the importance of coffee plantations as a refuge of tree species, holding a potential role for conservation.
   Area of study: Our study area is the coffee region of Coatepec-Xico, in the state of Veracruz, Mexico.
   Material and Methods: We compiled a list of all tree species in each site to determine tree diversity and floristic similarity (dissimilarity). We used different similarity indices and a cluster analysis to show relations among sites.
   Main results: 2721 individuals from 154 species were registered in the montane cloud forests as a whole. In the grown-shade coffee plantation we registered 2947 individuals from 64 species. The most similar sites were the perturbed montane cloud forest and the grown-shade coffee plantation and the least similar were the preserved montane cloud forest and the grown-shade coffee plantation. The high biodiversity found in all sites and the differences in tree composition between the two montane cloud forests supports evidence of the ecosystems richness in the region.
   Research highlights: Diversity differences among sites determine that the grown-shade coffee plantation is not substitute for montane cloud forest. CAE's are developed under similar environmental conditions than the MCF; therefore, coexistence and recombination (replacement) of species make them particularly complementary. CAE's in Veracruz have a potential role as refuge for biodiversity.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, and is currently highly fragmented and disturbed due to human activities. Variation in environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest can influence the distribution of species, which may show associations with some environmental features. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) are insects that act in nutrient cycling via organic matter decomposition and have been used for monitoring environmental changes. The aim of this study is to identify associations between the spatial distribution of dung beetle species and Atlantic Forest structure. The spatial distribution of some dung beetle species was associated with structural forest features. The number of species among the sampling sites ranged widely, and few species were found in all remnant areas. Principal coordinates analysis indicated that species composition, abundance and biomass showed a spatially structured distribution, and these results were corroborated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The indicator value index and redundancy analysis showed an association of several dung beetle species with some explanatory environmental variables related to Atlantic Forest structure. This work demonstrated the existence of a spatially structured distribution of dung beetles, with significant associations between several species and forest structure in Atlantic Forest remnants from Southern Brazil.

AB Paullinia species are generally laticiferous, woody climbers with a pair of watch-spring tendrils at the middle of the inflorescence, stipules, compound leaves with mostly pinnate organization, zygomorphic flowers with white corollas, septifragal capsules, and black or dark brown seeds with a white arillode. Paullinia is a Neotropical genus with approximately 220 species, one of which (P. pinnata) is also naturally found in Africa and Madagascar. Currently, 99 species are listed for Brazil, most of which are found in forest formations. The Amazon and the coastal Atlantic Forest are the two Brazilian biomes that hold the greatest diversity of Paullinia, with 73 and 26 species respectively. Surprisingly, nearly half of the Brazilian species of Paullinia (45 species, five new records for Brazil) are recorded for the Amazonian state of Acre. In the present work, we provide keys and brief species descriptions to identify the species of Paullinia found in the state of Acre. We also provide information on their distributions within Acre, and within their total range. It is noteworthy that about 70% of the species had their distribution restricted to the Amazonian domain and 44% are restricted to southwestern Amazonia, suggesting this region is a center of diversity for the genus.

   BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB In order to understand the timing of metatherian radiations, adaptations, and extinctions, it is important to review the variety of strongly interrelated contexts that defined them. (1) During the Cenozoic Era, global climates shifted from Greenhouse to Icehouse conditions; this major change was quite obvious by the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (ca. 33 Ma). Other large-scale changes also occurred prior and subsequent to this shift: hyperthermal events, as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or cooling phases, such as that triggered by the late Miocene closing of the Panama isthmus. (2) Many elements precursor to the Cenozoic South American ecosystems were already in place by the late Mesozoic Era. By the Paleocene-early Eocene, several of the most important types (e.g., Neotropical forest, broad-leaved forest types) had developed their modern versions, as is the case of the. Grasslands seem to have been established, at least in southern South America, by the late Oligocene. (3) A recent biogeographical review supports the proposal that the southernmost tip of South America (the Andean Region) belongs to a distinct biogeographical unit, the Austral Kingdom. In turn, most of the remaining areas of South America, as well as southernmost North America and the Caribbean, comprise the Neotropical Region of the Holotropical Kingdom. South America's Arid Diagonal is the great biogeographic divide between the Neotropical Region and the Andean Region. The distribution of this arid-semiarid belt, originally placed in much of southwestern Gondwana, closely matches the distribution of the Subtropical Seasonal Dry climatic belt since early Mesozoic times. (4) Reinforcing this climatic divide of the continent, paleogeographic reconstructions of South America suggest that the continent was split into northern and southern portions by means of epeiric seas due to marine transgressions. In southernmost South America, the paleogeography resulting from marine transgressions led to a very complex, almost archipelagic continental configuration. (5) At least six successive phases can be recognized in the evolution of Mesozoic-Cenozoic South American mammals: Early Gondwanian, Late Gondwanian, Early South American, Late South American, Interamerican, and Hypoamerican.

AB The effect of noise on predator vigilance in Pagurus bernhardus was explored in this study. Latency of the first response, emergence time, and response type were measured from hermit crabs during continuous and variable vessel noise and two controls. The mean (+/- SE) response latency was longer for the noise treatments (continuous, 18.19 +/- 2.78 s; variable, 11.39 +/- 1.48 s) than for the controls (ambient, 7.21 +/- 0.82 s; silent, 6.66 +/- 0.95 s). Response type and emergence time were not significantly affected but were more variable during the noise treatments than during the controls. Noisy conditions may increase predation risk, suggesting potential fitness consequences for invertebrates.

AB Community-based tropical forest restoration projects, often promoted as a win-win solution for local communities and the environment, have increased dramatically in number in the past decade. Many such projects are underway in Andean cloud forests, which, given their extremely high biodiversity and history of extensive clearing, are understudied. This study investigates the efficacy of community-based tree-planting projects to accelerate cloud forest recovery, as compared to unassisted natural regeneration. This study takes place in northwest Andean Ecuador, where the majority of the original, highly diverse cloud forests have been cleared, in five communities that initiated tree-planting projects to restore forests in 2003. In 2011, we identified tree species along transects in planted forests (n = 5), naturally regenerating forests (n = 5), and primary forests (n = 5). We also surveyed 120 households about their restoration methods, tree preferences, and forest uses. We found that tree diversity was higher in planted than in unplanted secondary forest, but both were less diverse than primary forests. Ordination analysis showed that all three forests had distinct species compositions, although planted forests shared more species with primary forests than did unplanted forests. Planted forests also contained more animal-dispersed species in both the planted canopy and in the unplanted, regenerating understory than unplanted forests, and contained the highest proportion of species with use value for local people. While restoring forest increased biodiversity and accelerated forest recovery, restored forests may also represent novel ecosystems that are distinct from the region's previous ecosystems and, given their usefulness to people, are likely to be more common in the future.

AB The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) is one of three Panels that regularly informs the Parties (countries) to the Montreal Protocol on the effects of ozone depletion and the consequences of climate change interactions with respect to human health, animals, plants, biogeochemistry, air quality, and materials. The Panels provide a detailed assessment report every four years. The most recent 2014 Quadrennial Assessment by the EEAP was published as a special issue of seven papers in 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2015, 14, 1-184). The next Quadrennial Assessment will be published in 2018/2019. In the interim, the EEAP generally produces an annual update or progress report of the relevant scientific findings. The present progress report for 2015 assesses some of the highlights and new insights with regard to the interactive nature of the effects of UV radiation, atmospheric processes, and climate change.

AB The rapid spread of bamboos can strongly affect forest structure by interfering plant regeneration and reducing local biodiversity. Considering that bamboos exert a negative influence on the plant community, our main goal was to investigate how this influence manifests at the population level. We compared the demographic structure of the threatened palm Euterpe edulis between bamboo and non-bamboo dominated patches within the Atlantic forest. In the study site, the native bamboo Guadua tagoara has created a marked patchiness and heterogeneity in the vegetation. Plots were set up randomly in bamboo and non-bamboo patches and the heights of all E. edulis individuals were measured. Data from canopy openness and litter depth were collected for both patches. Greater number of E. edulis was recorded in bamboo patches. However, frequency distribution of the height classes differed between patches revealing a predominance of seedling and sapling I classes in bamboo patches, in comparison to a more evenly distribution of height classes in non -bamboo patches. The canopy in bamboo patches was more open and the litter depth was thicker. Our analyses evidenced G. tagoara is functioning as a demographic bottleneck of natural population of E. edulis by arresting its later stages of regeneration and in high densities that bamboos may limit recruitment of this palm species.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are significant threats for primate species worldwide. However, few attempts have been made to look for general patterns in primate responses to habitat loss and fragmentation, or whether these may be associated with species' traits. We conducted a review of published literature on effects of patch size to quantify the effect of a reduction in this predictor on primates, and to determine whether these effects depend on species' traits. The effects of patch size on seven response variables (density, parasite prevalence and diversity, presence, genetic diversity, time spent feeding, resting and movement), were extracted from 135 papers and compared across six species traits (diet specialisation, social structure, body size, home range size, group size and dispersal ability). We found that density, parasitic prevalence and diversity and time spent feeding were positively associated with a reduction in patch size, while species' presence and genetic diversity were negatively associated. Time spent resting and moving did not show clear patterns. We found little evidence that the effect of patch size varies consistently with traits. This study provides important evidence for the consistent effect of patch size on a range of factors that influence the dynamics of primate populations. However, there is a need to move beyond quantifying patch size effects alone and to quantify the effects of changes occurring at broader landscape scales. This would allow more holistic primate conservation strategies to be developed across whole landscapes rather than being focussed on the management of individual patches.

AB The diversity-stability relationship has been under intense scrutiny for the past decades, and temporal asynchrony is recognized as an important aspect of ecosystem stability. In contrast to relatively well-studied interannual and seasonal asynchrony, few studies investigate the role of circadian cycles for ecosystem stability. Here, we studied multifunctional redundancy of diurnal and nocturnal ant communities in four tropical rain forest sites. We analyzed how it was influenced by species richness, functional performance, and circadian asynchrony. In two neotropical sites, species richness and functional redundancy were lower at night. In contrast, these parameters did not differ in the two paleotropical sites we studied. Circadian asynchrony between species was pronounced in the neotropical sites, and increased circadian functional redundancy. In general, species richness positively affected functional redundancy, but the effect size depended on the temporal and spatial breadth of the species with highest functional performance. Our analysis shows that high levels of trophic performance were only reached through the presence of such high-performing species, but not by even contributions of multiple, less-efficient species. Thus, these species can increase current functional performance, but reduce overall functional redundancy. Our study highlights that diurnal and nocturnal ecosystem properties of the very same habitat can markedly differ in terms of species richness and functional redundancy. Consequently, like the need to study multiple ecosystem functions, multiple periods of the circadian cycle need to be assessed in order to fully understand the diversity-stability relationship in an ecosystem.

AB Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation and land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that specialized herbivores maintain high numbers of tree species in tropical forests by restricting adult recruitment so that host populations remain at low densities. We tested this prediction for the large timber tree species, Swietenia macrophylla, whose seeds and seedlings are preyed upon by small mammals and a host-specific moth caterpillar Steniscadia poliophaea, respectively. At a primary forest site, experimental seed additions to gaps - canopy-disturbed areas that enhance seedling growth into saplings - over three years revealed lower survival and seedling recruitment closer to conspecific trees and in higher basal area neighborhoods, as well as reduced subsequent seedling survival and height growth. When we included these Janzen-Connell effects in a spatially explicit individual-based population model, the caterpillar's impact was critical to limiting Swietenia's adult tree density, with a >10-fold reduction estimated at 300 years. Our research demonstrates the crucial but oft-ignored linkage between Janzen-Connell effects on offspring and population-level consequences for a long-lived, potentially dominant tree species.

AB In order to compare the effectiveness of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators, we studied the reproductive biology and pollinators of Tillandsia heterophylla E. Morren, an epiphytic tank bromeliad endemic to southeastern Mexico. Since anthesis in T. heterophylla is predominantly nocturnal but lasts until the following day, we hypothesised that this bromeliad would receive visits from both diurnal and nocturnal visitors, but that nocturnal visitors would be the most effective pollinators, since they arrive first to the receptive flower, and that bats would be the most frequent nocturnal visitors, given the characteristics of the nectar. Flowering of T. heterophylla began in May and lasted until July. The species is fully self-compatible, with an anthesis that lasts for ca. 15-16 h. Mean volume of nectar produced per flower was 82.21 mu l, with a mean sugar concentration of 6.33%. The highest volume and concentration of nectar were found at 20: 00 h, with a subsequent decline in both to almost zero over the following 12-h period. T. heterophylla has a generalist pollination system, since at least four different morphospecies of visitors pollinate its flowers: bats, moths, hummingbirds and bees. Most of the pollinating visits corresponded to bats and took place in the early evening, when stigma receptivity had already begun; making bats the probable pollinator on most occasions. However, diurnal pollinators may be important as a 'fail-safe' system by which to guarantee the pollination of T. heterophylla.

AB Consistent forest loss estimates are important to understand the role of forest loss and deforestation in the global carbon cycle, for biodiversity studies, and to estimate the mitigation potential of reducing deforestation. To date, most studies have relied on optical satellite data and new efforts have greatly improved our quantitative knowledge on forest dynamics. However, most of these studies yield results for only a relatively short time period or are limited to certain countries. We have quantified large-scale forest loss over a 21-year period (1990-2010) in the tropical biomes of South America using remotely sensed vegetation optical depth (VOD). This passive microwave satellite-based indicator of vegetation water content and vegetation density has a much coarser spatial resolution than optical data but its temporal resolution is higher and VOD is not impacted by aerosols and cloud cover. We used the merged VOD product of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) observations, and developed a change detection algorithm to quantify spatial and temporal variations in forest loss dynamics. Our results compared reasonably well with the newly developed Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) maps, available for the 2001 onwards period (r(2) = 0.90 when comparing annual country-level estimates). This allowed us to convert our identified changes in VOD to forest loss area and compute these from 1990 onwards. We also compared these calibrated results to PRODES (r(2) = 0.60 when comparing annual state-level estimates). We found that South American forest exhibited substantial interannual variability without a clear trend during the 1990s, but increased from 2000 until 2004. After 2004, forest loss decreased again, except for two smaller peaks in 2007 and 2010. For a large part, these trends were driven by changes in Brazil, which was responsible for 56% of the total South American forest loss area over our study period according to our results. One of the key findings of our study is that while forest loss decreased in Brazil after 2005, increases in other countries partly offset this trend suggesting that South American forest loss as a whole decreased much less than that in Brazil.

AB Understanding biological invasions patterns and mechanisms is highly needed for forecasting and managing these processes and their negative impacts. At small scales, ecological processes driving plant invasions are expected to produce a spatially explicit pattern driven by propagule pressure and local ground heterogeneity. Our aim was to determine the interplay between the intensity of seed rain, using distance to a mature plantation as a proxy, and microsite heterogeneity in the spreading of Pinus contorta in the treeless Patagonian steppe. Three one-hectare plots were located under different degrees of P.contorta invasion (Coyhaique Alto, 45 degrees 30S and 71 degrees 42W). We fitted three types of inhomogeneous Poisson models to each pine plot in an attempt for describing the observed pattern as accurately as possible: the dispersal models, local ground heterogeneity models, and combined models, using both types of covariates. To include the temporal axis in the invasion process, we analyzed both the pattern of young and old recruits and also of all recruits together. As hypothesized, the spatial patterns of recruited pines showed coarse scale heterogeneity. Early pine invasion spatial patterns in our Patagonian steppe site is not different from expectations of inhomogeneous Poisson processes taking into consideration a linear and negative dependency of pine recruit intensity on the distance to afforestations. Models including ground-cover predictors were able to describe the point pattern process only in a couple of cases but never better than dispersal models. This finding concurs with the idea that early invasions depend more on seed pressure than on the biotic and abiotic relationships seed and seedlings establish at the microsite scale. Our results show that without a timely and active management, P.contorta will invade the Patagonian steppe independently of the local ground-cover conditions.

AB Phosphorus (P) is the main limiting nutritional factor in the cultivation of Eucalyptus in Brazil. Despite this, little is known about the P fractions and dynamics in Eucalyptus soils in tropical regions. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the distribution of labile and non-labile fractions of P in soil in 10 sites of Eucalyptus in the state of SAo Paulo, Brazil and (2) to determine the interactions among the P fractions and to identify which fractions act as sinks or sources for the available P fraction. The P fractions were separated using the Hedley sequential extraction method, and the P transformation processes were evaluated via structural equation modeling. The labile P (resin-Pi + Pi and Po in NaHCO3) varied between 6% and 16%, the moderately labile P (Pi + Po in NaOH) varied between 28% and 40%, the occluded P (Pi + Po in Sonicate + NaOH) varied between 6% and 19%, the P associated with Ca (HCl-Pi) varied between 0.4% and 3% and the residual-P varied between 35% and 47%. The hypothetical structural model of soil P cycle was composed of four P pools (latent variables): the organic pool, occluded pool, inorganic pool, and available pool. The structural model was adequate to identify functional pools of P in soil, and to identify transformation processes of P based on the source-sink relationships. The available P pool was highly dependent on inorganic and occluded pools and the organic pool acted predominantly as a sink of P on available and inorganic pools. The results reinforce the high level of recalcitrance of the organic pool and the fact that Eucalyptus plants must access pools of limited-availability P to meet their nutritional demands.

AB We provide and discuss a floristic survey of herbaceous and subshrubby aquatic and palustrine angiosperms of Virua National Park (VNP). The VNP is located in the northern Amazon basin and displays phytophysiognomies distributed in a mosaic where these plants occur, as flooded forests, hydromorphic white-sand savannas, "buritizais" and waterbodies. After expeditions between February/2010 and January/2015 and the analysis of specimens from regional herbaria, we list 207 species of herbaceous and subshrubby aquatic and palustrine angiosperms for the VNP, distributed in 85 genera in 37 families. We recorded six new occurrences for Brazil, two for the northern Brazilian region and 21 for Roraima state. These new occurrences, added to the other species listed here, highlight the floristic similarity between the study site and the Guiana Shield, an adjacent phytogeographical unit and geologically related to the origin of white-sand savannas.

AB The biogeographic history of southern South America has led to a markedly distinct flora within the frame of the Neotropics, which is also particularly heterogeneous in terms of its eco-geographic distribution. This environmental complexity is at the base of the many and controversial classification systems that have been proposed for the vegetation of the so-called Cono Sur region (Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and parts of Brazil and Bolivia). In this study, we aimed to assess the floristic consistency of the main vegetation types that inhabit the region. Our dataset consisted of 116,130 occurrence records of 3662 species of shrubs and trees in 781 sampling sites spread over six countries and eight phytogeographic domains: Atlantic Forest, Pampa, Gran Chaco, Patagonia, Southern Andean, Mediterranean Chile, Temperate Pacific, and Pacific Islands. We performed a cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination analysis of this dataset followed by multi-response permutation procedures and permutational multivariate analysis of variance and taxonomic distinction index and indicator species. The greater differentiation took place among the phytogeographic domains and leaf flush regimes (evergreen, deciduous, and semideciduous) though there was also a remarkable latitudinal gradient. Our analyses showed that the pre-defined vegetation types were consistent in terms of woody flora composition and have a considerable number of indicators, many of which endemic. In terms of conservation prioritization, Atlantic Rain Forest therefore has importance because of its high species richness while temperate and mediterranean forests west of the Andes should not be ignored given that they show much higher endemism than would be expected given their species richness.

AB We explored the relationship between tree growth in two tropical species and local and large-scale climate variability in Southeastern Brazil. Tree ring width chronologies of Tectona grandis (teak) and Pinus caribaea (Caribbean pine) trees were compared with local (Water Requirement Satisfaction Index-WRSI, Standardized Precipitation Index-SPI, and Palmer Drought Severity Index-PDSI) and large-scale climate indices that analyze the equatorial pacific sea surface temperature (Trans-Nino Index-TNI and Nino-3.4-N3.4) and atmospheric circulation variations in the Southern Hemisphere (Antarctic Oscillation-AAO). Teak trees showed positive correlation with three indices in the current summer and fall. A significant correlation between WRSI index and Caribbean pine was observed in the dry season preceding tree ring formation. The influence of large-scale climate patterns was observed only for TNI and AAO, where there was a radial growth reduction in months preceding the growing season with positive values of the TNI in teak trees and radial growth increase (decrease) during December (March) to February (May) of the previous (current) growing season with positive phase of the AAO in teak (Caribbean pine) trees. The development of a new dendroclimatological study in Southeastern Brazil sheds light to local and large-scale climate influence on tree growth in recent decades, contributing in future climate change studies.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Understanding the evolutionary and ecological factors that determine plant distributions is of primary importance in botanical research. These factors may vary in predictable ways across different spatial scales, and thus, we can leverage scale to reveal the underlying processes limiting plant distributions.
   METHODS: We review various research considerations across local and geographic scales, including the investigation of dispersal and habitat limitation, evolutionary factors, abiotic and biotic factors, and research logistics. We also present two case studies, slender monkeyflower (Mimulus leptaleus) and cut-leaf monkeyflower (Mimulus laciniatus), in the California Sierra Nevada.
   KEY RESULTS: At a local spatial scale (within 50 m), no seeds were produced from plants sown at sites located just beyond known patches of M. leptaleus, but within the species' geographic range. At a much broader spatial scale (kilometers), at the highest and lowest elevations of the species' range, we found greatly reduced abundance and fecundity in plants sown outside of the geographic range limits of M. laciniatus.
   CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrate two contrasting spatial scales, yet agree in their illustration of strong habitat limitation. We end by discussing future avenues of research and by suggesting ways botanical researchers can frame their studies to maximize information gained on species requirements, distribution limits, and conservation among varying spatial scales.

AB Woody vegetation assessments were conducted in the burned and unburned paddocks of Tiisa Kalahari Ranch in western Botswana to determine the influence of opportunistic burning on woody species density, cover and structure in semiarid rangelands. Burning was conducted by farm management twice in one paddock in October 2005 and 2006, and once in another paddock in October 2011 to control bush encroachment. Sampling was conducted in May 2012 using 50 by 2 m transects (16 at the 2011 burn site and 18 at the 2005/2006 burn site) as paired comparisons in both burned and unburned paddocks. Tree height was 0.27 m (28%) and 0.23 m (21%) lower (P < 0.05) in burned paddocks at the 2011 and 2005/2006 burn sites, respectively. There was an increase in the proportion of saplings and a decrease in tall woody plants in burned areas at all sites (P < 0.001). At the 2011 burn site, height and cover of Catophractes alexandri were 63% (P = 0.041) and 67% (P = 0.035) lower in burned paddocks, respectively. Density of Acacia mellifera was 53% (P = 0.031) lower, with more multi-stemmed (>20 stems) plants in burned paddocks (P = 0.02). Grewia flava density was 59% higher in burned paddocks (P = 0.038). At the 2005/2006 burn site both height and density of Acacia hebeclada were significantly higher in burned paddocks (65%, P = 0.045 and 56%, P = 0.037, respectively). Tarchonanthus camphoratus was only present at this site, where its height, density and cover were significantly lower in burned paddocks (P < 0.05). Overall, tree height was shorter in burned than unburned paddocks, with C. alexandri contributing the most to the height reduction. Follow up browsing by goats on the coppice growth after burning may prevent C. alexandri, a dominant encroaching species from recruiting and spreading.

   interactions; polygodial; Pseudowintera colorata; red leaves

   RED ALERT; ANTHOCYANINS; TOLERANCE; EVOLUTION; COEVOLUTION; ADAPTATION
AB 1. Whether plants use leaf colour to deter herbivores remains controversial. The warning signal hypothesis predicts that red pigmentation is adaptive by reducing herbivory; plants with predominantly red foliage should have higher fitness than those with green leaves. Despite many discussions, this prediction has rarely been tested, and alternative, non-exclusive hypotheses cannot be ruled out.
   2. We have exploited leaf colour polymorphism in Pseudowintera colorata to test the warning signal hypothesis and to address possible alternative explanations.
   3. Consistent with warning signals, redder foliage contained higher concentrations of polygodial, a sesquiterpene dialdehyde with strong antifeedant properties, and incurred less herbivory than green leaves. Redder plants hosted 22% fewer lepidopteran leafroller larvae than neighbouring green plants.
   4. However, contrary to the predictions of the hypothesis, there were no differences in fitness parameters between red and green plants. Overall leaf canopy colour was not a significant predictor of the number of seeds per fruit or of mean seed weight. This may be explained by differences in photosynthesis: green P. colorata leaves had 47% higher maximum CO2 assimilation rates than matched red leaves from neighbouring plants.
   5. These results indicate that the benefits of deterring insect herbivores by signalling may be balanced by the higher photosynthetic rate of non-signalling plants. A balance between signalling and photosynthesis is a novel mechanism for the maintenance of leaf colour polymorphisms in nature.
   6. Synthesis. Anthocyanin pigments may simultaneously serve multiple functions within leaves, and individuals of the same plant species may use different strategies to cope with insect herbivores. Therefore, investigations into the role of these pigments in plant-insect interactions need to consider plant physiology and the diversity of plant defence mechanisms.

AB 1. Spatial statistics are widely used in studies of ecological processes in plant communities, especially to provide evidence of neutral or non-neutral mechanisms that might support species coexistence. The contribution of such statistics has been substantial, but their ability to identify any links between underlying processes and emergent patterns is not certain.
   2. We investigate the ability of a number of spatial statistics to distinguish theorized mechanisms of species coexistence (spatial and temporal niche differentiation, neutrality, the Janzen-Connell effect and heteromyopia) in a simulated plant community.
   3. We find that individual statistics differ substantially in their sensitivity to these mechanisms, with those based on nearest neighbour species identities being the most sensitive. These differences are largely robust to changes in the strength of the modelled mechanisms when simulated independently and in combination. The spatial signal of niche differentiation is always distinct in simulations that combine mechanisms.
   4. Synthesis. We describe full spatial signals of modelled coexistence mechanisms that are observed consistently across statistics and simulated strengths and combinations of mechanisms, and identify a set of spatial statistics that holds particular promise for empirical studies designed to investigate mechanisms of these kinds.

AB Published maps of global tree cover derived from Landsat data have indicated substantial changes in forest area from 2000 to 2012. The changes can be arranged in different patterns, with different consequences for forest fragmentation. Thus, the changes in forest area do not necessarily equate to changes in forest sustainability.
   The objective is to assess global and regional changes in forest fragmentation in relation to the change of forest area from 2000 to 2012.
   Using published global tree cover data, forest and forest interior areas were mapped in 2000 and 2012. The locations of forest interior change were compared to the locations of overall forest change to identify the direct (pixel level) and indirect (landscape level) components of forest interior change. The changes of forest interior area were compared to the changes of total forest area in each of 768 ecological regions.
   A 1.71 million km(2) (3.2 %) net loss of global forest area translated to a net loss of 3.76 million km(2) (9.9 %) of forest interior area. The difference in loss rates was consistent in most of the 768 ecological regions. The indirect component accounted for 2.44 million km(2) of the net forest interior change, compared to 1.32 million km(2) that was attributable to the direct component.
   Forest area loss alone from 2000 to 2012 underestimates ecological risks from forest fragmentation. In addition to the direct loss of forest, there was a widespread shift of the remaining global forest to a more fragmented condition.

AB Socially inefficient payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes result when adverse shifts in the provisioning of other ecosystem services (ES) or overpayment to service providers occur. To address these inefficiencies, a holistic evaluation of trade-offs between services should be conducted in parallel with determining land owners' service provisioning preferences. Recent evidence also suggests that nudging stakeholders' preferences could be a useful policy design tool to address global change challenges. Forest owners' landscape management preferences were nudged to determine the impact on the social efficiency of PES schemes for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation in Finland. ES indicators for biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and the albedo effect were included with traditional provisioning services (i.e. timber) and bioenergy to assess the consequent intra-service trade-offs. Synergies in provisioning of regulating services were identified, but were found to be more efficient when the management objective is for biodiversity conservation rather than climate change regulation. Nudging led to marginal gains in service provisioning above the baseline management and above neutral owner preferences, and increased aggregate service provisioning. This demonstrates the importance of considering intra-service trade-offs and that nudging could be an important tool for designing efficient PES schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Restinga formations grow on sandy spits of coastal plains, an environment whose conditions limit the growth and development of vegetal species. Studies on restinga gradients are good examples of how plants acclimate to restrictive environments. This work compares three woody species co-occurring in four vegetations of a restinga from Southern Brazil. It pinpoints morpho-anatomical attributes that favor the survival of species faced with spatial variability of soil and light conditions. Results indicate that they respond differently to environmental variables on different scales. The plastic response of morphological attributes is more marked than that of anatomical ones. Varronia curassavica and Dodonaea viscosa showed more xeromorphic features on the more stressful restinga formations while Symphyopappus casarettoi varied between xerophyte to mesophyte forms along the gradient. Individual height, fresh and dry leaf masses, leaf area, specific leaf mass and area, leaf density, and water content are particularly noteworthy. These responses are strategies allowing the studied species to survive in restinga environment with highly variable soil nutrient, water availability, and light conditions. The environmental conditions are important features that modulate de plant morphology along the gradient.

AB The seed-to-seedling transition constitutes a critical bottleneck in the life history of plants and represents a major determinant of species composition and abundance. However, we have surprisingly little knowledge regarding the forces driving this ontogenetic transition. Here we utilize information regarding organismal function to investigate the strength of intra-and interspecific negative density dependence during the seed-to-seedling transition in Puerto Rican tree species. Our analyses were implemented at individual sites and across an entire 16-ha forest plot, spanning 6 years. The functional richness of seedling assemblages was significantly lower than expected given the seed assemblages, but the functional evenness was significantly higher than expected, indicating the simultaneous importance of constraints on the overall phenotypic space and trait differences for successful transitions from seed to seedling. The results were consistent across years. Within species, we also found evidence for strong intraspecific negative density dependence, where the probability of transition was proportionally lower when in a site with high conspecific density. These results suggest that filtering of similar phenotypes across species and strong negative density dependence within and among species are simultaneously driving the structure and dynamics of tropical tree assemblages during this critical life-history transition.

AB Understanding how drylands respond to ongoing environmental change is extremely important for global sustainability. In this review, we discuss how biotic attributes, climate, grazing pressure, land cover change, and nitrogen deposition affect the functioning of drylands at multiple spatial scales. Our synthesis highlights the importance of biotic attributes (e.g., species richness) in maintaining fundamental ecosystem processes such as primary productivity, illustrates how nitrogen deposition and grazing pressure are impacting ecosystem functioning in drylands worldwide, and highlights the importance of the traits of woody species as drivers of their expansion in former grasslands. We also emphasize the role of attributes such as species richness and abundance in controlling the responses of ecosystem functioning to climate change. This knowledge is essential to guide conservation and restoration efforts in drylands, as biotic attributes can be actively managed at the local scale to increase ecosystem resilience to global change.

AB The present study examines the genetic diversity (using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I [COI] haplotypes) of polychaete Hediste diversicolor populations in the Amvrakikos Gulf (western Greece) in order to test Cognetti's hypothesis on the formation of distinct isolated populations of species living in stressed transitional water habitats. To this purpose, the intraspecific diversity of H. diversicolor and the similarities among its populations in the brackish water habitats of the Eastern Mediterranean were investigated. Samples were collected from the lagoonal complex of Am vrakikos Gulf in 2010 and 2011. Analysis showed that populations in the Amvrakikos Gulf share unique haplotypes which are distinct from the haplotypes hitherto reported, suggesting that these populations are highly isolated. This evidence partially supports Cognetti's hypothesis. The results indicate that the genetic differentiation in the studied populations was probably caused by the complete isolation of the gulf and periodic hypoxic conditions during its formation history. The occurrence of unique haplotypes in the gulf underlines the importance of considering genetic diversity in the design of long-term biodiversity management and conservation plans.

AB Does Asia have a distinct policy style? If so, what does it look like, and why does it take the shape it does? This article argues that in the newly reinvigorated emphasis of policy studies on policy instruments and their design lies the basis of an analysis of a dominant policy style in the Asian region, with significant implications for understanding the roles played by specific kinds of policy capacities. There is a distinctly Asian policy style based on a specific pattern of policy capacities and governance modes. In this style, a failure to garner initial policy legitimacy in the articulation of instrument norms often results in later mismatches between instrument objectives and specific mechanisms for their achievement. The formulation of payments for ecosystem services policy is used to illustrate the capacities required for policy designs and action to meet policy goals effectively.

AB Cloud cover is the main limitation of using remote sensing to study Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change, and Land Surface Temperature (1ST) in tropical area like Malaysia. In order to study LULC change and its effect on LST, the Landsat images were utilized within Geographical Information System (GIS) with the aim of removing the effect of cloud cover and image's gaps on the Digital Number (DN) of the pixels. 5356 points according to pixels coordinate which represent the 960 m to 960 m area were created in GIS environment and matched with thermal bands of the study area in remote sensing environment. The DNs of these points were processed to extract 1ST and imported in GIS environment to derive the temperature maps. Temperature was found to be generally higher in 2010 than in 2000. The comparison of the highest temperature area in the temperature maps with ground stations data showed that the topographical characteristics of the area, and the wind speed, and direction influence the occurrence of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This study concludes that integration of remote sensing data and GIS is a useful tool in urban LST detection in tropical area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   STRUCTURE; STEM-GROWTH; DRY SEASON
AB The seasonal climate drivers of the carbon cycle in tropical forests remain poorly known, although these forests account for more carbon assimilation and storage than any other terrestrial ecosystem. Based on a unique combination of seasonal pan-tropical data sets from 89 experimental sites (68 include aboveground wood productivity measurements and 35 litter productivity measurements), their associated canopy photosynthetic capacity (enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and climate, we ask how carbon assimilation and aboveground allocation are related to climate seasonality in tropical forests and how they interact in the seasonal carbon cycle. We found that canopy photosynthetic capacity seasonality responds positively to precipitation when rainfall is < 2000 mm yr(-1) (water-limited forests) and to radiation otherwise (light-limited forests). On the other hand, independent of climate limitations, wood productivity and litterfall are driven by seasonal variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration, respectively. Consequently, light-limited forests present an asynchronism between canopy photosynthetic capacity and wood productivity. First-order control by precipitation likely indicates a decrease in tropical forest productivity in a drier climate in water-limited forest, and in current light-limited forest with future rainfall < 2000 mm yr(-1).

AB Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides Hayata) and red cypress (Chamaecyparis formosensis (Matsum.)) are two red-listed species found mostly in Taiwan. A better understanding of the mortality patterns is necessary for good forest management of taiwania and red cypress, which is critical given that they are vulnerable and threatened species, respectively. The data for this project come from thinning trials where high-density plantations were established and later thinned. Mortality due to thinning was not included in the analysis. The mortality data were fitted to an exponential function using a negative binomial distribution model under a finite mixed modeling framework with stand density measures as predictor variables. The negative binomial distribution was zero-inflated for red cypress. Maximum mortality rates were fitted to the same exponential function used to model the mean response. Generally, average and maximum mortality rates increased as stand density increased, with stocking and average tree basal area having a large influence on mortality. Mortality rates were higher for red cypress than for taiwania. The differences in mortality rates could be due to the species relative shade tolerance or their ability to withstand competition. The mortality models can be used for developing thinning prescriptions and managing these species for conservation.

DT Article; Book Chapter
ID DAMAGE
AB Between 1972 and 1994, the US Army Corps of Engineers undertook five studies in New England evaluating the benefits and costs of protecting natural valley storage (NVS) areas-natural reservoirs-for flood mitigation. Only along the Charles River did benefits outweigh costs. Analysis of the studies finds that the costs of large-scale land acquisition will often exceed the sole benefits of avoided flood damages. To generate net benefits, there must be significant amounts of NVS lands still undeveloped, development pressure on those lands, and downstream areas that would sustain large damages. The NVS studies also raised questions of whether the Corps should be involved in land acquisition, and whether regulating land use could substitute for purchasing land. Note, these findings do not apply to other forms of natural flood-risk reduction, such as levee setbacks, green infrastructure for stormwater management, and multi-purpose projects, which have different economic and institutional contexts.

AB Lianas are a common plant growth form in tropical forests, where they compete intensely with trees, decreasing tree recruitment, growth, and survival. If the detrimental effects of lianas vary significantly with tree species identity, as is often assumed, then lianas may influence tree species diversity and community composition. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that liana abundance and biomass are increasing relative to trees in neotropical forests, which will likely magnify the detrimental effects of lianas and may ultimately alter tree species diversity, relative abundances, and community composition. Few studies, however, have tested the responses of multiple tree species to the presence of lianas in robust, well-replicated experiments. We tested the hypotheses that lianas reduce tree seedling growth and survival, and that the effect of lianas varies with tree species identity. We used a large-scale liana removal experiment in Central Panama in which we planted 14 replicate seedlings of 14 different tree species that varied in shade tolerance in each of 16 80x80m plots (eight liana-removal and eight unmanipulated controls; 3136 total seedlings). Over a nearly two-yr period, we found that tree seedlings survived 75% more, grew 300% taller, and had twice the aboveground biomass in liana-removal plots than seedlings in control plots, consistent with strong competition between lianas and tree seedlings. There were no significant differences in the response of tree species to liana competition (i.e., there was no species by treatment interaction), indicating that lianas had a similar negative effect on all 14 tree species. Furthermore, the effect of lianas did not vary with tree species shade tolerance classification, suggesting that the liana effect was not solely based on light. Based on these findings, recently observed increases in liana abundance in neotropical forests will substantially reduce tree regeneration, but will not significantly alter tropical tree species diversity, relative abundance, or community composition.

AB Bioautography has been used as rapid and easy strategy to detect and identify bioactive fractions/molecules in the never before investigated Hedyosmum sprucei Solms (Chloranthaceae) essential oil (EO). The antioxidant activity, performed through DPPH bioautographic assay and spectrophotometric evaluations (IC50 = 230 +/- 10 mu g/mL), seemed to be mainly due to alpha-cadinol and alpha-muurolol. (HP) TLC bioautography, focused on antimicrobial capacities, pointed out alpha-cadinol, alpha-muurolol, tau-muurolol, caryophyllene oxide, and methyleugenol as the most effective compounds against Staphylococcus aureus, considered as testing strain. Moreover, the microdilution method, assessed among a wide panel of microorganisms, revealed Listeria grayi and Staphylococcus aureus as the most sensitive among human tested strains and Clavibacter michiganensis among phytopathogens. GC-MS chemical profile showed that bioactive molecules represented only a small quantity of the whole EO: germacrene D (23.16%), beta-caryophyllene (15.53%), delta-cadinene (5.50%), alpha-copaene (5.08%), and alpha-phellandrene (3.48%) were the main compounds, highlighting an uncommon composition among the genus Hedyosmum. Finally, H. sprucei EO was checked for cytotoxic potential against A549 (lung cancer) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines showing promising cytotoxic effects against both cell lines after 48 h (IC50 A549 = 44.05 +/- 2.35 mu g/mL; IC50 MCF-7 = 32.76 +/- 4.92 mu g/mL) and 72 h (IC50 A549 = 43.55 +/- 2.80 mu g/mL; IC50 MCF-7 = 33.64 +/- 0.43 mu g/mL).

AB Jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, is a species endemic to the eastern Pacific. Its distribution ranges from the Gulf of Alaska to Chile. These squids are important components of the ecosystem, as they are prey to sharks, billfishes, and marine mammals, and active predators of myctophid fishes, other squids and crustaceans. In Ecuador, D. gigas is a potential resource for industrial and artisanal fisheries, but they are often by-catch in artisanal fisheries that use trammel net and gill-netting methods. Due to the importance of D. gigas as prey and predator, we performed this exploratory research to describe the composition of their diet and identify their most important prey. A total of 167 squids were sampled in Santa Rosa, Salinas, Ecuador from May to December 2014. Squids ranged between 17.5 and 52 cm ML, and our results showed an average size of 40 cm ML. According to the %IRI the diet was mainly composed of fish and squids. Two myctophids, Lampanyctus sp. and Myctophum sp., were important food resources. Our results showed that there was no difference between food resources, and the sex, size, and maturity of squids in our sample. Cannibalism also occurs on small to large D. gigas, and is influenced by availability of other prey in the surface waters during fishing activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing pressure on tropical forests is continually highlighting the need to find new solutions that mitigate the impact of human populations on biodiversity. However, developing solutions that can tackle the drivers of anthropogenic pressure, or at least take them into account, hinges upon building a good understanding of the culture and perceptions of local people. This study aims to provide an overview of the ethnoprimatology of an indigenous Kichwa community in the Ecuadorian Amazon that maintains a traditional lifestyle but also has good access to markets. We examine whether primates are seen as a distinctive group and their relative importance as sources of bushmeat and as household pets. Pile-sorting exercises revealed that although locals generally group members of the order Primates together, tree-dwelling non-primates including sloths, coatis, kinkajous and tamanduas are also frequently classified as 'monkeys'. The perceived importance of primates to the forest and the community lay more in their potential as bushmeat, and only 1 respondent identified an ecological role for the group in terms of seed dispersal. Gaining a better understanding of local perceptions will allow for better-informed conservation decisions that are more aware of potential impacts and are more likely to gain community support.

AB Visual cues are important for insects to find flowers and host plants. It has been proposed that the diversity of leaf shape in Passiflora vines could be a result of negative frequency dependent selection driven by visual searching behavior among their butterfly herbivores. Here we tested the hypothesis that Heliconius butterflies use leaf shape as a cue to initiate approach toward a host plant. We first tested for the ability to recognize shapes using a food reward conditioning experiment. Butterflies showed an innate preference for flowers with three and five petals. However, they could be trained to increase the frequency of visits to a non-preferred flower with two petals, indicating an ability to learn to associate shape with a reward. Next we investigated shape learning specifically in the context of oviposition by conditioning females to lay eggs on two shoots associated with different artificial leaf shapes: their own host plant, Passiflora biflora, and a lanceolate non-biflora leaf shape. The conditioning treatment had a significant effect on the approach of butterflies to the two leaf shapes, consistent with a role for shape learning in oviposition behavior. This study is the first to show that Heliconius butterflies use shape as a cue for feeding and oviposition, and can learn shape preference for both flowers and leaves. This demonstrates the potential for Heliconius to drive negative frequency dependent selection on the leaf shape of their Passiflora host plants.

AB The Amazon tropical evergreen forest is an important component of the global carbon budget. Its forest floristic composition, structure, and function are sensitive to changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and land use. In this study biomass and productivity simulated by three dynamic global vegetation models (Integrated Biosphere Simulator, Ecosystem Demography Biosphere Model, and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) for the period 1970-2008 are compared with observations from forest plots (Rede Amazonica de Inventarios Forestales). The spatial variability in biomass and productivity simulated by the DGVMs is low in comparison to the field observations in part because of poor representation of the heterogeneity of vegetation traits within themodels. We find that over the last four decades the CO2 fertilization effect dominates a long-term increase in simulated biomass in undisturbed Amazonian forests, while land use change in the south and southeastern Amazonia dominates a reduction in Amazon aboveground biomass, of similar magnitude to the CO2 biomass gain. Climate extremes exert a strong effect on the observed biomass on short time scales, but the models are incapable of reproducing the observed impacts of extreme drought on forest biomass. We find that future improvements in the accuracy of DGVM predictions will require improved representation of four key elements: (1) spatially variable plant traits, (2) soil and nutrients mediated processes, (3) extreme event mortality, and (4) sensitivity to climatic variability. Finally, continued long-term observations and ecosystem-scale experiments (e. g. Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiments) are essential for a better understanding of the changing dynamics of tropical forests.

AB The Amazon Basin is a region of global importance for the carbon and hydrological cycles, a biodiversity hotspot, and a potential centre for future economic development. The region is also a major source of water vapour recycled into continental precipitation through evapotranspiration processes. This review applies an ecohydrological approach to Amazonia's water cycle by looking at contributions of water resources in the context of future agricultural production. At present, agriculture in the region is primarily rain-fed and relies almost exclusively on green-water resources (soil moisture regenerated by precipitation). Future agricultural development, however, will likely follow pathways that include irrigation from blue-water sources (surface water and groundwater) as insurance from variability in precipitation. In this review, we first provide an updated summary of the green-blue ecohydrological framework before describing past trends in Amazonia's water resources within the context of land use and land cover change. We then describe green- and blue-water trade-offs in light of future agricultural production and potential irrigation to assess costs and benefits to terrestrial ecosystems, particularly land and biodiversity protection, and regional precipitation recycling. Management of green water is needed, particularly at the agricultural frontier located in the headwaters of major tributaries to the Amazon River, and home to key downstream blue-water users and ecosystem services, including domestic and industrial users, as well as aquatic ecosystems.

AB The boreal forest of Alberta, Canada, is under pressure from a rapid expansion of the wildland-human interface driven by natural resources exploitation. The specific impact of these changes on area burned remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue by modelling area burned for the 1980-2010 period using variables accounting for various anthropogenic effects. We hypothesise that an ecological frontier exists in the areas of intermediate to low human influence in northern Alberta, which implies a new influx of human-caused ignitions coinciding with continuous flammable vegetation, hence promoting area burned. Using a statistical control approach, we assessed the importance of each anthropogenic variable by adding them to a biophysical regression model. Our results show that there is a diversity of responses of area burned to the different anthropogenic factors considered. Distance to the transportation network, human footprint and density of the energy network significantly improved the model predictions. The area burned in the ecological frontier showed clusters of higher predictions by anthropogenic models, which supports our hypothesis of an ecological frontier and suggests that human and natural ignitions have an additive, albeit temporary, effect on landscape fire susceptibility.

AB Plant conservation biology needs a new approach to cope with the rapid disappearance of species and ecosystems. This paper is an attempt to introduce such an approach via conceptual integration of conservation biology and restoration ecology in what can be called conservation-oriented restoration. Use of this term is limited to cases when restoration is applied to a still-functioning ecosystem, excluding cases when the destroyed ecosystem must be recreated or altered to a desirable state. The paper demonstrates the importance of habitat restoration for the majority of threatened species, and, although it may seem paradoxical, advocates usefulness of threatened plant species for restoration of natural habitats. It is proposed that threatened plant species should become an important part of many restoration projects and be introduced not only into locations where they currently grow or grew in the recent past, but also into suitable locations within their potential distribution range. Because the number of potentially suitable locations can be close to zero if we consider only untouched natural habitats as suitable, the introduction sites should include those that require restoration efforts. The available literature is reviewed to show why and how ecological restoration should become an integral part of the conservation biologist's armory.

AB Plant conservation biology needs a new paradigm to stop ongoing environmental degradation and species loss. This paper provides detailed methodological guidelines for the conceptual integration of conservation biology and restoration ecology through "conservation-oriented restoration" as introduced in a companion paper. Based on the latest theoretical developments in community ecology and vast experience gained by researchers in restoration ecology and conservation biology, this paper provides recommendations, among others, for (i) identification of a reference ecosystem; (ii) making operational species lists for introduction; (iii) choosing optimal restoration in terms of planting design, plant number and density; (iv) collecting, storing and using seeds; and (v) addressing plant animal interactions.

AB 1. Edge effects are pervasive in landscapes yet their causal mechanisms are still poorly understood. Traditionally, edge effects have been attributed to differences in habitat quality along the edge-interior gradient of habitat patches, under the assumption that no edge effects would occur if habitat quality was uniform. This assumption was questioned recently after the recognition that geometric constraints tend to reduce population abundances near the edges of habitat patches, the so-called geometric edge effect (GEE).
   2. Here, we present the first empirical, landscape-level evaluation of the importance of the GEE in shaping abundance patterns in fragmented landscapes.
   3. Using a data set on the distribution of small mammals across 18 forest fragments, we assessed whether the incorporation of the GEE into the analysis changes the interpretation of edge effects and the degree to which predictions based on the GEE match observed responses. Quantitative predictions were generated for each fragment using simulations that took into account home range, density and matrix use for each species.
   4. The incorporation of the GEE into the analysis changed substantially the interpretation of overall observed edge responses at the landscape scale. Observed abundances alone would lead to the conclusion that the small mammals as a group have no consistent preference for forest edges or interiors and that the black-eared opossum Didelphis aurita (a numerically dominant species in the community) has on average a preference for forest interiors. In contrast, incorporation of the GEE suggested that the small mammal community as a whole has a preference for forest edges, whereas D. aurita has no preference for forest edges or interiors. Unexplained variance in edge responses was reduced by the incorporation of GEE, but remained large, varying greatly on a fragment-by-fragment basis.
   5. This study demonstrates how to model and incorporate the GEE in analyses of edge effects and that this incorporation is necessary to properly interpret edge effects in landscapes. It also suggests that geometric constraints alone are unlikely to explain the variability in edge responses of a same species among different areas, highlighting the need to incorporate other ecological factors into explanatory models of edge effects.

AB 1. Tropical forest tree diversity has been hypothesized to be maintained via the attraction of density responsive and species-specific enemies. Tests of this hypothesis usually assume a linear relationship between enemy pressure (amount of damage and enemy richness) and seedling or tree density. However, enemy pressure is likely to change nonlinearly with local seedling abundance and community scale tree abundance if enemies are characterized by nonlinear functional responses.
   2. We examined the abiotic and biotic factors associated with richness of above-ground enemies and foliar damage found in tree seedlings in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Rather than identify specific enemies targeting these seedlings, we used damage morphotypes, a paleo-ecological method, to derive a proxy for enemy species richness.
   3. We found that the relationships between local and (conspecific seedling density) community scale (conspecific basal area of adult trees) abundance and both richness of above-ground enemies and foliar damage were hump-shaped. Seedlings of tree species existing at intermediate levels of abundance, at both local and community scales, suffered more damage and experienced pressure from a greater diversity of enemies than those existing at high or low densities.
   4. We hypothesized that greater damage at intermediate abundance level could arise from a rich mixture of generalist and specialist enemies targeting seedlings of intermediate abundance tree species. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that generalist enemies were more diverse on species at rare or intermediate abundance relative to common tree species. However, specialist enemies showed no significant trend across tree species abundance at either the local or community scales.
   5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that interspecific variation in tree species abundance leads to differences in the magnitude and type of damage tropical tree seedlings suffer. This variation leads to a nonlinear, hump-shaped relationship between species abundance and enemy damage, highlighting fruitful directions for further development of species coexistence theory.

AB Ecosystem engineering by insect herbivores occurs as the result of structural modification of plants manipulated by insects. However, only few studies have evaluated the effect of these modifications on the plant responses induced by stem-borers that act as ecosystem engineers. In this study, we evaluated the responses induced by the herbivory of the twig-girdler beetle Oncideres albomarginata chamela (Cerambycidae: Lamiinae) on its host plant Spondias purpurea (Anacardiaceae), and its relationship with the ecosystem engineering process carried out by this stem-borer. Our results demonstrated that O. albomarginata chamela branch removal induced the development of lateral branches increasing the resources needed for the development of future insect generations, of its own offspring and of many other insect species. Detached branches represent habitats with high content of nitrogen and phosphorous, which eventually can be incorporated into the ecosystem, increasing nutrient cycling efficiency. Consequently, branch removal and the subsequent plant tissue regeneration induced by O. albomarginata chamela represent key mechanisms underlying the ecosystem engineering process carried out by this stem-borer, which enhances arthropod diversity in the ecosystem.

AB Small mammals can impede tree regeneration by injuring seedlings and saplings in several ways. One fatal way is by severing their stems, but apparently this type of predation is not well-studied in tropical rain forest. Here, we report on the incidence of stem-cutting' to new, wild seedlings of two locally dominant, canopy tree species monitored in 40 paired forest understorey and gap-habitat areas in Korup, Cameroon following a 2007 masting event. In gap areas, which are required for the upward growth and sapling recruitment of both species, 137 seedlings of the long-lived, light-demanding, fast-growing large tropical tree (Microberlinia bisulcata) were highly susceptible to stem-cutting (83% of deaths) it killed 39% of all seedlings over a c. 2-y period. In stark contrast, seedlings of the more shade-tolerant, slower-growing tree species (Tetraberlinia bifoliolata) were hardly attacked (4.3%). In the understorey, however, stem-cutting was virtually absent. Across the gap areas, the incidence of stem-cutting of M. bisulcata seedlings showed significant spatial variation that could not be explained significantly by either canopy openness or Janzen-Connell type effects (proximity and basal area of conspecific adult trees). To examine physical and chemical traits that might explain the species difference to being cut, bark and wood tissues were collected from a separate sample of seedlings in gaps (i.e. not monitored for stem-cutting). These analyses suggested that, compared with T. bifoliolata, the lower stem density, higher Mg and K and fatty acid concentrations in bark, and fewer phenolic and terpene compounds in M. bisulcata seedlings made them more palatable and attractive to small-mammal predators, likely rodents. We conclude that selective stem-cutting is a potent countervailing force to the current local canopy dominance of the grove-forming M. bisulcata by limiting the recruitment and abundance of its saplings. Given the ubiquity of gaps and ground-dwelling rodents in pantropical forests, it would be surprising if this form of lethal browsing was restricted to Korup.

AB Coastal defences are proliferating in response to climate change, leading to the creation of more vertical substrata. Efforts are being made to mitigate their impacts and create novel habitats to promote biodiversity. Little is known about the effect of aspect (i.e. north-south directionality) and inclination on intertidal biodiversity in artificial habitats. Artificial and natural habitats were compared to assess the role of aspect and substratum inclination in determining patterns of biodiversity at two tidal heights (high and mid). We also compared grazing activity between north-and south-facing surfaces in natural habitats to examine the potential for differential grazing pressure to affect community structure and functioning. Results were variable but some clear patterns emerged. Inclination had no effect on biodiversity or abundance. There was a general trend towards greater taxon richness and abundance on north-facing than south-facing substrata in natural and artificial habitats. On natural shores, the abundance and grazing activity of 'southern' limpets (i.e. Patella depressa) was greater on south-facing than north-facing substrata, with possible implications for further range-expansion. These results highlight the importance of incorporating shaded habitats in the construction of artificial habitats. These habitats may represent an important refuge from grazing pressure and thermal and desiccation stress in a warming climate.

AB Environmental change incorporates the full range of natural and anthropogenic changes currently affecting the planet. These changes include fluxes within the carbon and nutrient cycles, resulting in disturbances at the ecosystem level, which may affect plant species distribution as well as soil systems. Mycorrhizal fungi form an important link between plants and soil systems, functioning at the root-soil interface, contributing towards nutrient cycling processes, and, ultimately, influencing the plant composition of terrestrial ecosystems. A more integrated and systemic understanding of these mycorrhizal associations can help us predict, and thus mitigate, the impact of environmental change on biotic communities. In this review we present the latest research on how the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics of arbuscular and ectomycorrhiza vary in their representative ecosystems. Furthermore, we also demonstrate how they respond to environmental change, which relates to both biotic and abiotic factors, such as CO2-enrichment, nitrogen-depletion, and the impact of invasive species. This review provides insight on the role of mycorrhiza in offsetting the negative effects of environmental change.

AB Little is known about the potential of restoration plantations to provide appropriate understory conditions to support the establishment of seeds arriving from neighboring native forests. In this article, we investigated how seedling establishment is affected in the understory of restoration sites of different ages and assessed some of the potential environmental factors controlling this ecological process. We first compared the density and richness of native tree seedlings among 10-, 22-, and 55-year-old restoration plantations within the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Then, we undertook a seed addition experiment in each study site, during the wet season, and compared seedling emergence, survival, and biomass on local versus old-growth forest soil (transferred from a reference ecosystem), in order to test whether local substrate could hamper seedling establishment. As expected, the oldest restoration site had higher density and richness of spontaneously regenerating seedlings. However, seedling establishment was less successful both in the oldest restoration planting and using substrate transferred from a reference ecosystem, where emergence and survival were lower, but surviving seedlings grew better. We attribute these results to lower light availability for seedlings in the understory of the oldest site and speculate that higher incidence of pathogens on old-growth forest soil may have increased seedling mortality. We conclude that the understory of young restoration plantations provides suitable microsite conditions at the early establishment phases for the spontaneous regeneration or enrichment planting of native trees.

AB Recolonisation of soil by macrofauna (especially ants, termites and earthworms) in rehabilitated open-cut mine sites is inevitable and, in terms of habitat restoration and function, typically of great value. In these highly disturbed landscapes, soil invertebrates play a major role in soil development (macropore configuration, nutrient cycling, bioturbation, etc.) and can influence hydrological processes such as infiltration, seepage, runoff generation and soil erosion. Understanding and quantifying these ecosystem processes is important in rehabilitation design, establishment and subsequent management to ensure progress to the desired end goal, especially in waste cover systems designed to prevent water reaching and transporting underlying hazardous waste materials. However, the soil macrofauna is typically overlooked during hydrological modelling, possibly due to uncertainties on the extent of their influence, which can lead to failure of waste cover systems or rehabilitation activities. We propose that scientific experiments under controlled conditions and field trials on post-mining lands are required to quantify (i) macrofauna-soil structure interactions, (ii) functional dynamics of macrofauna taxa, and (iii) their effects on macrofauna and soil development over time. Such knowledge would provide crucial information for soil water models, which would increase confidence in mine waste cover design recommendations and eventually lead to higher likelihood of rehabilitation success of open-cut mining land.

AB Bioeconomic models are idealized representations of human-nature interactions used to describe how the decisions that people make regarding the harvest of biological resources affect the future condition of resource stocks and the flow of net economic benefits. This modeling approach posits an assumed goal or objective that a decision-maker seeks to optimize subject to a set of biological constraints. The power of this method derives from its ability to evaluate a wide array of alternative policy or management innovations over timescales that are radically longer than the timescales considered in many other approaches to economic analysis. In this chapter, we review techniques and applications of two complementary classes of bioeconomic models that have been used to analyze alternative strategies for sustainable use of tropical forests. First, continuous-time bioeconomic models have been used to derive dynamic policy prescriptions for optimally balancing tropical timber production and tropical forest conservation over very long time scales. Second, discrete-time bioeconomic models have been used to evaluate alternative on-the-ground timber harvesting strategies. Emerging threats associated with climate change could be addressed with bioeconomic models that consider the resilience of tropical forests to potentially catastrophic changes.

AB This chapter discusses methods for summarizing and distilling lessons from the empirical economics literature on tropical forestry, giving particular attention to the method of meta-analysis ("the study of studies") and to the topic of tropical deforestation. Meta-analysis can be used to take stock of the literature, test hypotheses about the effects of explanatory variables on a dependent variable, and predict the value of a dependent variable across space and time. We discuss previous reviews of the literature on deforestation and then illustrate how to test hypotheses with meta-analysis. Specifically, we examine the so-called "win-win" hypothesis that economic development is good for both people (resulting in higher incomes) and forests (resulting in lower rates of deforestation). Consistent with previous literature reviews, we find that the drivers of deforestation vary by region. However, we reject the win-win hypothesis in all regions: meta-analysis of the literature clearly shows that there are trade-offs between development and forest conservation. In Latin America, there is some evidence for the alternative hypothesis of an "environmental Kuznets curve" of deforestation. The meta-analysis also reveals possible publication biases, including different patterns of results in economics versus other publication outlets, which are important to keep in mind when drawing conclusions from the literature.

AB Economic valuation of the tropical forest resource is en vogue. The acknowledgment of the environment's multiple benefit delivery paves the way for reciprocal bargain-like transactions, opening up the potential for designing efficient and effective compensation mechanisms. The following chapter contributes to the economic section of the present handbook, introducing in a first step theoretical considerations necessary to gain an understanding of the rationale environmental and forest-related compensation schemes are based on. Subsequently, the reader will be familiarized with practical examples including Kyoto's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). Through the combination of theory and their practical embedding, this chapter offers a holistic overview of compensation payment arrangements found throughout the tropical hemisphere, providing guidance and material for mastering the subject.

AB Payment for environmental services - in short PES - has become a prominent topic in the tropics, especially in Latin America where Costa Rica is considered a pioneer in the field. This chapter introduces PES by providing the theoretical basis underpinning the topic in a first step, followed by a description of the PES landscape and implementation essentials. As PES lives from examples on the ground, five concrete PES cases are introduced, ranging from the Vittel water brand in France over the ICMS Ecologico in Brazil to the 1996 established Costa Rican PES scheme. Described cases are finally used to derive a set of lessons-learnt from the PES experience.

AB A long-standing paradigm in tropical ecology is that phosphorus (P) availability limits the productivity of most lowland forests, with the largest pool of plant-available P resident in biomass. Evidence that P limits components of productivity is particularly strong for sites in Panama and the Amazon basin. Analyses of forest communities in Panama also show that tree species distributions are strongly affected by P availability at the regional scale, but that their local distributions in a single site on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) are as frequently correlated with base cations as with P. Traits associated with species sensitivity to P availability require more detailed exploration, but appear to show little similarity with those associated with N limitation in temperate forests. Recent research indicates that a large fraction of P in tropical forests exists as organic and microbial P in the soil; plant adaptations to access organic P, including the synthesis of phosphatase enzymes, likely represent critical adaptations to low P environments. Plants also cope with low P availability through increases in P use-efficiency resulting from increased retention time of P in biomass and decreased tissue P concentration. Although foliar P responds strongly to P addition, we show here that foliar P and N:P are highly variable within communities, and at BCI correlate with regional species distributional affinity for P. An improved understanding of P limitation, and in particular the plasticity of responses to P availability, will be critical to predicting community and ecosystem responses of tropical forests to climate change.

AB One of the ongoing debates around metacommunity ecology is to what extent stochastic and deterministic processes act on community assembly. We explored the influence of both determinism, mediated by environmental filters, and stochasticity, mediated by dispersal and ecological drift, on phytoplankton assembly in a floodplain river. A probabilistic co-occurrence model revealed the presence of 94.1% random and 5.9% non-random species pairwise associations. The latter were higher at both hydrologically isolated (4.42%) and connected environments (2.2%). Variation partitioning analysis showed similar significant explanations by the unique environmental (7.7%, Secchi, conductivity, vegetation, phosphorous) and spatial (7.2%, watercourse distance, longitude) components. Temporal variability was poorly represented (2.4%) because we only considered two low-water periods. Species co-occurrence patterns showed that most taxa coexist randomly. The environmental explanation is in line with niche-assembly models (species sorting), but the similar proportion explained by spatial organisation related to random dispersal guides the evidence to both deterministic and stochastic processes. The higher percentage of random co-occurrence and the larger assemblage variability observed in isolated environments suggests that random dispersal, ecological drift, and priority effects could promote stochasticity. We concluded that both processes affect the structure of phytoplankton metacommunities in a floodplain system and suggest the preponderance of stochastic organisation.

AB Ants can act as plant biotic defenses, however, in agricultural ecosystems they are often associated with outbreaks of honeydew-producing pests mainly due to the protection they offer to the plant feeders in exchange for honeydew. In this interaction ants may alter the abundance, diversity and community structure of predators and parasitoids. In the present study, we conducted ant-exclusion experiments in three commercial citrus orchards, each one dominated by one ant species (Pheidole pallidula, Lasius grandis or Linepithema humile) during two consecutive years. We then compared the abundance, species richness, diversity and community structure of predators and parasitoids between the ant-allowed and ant-excluded treatments. A total of 176,074 natural enemies belonging to 81 taxa were captured and identified. The abundance of the natural enemies showed a species specific response between treatments. When examining functional groups of natural enemies the abundance of generalist predators decreased while that of parasitoids increased in the ant-allowed treatment. The species richness was significantly lower for predators and higher for parasitoids in the ant-allowed treatment. The Shannon diversity index was not different between treatments for predators, whereas parasitoid diversity was significantly higher in the ant-allowed treatment. Finally, the community structure of predators and parasitoids was not significantly different between treatments. These results suggest that ants in citrus are not associated with a dramatic decrease in natural enemy abundance or biodiversity; on the contrary ants were associated with increased parasitoid species richness and diversity. On the other hand, ants negatively affected the abundance of specific natural enemy species, mainly generalist predators. The impact on these predators might explain the higher pest densities associated with ants in citrus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although agriculture is a major factor in environmental change, the level of its impact is likely to vary with farming practices. Thus, we sought to determine how farming practices might affect the natural compartment of agroecosystems and the sustainable use of land. In particular, we examined ant biodiversity and community composition as related to orchard design and management practices in the mango- and citrus-based orchard agroecosystems of Senegal. Ants were collected using pitfall traps in 49 orchards classed in four types based on their design and management. The results showed that the effect of practices was significant, albeit weak, and a typology of orchards based on design and management practices was congruent with a typology based on the composition of ant communities. The different types of orchard were seen to differ in the richness and diversity ant species. Moreover, ant richness and diversity was positively correlated with tree richness. We were also able to identify some ant species as being related to agricultural practices. For instance, Monomorium salomonis (L.) was closely associated with high irrigation, fertilization and pesticide use, whereas Paltotyreus tarsarits was associated with greater tree richness, high local ground coverage by the tree canopy, more leaf litter and great variation in the local tree planting density.

AB Leaf-cutting ants are major agricultural and forestry pests in the New World. Attempts to control them have most frequently involved the use of chemical insecticides, with mixed results. Among alternative methods, botanical pesticides may provide a sustainable and efficient control of leaf-cutting ants. In the present study, we screened the activity of plant extracts derived from 89 species native to Argentina, against the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex lundi (Guerin) and its mutualistic fungus, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, through a pick-up assay and bioautography, respectively. The pick-up assay revealed moderate to strong anti-foraging activity for just over 13.5% of the assayed species, including complete ant foraging inhibition for Aristolochia argentina, Flourensia oolepis, Gaillardia megapotamica, Lantana grisebachii and Lithrea molleoides. Most plant extracts were well tolerated by fungi, with only 12.3% of the species tested showing some degree of fungus growth inhibition. Among these, A. argentina, F. oolepis and Pterocaulon alopecuroides were the strongest inhibitors, whereas Baccharis flabellata, Dalea elegans and Zanthoxylum coco revealed a more moderate activity. Only A. argentina and F. oolepis extracts showed strong antiforaging effects and affected fungus growth at the same time. Values of IC50 and MIC indicated that extracts inhibiting ant foraging at lower concentrations did not necessarily also inhibit fungus growth at lower doses. The active principle of A. argentina, on both ant foraging and fungal growth, was identified as argentilactone. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Green tree retention is thought to conserve biodiversity in harvested landscapes; however, the amount and distribution of retention that best meets conservation goals remains unclear. To clarify size of retention patches needed to effectively conserve saproxylic (i.e., deadwood-associated) beetles in western Canada, we compared beetle assemblages among patches of three size categories (small: 0.63-1.06 ha, medium: 1.43-2.93 ha, and large: 3.34-5.93 ha) left in harvested areas with those from intact forests and harvested matrix. To understand edge effects as a potential driver of faunal changes associated with patch size, we also compared assemblages from edges and centers of retention patches. Saproxylic beetle assemblages similar to those in intact forests were well maintained in all patch centers, but assemblages in small and medium patches were strongly influenced by edge effects and were least similar to those in intact forests. Particular trophic guilds showed distinct responses to patch size. Predator assemblages showed negative edge effects in small and medium patches, while phloeophage assemblages did not differ between edges and centers of different patch sizes. Although smaller patches may better emulate historical size distributions of fire skips, conservation value is likely maximized in large patches, mainly by decreasing edge effects. Our study dealt mainly with 'initial colonizers', but further studies to define minimum patch size for retention harvest must be conducted over time to incorporate effects on species associated with well-decayed deadwood.

AB Deforestation causes habitat loss, fragmentation, degradation, and can ultimately cause extinction of the remnant species. Tropical montane birds face these threats with the added natural vulnerability of narrower elevational ranges and higher specialization than lowland species. Recent studies assess the impact of present and future global climate change on species' ranges, but only a few of these evaluate the potentially confounding effect of lowland deforestation on species elevational distributions. In the Western Andes of Colombia, an important biodiversity hotspot, we evaluated the effects of deforestation on the elevational ranges of montane birds along altitudinal transects. Using point counts and mist-nets, we surveyed six altitudinal transects spanning 2200 to 2800m. Three transects were forested from 2200 to 2800m, and three were partially deforested with forest cover only above 2400m. We compared abundance-weighted mean elevation, minimum elevation, and elevational range width. In addition to analysing the effect of deforestation on 134 species, we tested its impact within trophic guilds and habitat preference groups. Abundance-weighted mean and minimum elevations were not significantly different between forested and partially deforested transects. Range width was marginally different: as expected, ranges were larger in forested transects. Species in different trophic guilds and habitat preference categories showed different trends. These results suggest that deforestation may affect species' elevational ranges, even within the forest that remains. Climate change will likely exacerbate harmful impacts of deforestation on species' elevational distributions. Future conservation strategies need to account for this by protecting connected forest tracts across a wide range of elevations.

ID HIGHWAY; IMPACT
AB The Brazilian government has been heavily investing in transportation infrastructure. According to environmental laws, this kind of enterprise must do an environmental impact assessment (EIA). However, the EIA is a regulatory measure applied post-project, which allows for limited project changes. For increasing environmental viability of the project, changes should be done from earlier steps of the project in a regional or national strategic planning context. For the transportation sector, a National Plan on Logistics and Transportation (NPLT) recommends aims, targets and plans for Brazil and neighboring countries for the future. We have evaluated the environmental aspects of the NPLT as showed in three reports from 2007, 2009 and 2012. The first report (2007) has summarized the trajectory of transportation planning in Brazil, since the military dictatorship period in the 1970s, showing the necessity of considering environmental impacts from transportation projects and from respecting environmental laws. The following reports indicated the need to expand the modal matrix of transportation, which until then is concentrated on highways, and mentioned the importance of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The SEA tool would allow to identify, previously, the cumulative and synergetic effects of the project as predicted in the PNLT; however it still remains as a proposition for improvement in the Brazilian environmental laws. We believe that using SEA oriented by Economic Ecological Zoning (EEZ) and some basic concepts of Landscape Ecology and Road Ecology, the protection of environmentally vulnerable regions and priority areas for biodiversity conservation in Brazil would effectively guide the PNLT aims, targets and plans.

AB Hummingbirds are the most important and specialized group of pollinating birds in the Neotropics and their interactions with plants are key components to many communities. In the present study we identified the assemblage of plants visited by hummingbirds and investigated the temporal availability of floral resources in an area of restinga, sandy plain coastal vegetation associated with the Atlantic forest, in Southeastern Brazil. We recorded flower and nectar features, flowering phenology and interactions between plants and hummingbirds and estimated the amount of calories produced per hectare from June 2005 to August 2006. Ten plant species were visited by two hummingbirds, Amazilia fimbriata and Eupetomena macroura. Resource availability was highly variable among plant species and over time. Nectar volume and concentration per flower were similar to other Neotropical hummingbird-visited plant assemblages. The estimated nectar resource availability between months varied from 0.85 to 5.97 Kcal per hectare/day, demanding an area between one and 6.8 ha to support a single hummingbird. Our study reports an unusual tropical setting where almost all interactions between hummingbirds and plants were performed by a single hummingbird species, A. fimbriata. Hence, the variable nectar availability is probably influencing hummingbird movements, its foraging area, and consequently plant pollination.

AB Phenology Hura polyandra Baill. was evaluated in a semideciduous tropical forest of Azueta Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, recording bimonthly for two years: falling leaves, flowering, fruiting and leaf sprout, correlating these variables with precipitation and temperature. Diameter trees were associated with phenology. Using dendrometer bands growth diameter was measured every two months for two years, establishing six diameter categories, three symmetries and three crown lighting, adjusting the growth increments to a mathematical model. Growth periodicity was determined by performing markings on the cambium of a tree at 1.30 m (DBH) every two months and obtaining the corresponding slice at the end of the experiment to determine whether annual rings were formed. Hura polyandra defoliates from March to May, flowers from March to July; bear fruits from March to September and sprouts the leaves from July to January. Significant correlations occurred between the development of leaves buds with precipitation (P <= 0.01) and flowering with temperature (P <= 0.01). The growth is higher and significant (P <= 0.001) in diameter categories 10, 15 and 20 cm. Crown lighting helps significantly (P <= 0.01) greater increases in diameter. In the study area, this species forms an annual ring.

AB Predation is frequently suggested to be a key biotic process that can shape ecological communities and drive coevolution. The premise behind these hypotheses is that predators select prey to ensure maximum gain per unit effort; for example, by selecting species that are more abundant or accessible. In this study, we tested for predator selectivity in a tropical molluscan assemblage by quantifying the influence of relative abundance (encounter frequency) on predation frequencies. We collected macromollusks (> 4 mm) from 15 sites in three soft-sediment reef lagoons at One Tree Reef (southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Dead mollusks were counted and identified to species level (61 species, n = 8131), and species predation frequencies were calculated as the proportion of shells with drill holes. We found that in this infauna-dominated community, levels of drilling predation were low (7.14% on average), and there was no evidence that predators selected prey based on encounter frequency. This result was consistent across prey species and lagoons. Thus, drilling predators did not specialize on more accessible prey species and were not a major cause of mortality in this modern macromollusk assemblage. Since drilling gastropods are size selective, lack of selectivity in our samples only applies to the prey size range considered. Detailed studies of prey morphological traits, as well as accounting for predator non-consumptive effects could shed light on the preferences and relevance of drilling gastropods in this soft-sediment carbonate reef assemblage.

AB We documented movement of a long-distant migrant (Swainson's Thrush Catharus ustulatus) and two understory resident species (Chestnut-capped Brush-finch Buarremon brunneinuchus and Streak-capped Treehunter Thripadectes virgaticeps) in a fragmented landscape dominated by a pasture matrix in a Sub-Andean region of central Colombia. Swainson's Thrush had no detectable difficulties traversing a pasture matrix and returning to the capture site. Chestnut-capped Brush-finch and Streak-capped Treehunter (understory resident species) avoided making lengthy flights and used stepping-stones and nearby corridors to ease their movement. Providing stepping stones such as live fences and isolated trees and maintaining corridors can enhance functional connectivity in regions with fragmented forests, aiding the conservation of bird species.

AB In tropical dry landscapes, biodiversity conservation is dependent upon both the protection of natural areas and the sustainable management of the agricultural matrix. We analyzed the taxonomic, species and functional group diversity of ants in three neighboring habitats with different degrees of anthropic disturbance in Veracruz, Mexico. A total of 34,957 ant workers belonging to 89 species, 34 genera, 19 tribes and 7 subfamilies were recorded. Primary forest had the highest species richness and most even distribution of species among the taxonomic levels, followed by secondary forest and active pasture. Because high species turnover among habitats increased species richness at the landscape level, the three neighboring habitats that we sampled are important for conservation biodiversity and together have a high conservation value for ants and probably for other invertebrates as well. Species of specialized functional groups were more frequent in primary forest, while those belonging to generalist and opportunistic groups were more frequent in active pasture. Human-disturbed areas in the vicinity of protected areas have an important role as reservoirs of biodiversity and should be included in landscape management practices designed to improve arthropod conservation in the tropics.

AB Tropical forests contain much of the world's biodiversity, yet their rate of decline is increasing. The strategy most frequently used to protect this biodiversity is to make parks and reserves. While there is a great deal of research on the effectiveness of parks for protecting biodiversity, there is little research on how well extractive reserves conserve biodiversity. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of four forest reserves in western Uganda at maintaining populations of primates and compare census data from the reserves to data from the neighbouring well-protected Kibale National Park. The relative abundance of the five most common primates in the park was approximately four times that of the forest reserves. In the forest reserves, evidence of new human encroachment was seen every 500 m, while in the park it was seen every 100,000 m. Two recommendations emerge from our research: (i) for forest reserves, such as those studied here, to have conservation value for primates, extraction must be reduced and (ii) until the long-term viability of the populations in forest reserves can be ascertained, they should not be considered in estimates of the sizes of endangered species protected ranges.

AB Understanding the factors driving changes in species distributions is fundamental to conservation, but for wide-ratiging species this is often complicated by the need for broad-scale observations across space and time. In the last three decades, the location of summer concentrations of migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in southern Hudson Bay (SHB), Canada, has shifted south and east as much as 500 km. We used long-term data (1987-2011) to test two hypotheses that could explain the distribution shift: forage depletion and anthropogenic disturbance. Over time and space, we compared the body size of live-captured adult female caribou, dietary quality from fecal nitrogen in July, the location of VHF- and GPS-collared female caribou in July, distribution of all-terrain vehicle (ATV) tracks and caribou tracks in August, and the proximity of collared caribou to sections of the coast with higher ATV activity in spring and summer. The forage depletion hypothesis was supported by greater body size and dietary quality in caribou of the eastern portion of SHB than in western SHB animals in 2009-11. The anthropogenic disturbance hypothesis was supported by the negative correlation of the distributions of ATV tracks and caribou tracks on the coast in 2010 and the fact that caribou avoided areas with ATV activity by 10-14 km. In 1987, collared caribou were observed largely along the coast in western SHB in mid-July, while in 2009-11, they were inland in western SHB and along the coast in eastern SHB. While these locations demonstrate a substantial change in summer distribution over three decades, we were unable to differentiate between forage depletion and anthropogenic disturbance as a single causal factor of the distribution shift.

AB Avian communities in cloud forests have high levels of endemism and are at major risk given the accelerated rate of habitat fragmentation. Nevertheless, the response of these communities to changes in fragment size remains poorly understood. We evaluated species richness, bird community density, community composition, and dominance as indicators of the response to fragment size in a fragmented cloud forest landscape in central Veracruz, Mexico. Medium-sized fragments had statistically higher than expected species richness and more even communities, which may be a reflection of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, in which medium-sized fragments are exploited by both forest and disturbance-associated species. Bird density also reached higher values in medium-sized fragments, which may indicate a carrying capacity in this habitat. However, large cloud forest fragments had a distinct taxonomic and functional composition, attributable to an increased number of understory insectivore species and canopy frugivores. By comparison, omnivorous species associated with human-altered habitats were more abundant in smaller fragments. Hence, although medium-sized cloud forest fragments had higher species richness and high bird density, large forest tracts maintained a distinct avian community composition, particularly of insectivorous and frugivorous species. Furthermore, the underlying response to fragmentation can only be properly addressed when contrasting several community attributes, such as richness, density, composition, and species dominance. Therefore, cloud forest conservation should aim to preserve the remaining large forest fragments to maintain comprehensive avian communities and avoid local extinctions.

AB If we are to develop effective conservation strategies for primates in heavily disturbed biomes, we must understand why they persist or perish in human-dominated landscapes. I investigated the potential of an agroforestry/forest mosaic in the Atlantic forest of Bahia, Brazil to sustain populations of three monkey species -capuchins (Sapajus xanthosternos), titi monkeys (Callicebus melanochir), and marmosets (Callithrix sp.)- sampling the primates in three forest and four agroforestry landscapes across a 1000 km(2) landscape during a 17-yr study. I used 754 km of transects, reconnaissance walks, semistructured interviews, and key informant reports to collect information on the monkeys. Capuchins and titi monkeys are mostly restricted to the largest forests, with titi monkeys widely distributed and capuchins nearly extinct. Both species are absent from the Attalea funifera forests, but a few capuchins persist in the Brodiguesia santosii forests. Marmosets live throughout the landscape and are the only species inhabiting the agroforestry lands. The abundance data indicate that the disturbed forests characteristic of the landscape provide adequate habitat for all three species, but chronic hunting suppresses titi and capuchin populations and limits their distributions. Data from the Reserva Ecolgica Michelin show that protected monkey populations can reach abundances equal to those at other protected sites, and that capuchins and titi monkeys enter agroforestry lands when protected. Long-term data indicate that deforestation rates are low and that illegal logging and hunting pressure are declining. The creation of reserves and the relatively large amount of forest left make the regional landscape a vital part of the strategy to conserve these species. This study demonstrates that agroforestry/forest landscapes can play an important role in primate conservation when large blocks of contiguous forest with adequate escape space for hunted primates remain, but that the potential conservation value of agroforestry habitats and small forest fragments for hunted species will be realized only if hunting is controlled.

AB Aim Using a standardized sampling protocol along a 600-km transect in northern Australia, we tested whether ant diversity within a single biome, tropical savanna, decreases with increasing latitude (as a surrogate of temperature) and decreasing rainfall, as is expected for biodiversity in general.
   Location Northern Australia.
   Methods Ants were sampled using pitfall traps on three occasions at 1-hasand, loam and clay sites at each of five locations along the Northern Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), from 12 degrees 50 ' S (1400 mm mean annual rainfall) to 17 degrees 21 ' S (650 mm).
   Results We recorded a total of 246 species from 37 genera. Mean observed species richness pooled across sampling periods was similar at sand (85.4) and loam (82.2) sites, but was less than half this at clay sites (40.0). Ant communities were also compositionally distinct on clay soils compared with sands and loams. Individual genera showed variable diversity patterns, ranging from a linear increase to a linear decrease in species richness along the NATT. However, total species richness was relatively uniform along the gradient. Patterns of ant species turnover were consistent with previously recognized biogeographical boundaries, with a primary disjunction between the arid and monsoonal zones in the south, and a secondary disjunction between the semi-arid and mesic zones in the north.
   Main conclusions Patterns of ant diversity in Australian savannas do not conform to global patterns of biodiversity declines with increasing latitude and decreasing rainfall. We believe this is due to a lack of significant temperature change across the latitudinal gradient, and, in particular, to the fauna's evolutionary history in association with aridification, which makes it unusually resilient to increasing aridity. The diversity of other important faunal groups such as termites and lizards is also exceptionally high in arid Australia and is likewise not closely linked to rainfall in Australian savannas. We predict that these taxa are far more sensitive to increasing aridity in savannas elsewhere in the world, and especially in the Neotropics, where savannas have an evolutionary association with humid rain forest rather than desert.

AB International conservation donors have spent at least $3.4 billion to protect biodiversity and stem tropical deforestation in Africa since the early 1990s. Despite more than two decades of experience, however, there is little research on the effect of this aid at a region-wide scale. Numerous case studies exist, but show mixed results. Existing research is usually based on community perception or focused on short-term donor objectives rather than specific conservation outcomes, like deforestation rates. Thus, the impact of billions of dollars of conservation aid on deforestation rates remains an open question. This article uses an original dataset to analyze the effect of international conservation aid on deforestation rates in 42 African countries between 2000 and 2013. We first describe patterns of conservation aid across the continent and then assess its impact (with one to five-year lags), controlling for other factors that may also affect deforestation, including rural population, protected areas (PAs), governance, and other economic and commodity production variables. We find that conservation aid is associated with higher rates of forest loss after one-or two-year lags. A similar result holds for PA extent, suggesting possible displacement of deforestation from PAs. However, governance quality in high forest cover countries moderates these effects such that deforestation rates are reduced. Rural population is the most consistent factor associated with forest loss, confirming previous studies of this driver. Our results suggest that in heavily forested countries, development projects designed to support conservation work initially in conditions of good governance, but that conservation aid alone is insufficient to mitigate larger deforestation drivers.

AB Fragmentation alters forest canopy structure through various mechanisms, which in turn drive subsequent changes to biogeochemical processes and biological diversity. Using repeated airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) mappings, we investigated the size distribution and dynamics of forest canopy gaps across a topical montane forest landscape in Hawaii naturally fragmented by lava >100 yr ago. The combined effects of long-term isolation were evaluated using edge-proximity patterns in the distribution of gaps identified in year 1 ("existing gaps''). In addition, using the data from year 2, we investigated patterns in the loss of canopy ("new gaps'') and regrowth of canopy ("filled gaps''). The size distributions of the three gap types were modelled using the power-law exponent, lambda. We found that fragmentation has resulted in some large changes in gap dynamics, with both the total area of gaps and the relative proportion of large existing gaps increased with distance to fragment edge. In models of power-law distribution scaling, lambda estimates decreased to asymptotic values within 20 m of fragment edges for existing gaps. The size distributions of new and filled gaps were surprisingly similar. However, the total area of filled gaps was less than that of new gaps, and this difference was greatest near fragment edges. From these results, we conclude that fragmentation may be capable of continuously altering gap-phase dynamics of a forest for more than a century.

AB Interactions among sea urchin and abalone populations provide an important mechanism for maintaining segregation of habitat use at small spatial scales within kelp forest ecosystems. Here we provide evidence from a long-term study of the sea urchin, Evechinus chloroticus, and the abalone, Haliotis iris, populations in a pristine rocky harbor of Stewart Island, in southern New Zealand. Between 1998 and 2014 we observe declines in density of abalone within fished regions of the Inlet and a coincident increase in density of sea urchins. In these regions, sea urchins progressively invaded the shallow (0-3 m) depth stratum formally occupied by abalone and dense, multi-layered stands of macroalgae. Formation of the Ulva Island Marine Reserve in 2004 released abalone populations from fishing mortality, resulting in population increases within the shallow water depth stratum. Here we observed declines in sea urchin density as the growing abalone population displaced sea urchins from the shallow water habitats. The reestablishment of a depth-stratified distribution of abalone and sea urchins within the kelp forest provides a likely mechanism for maintenance of habitat complexity and evidence for the important role of high-density abalone populations within kelp forest ecosystems.

AB Avian diversity in fragmented Amazonian landscapes depends on a balance between extinction and colonization in cleared and disturbed areas. Regenerating forest facilitates bird dispersal within degraded Amazonian landscapes and may tip the balance in favor of persistence in habitat patches. Determining the response of Amazonian birds to fragmentation may be hindered because many species use adjacent second growth matrices thereby limiting the applicability of island biogeography to predict species loss; alternatively, a countryside biogeographic framework to evaluate the value of regenerating forest may be more appropriate. Here, we used point-count and capture data to compare Amazonian bird communities among continuous forest, 100 ha forest fragments with adjacent second growth, young and older second growth plots, and 100 ha forested islands bounded by water, to test the applicability of island biogeography on the mainland and to assess the ecological value of a regenerating matrix. Among foraging guilds, understory insectivores and flocking species were nearly absent on true islands. Fragments surrounded by young second growth were species rich, suggesting that a developing matrix may mitigate extinction associated with fragmentation. Our findings reinforce that true islands are often extinction-driven systems with distinct, depauperate communities. In contrast, succession of bird communities in second growth facilitates recolonization of forest fragments, permitting fragments as small as 100 ha to support bird communities similar to continuous forest.

AB Disturbance caused by anthropogenic fires are increasingly affecting the biodiversity of fire-prone ecosystems worldwide. The Cerrado biodiversity hotspot suffers higher deforestation rates than Amazonia and concentrates most of the burned areas in South America. To support adequate fire-management decisions in Cerrado, knowledge on the effects of altered fire regimes upon its animal populations is necessary. Based on a long-term, large-scale fire experiment, we investigated the effects of different fire regimes on the demography of the gymnophthalmid Micrablepharus atticolus, an endemic lizard of the Cerrado. Because M. atticolus is more abundant in open habitats, we predicted that frequent burns should favor its populations. Over eight years, we conducted a mark-recapture study using pitfall trap arrays in five 10 ha plots of cerrado sensu stricto, subjected to prescribed burns. Using generalized linear mixed-models of time series data and an information theoretic approach to select demographic models, we describe the life history of M. atticolus and assess the response of apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment to burn regimes and climate variation. Micrablepharus atticolus has an annual life cycle, with complete annual population turnover; breeding takes place during the dry season, when activity is higher, and hatchlings appear in the wet season. Apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment increased in the short-run after the passage of fire in all experimental plots. In the long run, however, both fire-suppression and more severe fire regimes were seemingly detrimental, presumably by affecting microclimatic conditions and food availability. Short-term studies may not adequately describe the effects of fire on the demography of lizard populations. Adequate fire management is warranted for biodiversity conservation in Cerrado, both inside and outside protected areas, including a reduction in the frequency and severity of burns in open physiognomies and controlled, patch mosaic fires to prevent excessive fuel accumulation in denser physiognomies.

AB Microorganisms are the pillars of life on Earth. Over billions of years, they have evolved into every conceivable niche on the planet. Microbes reshaped the oceans and atmosphere and gave rise to conditions conducive to multicellular organisms. Only in the past decade have we started to peer deeply into the microbial cosmos, and what we have found is amazing. Microbial ecosystems behave, in many ways, like large-scale ecosystems, although there are important exceptions. We review recent advances in our understanding of how microbial diversity is distributed across environments, how microbes influence the ecosystems in which they live, and how these nano-machines might be harnessed to advance our understanding of the natural world.

AB This paper addresses the differential impacts on decisions towards collective action in the context of payments for ecosystem services (PES) where individual and collective rewards are conditional on a minimum collective conservation level being achieved. Interactions between the different reward types, farmers' social preferences, social ties and communication are identified. A field game experiment is conducted with Andean farmers in Peru and framed around their decisions to conserve agrobiodiversity as an impure public good. The main results are that PBS schemes could be effective in motivating collective action for agrobiodiversity conservation and that individual rewards are likely to be more effective and less sensitive to social factors than collective rewards. The latter might have a positive effect on conservation when they are shared within socially closely-related groups or in situations where communication and deliberation about collective action are possible.

AB Replacement of native forests by forest plantations may change the composition and abundance of small mammals, thus influencing the foraging behavior of mesocarnivores in these human-created habitats. We assessed how differences in prey abundance between native forests and exotic plantations in southern Chile may explain the prey selection of four mesocarnivores, as analyzed from their scats. Using a spatial zero-inflated Poisson model, we determined that the abundance of most small mammals was lower in plantations than native forests, except for three common species, which had similar or larger abundances in exotic plantations. We assessed mesocarnivores' prey selection by assessing the coefficients and log-ratios of use and availability of a Bayesian Resource Selection Function. We determined that in native forest, the preferences of kodkod (Leopardus guigna) for arboreal prey was stronger, whereas chilla fox (Pseudalopex griseus) and Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex fuhdpes) exhibited a selective preference for ground prey. Darwin's fox also exhibited a habitat-dependent changes in their selection for Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), from a positive log ratio in native forest to a negative ratio in exotic plantations. Conversely, culpeo fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus) selected long-tailed colilargo (Oligoriaomys longicaudatus) and Chilean climbing mouse (Irenomys tarsalis) in plantations only, even though these prey were more abundant in native forests. Although mature commercial forest plantations may provide feeding grounds for mesocarnivores, depending on their species-specific ability to capture available prey, the decline of small mammal availability in plantations may modify the prey selection of mesocarnivores.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; DESIGNING PAYMENTS; LESSONS
AB Forest conservation policies could potentially become a centerpiece for climate change mitigation. Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To address human-wildlife conflicts and the related threat of extinction of the African lion, in 2003, the Maasailand Preservation Trust established a fund at the Mbirikani Group Ranch in southern Kenya to provide monetary compensation for livestock killed by wildlife. In this paper, the policy arrangement approach (PAA) is used to analyse this arrangement as a form of payment for environmental services (PES). Although there has been a considerable reduction in the number of lions killed, the analysis reveals several limitations of this arrangement, including three main side effects, namely it has initiated a process that is difficult to sustain or reverse, created a new cycle of dependence and widened the gap between different groups in the community. In conclusion, the drawbacks of this type of compensation fund must be addressed by combining such arrangements with other public and private policies and initiatives. Careful examination and comparison of different kinds of experiments with PES-like arrangements are required to further build understanding of the potential and different contributions of public and private, market-based initiatives in biodiversity governance.

AB Genetic diversity represents the evolutionary potential of a population, and allows insights into its demographic history and genetic structure; understanding these aspects of a population is crucial for conservation planning. The Neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis) is distributed from Argentina to Northern Mexico and is currently listed as 'data deficient' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). To contribute to conservation planning for the species, we used non-invasive sampling to obtain mtDNA control region sequences from 44 individuals from across Mexico. We examined country-wide genetic diversity and demographic history, as well as genetic structure among 3 regions: North Pacific, South Pacific, and Atlantic. Haplotypes identified in Mexico were combined with Central and South American haplotypes in order to examine phylogeographic patterns and identify evolutionary significant units (ESUs). Results show lower genetic diversity in Mexico compared to recent estimates for South American populations. Analyses of demographic history in Mexico indicated an expansion coinciding with climatic changes at the end of the Pleistocene. Genetic structure was high among North Pacific/South Pacific (F-ST = 0.48) and North Pacific/Atlantic (F-ST = 0.49), potentially due to mountain chains acting as barriers to female gene flow among these regions. On the other hand, we identified a potential corridor for gene flow among South Pacific and Atlantic. Phylogeographic analyses identified a distinct lineage distributed in North and Central America. We propose this represents a distinctive ESU which should be considered for separate conservation management.

AB Tree squirrels are important components of ecosystems but to understand their role, we must learn how squirrels select and use habitat. Tree squirrel species richness is highest in the tropics and, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, is also where the greatest number of data deficient species occurs. The Neotropical pygmy squirrel (Sciurillus pusillus) is one of these species. In 2009 and 2010, we conducted distance sampling to estimate population density, we measured vegetation variables to investigate forest characteristics that influence habitat selection at 3 different scales, and conducted observations to obtain knowledge about activity patterns and behavior of Neotropical pygmy squirrels in igapo forest in the Peruvian Amazon. Density of squirrels was 0.10 and 0.14 individuals/ha, respectively, for each year. Squirrel activity peaked at 0800 h, individuals were found mainly in the canopy and never on the ground, and frequency of squirrel behaviors differed by time and story level. Squirrels mainly used high and low restinga and areas that had more trees that were >= 30 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)/ha compared to random areas in our site in igapo forest. Squirrels used trees that were larger in DBH, taller, and had a larger live crown compared to random trees. Neotropical pygmy squirrels are associated with features related to mature forests.

AB Rationale: Improved understanding of the lung microbiome in HIV-infected individuals could lead to better strategies for diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis of HIV-associated pneumonias. Differences in the oral and lung microbiomes in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals are not well defined. Whether highly active antiretroviral therapy influences these microbiomes is unclear.
   Objectives: We determined whether oral and lung microbiomes differed in clinically healthy groups of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects.
   Methods: Participating sites in the Lung HIV Microbiome Project contributed bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing data from oral washes and bronchoalveolar lavages(BALs) obtained from HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 86), HIV-infected individuals who were treatment naive (n = 18), and HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (n = 38).
   Measurements and Main Results: Microbial populations differed in the oral washes among the subject groups (Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Rothia, and Atopobium), but there were no individual taxa that differed among the BALs. Comparison of oral washes and BALs demonstrated similar patterns from HIV-uninfected individuals and HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, with multiple taxa differing in abundance. The pattern observed from HIV-infected individuals who were treatment naive differed from the other two groups, with differences limited to Veillonella, Rothia, and Granulicatella. CD4 cell counts did not influence the oral or BAL microbiome in these relatively healthy, HIV-infected subjects.
   Conclusions: The overall similarity of the microbiomes in participants with and without HIV infection was unexpected, because HIV-infected individuals with relatively preserved CD4 cell counts are at higher risk for lower respiratory tract infections, indicating impaired local immune function.

AB Physiological concepts and tools can help us to understand why organisms and populations respond to habitat fragmentation in the way they do, and allow us to determine the mechanisms or individual characteristics underlying this differential sensitivity. Here, we examine food intake, relative medullary thickness and distribution/expression of water channel aquaporin-1 in three species of South American rodents that have been reported to have different levels of tolerance to habitat fragmentation (Akodon montensis, Oligoryzomys nigripes, and Euryoryzomys russatus), using a classic water deprivation experiment to assess their abilities to cope with water shortage. We believe the mechanisms underlying this differential sensitivity are related to the organisms' capacities to maintain water balance, and therefore the species more tolerant to habitat fragmentation (A. montensis and O. nigripes) should have a higher capacity to maintain water balance. We found that A. montensis and O. nigripes were more tolerant to water deprivation than E. russatus, and this difference appears to be unrelated to differences in food ingestion rate. O. nigripes showed the highest values for RMT, followed by A. montensis and E. russatus. However all species showed RMT values that were 2.2% to 14.1% below the lower prediction limit when compared to other rodents through allometric relationships. Water deprivation seems to trigger changes in the distribution of aquaporin-1, mostly for O. nigripes and E. russatus, which may contribute to water balance maintenance. Our data suggest that these intrinsic physiological differences among these species could provide a mechanism for their differential tolerance of habitat fragmentation.

AB To reveal whether hypocotyl sink activities are regulated by the aboveground parts, and whether physiology and morphology of source leaves are affected by the hypocotyl sink activities, we conducted grafting experiments using two Raphanus sativus varieties with different hypocotyl sink activities. Comet (C) and Leafy (L) varieties with high and low hypocotyl sink activities were reciprocally grafted and resultant plants were called by their scion and stock such as CC, LC, CL and LL. Growth, leaf mass per area (LMA), total non-structural carbohydrates (TNCs) and photosynthetic characteristics were compared among them. Comet hypocotyls in CC and LC grew well regardless of the scions, whereas Leafy hypocotyls in CL and LL did not. Relative growth rate was highest in LL and lowest in CC. Photosynthetic capacity was correlated with Rubisco (ribulose 15-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) content but unaffected by TNC. High C/N ratio and accumulation of TNC led to high LMA and structural LMA. These results showed that the hypocotyl sink activity was autonomously regulated by hypocotyl and that the down-regulation of photosynthesis was not induced by TNC. We conclude that the change in the sink activity alters whole-plant growth through the changes in both biomass allocation and leaf morphological characteristics in R. sativus.

AB Sex-biased dispersal and multiple mating may prevent or alleviate inbreeding and its outcome, inbreeding depression, but studies demonstrating this in the wild are scarce. Perennial ant colonies offer a unique system to investigate the relationships between natal dispersal behavior and inbreeding. Due to the sedentary life of ant colonies and lifetime sperm storage by queens, measures of dispersal distance and mating strategy are easier to obtain than in most taxa. We used a suite of molecular markers to infer the natal colonies of queens and males in a wild population of the ant Formica exsecta. Dispersal was male biased, with median male dispersal distances (approximate to 140 m) twice those of queens (approximate to 60 m). The results also showed that the population was inbred and that inbreeding avoidance behaviorssex-biased dispersal, queen dispersal distance, and multiple matingwere all ineffective in reducing homozygosity among colony workers. Queen homozygosity did not affect dispersal behavior, but more homozygous queens had lower colony-founding success and were more incestuously mated themselves, with potentially accumulating effects on colony fitness. We also provide independent evidence that dispersal is sex biased and show that our estimate corresponds well with dispersal estimates derived from population-genetic estimates.

AB Contrary to trends in many countries, forest cover in India has increased in recent times. Using a step wise time series cross section regression analysis on state-level panel data over 1990-2008, we examine two hypotheses to explain this increase: Forest cover is influenced by policies as well as the timber market. While appropriately controlling for economic and structural influences, we find that implementation of joint forest management is positively correlated with forest cover, implying that community participation is key to effective afforestation; and the timber and fuel wood market demands are positively correlated with forest cover, implying that demand-driven growth is conducive to forest growth, especially in presence of complementary policies. Our results suggest that policies, by supporting individual interests, can increase forest cover more effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Intermittent streams drain much of the world's tropical savannas, yet these vitally important stream ecosystems are among the most poorly understood components of tropical savannas. Fire is a widely used management tool in tropical savannas, but the effects of prescribed burning on savanna streams or riparian zones have not been investigated experimentally. This study was undertaken within a catchment-scale, replicated experiment to determine the effect of prescribed burning on savanna riparian zones in northern Australia. Regardless of position along the stream, burning had dramatic effects on the composition and structure of the riparian vegetation. Woody species richness and total abundance, the abundance of small- and medium-sized trees, total basal area, canopy cover, and the richness and cover of vines were reduced by burning, whereas grass cover was much higher in burned areas. Fire also reduced seed production of the dominant riparian eucalypt. This study adds greatly to our understanding of the effects of fire management on savanna riparian zones and demonstrates that they are far more fire sensitive than the surrounding savanna.

AB The extensive clearing of tropical forests throughout past decades has been partly assigned to increased trade in agricultural goods. Since further trade liberalisation can be expected, remaining rainforests are likely to face additional threats with negative implications for climate mitigation and the local environment. We apply a spatially explicit economic land-use model coupled to a biophysical vegetation model to examine linkages and associated policies between trade and tropical deforestation in the future. Results indicate that further trade liberalisation leads to an expansion of deforestation in Amazonia due to comparative advantages of agriculture in South America. Globally, between 30 and 60 million ha (5-10 %) of tropical rainforests would be cleared additionally, leading to 20-40 Gt additional emissions by 2050. By applying different forest protection policies, those values could be reduced substantially. Most effective would be the inclusion of avoided deforestation into a global emissions trading scheme. Carbon prices corresponding to the concentration target of 550 ppm would prevent deforestation after 2020. Investing in agricultural productivity reduces pressure on tropical forests without the necessity of direct protection. In general, additional trade-induced demand from developed and emerging countries should be compensated by international efforts to protect natural resources in tropical regions.

AB Functional traits play a key role in driving biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Here, we examine the geographical distributions of three key functional traits in New World palms (Arecaceae), an ecologically important plant group, and their relationships with current climate, soil and glacial-interglacial climate change. We combined range maps for the New World (N=541 palm species) with data on traits (leaf size, stem height and fruit size), representing the leaf-height-seed plant strategy scheme of Westoby, to estimate median trait values for palm species assemblages in 110x110-km grid cells. Spatial and non-spatial multi-predictor regressions were used with the Akaike Information Criterion to identify minimum adequate models. Present-day seasonality in temperature and precipitation played a major role in explaining geographical variation of all traits. Mean annual temperature and annual precipitation were additionally important for median leaf size. Glacial-interglacial temperature change was the most important predictor for median fruit size. Large-scale soil gradients played only a minor role overall. These results suggest that current climate (larger median trait values with increasing seasonality) and glacial-interglacial temperature change (larger median fruit size with increasing Quaternary temperature anomaly) are important drivers for functional trait distributions of New World palms.

AB In recent years the most advanced societies are beginning to rethink the principles applied in river management methods. This shift in the way we think about our river heritage is what is called in this paper: fluvial thought. This thinking implies overthrowing incomplete or erroneous ideas about what is a river and acknowledge it as a dynamic natural system. But the fluvial thought also invites discussion on how to conserve and restore rivers. In this sense, the fluvial geomorphology emerges like the basic science for designing conservation plans and restoration (geo-restoration). In fact, over the last two decades the interest in fluvial geomorphic processes has left the purely scientific level, becoming a line of applied research useful for territorial management.

AB A preponderance of evidence suggests humanity is causing a mass extinction event: the sixth mass extinction since the rise of complex life on Earth:This paper takes this empirical conclusion as given and asks a philosophical question: what is the meaning of the sixth mass extinction? How should we think about it, what should we do about it, and what does it tell us about humanity and our place in the world? Conservationists typically see mass extinction as an immense loss, as does most of the general public. But how best to characterize this loss is not immediately clear, and how we do so has important practical implications. This paper focuses on three common and plausible ways to think about the sixth mass extinction: as a loss of important resources (a mistake); as interspecies genocide (a crime); and as evidence that humanity is a cancer on the biosphere (as an inevitability). Considered together, these three approaches clarify the meaning of the sixth mass extinction and suggest how humanity ought to respond to it. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inappropriate soil management on the Chinese Loess plateau has induced significant soil erosion, and improvements were obtained with cover crops, whereas few studies were reported about orchard soil management. This study investigated effects of five soil management (SM) practices on surface runoff and soil water content, which were (i) full ground mulching with jujube branches (BM), (ii) strip tillage only (ST), (iii) jujube branch mulch + strip tillage (BMT), (iv) jujube branch mulch + strip white clover (Trifolium repens L.) cover (BMWC), and (v) no cover (NC) as a control. Six microplots (with a length of 200 cm, width of 80 cm and depth of 80 cm) were subjected to artificial rain during the growing seasons from 2011 to 2013. The variables about runoff and sediment evolution as well as soil water content were studied. Results showed that: (i) the time to runoff initiation was significantly shorter under NC than in other treatments, and the runoff plateau, total runoff volume and sediment yield were highest under NC Compared with NC, there was over 60% reduction in runoff and 80% reduction in sediment load under other treatments, (ii) runoff and sediment discharge increased linearly under NC before reaching the peak value, while it increased step-wise in the other treatments, (iii) soil water content (theta) and soil water storage increase (SWI) were significantly greater under BM than others; The 2-year (growing season of 2011 and 2012) mean theta and SWI were the lowest under NC, (iv) overall, BM increased soil water content, and decreased runoff and sediment yield, and thus could potentially solve water shortage and soil erosion problems in rainfed jujube orchards on Chinese Loess Plateau.

AB Understanding how biotic communities respond to landscape spatial structure is critically important for conservation management as natural habitats become increasingly fragmented. However, empirical studies of the effects of spatial structure on plant species richness have found inconsistent results, suggesting that more comprehensive approaches are needed. We asked how landscape structure affects total plant species richness and the richness of a guild of specialized plants in a multivariate context. We sampled herbaceous plant communities at 56 dolomite glades (insular, fire-adapted grasslands) across the Missouri Ozarks, USA, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the relative importance of landscape structure, soil resource availability, and fire history for plant communities. We found that landscape spatial structure, defined as the area-weighted proximity of glade habitat surrounding study sites (proximity index), had a significant effect on total plant species richness, but only after we controlled for environmental covariates. Richness of specialist species, but not generalists, was positively related to landscape spatial structure. Our results highlight that local environmental filters must be considered to understand the influence of landscape structure on communities and that unique species guilds may respond differently to landscape structure than the community as a whole. These findings suggest that both local environment and landscape context should be considered when developing management strategies for species of conservation concern in fragmented habitats.

AB Ants are functionally important organisms in most terrestrial ecosystems. Being ubiquitous and abundant, ant communities can affect the availability of resources to both primary and secondary consumers. As nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems, deposition of ant manure may augment the host plants' acquisition of nitrogen. In this study, we quantified the manure deposited by colonies of the Asian weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina. We developed a method to estimate the amount of manure deposited in host trees (Mangifera indica) based on the trail activity of O. smaragdina. The rate of manure deposition was on average 62.3 kg dw ha(-1) y(-1), of which 0.2 kg ha(-1) y(-1) was deposited as urea-N, a nutrient that may be absorbed directly through the leaves, and 1.9 kg ha(-1) y(-1) was deposited as total nitrogen. Furthermore, ants given access to sucrose solution increased their rate of manure deposition significantly, suggesting that nectaries and/or trophobionts may play a major role in the production of ant manure. This study reveals that O. smaragdina can supply a significant amount of nitrogen to their host plants. In light of their remarkable abundance, the manure deposition by ants may have a hitherto unappreciated impact on the allocation of nutrients within their ecosystem.

AB We studied the formation of heartwood in Erythrophleum fordii Oliv., an endangered rosewood species, by cross-section analysis on 52 stumps aged 28-57 years and arbitrarily sampled from natural forests in South China. Width and area of heartwood were positively correlated with age and xylem width (XW), and were independent of annual radial growth. The proportions of heartwood and sapwood areas were equal at about 40 years. The heartwood formation process was simulated by linear regression of age and XW.

AB Seedlings are vulnerable to many kinds of fatal abiotic and biotic agents, and examining the causes of seedling dynamics can help understand mechanisms of species coexistence. To disentangle the relative importance of neighborhood densities, habitat factors and phylogenetic relatedness on focal seedling survival, we monitored the survival of 5306 seedlings of 104 species > 15 months. We address the following questions: (i) How do neighborhood densities, habitat variables and phylogenetic relatedness affect seedling survival? What is the relative importance of conspecific densities, habitat variables and phylogenetic relatedness to seedling survival? (ii) Does the importance of the neighborhood densities, habitat variables and phylogenetic relatedness vary among growth forms, leaf habits or dispersal modes? Specially, does the conspecific negative density dependence inhibit tree and deciduous seedlings more compared with shrub and evergreen species? Does density dependence affect the wind and animal-dispersed species equally?
   We established 135 census stations to monitor seedling dynamics in a 25-ha subtropical forest plot in central China. Conspecific and heterospecific seedling density in the 1-m(2) seedling plot and adult basal area within a 20-m radius provided neighborhood density variables. Mean elevation, convexity and aspect of every 5- x 5-m grid with seedling plots were used to quantify habitat characteristics. We calculated the relative average phylodiversity between focal seedling and heterospecific neighbors to quantify the species relatedness in the neighborhood. Eight candidate generalized linear mixed models with binominal error distribution were used to compare the relative importance of these variables to seedling survival. Akaike's information criteria were used to identify the most parsimonious models.
   At the community level, both the neighborhood densities and phylogenetic relatedness were important to seedling survival. We found negative effects of increasing conspecific seedlings, which suggested the existence of species-specific density-dependent mortality. Phylodiversity of heterospecific neighbors was negatively related to survival of focal seedlings, indicating similar habitat preference shared among phylogenetically closely related species may drive seedling survival. The relative importance of neighborhood densities, habitat variables and phylogenetic relatedness varied among ecological guilds. Conspecific densities had significant negative effect for deciduous and wind-dispersed species, and marginally significant for tree seedlings > 10cm tall and animal-dispersed species. Habitat variables had limited effects on seedling survival, and only elevation was related to the survival of evergreen species in the best-fit model. We conclude that both negative density-dependent mortality and habitat preference reflected by the phylogenetic relatedness shape the species coexistence at seedling stage in this forest.

AB In the last 2 decades, deforestation had been an international issue due to its effect to climate change. This study describes a spatial modelling for predicting deforestation in Jambi Province. The main study objective was to find out the best spatial model for predicting deforestation by considering the spatial contexts. The main data used for the analysis were multitemporal Landsat TM images acquired in 1990, 2000, and 2011, the existing land cover maps published by the Ministry of Forestry, statistical data and ground truth. Prior to any other analyses, all districts within the study area were classified into 2 typologies, i.e. low-rate and high-rate deforestation districs on the basis of social and economic factors by using clustering approaches. The spatial models of deforestation were developed by using least-square methods. The study found that the spatial model of deforestation for low-rate deforestation area is Logit (Deforestation) = -2.7046 - 0.000397*JH90((distance from forest edge)) + 0.000002*JJ((distance from road)) - 0.000111*JKBN90((distance from estate crop edge)) + 0.000096 *JP90((distance from agricultural crop edge)) + 0.044227*PDK90 (population density) + 0.148187 *E-(elevation) - 0.131178*S-(slope); while for the high-speed deforestation area is Logit (Deforestation) = 9.1727 - 0.000788*JH90((distance from forest edge)) - 0.000065 *JJ((distance from road)) - 0.000091*JKBN90((distance from estate crop edge)) + 0.000005 *JP90((distance from agricultural crop edge)) - 0.070372*PDK90 ((population density)) + 11.268539*E-(elevation) - 1.495198*S-(slope). The low-rate and high-rate deforestation (population density) (elevation) (slope) models had relatively good ROC (Relative Operating Characteristics) values of 91.32% and 99.08%, respectively. The study concludes that the deforestation rate was significantly affected by accessibility (distance from forest edge, distance from estate crop edge, edge from agricultural land), biophysical condition (elevation and slope) as well as population density.

AB Biochar incorporation in agricultural soils has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy and has proved to substantially increase crop productivity via physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. The changes induced in soil properties are known to have a direct impact on soil ecosystem with consequences for soil biota community that, in turn, can influence biochar aging in soil. Despite several studies investigated in the interplay between biochar and soil microbiology, there is a clear lack of information on groups that live in the most superficial ground layers: soil meso and macro fauna. These groups are of great importance if we consider that biochar application should ideally be located in the soil's surface layer (0-30 cm). Our study is the first attempt to investigate the interactions between biochar soil amendments and aboveground soil macro-meso fauna in a field crop. This was made setting-up a randomized-block experiment on a processing tomato crop in northern Italy, using three different biochar types and periodically monitoring soil parameters and fauna abundances along the crop growing cycle in summer 2013. Results show that the impact of biochar application on soil fauna as a whole is small when compared to that of agricultural management, suggesting that this amendment does not have short-term ecological interferences. Nevertheless, ants exhibited variations in abundances and distribution connected to properties of amended soils such as temperature, pH and humidity, proving that they can be effectively used as a target group in the study of interactions between biochar and soil biota.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis states that tree diversity in tropical forests is maintained by specialist predators that are distance- or density-responsive (i.e. predators that reduce seed or seedling survival near adults of their hosts). Many empirical studies have investigated whether predators are distance-responsive; however, few studies have examined whether distance-responsiveness matters for how predators maintain tree diversity. Using a site-occupancy model, we show analytically that distance-responsive predators are actually less able to maintain diversity than specialist predators that are not distance-responsive. Generally, specialist predators maintain diversity because they become rare when their host's densities are low, reducing predation risk. However, if predators are distance-responsive, and most seeds cannot disperse away from these predators, then seed predation rates will remain high, even if predator density is low across the landscape. Consequently, a reduction in a host's population density may not lead to a significant reduction in seed and seedling predation. We show that habitat partitioning can cause recruitment to be highest near conspecific adults, even in the presence of distance-responsive predators, without any change in the effect that the predators have on coexistence (a result contrary to predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis). Rather, specialist predators and habitat partitioning have additive effects on species coexistence in our model, i.e., neither mechanism alters the effect of the other one. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technology have provided the tools to comprehensively and accurately characterize the microbial community in the respiratory tract in health and disease. The presence of commensal and pathogenic bacteria has been found to have important effects on the lung immune system. Until relatively recently, the lung has received less attention compared to other body sites in terms of microbiome characterization, and its study carries special technological difficulties related to obtaining reliable samples as compared to other body niches. Additionally, the complexity of the alveolar immune system, and its interactions with the lung microbiome, are only just beginning to be understood. Amidst this complexity sits Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), one of humanity's oldest nemeses and a significant public health concern, with millions of individuals infected with Mtb worldwide. The intricate interactions between Mtb, the lung microbiome, and the alveolar immune system are beginning to be understood, and it is increasingly apparent that improved treatment of Mtb will only come through deep understanding of the interplay between these three forces. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the lung microbiome, alveolar immunity, and the interaction of each with Mtb. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recomposition of deforested environments demands the acclimation of seedlings in nurseries. This process induces changes in physiological, anatomical, and morphological traits of plants, favouring their establishment after transplantation to the field. The present study aimed to verify the influence of full-sun acclimation on seedling hardiness. For the purpose, leaf gas-exchange, plant anatomical and morphological parameters of three tree species [Ceiba speciosa (A. St.-Hil.) Ravenna (Malvaceae), Croton floribundus Spreng. (Euphorbiaceae), and Cecropia pachystachya Trecul (Urticaceae)], which are used for reforestation in the Brazilian Atlantic biome, were evaluated. Seedlings were grown under 40% of total PPFD (shaded control) and under full sun (acclimated) for 168 days. The acclimation process induced a higher leaf production rate in C. speciosa and C. floribundus, whereas C. pachystachya seedlings replaced their leaves quickly, irrespective of the light conditions. The newly developed leaves of all three species presented a lower area and thicker palisade parenchyma, resulting in a reduced specific leaf area. The seedlings of C. speciosa and C. pachystachya showed increases in light-saturated net photosynthesis and transpiration rates, whereas water-use efficiency generally remained unchanged in all three species. The full-sun acclimated seedlings of C. pachystachya showed a reduced relative growth rate, lower height/stem diameter (H/D) and shoot to root dry mass ratios, characteristics that may result in greater physical resistance and ability for water and nutrient uptake to support the higher transpiratory demand under full sun. The reduction of the H/D ratio also occurred in the acclimated seedlings of C. speciosa. The seedlings of C. floribundus showed few changes during acclimation, but they did not seem to be affected by excessive light. In spite of the observed differences among the three species, all of them developed hardiness characteristics, mainly related to leaf anatomy, which should favour their establishment after transplantation to the field.

AB Land-use changes until the beginning of the 20th century made the terrestrial biosphere a net source of atmospheric carbon. Later, burning of fossil fuel surpassed land use changes as the major anthropogenic source of carbon. The terrestrial biosphere is at present suggested to be a carbon sink, but the distribution of excess anthropogenic carbon to the ocean and biosphere sinks is highly uncertain. Our modeling suggest that land-use changes can be tracked quite well by the carbon isotopes until mid-20th century, whereas burning of fossil fuel dominates the present-day observed changes in the isotope signature. The modeling indicates that the global carbon isotope fractionation has not changed significantly during the last 150 years. Furthermore, increased uptake of carbon by the ocean and increasing temperatures does not yet appear to have resulted in increasing the global gross ocean-to-atmosphere carbon fluxes. This may however change in the future when the excess carbon will emerge in the ocean upwelling zones, possibly reducing the net-uptake of carbon compared to the present-day ocean.

AB In intertidal communities, abiotic factors like wave exposure can directly and indirectly affect an organism's morphology, foraging behavior, available prey, prey choice, and predators. Although these factors may be transient, their influences persist to affect optimal foraging decisions of intermediate consumers and any accompanying behaviorally mediated trophic cascades. In this study, we documented the influence of wave action on prey available to the whelk Nucella lapillus at wave-exposed and wave-protected sites in the Gulf of Maine. We then determined if whelks from wave-exposed and wave-protected sites similarly reduced foraging in response to cues from the predatory invasive crab Carcinus maenas and if crab cues altered the whelks' preference for barnacles Semibalanus balanoides over mussels Mytilus edulis. We found that while mussels were more abundant at wave-exposed sites than at wave-protected sites, whelks from both habitats consistently preferred barnacles and did not switch prey in the presence of crab cues. Furthermore, the influence of crab cues on the whelks' foraging was not detected in the consumption of the less preferred prey (mussels), and in the consumption of barnacles, it was only consistently observed in whelks taken from wave-protected sites. We suggest that the whelks' preference for barnacles over mussels demonstrates an optimal foraging decision in which the whelks are maximizing energetic gain by choosing the less energetically demanding prey. While local populations of whelks may express different behavioral responses to predators due to abiotic conditions, our results suggest that the preference of N. lapillus for barnacles is not altered by predator cues, wave exposure, or prior diet.

AB Niche and neutral theories emphasize different processes contributing to the maintenance of species diversity. In this study, we calculated the local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) of every cell, using variation partitioning in combination with spatial distance and environmental variables of the 25-ha Badagongshan plot (BDGS), to determine the contribution of environmentally-related variation versus pure spatial variation. We used topography and soil characteristics as environmental variables, distance-based Moran's eigenvectors maps (dbMEM) to describe spatial relationships among cells and redundancy analysis (RDA) to apportion the variation in beta diversity into three components: pure environmental, spatially-structured environmental, and pure spatial. Results showed LCBD values were negatively related to number of common species and positively related to number of rare species. Environment and space jointly explained similar to 60% of the variation in species composition; soil variables alone explained 21.6%, slightly more than the topographic variables that explained 15.7%; topography and soil together explained 27%, slightly inferior to spatial variables that explained 34%. The BDGS forest was controlled both by the spatial and environmental variables, and the results were consistent across different life forms and life stages.

AB Predicting species presence and richness on islands is important for understanding the origins of communities and how likely it is that species will disperse and resist extinction. The equilibrium theory of island biogeography (ETIB) and, as a simple model of sampling abundances, the unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB), predict that in situations where mainland to island migration is high, species-abundance relationships explain the presence of taxa on islands. Thus, more abundant mainland species should have a higher probability of occurring on adjacent islands. In contrast to UNTB, if certain groups have traits that permit them to disperse to islands better than other taxa, then phylogeny may be more predictive of which taxa will occur on islands. Taking surveys of 54 island snake communities in the Eastern Nearctic along with mainland communities that have abundance data for each species, we use phylogenetic assembly methods and UNTB estimates to predict island communities. Species richness is predicted by island area, whereas turnover from the mainland to island communities is random with respect to phylogeny. Community structure appears to be ecologically neutral and abundance on the mainland is the best predictor of presence on islands. With regard to young and proximate islands, where allopatric or dadogenetic speciation is not a factor, we find that simple neutral models following UNTB and ETIB predict the structure of island communities.

AB Detailed information about interspecific spatial associations among tropical tree species is scarce, and hence the ecological importance of those associations may have been underestimated. However, they can play a role in community assembly and species diversity maintenance. This study investigated the spatial dependence between pairs of species. First, the spatial associations (spatial attraction and spatial repulsion) that arose between species were examined. Second, different sizes of trees were considered in order to evaluate whether the spatial relationships between species are constant or vary during the lifetime of individuals. Third, the consistency of those spatial associations with the species-habitat associations found in previous studies was assessed. Two different tropical ecosystems were investigated: a montane cloud forest and a lowland moist forest. The results showed that spatial associations among species exist, and these vary among life stages and species. The rarity of negative spatial interactions suggested that exclusive competition was not common in the studied forests. On the other hand, positive interactions were common, and the results of this study strongly suggested that habitat associations were not the only cause of spatial attraction among species. If this is true, habitat associations and density dependence are not the only mechanisms that explain species distribution and diversity; other ecological interactions, such as facilitation among species, may also play a role. These spatial associations could be important in the assembly of tropical tree communities and forest succession, and should be taken into account in future studies.

AB Accurate predictions of the impacts of future land use change on species of conservation concern can help to inform policy-makers and improve conservation measures. If predictions are spatially explicit, predicted consequences of likely land use changes could be accessible to land managers at a scale relevant to their working landscape. We introduce a method, based on open source software, which integrates habitat suitability modelling with scenario-building, and illustrate its use by investigating the effects of alternative land use change scenarios on landscape suitability for black grouse Tetrao tetrix. Expert opinion was used to construct five near-future (twenty years) scenarios for the 800 km(2) study site in upland Scotland. For each scenario, the cover of different land use types was altered by 5-30% from 20 random starting locations and changes in habitat suitability assessed by projecting a MaxEnt suitability model onto each simulated landscape. A scenario converting grazed land to moorland and open forestry was the most beneficial for black grouse, and 'increased grazing' (the opposite conversion) the most detrimental. Positioning of new landscape blocks was shown to be important in some situations. Increasing the area of open-canopy forestry caused a proportional decrease in suitability, but suitability gains for the 'reduced grazing' scenario were nonlinear. 'Scenario-led' landscape simulation models can be applied in assessments of the impacts of land use change both on individual species and also on diversity and community measures, or ecosystem services. A next step would be to include landscape configuration more explicitly in the simulation models, both to make them more realistic, and to examine the effects of habitat placement more thoroughly. In this example, the recommended policy would be incentives on grazing reduction to benefit black grouse.

AB By mapping translated metagenomic reads to a microbial metabolic network, we show that ruminal ecosystems that are rather dissimilar in their taxonomy can be considerably more similar at the metabolic network level. Using a new network bi-partition approach for linking the microbial network to a bovine metabolic network, we observe that these ruminal metabolic networks exhibit properties consistent with distinct metabolic communities producing similar outputs from common inputs. For instance, the closer in network space that a microbial reaction is to a reaction found in the host, the lower will be the variability of its enzyme copy number across hosts. Similarly, these microbial enzymes that are nearby to host nodes are also higher in copy number than are more distant enzymes. Collectively, these results demonstrate a widely expected pattern that, to our knowledge, has not been explicitly demonstrated in microbial communities: namely that there can exist different community metabolic networks that have the same metabolic inputs and outputs but differ in their internal structure.

AB Newly created forest edges have significant ecophysiological effects on bordering trees. We studied edge effects on microclimate and tree transpiration rates during wet and dry seasons along a 250 m transect spanning the edge of an unpaved road into an old growth tropical lowland forest in the Central Brazilian Amazon. Canopy openness decreased only minimal from the road (3.68%) towards the forest interior (1.69%). Vapor pressure deficit (measured at 2.2 m height above ground) was lower in the forest interior. The edge effect on microclimate penetrated deeper into the forest (>100 m) during the dry season compared to the wet season (<100 m). Overall, sap flux, and therefore transpiration rate, was 54% higher in trees adjacent to the road compared to forest interior trees. Higher transpiration rates at the forest edge can be explained by higher turbulences and energy exchange of the canopy boundary layer and by a shift in species composition to high water using secondary forest species 25 years after the road construction. Similar changes might be expected for other disturbances affecting local relative humidity and in situations that favor plants with water use traits differing from those found in the forest interior.

AB Some phytogeographical, zoogeographical and biogeographical regionalisations of the world are reviewed qualitatively. A biogeographical regionalisation attempting some consensus is proposed, recognising the following three kingdoms and nine regions: Holarctic kingdom (Nearctic and Palearctic regions), Holotropical kingdom (Neotropical, Ethiopian and Oriental regions) and Austral kingdom (Cape, Andean, Australian and Antarctic regions). Additionally, the following five transition zones are recognised: Mexican (Nearctic-Neotropical transition), Saharo-Arabian (Palearctic-Ethiopian transition), Chinese (Palearctic-Oriental transition), Indo-Malayan (Oriental-Australian transition) and South American (Neotropical-Andean transition).

AB Strangler trees germinate and grow on other trees, eventually enveloping and potentially even girdling their hosts. This allows them to mitigate fitness costs otherwise incurred by germinating and competing with other trees on the forest floor, as well as minimize risks associated with host tree-fall. If stranglers can themselves host other strangler trees, they may not even seem to need non-stranglers to persist. Yet despite their high fitness potential, strangler trees neither dominate the communities in which they occur nor is the strategy particularly common outside of figs (genus Ficus). Here we analyze how dynamic interactions between strangling and non-strangling trees can shape the adaptive landscape for strangling mutants and mutant trees that have lost the ability to strangle. We find a threshold which strangler germination rates must exceed for selection to favor the evolution of strangling, regardless of how effectively hemiepiphytic stranglers may subsequently replace their hosts. This condition describes the magnitude of the phenotypic displacement in the ability to germinate on other trees necessary for invasion by a mutant tree that could potentially strangle its host following establishment as an epiphyte. We show how the relative abilities of strangling and non-strangling trees to occupy empty sites can govern whether strangling is an evolutionarily stable strategy, and obtain the conditions for strangler coexistence with non-stranglers. We then elucidate when the evolution of strangling can disrupt stable coexistence between commensal epiphytic ancestors and their non-strangling host trees. This allows us to highlight parallels between the invasion fitness of strangler trees arising from commensalist ancestors, and cases where strangling can arise in concert with the evolution of hemiepiphytism among free-standing ancestors. Finally, we discuss how our results can inform the evolutionary ecology of antagonistic interactions more generally. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background
   Climate change scenarios that include precipitation shifts and nitrogen (N) deposition are impacting carbon (C) budgets in arid ecosystems. Roots constitute an important part of the C cycle, but it is still unclear which factors control root mass loss and nutrient release in arid lands.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Litterbags were used to investigate the decomposition rate and nutrient dynamics in root litter with water and N-addition treatments in the Gurbantunggut Desert in China. Water and N addition had no significant effect on root mass loss and the N and phosphorus content of litter residue. The loss of root litter and nutrient releases were strongly controlled by the initial lignin content and the lignin: N ratio, as evidenced by the negative correlations between decomposition rate and litter lignin content and the lignin: N ratio. Fine roots of Seriphidium santolinum (with higher initial lignin content) had a slower decomposition rate in comparison to coarse roots.
   Conclusion/Significance
   Results from this study indicate that small and temporary changes in rainfall and N deposition do not affect root decomposition patterns in the Gurbantunggut Desert. Root decomposition rates were significantly different between species, and also between fine and coarse roots, and were determined by carbon components, especially lignin content, suggesting that root litter quality may be the primary driver of belowground carbon turnover.

AB The lemurs of Madagascar are among the most threatened mammalian taxa in the world, with habitat loss due to shifting cultivation and timber harvest heavily contributing to their precarious state. Deforestation often leads to fragmentation, resulting in mixed-habitat matrices throughout a landscape where disturbed areas are prone to invasion by exotic plants. Our study site, the Mandena littoral forest (southeast Madagascar), is a matrix of littoral forest, littoral swamp, and Melaleuca swamp habitats. Here, Melaleuca quinquenervia has invaded the wetland ecosystem, creating a mono-dominant habitat that currently provides the only potential habitat corridor between forest fragments. We sought to understand the role of this invasive Melaleuca swamp on the behavioral ecology of a threatened, small-bodied folivore, the southern bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis). We collected botanical and behavioral data on four groups of H. meridionalis between January and December 2013. Our results confirm Melaleuca swamp as an important part of their home range: while lemurs seasonally limited activities to certain habitats, all groups were capable of utilizing this invasive habitat for feeding and resting. Furthermore, the fact that Hapalemur use an invasive plant species as a dispersal corridor increases our knowledge of their ecological flexibility, and may be useful in the conservation management of remaining threatened populations.

AB We examined tree-soil habitat associations in lowland forest communities at Paracou, French Guiana. We analyzed a large dataset assembling six permanent plots totaling 37.5 ha, in which extensive LIDAR-derived topographical data and soil chemical and physical data have been integrated with precise botanical determinations. Map of relative elevation from the nearest stream summarized both soil fertility and hydromorphic characteristics, with seasonally inundated bottomlands having higher soil phosphate content and base saturation, and plateaus having higher soil carbon, nitrogen and aluminum contents. We employed a statistical test of correlations between tree species density and environmental maps, by generating Monte Carlo simulations of random raster images that preserve auto-correlation of the original maps. Nearly three fourths of the 94 taxa with at least one stem per ha showed a significant correlation between tree density and relative elevation, revealing contrasted species-habitat associations in term of abundance, with seasonally inundated bottomlands (24.5% of species) and well-drained plateaus (48.9% of species). We also observed species preferences for environments with or without steep slopes (13.8% and 10.6%, respectively). We observed that closely-related species were frequently associated with different soil habitats in this region (70% of the 14 genera with congeneric species that have a significant association test) suggesting species-habitat associations have arisen multiple times in this tree community. We also tested if species with similar habitat preferences shared functional strategies. We found that seasonally inundated forest specialists tended to have smaller stature (maximum diameter) than species found on plateaus. Our results underline the importance of tree-soil habitat associations in structuring diverse communities at fine spatial scales and suggest that additional studies are needed to disentangle community assembly mechanisms related to dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering from species-habitat associations. Moreover, they provide a framework to generalize across tropical forest sites.

AB Percentage maps (%) of forest cover derived from the annual product MOD44B were compared with the annual deforestation data from PRODES. PRODES data were used to calibrate the MOD44B (sub-pixel-level representation of surface vegetation cover estimates globally) annual images with the aim of evaluating the annual characterization of the deforestation dynamics and forest regeneration in the municipality of Bujari - Acre, Brazil, from 2000 to 2010. The percentage rates from MODIS were divided into forest cover categories (forested and deforested areas) by means of the Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test used in each category. The results were satisfactory when compared with PRODES. The analysis of MOD44B product in the municipality, during the years 2001, 2004 and 2009, shows that there was an increase of the pixel frequency in the "Extremely High" category, which indicates regeneration of the area in the municipality of Bujari. Validations in situ should be done primarily to the regenerate areas.

AB Global environmental changes and human activity influence wildland fires worldwide, but the relative importance of the individual factors varies regionally and their interplay can be difficult to disentangle. Here we evaluate projected future changes in burned area at the European and sub-European scale, and we investigate uncertainties in the relative importance of the determining factors. We simulated future burned area with LPJ-GUESS-SIMFIRE, a patch-dynamic global vegetation model with a semiempirical fire model, and LPJmL-SPITFIRE, a dynamic global vegetation model with a process-based fire model. Applying a range of future projections that combine different scenarios for climate changes, enhanced CO2 concentrations, and population growth, we investigated the individual and combined effects of these drivers on the total area and regions affected by fire in the 21st century. The two models differed notably with respect to the dominating drivers and underlying processes. Fire-vegetation interactions and socioeconomic effects emerged as important uncertainties for future burned area in some European regions. Burned area of eastern Europe increased in both models, pointing at an emerging new fire-prone region that should gain further attention for future fire management.

AB Breaking the core assumption of ecological equivalence in Hubbell's "neutral theory of biodiversity" requires a theory of species differences. In one framework for characterizing differences between competing species, non-neutral interactions are said to involve both niche differences, which promote stable coexistence, and relative fitness differences, which promote competitive exclusion. We include both in a stochastic community model in order to determine if relative fitness differences compensate for changes in community structure and dynamics induced by niche differences, possibly explaining neutral theory's apparent success. We show that species abundance distributions are sensitive to both niche and relative fitness differences, but that certain combinations of differences result in abundance distributions that are indistinguishable from the neutral case. In contrast, the distribution of species' lifetimes, or the time between speciation and extinction, differs under all combinations of niche and relative fitness differences. The results from our model experiment are inconsistent with the hypothesis of "emergent neutrality" and support instead a hypothesis that relative fitness differences counteract effects of niche differences on distributions of abundance. However, an even more developed theory of interspecific variation appears necessary to explain the diversity and structure of non-neutral communities.

AB The impacts of climate change on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes are not fully understood, especially in savanna ecosystems. This study aimed to assess the potential impacts of climate change in soil C and N pools in the savannas.
   Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were quantified at four sites with consistent sandy soils along a precipitation gradient in the southern Africa savannas. Soils were sampled at 240 locations at each site at four depths: 10, 30, 70 and 120 cm.
   The driest site and the wettest site had the SOC content of 1,397 g m(-2) and 1,982 g m(-2), respectively. Mean C:N ratio was highest (26 +/- 6) at the wettest site and lowest at the next-wettest (15 +/- 2). Our results support the hypothesis of low nitrogen fixation in the area, particularly in the dry southern region. We found a significant spatial relationship between SOC/TN content and tree height or tree mass only in the driest. The Botswana Kalahari (BK) soil is estimated to contain about 0.99 x 10(15) g C belowground of which about 92 % is SOC. Furthermore, under IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 carbon emission scenarios, total belowground C is predicted to drop to 0.92 and 0.86 x 10(15) g C, respectively by the end of the century.
   Our results provide insight into soil C stocks in Kalahari savannas and suggest that savannas may be bigger stores of organic C than currently thought. The current climate change projections together with field measurements suggest that C storage in these savannas may decrease in the future as the region warms and dries into the next century.

AB Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) are ancient anthropogenic soils distributed in the Amazon basin. They are characterized by high nutrients such as phosphorus, calcium, potassium and nitrogen. We studied the effect of ADE on growth, morphology and physiology of 17 tree species from a Bolivian tropical moist forest.
   We conducted a greenhouse experiment where seedlings were grown for 2-4 months on ADE and non-ADE. We evaluated soil nutrient concentrations, seedling growth, leaf and root functional traits, and leaf nutrient concentrations.
   Soil type affected 10 out of 24 evaluated seedling traits. Seedlings did not invest more in roots in non-ADE, but they invested in leaves and leaf area in ADE, although this did not lead to faster growth rate. Species responded differently to soil Ca increment; some species seemed to suffer from Ca toxicity as indicated by low survival, others from nutrient imbalance, whereas other species increased their leaf calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen concentration in ADE. Only for this latter group of nutrient accumulators, there was a positive interspecific relationship between leaf Ca and seedling growth rates.
   ADE did not lead to increased seedling growth. The ability of plants to colonize patches of ADE might depend on plant responses to increased soil Ca and their capacity to regulate internal tissue calcium to balance nutrition.

AB The Middle America is located in the Nearctic-Neotropical boundary. The combination of temperate and tropical biota of these two biogeographic regions, plus an area of biotic overlap propitiates unusually high species diversity and endemism. We present the first general assessment based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species that provides evidence of widespread decline in the conservation status of land mammals from southern U.S.A. to Panama. One in every three species considered in our study (n = 273) is classified as threatened, and the rate of biodiversity loss increased 0.64% between 2008 and 2012. Endangered species of the Middle America represents 11.8% of the global endangered mammal species, and 7.9% of the threatened species. Habitat loss and the introduction of alien species are the major threats; however, the relative impact of these threats varies among habitats. For continental species, habitat loss is prevalent, while for insular species the introduction of alien species has devastating effects. Our results suggest that if no integral multi-species conservation actions are applied in the short-term, more than 20% of the extant mammal species in the region could become extinct in the near future (10-50 years).

AB The forest in the Central Argentine Chaco has been dramatically fragmented and persists only as isolated patches in an agricultural matrix. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fragmentation on total density, recruitment, and size-class structure of its dominant tree species, a key issue, although little explored, for forest conservation in the region. We particularly analyzed the effects of fragment size and forest cover at landscape level on seven of the most important tree species of the forest. Our results suggest that forest cover at landscape level is more important than fragment size to explain the population patterns of the main tree species. Fragment size was relevant in only one species, Cordia americana, whereas forest cover resulted relevant in five species. The size-class structure of Schinopsis balansae, one of the dominant species of the upper stratum, appeared to be affected in landscapes with less forest cover, showing lower densities of the smaller classes. Our results show that for the conservation of the forest it would be important to increase their protection degree against the expansion of agriculture, attempting to preserve as much of the forest as possible, to promote the forest cover at landscape level and give relevance even to the smallest fragments.

AB Manipulative field experiments provide a window into the complexity of nature. Yet there is concern that we lack resolution by conducting experiments on a scale that is too small and short to include the relevant complexity of the study system. We addressed this issue by asking how and why the scale (local and global spatial extent, spatial grain, duration) and complexity (number of species, factors, treatment combinations) of experiments performed on marine hard substrata (rocky intertidal, RI; coral reef, CR; rocky subtidal, RS; mangrove root, MR) has changed by assessing 311 total experiments published since 1961 in Ecology and Ecological Monographs and since 1967 in Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. We show that the local spatial extent and all metrics of complexity increased as a positive, log-linear function of time. In contrast, the size of experimental units (spatial grain) decreased with time. Quantile regression analysis revealed that these trends are largely driven by changes in the upper bounds of experimental scale and complexity; most studies are still relatively simple in design and conducted over small areas. A structural equation model (SEM) incorporated the direct and indirect effects of six metrics indicating that the complexity of field experiments has increased both as a direct effect of time and because experiments have become smaller in spatial grain. The SEM also showed longer experiments tended to be more complex. We show striking habitat differences, as subtidal experiments (CR, RS) involved more species and were carried out on the largest global spatial scales. RI experiments were the longest. Future prospects to incorporate more of the complexity of nature into field experiments include site replication, as only 34.7% of all experiments were conducted at more than one site, open experimental designs monitored by technology, and integrating experimental manipulations with long-term monitoring to achieve mechanistic insight across scales relevant to human alteration of the biosphere. The increasing resolution of remote sensing also creates opportunities to track experiment-driven changes in community structure across large scales. We suggest applying these methods to a wider class of problems to enhance our understanding of marine communities and ecosystems.

AB Tropical rainforests are species-rich, complex ecosystems. They are increasingly being negatively affected by anthropogenic activity, which is rapidly and unpredictably altering their structure and complexity. These changes in habitat state may expose tropical animals to novel and unpredictable conditions, potentially increasing their extinction risk. However, an animal's ability to cope with environmental change may be linked to its personality. While numerous studies have investigated environmental influences on animal personalities, few are focused on tropical species. In this review, we consider how behavioural syndromes in tropical species might facilitate coping under, and adapting to, increasing disturbance. Given the complexity of tropical rainforests, we first discuss how habitat complexity influences personality traits and physiological stress in general. We then explore the ecological and evolutionary implications of personality in the tropics in the context of behavioural flexibility, range expansion and speciation. Finally, we discuss the impact that anthropogenic environmental change may have on the ecological integrity of tropical rainforests, positing scenarios for species persistence. Maintaining tropical rainforest complexity is crucial for driving behavioural flexibility and personality type, both of which are likely to be key factors facilitating long term persistence in disturbed habitats.

AB Tropical forest understory birds are declining globally for unknown reasons, indicating an urgent need to understand the causes. We review and synthesize studies investigating causes of these declines focusing on the Sarapiqui region of the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica. We discuss evidence for five potential causes of population declines motivated by current understanding of the effects of fragmentation, disturbance of remnant forests, climate change, and their possible interactions: (1) reduced forest area increases the probability of stochastic extirpation; (2) reduced connectivity among forest patches decreases population rescue opportunities; (3) degradation of preferred microhabitats due to, for example, abundant large mammals, jeopardizes specialized birds' foraging opportunities; (4) high nest predation rates reduce productivity below replacement levels; and (5) changes in macro- and microclimate increase energetic demands and reduce survival. Our review documents how tropical forest loss and degradation likely Impact understory birds through a variety of direct, indirect, and interrelated causes spanning multiple temporal and spatial scales and levels of biological organization. We propose that the processes affecting understory birds in the Sarapiqui region may be broadly representative of threats experienced by rainforest understory birds pantropically. Effective conservation will require consideration of such diverse and interacting factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying the ecological and life-history traits that render species vulnerable to fragmentation is an important prerequisite for the development of effective conservation strategies to minimize future biodiversity losses. When determining how species traits influence vulnerability to fragmentation, however, several important confounding factors such as detectability and synergistic effects among traits are rarely considered. In this study, after controlling for these methodological shortcomings, we determined how species traits influenced fragmentation vulnerability using bird data collected from islands created by the inundation of the Thousand Island Lake, China. We obtained eight species traits from field surveys and from the literature: natural abundance, geographical range size, habitat specificity, body size, trophic level, mobility, fecundity, and nest type. After phylogenetic correction, these traits were used separately and in combination to assess their associations with the index of fragmentation vulnerability, the proportion of islands occupied. Inclusion of detectability in analysis resulted in considerable increases in overall island occupancy for all species in general and for cryptic species in particular. Accounting for detectability altered the rank of best models and thus influenced the identification of the relationships between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. We found synergistic interactions between natural abundance and habitat specificity. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating detectability and synergistic effects among traits into future studies. From a conservation perspective, our results suggest that we should give priority conservation efforts to rare species with low natural abundance and high habitat specificity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding causes of variation in multispecies assemblages along spatial environmental gradients is a long-standing research topic in ecology and biogeography. Ecological networks comprising interacting species of plants and pollinators are particularly suitable for testing effects of environmental gradients on the functional structure and specialization in multispecies assemblages. In this study, we investigated patterns in functional assemblage structure and specialization of hummingbirds at the individual and species level along a tropical elevational gradient. We mist-netted hummingbirds at three elevations in Costa Rica in seven temporally distinct sampling periods and used the pollen carried by hummingbird individuals to construct plant-hummingbird networks at each elevation. We measured four functional traits of hummingbird species and quantified different metrics of functional community structure. We tested the effect of elevation on functional metrics of hummingbird assemblages and specialization within the networks, employing the variability across sampling periods and hummingbird species to compare the respective metrics among elevations. Hummingbird species and individuals were more specialized at low and mid elevations than at the highest elevation. This pattern corresponded to a more even and over-dispersed assemblage structure at the lower elevations throughout the year and suggests a high level of floral resource partitioning in functionally diversified communities. In contrast, an uneven and clustered functional structure of the highland assemblage across all sampling periods suggests that this assemblage was structured by environmental filtering and by niche expansion of hummingbird individuals and species at this elevation. We conclude that high degrees of specialization on specific floral resources might be crucial for the coexistence of hummingbird species in diversified lowland communities. Spatial variation in animal resource use may be an important crucial driver of spatial patterns in the functional structure of diversified species assemblages also in other types of ecological networks.

AB Questions: The loss and degradation of tropical forests is having severe impacts on the dynamics of understorey plant communities. Understanding these impacts requires efficient ways to measure vegetation change over broad spatial and temporal scales. Leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass are preferred quantitative measures of variation in plant community structure. However, their accurate measurement requires destructive sampling, which can be impractical or inappropriate. Here we test whether semi-quantitative assessment of Braun-Blanquet vegetation cover scores is a reliable proxy for direct quantitative measures of LAI and above-ground biomass of differing plant growth forms (PGF) within tropical forests.
   Location: Six hundred square kilometre area of tropical lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia.
   Methods: We sampled understorey rain forest plant communities across a disturbance gradient in 2 x 2 m plots at 301 locations. We used a modified Braun-Blanquet scale to estimate plant cover, destructively harvested all live above-ground biomass up to a height of 2 m, calculated the above-ground biomass of each species from separately processed stem and leaf fractions in each plot, and then calculated LAI using reference measures of specific leaf area for each species. For each of nine PGFs, we regressed LAI and biomass against the nine-point Braun-Blanquet ordinal transform scale (OTS) using linear mixed effects models.
   Results: We found a simple, uniform logarithmic scaling of LAI with increasing Braun-Blanquet cover classes that was consistent across most PGFs, and with slope estimates close to 1.0. By contrast, no simple scaling relationship was found for above-ground biomass, with most PGFs exhibiting an asymptotic relationship in which the Braun-Blanquet estimates across high cover scores provided almost no resolution of observed variation in empirical biomass measures.
   Conclusions: We found that the Braun-Blanquet OTS provides a remarkably simple and accurate logarithmic scaling of LAI, but care should be taken in applying scaling rules uniformly across PGFs. In contrast, the Braun-Blanquet OTS shows a more complex relationship with plant above-ground biomass and we caution against its unconditional use for biomass estimation. The findings of this study should be broadly applicable to other ecosystems due to the heterogeneity of plant communities included in this work.

AB Light is of primary importance in structuring tropical tree communities. Light exposure at seedling and adult stages has been used to characterize the ecological profile of tropical trees, with many implications in forest management and restoration ecology. Most shade-tolerance classification systems have been proposed based on empirical observations in a specific area and thus result in contradictions among categories assigned to a given species. In this study, we aimed to quantify the light requirements for seedling growth of a Central African timber tree, Lophira alata (Ochnaceae), taking into account effects of population origin. In two controlled experiments: a light response experiment and a comparative population experiment, conducted in southwestern Cameroon, using seeds collected from four populations (three from Cameroon and one from Gabon), we examined the quantitative responses to irradiance of seedlings. After 2years, mortality was very low (<3%), even in extremely low irradiance. Growth and biomass allocation patterns varied in response to light, with intermediate irradiance (24-43%) providing optimal conditions. Light response differed between populations. The Boumba population in the northeastern edge of the species' distribution exhibited the highest light requirements, suggesting a local adaptation. As a result of positive growth at low irradiance and maximum growth at intermediate irradiance, we concluded that L. alata exhibits characteristics of both non-pioneer and pioneer species. Implications of our results to propose an objective way to assign the light requirement for tropical tree species are discussed.

ID SECONDARY FORESTS; FRAGMENTS; MOVEMENT
AB Primary tropical rain forests are being rapidly perforated with new edges via roads, logging, and pastures, and vast areas of secondary forest accumulate following abandonment of agricultural lands. To determine how insectivorous Amazonian understory birds respond to edges between primary rain forest and three age classes of secondary forest, we radio-tracked two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, N=17; Xiphorhynchus pardalotus, N=18) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius colma, N=19). We modeled species-specific response to distance to forest edge (a continuous variable) based on observations at varying distances from the primary-secondary forest interface. All species avoided 8-14-yr-old secondary forest. Glyphorynchus spirurus and F.colma mostly remained within primary forest <100m from the young edge. Young F.colma rarely penetrated >100m into secondary forest 27-31yr old. Young Formicarius colma and most G.spirurus showed a unimodal response to 8-14-yr-old secondary forest, with relative activity concentrated just inside primary forest. After land abandonment, G.spirurus was the first to recover to the point where there was no detectable edge response (after 11-14yr), whereas X.pardalotus was intermediate (15-20yr), and F. colma last (28-30yr +). Given the relatively quick recovery by our woodcreeper species, new legislation on protection of secondary forests >20-yr old in Brazil's Para state may represent a new opportunity for conservation and management; however, secondary forest must mature to at least 30yr before the full compliment of rain forest-dependent species can use secondary forest without adverse edge effects.

AB Tropical rain forest understory insectivorous birds are declining, even in large forest reserves, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Abundant large mammals can reshape forest structure, which degrades foraging microhabitat. We used six sites in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama with varying collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) density to test three linked hypotheses: (1) locally declining understory insectivores forage preferentially in liana tangles; (2) vine and liana density, cover, and frequency of dense tangles are lower in the presence of abundant collared peccaries; and consequently (3) abundant collared peccaries are associated with reduced understory insectivorous bird abundance. Three insectivores that declined at La Selva preferentially foraged in liana tangles: Checker-throated Antwren (Epinecrophylla fulviventris), Dot-winged Antwren (Microrhopias quixensis), and Ruddy-tailed Flycatcher (Terenotriccus erythrurus). Vine density, liana cover, liana tangle frequency, and forest cover were lower in the presence of collared peccaries relative to experimental mammal exclosures, with the greatest differences at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Across sites, five of seven vine and liana measures showed negative, curvilinear relationships with peccary densities. Vine and liana measures peaked at sites with intermediate peccary density, and were low at La Selva. Structural equation models suggest negative indirect effects of the collared peccaries on focal bird densities, mediated by vine and liana density, cover, or tangle frequency. Forest area and rainfall affected both lianas and birds, but collared peccaries also contributed to the reduced abundance of understory insectivores. Indirect effects such as that suggested here may occur even in large, protected forest reserves where large mammal communities are changing.

AB Despite the high proportion of secondary forests in the tropics, their conservation value remains poorly understood, particularly with regard to animals. Most theoretical studies of succession have focused on plants, linking life history trade-offs to well-known patterns of community change. However, the same trade-offs proposed for plants should apply to animals, and indeed, animal studies show a change in community dominance from habitat generalist to forest specialist species during succession. Focusing on the diverse terrestrial small mammals of the endangered Atlantic Forest, we assessed which ecological drivers (habitat structure and food availability) affect community changes during succession. If the change in community dominance is driven by trade-offs between productivity and efficiency, it should be mainly associated with a decrease in food availability. As expected, from younger to older forest, habitat generalists decreased in richness and total abundance, concurrent with a decrease in arthropod biomass. By contrast, the increase in richness and total abundance of forest specialists was not clearly supported by the data; however, this group was not affected by food availability. These results are congruent with a trade-off between competitive ability and ability to use abundant resources, and indicate that the major community change during succession involves habitat generalists. Secondary forests may thus be valuable for conservation, at least where habitat loss and fragmentation are not high, and old growth forest is available.

AB Our understanding of the principal controls on litter decomposition is critical for our capacity to predict how global changes will impact terrestrial ecosystems. Although climate, litter quality and soil organisms clearly modulate carbon (C) and nutrient turnover, land-use change affecting plant species composition and structure can alter the relative importance of such controls. We took advantage of prior land-use changes of intentional planting of exotic forest species along a broad precipitation gradient [250-2200mm mean annual precipitation (MAP)] in Patagonia, South America, where we established five paired sites in natural vegetation and adjacent 35-year-old pine plantations. We explored direct and interactive effects of precipitation and plant community structure on litter decomposition with insitu decomposition, common litters and reciprocal transplants, in addition to an evaluation of microenvironmental changes. Surface litter decomposition in natural vegetation (NV) was similar in all sites along the gradient, independent of litter quality, MAP or soil characteristics, while mass loss demonstrated a significant positive linear relationship with MAP in pine plantations (PP). Decomposition of common litters in PP was markedly reduced with respect to NV, which was > 50% faster at the arid extreme of the gradient. C:N ratios predicted decomposition only in PP, and differences in decomposition were highly correlated with impacts of vegetative cover on incident solar radiation.Synthesis. Concurrent changes in plant cover in NV with increasing MAP resulted in reduced incident solar radiation at the soil surface and decreased the relative importance of photodegradation as a control on surface mass loss. These changes eclipsed direct effects of water availability, litter quality and soil nutrients. In contrast, increased shade and recalcitrant litter with afforestation in PP sites combined such that photodegradation was entirely eliminated as a control and biotic decomposition was much reduced. While afforestation projects are promoted as a strategy to mitigate increased atmospheric carbon dioxide due to human activity, our results highlight that primary controls of litter decomposition were substantially altered with unexpected consequences for the C balance of these ecosystems.

AB In a rapidly changing world, characterized by novel ecological scenarios and fluctuating socioeconomic and ecological demands, ecological restoration practices must constantly adapt to emerging issues and circumstances. Restoration ecology, the scientific discipline that informs ecological restoration, must therefore evolve and expand its focus to address this need. To describe and evaluate the evolution of research pertaining to the ecological restoration of forests within the field of forestry, we performed a review of all 29,766 abstracts published over the last 35 years (1980-2014) in 15 leading forestry journals using automated content analysis, a machine learning-based tool for automated review of large volumes of literature ("big literature"). We found not only a 50-fold increase in the prominence of restoration ecology in forestry literature from 2000 to 2013, but also an evolution in the focus of forest restoration research. This evolution is likely in response to emerging topics and issues affecting forest restoration, such as exotic species, altered disturbance regimes, degraded tropical forests, and ecosystem services. Our results also revealed a pattern of "cyclic development," in which research in the 1990s was focused on constructing theoretical frameworks, in the 2000s research appeared to be concentrated on restoration practices and programs, while in the 2010s research revisited established theoretical frameworks, possibly indicating a conceptual expansion. Our study highlighted gaps in research on important topics and emerging challenges, such as global climate change, genetic considerations, landscape-level factors, and restoring degraded systems, thus pointing the way for new and necessary research directions.

AB Although tree growth in southern African savannas is correlated with rainfall in the wet season, some studies have shown that tree growth is controlled more by rainfall in the dry season. If more rainfall occurred in the dry season in future climates, it would affect the growth of savanna trees, especially saplings that have shallower roots which limit access to subsoil water during the dry season when leaf flush and shoot extension occur. Recent paleobotanical evidence has revealed that there was relatively more precipitation in the dry season in eastern Africa in the Eocene than under the current climate. Saplings therefore can be expected to respond more to water addition during the dry season than mature trees that have more stored water and deeper roots that access subsoil water. Accordingly, I hypothesized that irrigation in the dry season should (i) advance the onset of the growing season, (ii) increase growth rates and (iii) alter the growth responses of saplings to climate factors. To test these hypotheses saplings of five savanna woody species were irrigated during the hot-dry season at a site in central Zambia and their monthly and annual growth rates compared to those of conspecifics growing under control conditions. Although the responses among the species were variable, all irrigated saplings had significantly higher monthly and annual growth rates than control plants. In addition, dry season watering significantly altered the climatic determinants of sapling growth by either strengthening the role of the same climatic factors that were important under control conditions or displacing them altogether. In conclusion, more precipitation during the hot-dry season is likely to have significant positive effects on sapling growth and consequently reduce the sapling-tree transition periods and promote future tree population recruitment in some southern African savanna tree species.

AB The spatial distribution of species in forest ecosystems involves the underlying ecological processes or mechanisms of population and community structure, as well as forest dynamics. Because the relative importance of these factors can shift across life history stages, assessment of local population and community structures in the context of life history stages is essential for understanding forest dynamics. In this study, we investigated the changes in the spatial patterns of seed dispersal as well as seedling and sapling recruitment for Castanopsis fargesii, a dominant tree species in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in China. We found notably aggregated spatial patterns for C. fargesii seeds during the seed dispersal. A majority of seeds and newly germinated seedlings aggregated under adult tree canopies, suggesting a decreased efficiency in secondary dispersal for C. fargesii within this evergreen broad-leaved forest. During the later stages of life history (i.e., seedling and sapling stages), the spatial distribution of C. fargesii getting segregated. This is caused by a negative density dependence mechanism in seedling recruitment, rather than by spatial dispersion due to secondary dispersal. By incorporating the patterns and processes across the life history stages of dominant species of evergreen broad-leaved forests, we can add specific details in developing methods of stage-based in situ forest management and conservation frameworks.

AB Annual rings are not commonly produced in tropical trees because they grow in a relatively aseasonal environment. However, in the subalpine zones of Hawai'i's highest volcanoes, there is often strong seasonal variability in temperature and rainfall. Using classical dendrochronological methods, annual growth rings were shown to occur in Sophora chrysophylla, a native tree species on Maunakea, Hawai'i. Chronologies were established from nearby non-native, live conifer trees and these were used to verify the dates from a total of 52 series from 22 S. chrysophylla trees, establishing an 86-y chronology (1926-2011). Ring-width patterns were significantly correlated with monthly rainfall from August of the previous year. This study is the first in the eastern tropical Pacific region to demonstrate annual growth rings in trees.

AB Model predictions for species competition outcomes highly depend on the assumed form of the population growth function. In this paper we apply an alternative inferential method based on statistical mechanics, maximizing Boltzmann entropy, to predict resource-constrained population dynamics and coexistence. Within this framework, population dynamics and competition outcome can be determined without assuming any particular form of the population growth function. The dynamics of each species is determined by two parameters: the mean resource requirement theta (related to the mean metabolic rate) and individual distinguishability D-r (related to intra- compared to interspecific functional variation). Our theory clarifies the condition for the energetic equivalence rule (EER) to hold, and provide a statistical explanation for the importance of species functional variation in determining population dynamics and coexistence patterns.

AB The relationship between functional traits and environmental factors contribute to understanding community structure and predicting which species will be able to elude environmental filters in different habitats. We selected 10 functional traits related to morphology, demography and regeneration niche in 54 subtropical premontane tree species to describe their main axes of functional differentiation. We derived species traits, environmental variables and species abundance data from 20 1-ha permanent plots established in a seasonal subtropical premontane forest in northwestern Argentina. We analyzed the relationship between species functional traits and environmental factors through RLQ and fourth-corner analyzes. We found an axis of structural differentiation that segregates understory from canopy species, and an axis of functional differentiation that segregates species that maximize resource acquisition from those that promote resource conservation. Environmental and forest use gradients operate hierarchically over subtropical premontane tree species influencing the distribution of demographic and morphological traits. The interaction between climatic and topographic factors influences the distribution of species functional traits at the regional scale. In addition, the history of forest use seems to operate at the landscape scale and explains the distribution of species traits reflecting a trade-off between resource acquisition and resource conservation strategies in secondary forests across different successional stages. Our results support the idea that functional traits may be used to analyze community structure and dynamics through niche differentiation and environmental filtering processes.

AB Land development contributes to the clearance of large trees that are sometimes offset with many smaller trees as compensatory wildlife habitat. But are many smaller trees a valid biodiversity offset for the loss of a single large tree? To answer this question, we tested predictions underpinned by island biogeography theory. Targeting birds, we investigated size and landscape context effects at 72 trees of three sizes (small, medium, and large) located in four landscape contexts (reserves, pasture, urban parklands, and urban built-up areas). Significant positive relationships occurred between tree basal area and bird abundance and species richness in all landscape contexts. SLOSS (single large or several small) analysis revealed that in modified landscapes, several small and medium trees supported an equivalent number of individuals and species as a single large tree, but the same pattern was weaker in reserves. Extrapolated rarefaction curves revealed that in reserves and urban built-up areas, many small or medium trees accumulated the same number or more species than large trees. However, in pasture and urban parklands, many small or medium trees accumulated fewer species than large trees. Overall, 29% of bird species were recorded only at large trees, highlighting that many smaller trees will not be suitable habitat compensation for all species. Complementary approaches to biodiversity offsets are needed, balancing large tree preservation and revegetation. Response patterns for birds at trees conformed to some biogeographic predictions (species-area relationship), but not others (habitat-isolation relationship), underscoring the need for novel conceptual frameworks for habitat structures in modified landscapes.

AB Road construction demonstrably accelerates deforestation rates in tropical forests, but its consequences for forest degradation remain less clear. We estimated a series of forest value metrics including components of biodiversity, carbon stocks, and timber and non-timber forest product resources, along the recently paved Inter-Oceanic Highway (IOH) integrating Brazil and Peru along the Bolivian border. We installed 69 vegetation plots in intact terra firme forests representative of local community holdings near and far from the IOH, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot.
   We observed strong geographic gradients in forest value components across the region, with increases from west to east in aboveground biomass and in the abundance of timber and non-timber forest product trees and regeneration. Plots in communities in Pando, Bolivia, where the IOH remains in part unpaved, had the highest aboveground biomass, standing timber volumes and Brazil nut tree density. In contrast, communities in Madre de Dios, Peru, where settlements and unpaved portions of the IOH have existed for decades, and in Acre, Brazil, where paving of the IOH has been underway for more than a decade, were more degraded. Seven of the fifteen forest value components we measured increased with increasing distance from the IOH, although the magnitude of these effects was weak. Landscape scale remote sensing analyses showed much stronger effects of road proximity on deforestation. We suggest that remote sensing techniques including canopy spectral signatures might be calibrated to characterize multiple components of forest value, so that we can estimate landscape scale-impacts of infrastructure developments on both deforestation and forest degradation in tropical regions.

AB The elucidation of phytogeographic patterns and their drivers in biodiversity hotspots is essential to the study of ecology and the conservation of these areas. In 2000, an important study by Oliveira-Filho and Fontes led to changes in the paradigms that define our understanding of the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). Here, our aim was to revisit this study using a more comprehensive set of environmental predictors, an updated and much larger tree species dataset and checklist, and more refined data analyses. We performed exploratory and confirmatory analyses, including the modeling of the spatial components with Moran's Eigenvector Maps, using data from 483 sites in southeastern Brazil, which encompass a total of 3546 species and 33 geo-climatic variables. We observed strong floristic similarities between rain- and seasonal forests and a species distribution continuum across the main gradients. The environmental and spatial variables were significantly correlated with floristic patterns, and we demonstrated that the tree flora of the seasonal forests should no longer be considered a simple subset of the rain forest flora. The findings of the original paper were not only confirmed but we also unveiled additional, important phytogeographic patterns. We also reinforced the main conclusion of the paper that the Atlantic Forest concept must encompass all of the forest types east of the dry corridor in South America, a designation of utmost importance for the conservation of this biodiversity hotspot.

AB One of the key problems in ecology is our need to anticipate the set of locations in which a species will be found (hereafter species' distributions). A major source of uncertainty in these models is the role of interactions among species (hereafter biotic interactions). Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly study this problem at large spatial scales and we lack a clear understanding of when biotic interactions shape species' distributions. We show a simple, direct link between the ease of species' coexistence and the importance of competition for shaping species' distributions. We show that increasing the ease of species' coexistence reduces the influence of biotic interactions. Changing the spatial scale of the analysis can reduce the influence of species interactions, but only when it promotes regional coexistence. Using these ideas, we analyze the conditions under which biotic interactions alter species' distributions in a Lotka-Volterra model of competition along an environmental gradient and argue that coexistence theory, rather than scale alone, provides a guide to the influence of species interactions. Our results provide a guide to the facets of biotic interactions that are necessary to anticipate their effects on species distributions. As such, we expect our work will help the development of more realistic distribution models.

AB Understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which environmental variation affects populations of plants and animals is an important goal for modern population biology, especially in the context of shifting climatic conditions. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) generates climatic extremes of interannual variation, and has been shown to have significant effects on the diversity and abundance of a variety of terrestrial taxa. However, studies that have investigated the influence of such large-scale climate phenomena have often been limited in spatial and taxonomic scope. We used 23 years (1988-2010) of a long-term butterfly monitoring data set to explore associations between variation in population abundance of 28 butterfly species and variation in ENSO-derived sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) across 10 sites that encompass an elevational range of 2750 m in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. Our analysis detected a positive, regional effect of increased SSTA on butterfly abundance (wetter and warmer years predict more butterfly observations), yet the influence of SSTA on butterfly abundances varied along the elevational gradient, and also differed greatly among the 28 species. Migratory species had the strongest relationships with ENSO-derived SSTA, suggesting that large-scale climate indices are particularly valuable for understanding biotic-abiotic relationships of the most mobile species. In general, however, the ecological effects of large-scale climatic factors are context dependent between sites and species. Our results illustrate the power of long-term data sets for revealing pervasive yet subtle climatic effects, but also caution against expectations derived from exemplar species or single locations in the study of biotic-abiotic interactions.

AB Although Eucalyptus is widely planted in South China, whose effects on native biodiversity are unclear. The objective of this study was to quantify the richness and composition of understory plants in two contrasting Eucalyptus chronosequences in South China. One was in Zhangzhou City with plantation age of 2, 4, and 6 years after clear-cutting Chinese fir forests, while the other was in Heshan City with plantation age of 2, 3, and 24 years that reforested on barren lands. Results showed that the richness of understory plants and functional groups was not significantly altered in the Zhangzhou chronosequence, while increased in the 24-year-old plantations, with a significantly larger proportion of woody plants than the younger plantations for the Heshan chronosequence. Moreover, a higher richness of woody plants accompanied by a lower richness of herbaceous species was detected in the Zhangzhou chronosequence compared with the Heshan one. To balance the need for pulp production and plant diversity conservation, we suggest that intercropping approaches between exotic Eucalyptus plantations and native forests should be considered in the fast rotation Eucalyptus plantations. However, Eucalyptus plantations may be used as pioneer species to sustain ecosystem functioning for the degraded lands.

AB The loss of tropical forests has continued in recent decades despite wide recognition of their importance to maintaining biodiversity. Here, we examine the conversion of forests to pastures and coca crops (illicit activity) on the San Lucas Mountain Range, Colombia for 2002-2007 and 2007-2010. Land use maps and biophysical variables were used as inputs to generate land use and cover change (LUCC) models using the DINAMICA EGO software. These analyses revealed a dramatic acceleration of the pace of deforestation in the region, with rates of conversion from forest to pasture doubling from the first to the second period. Altitude, distance to other crops, and distance to rivers were the primary drivers of deforestation. The influence of these drivers, however, differed markedly depending on whether coca cultivation or pastures replaced forest. Conversion to coca was more probable farther from other crops and from settlements. In contrast, proximity to other crops and to settlements increased conversion to pasture. These relationships highlight the different roles of coca and pastures in forest loss, with coca tending to open up new forest frontiers, and pastures tending to consolidate agricultural expansion and urban influence. Large differences between LUCC processes for each period suggest highly dynamic changes, likely associated with shifting underlying causes of deforestation. These changes may relate to shifts in demand for illicit crops, land, or mining products; however, the data to test these hypotheses are currently lacking. More frequent and detailed monitoring is required to guide actions to decrease the loss of forest in this highly vulnerable biodiversity hotspot in the Northern Andes.

AB 1. Biotic interactions of plants can have legacy effects mediated by changes in plant traits and soil characteristics. Legacy effects are defined as effects that persist after the causal biotic interaction ceases, because plant traits and soil characteristics are plastic and modifications may be maintained for long time periods. 2. To date, studies on biotic interactions of plants with above- and below-ground organisms and their plant-mediated interactions have mainly focused on short-term effects in the continuous presence of interacting organisms. 3. Little is known about how long the changes in plant traits and soil characteristics persist after the biotic interaction ceases and indirectly affect future biotic interactions and community assembly. Further, since some organisms switch between above- and below-ground compartments during ontogeny, impacts on soil-dwelling larval stages can have direct legacy effects on their above-ground adult stages and vice versa. 4. Elucidating legacy effects of biotic interactions above and below the ground will provide a deeper insight into a better understanding of the importance of plant trait- and soil characteristic-mediated indirect interactions in shaping community assembly, biodiversity and ecosystem function.

AB Aim The drivers of phylogenetic beta diversity include both local processes (e.g. environmental filtering) and regional processes (e.g. dispersal limitation). The role of environmental filtering can be investigated more directly by analysing community-environment associations, but dispersal limitation is one of the most challenging processes to examine. We investigated the role of traits related to dispersal - flight capacity, body size and voltinism - as drivers ofphylogenetic distance decay relationships in Neotropical stream insect communities.
   Location Headwater streams spread over 600km in south-eastern Brazil.
   Methods We compiled a data set of aquatic insect communities inhabiting streams across the State of SAo Paulo (Brazil). Then, we investigated environmental and spatial signals on phylobetadiversity patterns of aquatic insects using Mantel tests, multiple regressions on distance matrices and variation partitioning. We employed null models to investigate whether phylogenetic distance decay differed from pure compositional distance decay. We deconstructed the data set based on dispersal-related traits; we then ran distance decay analyses for these subsets separately.
   Results Geographical distance, rather than environmental distance, better explained the patterns of phylobetadiversity. We found that the phylogenetic decay relationship differed from the relationship expected for the null models only for univoltine, large-bodied genera with a high-flight capacity.
   Main conclusions Dispersal limitation, rather than species sorting, was the main driver for phylogenetic beta diversity in the metacommunity that we studied. We suggest that life-history strategies and mainly voltinism drive the distance decay of similarity in the insect communities examined. We additionally discuss the role of dispersal events over time to explain differences in distance decay patterns among tropical and other regions.

AB Plants have numerous impacts on biogeochemical cycling across both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. These effects extend well beyond the critical role of carbon (C) fixation through photosynthesis that provides the basis for ecosystem energy flow. While foliar and root traits of senescent plant material (litter) have been explored in detail in terrestrial ecosystems, there is a resurgence of interest in how plants modulate biogeochemical cycling in ways other than litter quality effects on C and nutrient mineralization. This Special Feature represents a collection of fresh' perspectives on how plants alone, or in interaction with other organisms, have important and lasting impacts on biogeochemical cycles of C and nutrients in a range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. We begin in the open ocean and then peer from the forest edge before moving into forest understoreys and grasslands to examine the control by live terrestrial plants on ecosystem C and nutrient cycling. Plants directly affect biogeochemical cycling while living through their diversity and composition, nutrient capture and strategies for assimilating C, and by altering the microclimate for decomposition. In addition, how they construct their tissues and alter the abiotic environment has large impacts on the turnover of C and nutrients once plants have senesced or died. From the direct impact of plants, we move onto the influence of plant-insect interactions, which effectively determine changes in plant stoichiometry in grasslands of varying diversity. Finally, looking directly in the soil, it is clear that plant-mycorrhizae interactions are important in modulating the response of litter decomposition to nutrient addition and the nature of C metabolism in the soil.Synthesis. The papers here highlight careful matching between how plants live and their biotic and abiotic contexts. Taken together, it appears that the dynamic, rather than passive, nature of plant responses to variable environments is key in affecting ecosystem level processes of C and nutrient turnover. This Special Feature highlights a diversity of connections between plants and their environment and demonstrates that in both life and death, how plants respond to these changes differs among plant lineages and this diversity will play a central role in determining biogeochemical cycling in the future in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Aim: Community assembly theory predicts that niche differentiation promotes the spatial clustering of functionally dissimilar species, whereas habitat filtering has the converse effect. We used these predictions to assess the relative effects of habitat filtering and niche differentiation on recruit community assembly over spatial (5- and 30-m neighbourhoods) and temporal (20-yr) scales in the Forest Dynamics Plot at Barro Colorado Island.
   Location: Barro Colorado Island, Panama.
   Methods: We integrated data on the spatial patterns of >= 1 cm DBH (diameter at 1.3 m above ground) recruits with data on seven functional traits for 64 species. First, we quantified the interspecific association patterns of all species pairs i and j using the K-function K-ij(r) and the nearest-neighbour distribution function D-ij(r). Second, for those pairs with significant spatial associations, we calculated an index of interspecific spatial association using the results of these two summary statistics. Finally, we examined the relationship between interspecific spatial association and trait similarity using simple and partial Mantel tests.
   Results: In all censuses, almost one-half of species pairs had no spatial associations, but for pairs that were significantly spatially associated, positive relationships between trait similarity and spatial association occurred in 5-m and 30-m neighbourhoods, whereas significant negative relationships only appeared in 5-m neighbourhoods. This suggests that habitat filtering was more important than niche differentiation in assembling recruit communities at 5- and 30-m scales. Habitat filtering mainly acted upon traits related to topographic habitat preferences and dispersal mode, whereas spatial association was inversely related to similarity in terms of wood specific gravity and shade tolerance.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both stochastic and deterministic processes operate in species-rich ecological communities, but the role of habitat filtering and niche differentiation as determinants of community assembly vary over spatial and temporal scales. Species co-occurrence was driven by habitat filtering at small and large scales, but also by a combination of niche differentiation and weaker-competitor exclusion effects at small scales. Temporal variations in the importance of habitat filtering and niche differentiation could be related to the occurrence of disturbances such as tree falls. Our results emphasize the role of trait-based processes in plant community assembly.

AB Although one of the most widely studied hypotheses for high tree diversity in the tropics, the Janzen-Connell hypothesis (JC), and the community compensatory trend upon which it is based, have conflicting support from prior studies. Some of this variation could arise from temporal variation in seedling survival of common and rare species. Using 10 years of data from La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, we analyzed annual seedling survival and found that negative density-dependence (negative DD) was significantly stronger for rare species than for common species in 2 years and was significantly stronger for common species than for rare species in 4 years. This temporal variation in survival was correlated with climatic variables: in warmer and wetter years, common species had higher negative DD than rare species. The relationship between climate and variation in JC effects on seedling survival of common and rare species could have important consequences for the maintenance of tree species diversity in Central America, which is predicted to experience warmer and wetter years as global change proceeds.

AB The recent rise in global demand for natural rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) has led to expansive areas of natural forest being transformed into monoculture plantations. This paper explores the utility of annual Landsat time series for monitoring forest disturbance and the role of natural rubber in mainland Southeast Asia from 2000 to 2012. A region on the Cambodian-Vietnamese border was chosen for this study considering four primary questions: 1) how accurately can annual Landsat time series map the location and timing of forest disturbances in evergreen and seasonal tropical forests, 2) are there cross-border differences in frontier and non-frontier forest disturbance rates between Cambodia and Vietnam, 3) what proportion of disturbances in frontier and non-frontier forests can be accounted for by the impact of rubber plantations, and 4) is there a relationship between global market prices for natural rubber and the annual rate of frontier forest clearing for rubber plantations on both sides of the border. We used LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) for temporal segmentation of the Landsat time series and disturbance mapping. Our results show that this approach can provide accurate forest disturbance maps but that accuracy is affected by forest type. Highest accuracies were found in evergreen forest (91%), with lower accuracies in mixed (82%) and dry-deciduous forest types (86%). Our final map considering all forest types yielded an overall accuracy of 86%. Forest disturbance rates were generally higher on the Cambodian side of the border. Frontier forest disturbance rates averaged 3.8%/year in Cambodia compared to 2.5%/year in Vietnam. Conversion to rubber was the dominant form of frontier forest change in both countries (42% in Cambodia and 84% in Vietnam). Non-frontier forest disturbances averaged 4.0% and 2.5% in Cambodia and Vietnam, respectively, with most disturbances likewise linked with rubber plantations. Although rates of frontier forest disturbance differed in both countries, they each displayed similar correlations between disturbance rates related to rubber plantation expansion and price fluctuations of natural rubber. This suggests links between localized land cover/use change and international market forces, irrespective of differing political and socioeconomic backgrounds. Our study underlines the value of using dense Landsat time series when exploring the dynamics of human-induced land cover change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Estimates of extinction risk for Amazonian plant and animal species are rare and not often incorporated into land-use policy and conservation planning. We overlay spatial distribution models with historical and projected deforestation to show that at least 36% and up to 57% of all Amazonian tree species are likely to qualify as globally threatened under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria. If confirmed, these results would increase the number of threatened plant species on Earth by 22%. We show that the trends observed in Amazonia apply to trees throughout the tropics, and we predict thatmost of the world's >40,000 tropical tree species now qualify as globally threatened. A gap analysis suggests that existing Amazonian protected areas and indigenous territories will protect viable populations of most threatened species if these areas suffer no further degradation, highlighting the key roles that protected areas, indigenous peoples, and improved governance can play in preventing large-scale extinctions in the tropics in this century.

AB Aim We test whether the modern regionalization of the angiosperm flora is the result of Cenozoic barriers to dispersal.
   Location Global.
   Methods We used a database of Cenozoic woody angiosperm fossils to build a matrix of family and genus occurrence at 11 continents/regions for five time periods of the Cenozoic, thus defining 55 floras. We used ordinations and cluster analyses to infer the relationships among these floras. We tested for the effects of time, land connections and dispersal barriers on the similarities between these woody angiosperm floras.
   Results For all time periods of the Cenozoic the world's woody angiosperm floras were grouped into three large clusters: a very compact Northern Hemisphere cluster (North America, Europe, temperate Asia and Palaeogene south China), a somewhat less compact Palaeotropical cluster (Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Neogene south China) and a rather diffuse Gondwanan cluster (Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, temperate South America and the Neotropics). The primary clustering is evidently geographical, and reflects the barriers formed by the Tethys and the southern Atlantic-southern Indian oceans. There is evidence that the more recent Gondwanan floras are more divergent than the older floras, possibly due to long isolation by oceans and multiple extinction events, whereas the similarities among Northern Hemisphere floras increased during the Neogene.
   Main conclusions The modern regionalization is mainly the result of dispersal barriers that existed at diverse times in the Cenozoic, resulting in several woody angiosperm floras that evolved in parallel. Climatic change and dispersal also played important roles in shaping biogeographical patterns of Cenozoic woody angiosperms.

AB Vegetation succession, drainage, and climate change are causes of peatland habitat loss in the Western Balkans. Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the most ecologically important invertebrate taxa in terrestrial ecosystems. To explore whether, and to what extent, fen ant communities are specialized, we sampled an alkaline fen, adjacent habitats undergoing vegetation succession, and the surrounding beech forest in west-central Croatia. Here, we show how a fen and its surrounding habitats differ in ant community structure, and which of the environmental variables (soil temperature, moisture, and pH) have the strongest impact in shaping those communities. In the two growing seasons of sampling we recorded 16 ant species, none of which were peatland specialists. While species richness did not differ between the sites, species diversity was the highest at a succession site. Specific environmental conditions of the fen limit colony establishment and allow survival of a small subset of ant species from the surrounding habitats. Consequently, only two ant species (Myrmica rubra and Lasius platythorax) were abundant at the fen site. Their presence at other study sites indicates that the fen fauna is composed of generalist species. The fen and forest community composition differed from the successional sites, and it was most strongly affected by soil pH. The fauna of these habitat islands completely lacks peatland-specific ant species. Knowing more about communities of these disappearing habitats will help us predict future biodiversity losses in similar habitats threatened by vegetation succession.

AB In the marine environment, many cryptic - morphologically similar but genetically distinct species show sympatric distributions, which challenges traditional ecological competition theory. In the morphospecies complex of the bacterivorous nematode Litoditis marina, four cryptic species (Pm I, Pm II, Pm III and Pm IV) frequently occur with mostly two or more of these species together. This co-occurrence displays fluctuating abundances that have been linked to seasonal dynamics in the environment. In intertidal marine environments, salinity and temperature play an important role in species distributions. In the here presented experiments, the impact of these two abiotic variables on juvenile development time, fecundity and population development was investigated. Monospecific cultures were reared at three different temperatures: 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C (salinity 25) and at two different salinities: 15 and 25 (temperature: 20 degrees C) in 2 separate experiments. Our results showed that differences in life history are present between the four species: Pm III had a higher instantaneous fecundity than the other three species. Furthermore, differences in reproduction strategy were observed between the cryptic species: Pm II and Pm III were always oviparous in this experiment, whilst Pm land Pm IV were mostly viviparous species. Abiotic factors affected the life history characters and the reproductive strategy of some of these cryptic species, with temperature clearly having a stronger effect than salinity. Temperature had an effect on juvenile development time for all species and a species-specific influence on population development. Pm III performed better at higher temperature, Pm II and Pm IV at lower temperature, whereas Pm I proved to be a more eurytherm species, which nicely correlates with their respective seasonal field distribution pattern in the south-eastern coast of the North Sea and adjacent estuaries. Juvenile development time was also influenced by salinity, with a shorter development time at the lower salinity for all cryptic species. Moreover, Pm III and Pm IV performed better at lower than at the higher salinity. Pm IV also changed its reproductive strategy, depending on the salinity. The effect of salinity was less clearly reflected in the geographical distribution of the four species. Different temperature preferences of the cryptic species on the other hand may result in niche differentiation and can provide an important mechanism for coexistence of these closely related species.

AB Understanding the factors determining the spatial and temporal variation of ecological networks is fundamental to the knowledge of their dynamics and functioning. In this study, we evaluate the effect of elevation and time on the structure of plant-flower-visitor networks in a Colombian mountain forest. We examine the level of generalization of plant and animal species and the identity of interactions in 44 bipartite matrices obtained from eight altitudinal levels, from 2200 to 2900 m during eight consecutive months. The contribution of altitude and time to the overall variation in the number of plant (P) and pollinator (A) species, network size (M), number of interactions (I), connectance (C), and nestedness was evaluated. In general, networks were small, showed high connectance values and non-nested patterns of organization. Variation in P, M, I and C was better accounted by time than elevation, seemingly related to temporal variation in precipitation. Most plant and insect species were specialists and the identity of links showed a high turnover over months and at every 100 m elevation. The partition of the whole system into smaller network units allowed us to detect small-scale patterns of interaction that contrasted with patterns commonly described in cumulative networks. The specialized but erratic pattern of network organization observed in this tropical mountain suggests that high connectance coupled with opportunistic attachment may confer robustness to plant-flower-visitor networks occurring at small spatial and temporal units.

AB Habitat complexity is a major determinant of structure and diversity of ant assemblages. Following the size-grain hypothesis, smaller ant species are likely to be advantaged in more complex habitats compared to larger species. Habitat complexity can act as an environmental filter based on species size and morphological traits, therefore affecting the overall structure and diversity of ant assemblages. In natural and semi-natural ecosystems, habitat complexity is principally regulated by ecological successions or disturbance such as fire and grazing. Urban ecosystems provide an opportunity to test relationships between habitat, ant assemblage structure and ant traits using novel combinations of habitat complexity generated and sustained by human management. We sampled ant assemblages in low-complexity and high-complexity parks, and high-complexity woodland remnants, hypothesizing that (i) ant abundance and species richness would be higher in high-complexity urban habitats, (ii) ant assemblages would differ between low-and high-complexity habitats and (iii) ants living in high-complexity habitats would be smaller than those living in low-complexity habitats. Contrary to our hypothesis, ant species richness was higher in low-complexity habitats compared to high-complexity habitats. Overall, ant assemblages were significantly different among the habitat complexity types investigated, although ant size and morphology remained the same. Habitat complexity appears to affect the structure of ant assemblages in urban ecosystems as previously observed in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. However, the habitat complexity filter does not seem to be linked to ant morphological traits related to body size.

TI Frugivory in Canopy Plants in a Western Amazonian Forest: Dispersal

AB Frugivory is a widespread mutualistic interaction in which frugivores obtain nutritional resources while favoring plant recruitment through their seed dispersal services. Nonetheless, how these complex interactions are organized in diverse communities, such as tropical forests, is not fully understood. In this study we evaluated the existence of plant-frugivore sub-assemblages and their phylogenetic organization in an undisturbed western Amazonian forest in Colombia. We also explored for potential keystone plants, based on network analyses and an estimate of the amount of fruit going from plants to frugivores. We carried out diurnal observations on 73 canopy plant species during a period of two years. During focal tree sampling, we recorded frugivore identity, the duration of each individual visit, and feeding rates. We did not find support for the existence of sub assemblages, such as specialized vs. generalized dispersal systems. Visitation rates on the vast majority of canopy species were associated with the relative abundance of frugivores, in which ateline monkeys ( i.e. Lagothrix and Ateles) played the most important roles. All fruiting plants were visited by a variety of frugivores and the phylogenetic assemblage was random in more than 67% of the cases. In cases of aggregation, the plant species were consumed by only primates or only birds, and filters were associated with fruit protection and likely chemical content. Plants suggested as keystone species based on the amount of pulp going from plants to frugivores differ from those suggested based on network approaches. Our results suggest that in tropical forests most tree-frugivore interactions are generalized, and abundance should be taken into account when assessing the most important plants for frugivores.

AB Phylogenetic ecology complements trait-based analysis on community assembly by considering that species are not independent units but are related to each other by their evolutionary history. Phylogenetic patterns clustered when there are more close relatives than expected by chance or overdispersed with less close relatives than expected. Patterns among species in a community indicate underlying biotic and abiotic processes acting on species functional traits. However, phylogenetic ecology has seldom been applied to forest restoration. We used floristic and abundance data from six forest restoration sites of different ages and four old-growth reference forests in the Brazilian Atlantic forest to evaluate similarities in phylogenetic patterns between restoration and reference forests as a measure of restoration success. The presence of an initial tree canopy in restoration forests conducted by planting species increases seed dispersal. Nevertheless, we expected random phylogenetic patterns early in restoration due to dispersal limitation in a highly fragmented landscape. As time since planting increases and in reference forests, we expected less of an effect of dispersal on community composition and more of an effect of negative biotic interactions among close relatives to lead to overdispersed patterns. We did not find a clear trajectory showing that restoration sites would resemble the phylogenetic patterns of reference sites with age since planting. We found significant clustering patterns in two sites, the oldest restoration site and one reference forest. The other reference forests showed, non-significant yet clustering tendencies. The functional traits studied were less conserved than expected by chance, therefore, we cannot relate clustering to be solely the result of environmental filters leading to the presence of close relatives with similar habitat requirements. The presence of closely related species in the Meliaceae family in reference forests and in the oldest restoration site, which was next to a forest remnant, points toward dispersal as the main factor driving phylogenetic patterns in the sites studied. Despite the use of a high number of planted species, differences in the composition of planted species among sites also affected the observed phylogenetic structure. We believe that phylogenetic ecology complements floristic studies by providing information on trait conservatism and shedding light on community assembly processes that affect the successional trajectory of restoration forest.

AB The consequences of global change for the maintenance of species diversity will depend on the sum of each species responses to the environment and on the interactions among them. A wide ecological literature supports that these species-specific responses can arise from factors related to life strategies, evolutionary history and intraspecific variation, and also from environmental variation in space and time. In the light of recent advances from coexistence theory combined with mechanistic explanations of diversity maintenance, we discuss how global change drivers can influence species coexistence. We revise the importance of both competition and facilitation for understanding coexistence in different ecosystems, address the influence of phylogenetic relatedness, functional traits, phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variability, and discuss lessons learnt from invasion ecology. While most previous studies have focused their efforts on disentangling the mechanisms that maintain the biological diversity in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests, grasslands and coral reefs, we argue that much can be learnt from pauci-specific communities where functional variability within each species, together with demographic and stochastic processes becomes key to understand species interactions and eventually community responses to global change.

AB Animals living in intertidal habitats experience high temperatures and low humidity during emersion that represent extreme deviations from those experienced during immersion; some use behaviour to ameliorate these stressors. We made in situ observations of 3 behaviours displayed by the Pacific intertidal snail Littorina subrotundata on 3 exposed rocky intertidal shores in the northeast Pacific: microhabitat selection, activity level, and conspecific aggregation. We hypothesized that these behaviours might be altered in response to temperature and/or humidity at a particular time during tidal emersion. We used the Akaike information criterion to compare a set of models for each of the 3 behaviours that included combinations of substrate temperature (T-s), vapour pressure deficit (VPD) (which encompasses humidity), emersion time, snail shell width (Size), and study site (Site) as the independent variables. The best supported model of microhabitat selection in the summers of 2011 and 2012 used only the independent variables Site and Size. The best supported model of activity included both T-s and VPD in 2011 but included only T-s in 2012; increased Ts resulted in decreased activity. None of the models in the set explained much of the variance in conspecific aggregation. We conclude an alternate cue for microhabitat selection is likely in this system and suggest that biogenic refuges created by barnacles are a likely driver. Our findings also suggest that thermal stress during emersion is the primary cue that informs the snails to reduce their activity.

AB Tropical rainforests are known for their extreme biodiversity, posing a challenging problem in tropical ecology. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the diversity of tree species, yet our understanding of this phenomenon remains incomplete. Here, we consider the contribution of animal seed dispersers to the species diversity of trees. We built a multilayer lattice model of trees whose animal seed dispersers are allowed to move only in restricted areas to disperse the tree seeds. We incorporated the effects of seed dispersers in the traditional theory of allopatric speciation on a geological time scale. We modified the lattice model to explicitly examine the coexistence of new tree species and the resulting high biodiversity. The results indicate that both the coexistence and diversified evolution of tree species can be explained by the introduction of animal seed dispersers.

AB The evolution of redirecting resources from plant defense to growth or reproduction may explain why some exotic species are successful invaders in new environments. For example, the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis posits that escape from herbivores by invasive plants results in the selection of more vigorous genotypes that reduce their allocation of resources to defense. In addition, understanding the defense strategy of an invasive plant may help forecast the likely impact of herbivory. We tested the prediction of reduced defense (i.e., resistance) in Genista monspessulana, measured indirectly as the performance of a specialist psyllid herbivore, by comparing five native and introduced plant populations. We also examined the ability of G. monspessulana to compensate for herbivory in the presence and the absence of psyllids for a single plant population from the native and introduced regions. Plant origin (native or introduced) did not influence the psyllid's abundance and population growth rate, suggesting no change in resistance to herbivory for introduced plants. Similarly, we found no overall difference in plant performance between individuals in the presence and the absence of psyllid herbivory, suggesting that G. monspessulana was able to fully compensate for herbivory. Damaged plants compensated by changing the pattern of branching, which also resulted in greater dry leaf biomass. We conclude that evolution of reduced defenses does not explain the success of G. monspessulana as an invader and that compensation for herbivory may limit the efficacy of the psyllid as a biological control agent.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of island area and isolation on species richness and abundance, and vegetation structure of Isla Palma by comparing these parameters with those of the continental location, Playa Chucheros. By sampling vegetation at each locality using Gentry transects (10 50x2 m) we found 204 species of plants at Playa Chucheros, and 103 on Isla Palma. Species richness and abundance of woody plants was higher for Playa Chucheros (472 individuals) compared to Isla Palma (349 individuals). Richness estimators indicate that the plant species richness of Playa Chucheros is almost twice as high as that of Isla Palma. Rarefaction curves suggest that Playa Chucheros had a significantly greater richness than Isla Palma. Furthermore, physiognomic parameters were higher for Playa Chucheros than those observed for Isla Palma, showing that the former supports tree vegetation with higher DBH and greater height. These results indicate that the size and isolation of the island is reflected in a diminished richness and vegetation structure, which can be of significant assistance in the development of better conservation strategies for plants and other groups of organisms on islands.

AB Soil nitrogen and phosphorus are commonly limiting elements affecting plant species richness in temperate zones. Our species richness-ecological study was performed in alder-dominated forests representing temperate floodplains (streamside alder forests of Alnion incanae alliance) and swamp forests (alder carrs of Alnion glutinosae alliance) in the Western Carpathians. Species richness (i.e., the number of vascular plants in a vegetation plot) was analyzed separately for native and alien vascular plants in 240 vegetation plots across the study area covering Slovakia, northern Hungary and southern Poland. The relationship between the species richness of each plant group and total soil nitrogen content, plant-available phosphorus and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio was analyzed by generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with Poisson error distribution and log-link function. The number of recorded native and alien species was 17-84 (average 45.4) and 0-9 (average 1.5) species per plot, respectively. The GLMMs were statistically significant (p < 0.001) for both plant groups, but the total explained variation was higher for native (14%) than alien plants (9%). The richness of native species was negatively affected by the total soil nitrogen content and plant-available phosphorus, whereas the C/N ratio showed a positive impact. The alien richness was predicted only by the total soil nitrogen content showing a negative effect.

AB Conversion of agricultural land to forest plantations is a major driver of global change. Studies on the impact of forest plantations on biodiversity in plantations and in the surrounding native vegetation have been inconclusive. Consequently, it is not known how to best manage the extensive areas of the planet currently covered by plantations. We used a novel, long-term (16 years) and large-scale (30,000 ha) landscape transformation natural experiment (the Nanangroe experiment, Australia) to test the effects of land conversion on population dynamics of 64 bird species associated with woodland and forest. A unique aspect of our study is that we focused on the effects of plantations on birds in habitat patches within plantations. Our study design included 56 treatment sites (Eucalyptus patches where the surrounding matrix was converted from grazed land to pine plantations), 55 control sites (Eucalyptus patches surrounded by grazed land), and 20 matrix sites (sites within the pine plantations and grazed land). Bird populations were studied through point counts, and colonization and extinction patterns were inferred through multiple season occupancy models. Large-scale pine plantation establishment affected the colonization or extinction patterns of 89% of studied species and thus led to a comprehensive turnover in bird communities inhabiting Eucalyptus patches embedded within the maturing plantations. Smaller bodied species appeared to respond positively to plantations (i.e., colonization increased and extirpation of these species decreased in patches surrounded by plantations) because they were able to use the newly created surrounding matrix. We found that the effects of forest plantations affected the majority of the bird community, and we believe these effects could lead to the artificial selection of one group of species at the expense of another.

AB The conversion of agricultural land to forest plantations is a major driver of global land-use change, and considering that large portions of the planet are covered by forest plantations, understanding their impact on biodiversity is a research priority. The aim of our study was to quantify the long-term response of two lizard species to the transformation of the matrix surrounding remnant habitat patches (from agricultural land to pine plantations). We used a large-scale (115 sites), long-term (16 years) fully replicated and controlled landscape scale natural experiment' (the Nanangroe experiment', Australia) to compare the response of lizard populations to plantation establishment. The study entailed detailed surveys of reptiles in 50 eucalypt patches surrounded by maturing pine Pinus radiata plantations (treatments) and populations inhabiting 55 eucalypt patches surrounded by grazing land (controls). We found that the eastern three-toed earless skink Hemiergis talbingoensis was advantaged by the establishment of the pine plantations (increasing colonization of eucalypt patches embedded within plantations). In contrast, we found that the southern rainbow skink Carlia tetradactyla was negatively affected by surrounding areas of maturing plantations. Thus, our results show that plantations acted as a barrier for one species and increased connectivity for the other. We suggest that leaving areas of land devoid of pines between remnant eucalypt patches may enhance the connectivity for species that respond negatively to plantation establishment while maintaining the beneficial increase in connectivity for others.

AB Dead wood decomposition begins immediately after tree death and involves a large array of invertebrates. Ecological successions are still poorly known for saproxylic organisms, particularly in boreal forests. We investigated the use of dead wood as nesting sites for ants along a 60-yr postfire chronosequence in northeastern coniferous forests. We sampled a total of 1,625 pieces of dead wood, in which 263 ant nests were found. Overall, ant abundance increased during the first 30 yr after wildfire, and then declined. Leptothorax cf. canadensis Provancher, the most abundant species in our study, was absent during the first 2 yr postfire, but increased steadily until 30 yr after fire, whereas Myrmica alaskensis Wheeler, second in abundance, was found at all stages of succession in the chronosequence. Six other species were less frequently found, among which Camponotus herculeanus (Linne), Formica neorufibarbis Emery, and Formica aserva Forel were locally abundant, but more scarcely distributed. Dead wood lying on the ground and showing numerous woodborer holes had a higher probability of being colonized by ants. The C:N ratio was lower for dead wood colonized by ants than for noncolonized dead wood, showing that the continuous occupation of dead wood by ants influences the carbon and nitrogen dynamics of dead wood after wildfire in northern boreal forests.

AB Negative density dependence (NDD) and niche partitioning have been perceived as important mechanisms for the maintenance of species diversity. However, little is known about their relative contributions to seedling survival. We examined the effects of biotic and abiotic neighborhoods and the variations of biotic neighborhoods among species using survival data for 7503 seedlings belonging to 22 woody species over a period of 2years in three different forest types, a half-mature forest (HF), a mature forest (MF), and an old-growth forest (OGF), each of these representing a specific successional stage in a temperate forest ecosystem in northeastern China. We found a convincing evidence for the existence of NDD in temperate forest ecosystems. The biotic and abiotic variables affecting seedlings survival change with successional stage, seedling size, and age. The strength of NDD for the smaller (<20cm in height) and younger seedlings (1-2years) as well as all seedlings combined varies significantly among species. We found no evidence that a community compensatory trend (CCT) existed in our study area. The results of this study demonstrate that the relative importance of NDD and habitat niche partitioning in driving seedling survival varies with seedling size and age and that the biotic and abiotic factors affecting seedlings survival change with successional stage.

AB Although patellid limpets are influential grazers on many shores, few studies have characterised their diets in detail. These key species can be found as dominant grazers on rocky shores, but this ecosystem is being transformed due to the increase in infrastructures such as jetties, breakwaters or seawalls by commercial, residential and tourist activities. Increasing knowledge about the ecological effects of these artificial substrates on marine environments is available, and many papers have reported that urban infrastructures support different biota and assemblages and do not act as a surrogate for natural rocky shores. However, little is known about the effect of artificial substrata on marine trophic ecology. The aim of the study was to explore the influence of artificial substrata (breakwaters) on the dietary composition of the common grazer Patella caerulea, to provide data about food resource availability, and its influence on the trophic ecology of limpets. A nested design was used to explore potential differences between natural and artificial shores in Algeciras Bay (Strait of Gibraltar). Additionally, the dietary composition of the endangered limpets Cymbula safiana and Patella ferruginea was studied in a single site. Analyses of the chlorophyll a concentration of the substrate did not show differences between substrata. The analysis of the rock surface by SEM indicated a general prevalence of diatoms and cyanoprokaryotes on all of the substrata. P. caerulea specimens collected from artificial substrata showed a lower number of consumed taxa than those collected from natural rocky shores, whereas the assemblages found in the gut contents also differed between artificial and natural substrata. The diet richness of the three species might be due to the differences in the position of the species on the shore. Our results suggest that limpets are a key group in the top-down control of meiofaunal and macrofaunal populations, due to the presence of several animal taxa in their gut contents in this study, despite the fact that they have traditionally been considered herbivorous grazers that regulate only algal populations in the intertidal regions.

AB Here we present data on a study of the species composition and structure of borokotoh, a habitat associated with central Amazonian seasonally black-water flooded forests. Borokotoh appears never to have been specifically studied before, being mentioned only once or twice in the literature (and then not under this name). This is the first report on the phytosociology of this vegetation association. Borokotoh is, on average, only some 20 m wide, but very species rich (107 species in 60 genera from 34 families in one 0.25-ha plot). It consists of a series of rounded hummocks of fine-grained mud, each 6-12 m in length and 2-3 m in height, separated by narrow sloughs. Hummocks are seasonally inundated almost to their flat tops, which remained dry in the years of the survey. Species are strongly stratified within the borokotoh, with over 78% of identified species being recorded in just one of the three hummock sub-divisions: top, side or in between-hummock slough. This specificity, almost certainly linked to inundation duration and waterlogging tolerance, may explain the high species diversity recorded. The study is significant in demonstrating that undescribed habitats still exist in Amazonia, and that biodiversity there may be structured in ways that are highly localized and habitat-specific. There is clearly a need for more detailed work on borokotoh and similar vegetation associations where high biodiversity may be associated with very specific local features.

ID DEFORESTATION; FOREST; BASIN; KNOWLEDGE; SERVICES; POLICY; GROWTH
AB Amazonia has an iconic status in global conservation due to its enormous area and vast stores of biodiversity. Nevertheless, much of its biodiversity remains unknown, and many of the region's forests are under threat of habitat loss due to deforestation and climatic instability. Based on the assumption that effective management and conservation of forest resources should be supported by geographically localized scientific knowledge, we mapped the spatial and temporal distribution of Amazonian conservation research and compared it to areas under threat from deforestation or with a high probability of climate change induced savannization/transition to seasonal forest. Specifically, we created a database of 4019 spatial coordinates of research sites collated from 857 conservation science research articles retrieved from Scopus. Research sites tend to cluster along major rivers and urban areas and new research sites tend to be located near existing sites. Information deficits are particularly acute in the south and southeast regions within the so called 'arc of deforestation'. Areas at risk of ecosystem transition due to climate instability are generally well studied with the exception of a large area of southwest Amazonia that has a high risk of savannization. Our results suggest that a more systematic approach to Amazonian conservation research is required, specifically targeting those areas most under threat from anthropogenic environmental change.

AB Numerous authors have studied the diet of the Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus) and have described this species as a generalist predator of invertebrates. In most studies, prey taxa are identified to the family or order level. Additionally, few studies have directly assessed dietary preference by comparing diet to available prey. We chose an important component of the diet of red-backed salamanders (ants) to test whether salamanders altered their diets temporally and to determine if salamanders preyed on a subset of available ant prey. We identified ant species in salamander diets over a 13 mo period. In the fall season we also compared ants in stomach contents to those available in the surrounding leaf litter to determine if territorial residents of P. cinereus selectively forage on different ant species. We found significant temporal differences in ant species incorporated in the diet of P. cinereus that were consistent with our detailed examination of salamander ant preference in the fall. Our estimates of prey diversity and richness indicate that salamanders consumed a subset of available ant species. Aphaenogaster picea, an abundant species that prefers similar microhabitat characteristics to P. cinereus, made up a majority of the ants in the diet. However, our results indicate that P. cinereus avoids foraging on Myrmica punctiventris, Myrmecina americana, and Lasius alienus, ants that are among the most abundant species in the forested areas of northeastern Ohio where the study was conducted. These species are potentially aggressive and/or chemically defended, reducing their profitability as prey. The striped and unstriped morphs of red-backed salamanders foraged similarly on ant taxa, but the striped morph consumed significantly more ants and was found within territories that contained more ants. Our findings suggest selective foraging may be more common among generalist predators than previously considered, and we propose striped and unstriped morphs may represent a trophic polymorphism in P. cinereus.

AB Although high deforestation rates are documented in Latin America, there are also significant signs of secondary forest regrowth. In this study, we analyze the land cover dynamics in the Osa Peninsula region of Costa Rica between 1987 and 2009 that provides a good scenario for evaluating the effects over forest trends of the environmental policies set up in 1996. Remote sensing imagery from Landsat and SPOT 2 satellites was classified using the See5 algorithm to obtain land cover maps for 1987, 1998, 2003 and 2009. Our results show that land cover changes in Osa County are driven by grassland/forest dynamics. Forest area diminished over the 1987-1998 period, whereas it increased by 5 and 6 % during the 1998-2003 and 2003-2009 periods, respectively. Grassland abandonment was identified as the main driver of the net increase in forest cover area. Fragmentation analysis was done over the forest class of these maps disclosing secondary forest of the persistent forest of each period. Persistent forest patches decrease in number, but increase in size through time, forming areas of persistent forest established in bigger patches with lower edge density. Secondary forest patches have increased in number and size, forming larger areas of forest established in bigger patches. Nearly half of the reforested area in the period 1987-2009 remained as secondary forest in 2009, playing a key role by decreasing forest fragmentation and strengthening the natural corridor connecting the conservation areas of the region.

AB There is considerable research on the effects of soil-disturbing ecosystem engineers in semi-natural Central European grasslands in terms of plant species diversity, soil properties and soil microorganisms. However, knowledge on the importance of such ecosystem engineers for animal diversity is still relatively rare. In this study we analyse the role of Lasius flavus nest mounds as habitats for larvae of the declining burnet moth species zygaena purpuralis in calcareous grasslands. We assumed that anthills act as preferred larval habitats in dependence on climate or vegetation structure. The analysis considers a macroclimatic gradient by comparing sites with differing elevation and, hence, local climates. Additionally, we analysed the importance of anthills for Z. purpuralis along a microclimatic gradient by comparing sites with different vegetation structures. The study clearly shows that anthills are important larval habitats when general microclimatic conditions in the grasslands are unfavourable due to a cool climate at higher elevation or dense vegetation. The likelihood of detecting larvae of the burnet moth species on sites where anthills were occupied was higher on the mounds than within the surrounding vegetation. Anthills were preferred as larval habitats by Z. purpuralis as they combine two essential elements for successful larval development: (i) a favourable microclimate thanks to an open vegetation structure and (ii) a sufficient amount of food. The study underlines the importance of L. flavus as an ecosystem engineer for maintaining habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity within semi-natural grasslands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Quantitative research on household participation in the Payments for Environmental Services (PES) programme remains scarce. This paper aims to determine the key factors influencing household participation in a PES programme in Mozambique. Questionnaire-based quarterly surveys were conducted with 290 randomly selected households. We used the instrumental variables technique to identify the factors influencing household participation. The instrumental variables used for forest dependence were: household head born in the village, duration of residence of the household head in the village, ethnicity of the household head, business ownership of the household head and off-farm income of the household. The results show that education of household head and households' trust towards community members positively influenced household participation in PES, while forest dependence influenced it negatively. Future PES projects may thus need to focus more on developing social capital and the resource dependence of households.

AB Impoverished communities often turn to illegal extraction of resources from protected areas to alleviate economic pressures or to make monetary gains. Such practices can cause ecological damage and threaten animal populations. These communities also often face a high disease burden and typically do not have access to affordable health care. Here we argue that these two seemingly separate challenges may have a common solution. In particular, providing health care to communities adjacent to protected areas may be an efficient and effective way to reduce the disease burden while also improving local perceptions about protected areas, potentially reducing illegal extraction. We present a case study of a health centre on the edge of Kibale National Park, Uganda. The centre has provided care to c. 7,200 people since 2008 and its outreach programme extends to c. 4,500 schoolchildren each year. Contrasting the provision of health care to other means of improving community perceptions of protected areas suggests that health clinics have potential as a conservation tool in some situations and should be considered in future efforts to manage protected areas.

AB Sprouting is a key component of the population dynamics of woody species. Regeneration via sprouting contributes substantially to population growth when resource availability varies.
   Basal sprouting is an important trait that facilitates the persistence of woody species under different environmental conditions. Environmental heterogeneity can have variable effects on allocation to sexual reproduction and vegetative growth over an individual's ontogeny; consequently, environmental heterogeneity can influence the dynamics of woody plant populations. However, the effects of environmental factors on the ramet and genet dynamics of woody species have yet to be fully explored. This study investigated the population dynamics of Curatella americana L. (Dilleniaceae), an abundant tree species with a wide geographic distribution. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) density, vital rates and population growth rate are constrained by low rainfall and low soil fertility and (2) ramet production contributes more than seedling production to population growth at low rainfall levels and low soil fertility. Population dynamics were evaluated at two soil types (low and high fertility) over 3 years (2010, 2011 and 2012) with varying rainfall levels (average, average and low rainfall levels, respectively). Both hypotheses were supported. Vegetative growth and the population growth rate were limited by low rainfall and low soil fertility. The survival rates of adults and immature ramets had the largest effect on population growth. Although sprouting was limited by resource availability, this regeneration mode contributed more than seedlings to population growth. Basal sprouting not only ensures species persistence but also, as indicated by these results, permits a species to tolerate a lack of seedling recruitment. Basal sprouting was, therefore, determined to play an important role in the population growth of woody species in heterogeneous environments.

AB High human density and land use intensity often coincide with biodiversity hotspots making peri-urban reserves a keystone for conserving natural remnants in a highly anthropogenic matrix. Particularly, intense propagule pressure by alien plant species can pose a threat to native biodiversity. However, little is known about the factors that determine invasibility and the role of roads and other human disturbances for such small protected areas. Within a peri-urban reserve close to the city of Concepcin, south-central Chile, we investigated the influence of different site and landscape characteristics on the richness of native and alien plant species across different habitat (ruderal, road and forest sites) and forest types (native and alien dominated forests). Compared to other protected areas, alien species were frequently found in this reserve indicating the importance of urban areas as source for alien species. Aliens concentrate around disturbed ruderal and road sites, facilitating their spread into the reserve. Natural forest areas are less invaded until now. Within forests alien plant species richness was, however, positively associated to the proximity to disturbed landscapes. Forests dominated by alien tree species within the reserve are not the source for alien species within natural forests, but they negatively affect native species richness by replacing adequate seed sources. In order to prevent a further spread of alien species into peri-urban reserves, large scale anthropogenic disturbances should be minimized, already invaded sites must be monitored and buffer-zones protecting reserves from surrounding land use activities should be established.

AB Misperceptions about the world's grassy biomes contribute to their alarming rates of loss due to conversion for agriculture and tree plantations, as well as to forest encroachment. To illustrate the causes and consequences of these misperceptions, we show that the World Resources Institute and the International Union for Conservation of Nature misidentified 9 million square kilometers of ancient grassy biomes as providing "Opportunities" for forest restoration. Establishment of forests in these grasslands, savannas, and open-canopy woodlands would devastate biodiversity and ecosystem services. Such undesired outcomes are avoidable if the distinct ecologies and conservation needs of forest and grassy biomes become better integrated into science and policy. To start with, scientists should create maps that accurately depict grassy biomes at global and landscape scales. It is also crucial that international environmental agreements (e.g., the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) formally recognize grassy biomes and their environmental values.

AB Despite broad recognition that habitat loss represents the greatest threat to the world's biodiversity, a mechanistic understanding of how habitat loss and associated fragmentation affect ecological systems has proven remarkably challenging. The challenge stems from the multiple interdependent ways that landscapes change following fragmentation and the ensuing complex impacts on populations and communities of interacting species. We confronted these challenges by evaluating how fragmentation affects individual plants through interactions with animals, across five herbaceous species native to longleaf pine savannas. We created a replicated landscape experiment that provides controlled tests of three major fragmentation effects (patch isolation, patch shape [i.e., edge-to-area ratio], and distance to edge), established experimental founder populations of the five species to control for spatial distributions and densities of individual plants, and employed structural equation modeling to evaluate the effects of fragmentation on plant reproductive output and the degree to which these impacts are mediated through altered herbivory, pollination, or pre-dispersal seed predation. Across species, the most consistent response to fragmentation was a reduction in herbivory. Herbivory, however, had little impact on plant reproductive output, and thus we found little evidence for any resulting benefit to plants in fragments. In contrast, fragmentation rarely impacted pollination or pre-dispersal seed predation, but both of these interactions had strong and consistent impacts on plant reproductive output. As a result, our models robustly predicted plant reproductive output (r(2) = 0.52-0.70), yet due to the weak effects of fragmentation on pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation, coupled with the weak effect of herbivory on plant reproduction, the effects of fragmentation on reproductive output were generally small in magnitude and inconsistent. This work provides mechanistic insight into landscape-scale variation in plant reproductive success, the relative importance of plant-animal interactions for structuring these dynamics, and the nuanced nature of how habitat fragmentation can affect populations and communities of interacting species.

AB Grasses using the C-4 photosynthetic pathway dominate frequently burned savannas, where the pathway is hypothesized to be adaptive. However, independent C-4 lineages also sort among different fire environments. Adaptations to fire may thus depend on evolutionary history, which could be as important as the possession of the C-4 photosynthetic pathway for life in these environments. Here, using a comparative pot experiment and controlled burn, we examined C-3 and C-4 grasses belonging to four lineages from the same regional flora, and asked the following questions: Do lineages differ in their responses to fire, are responses consistent between photosynthetic types, and are responses related to fire frequency in natural habitats? We found that in the C-4 Andropogoneae lineage, frost killed a large proportion of aboveground biomass and produced a large dry fuel load, which meant that only a small fraction of the living tissue was lost in the fire. C-3 species from the Paniceae and Danthonioideae lineages generated smaller fuel loads and lost more living biomass, while species from the C-4 lineage Aristida generated the smallest fuel loads and lost the most living tissue. Regrowth after the fire was more rapid and complete in the C-4 Andropogoneae and C-3 Paniceae, but incomplete and slower in the C-3 Danthonioideae and C-4 Aristida. Rapid recovery was associated with high photosynthetic rates, high specific leaf area, delayed flowering, and frequent fires in natural habitats. Results demonstrated that phylogenetic lineage was more important than photosynthetic type in determining the fire response of these grasses and that fire responses were related to the frequency that natural habitats burned.

AB Hunting ants are predators of organisms belonging to different trophic levels. Their presence, abundance, and diversity may reflect the diversity of other ants and contribute to evaluate habitat conditions. Between 2003 and 2005 the restoration of seven corridors in an Andean rural landscape of Colombia was performed. The restoration took place in lands that were formerly either forestry plantations or pasturelands. To evaluate restoration progress, hunting ants were intensely sampled for 7 yr, using sifted leaf litter and mini-Winkler, and pitfall traps in 21 plots classified into five vegetation types: forests, riparian forests, two types of restored corridors, and pasturelands. The ant communities were faithful to their habitat over time, and the main differences in ant composition, abundance, and richness were due to differences among land use types. The forests and riparian forests support 45% of the species in the landscape while the restored corridors contain between 8.3-25%. The change from forest to pasturelands represents a loss of 80% of the species. Ant composition in restored corridors was significantly different than in forests but restored corridors of soil of forestry plantations retained 16.7% more species than restored corridors from pasturelands. Ubiquitous hunting ants, Hypoponera opacior (Forel) and Gnamptogenys ca andina were usually associated with pastures and dominate restored corridors. Other cryptic, small, and specialized hunting ants are not present in the restored corridors. Results suggest that the history of land use is important for the biodiversity of hunting ants but also that corridors have not yet effectively contributed toward conservation goals.

AB Litterfall plays an important role in nutrient cycling and maintenance of soil fertility in terrestrial ecosystems. Annual and seasonal variation in litterfall have been investigated in various habitats, however, seasonality in nutrient supply is less well documented. We studied litterfall over two years and seasonal litter nutrient input over one year across a tropical disturbance gradient from mature forest to monoculture tea plantation. Total litter production in the mature forests and regenerating forests was not significantly different. However, tea plantations had significantly lower litter production. Total litterfall in forest habitats showed a clear seasonal pattern with a peak during the dry season (Mar.-May), as has been reported for other tropical seasonal forests. Contrary to expectations, there was no significant difference in litter nutrient concentrations across the disturbance gradient, although there was a substantial change in plant species composition. Litter nutrient concentrations also did not vary significantly across seasons, again contrary to our expectations. Thus, nutrient input was driven solely by the seasonal litterfall pattern. Our results suggest that at a landscape scale turnover in species composition linked to anthropogenic disturbance may not always lead to changes in litter quality, presumably because a similar spectra of leaf types may exist across communities. Seasonal litterfall patterns, which have been more commonly studied, may prove a reasonable proxy for nutrient input in forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the dendroclimatic potential of tree species in a tropical dry forest in southern Ecuador. From 10 selected tree species, Bursera graveolens and Maclura tinctoria exhibited distinct annual and cross-datable tree-rings. It was possible to synchronize individual tree-ring series and to establish two tree-ring chronologies of 203 and 87 years length, respectively. The characteristic ENSO frequency band is reflected in wavelet power spectra of both chronologies. Both species show a strong correlation between ring width and precipitation of the wet season (January-May). Strong El Nino events (1972, 1983 and 1998) lead to strong growth responses in the tree-ring chronologies, whereas 'normal' ENSO events do not trigger long-lasting growth responses. The first ring-width based wet-season precipitation reconstruction for the past 103 years was developed. Statistical and spatial correlation analysis verified the skills of the reconstructed precipitation which captures a great part of the Rainfall Index over the land area of Ecuador and the equatorial Pacific. Furthermore, teleconnections with central Pacific precipitation and SST patterns were found. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A tree ring oxygen isotope (delta O-18(TR)) chronology developed from one species (Cedrela odorata) growing in a single site has been shown to be a sensitive proxy for rainfall over the Amazon Basin, thus allowing reconstructions of precipitation in a region where meteorological records are short and scarce. Although these results suggest that there should be large-scale (>100 km) spatial coherence of delta O-18(TR) records in the Amazon, this has not been tested. Furthermore, it is of interest to investigate whether other, possibly longer-lived, species similarly record interannual variation of Amazon precipitation, and can be used to develop climate sensitive isotope chronologies. In this study, we measured delta O-18 in tree rings from seven lowland and one highland tree species from Bolivia We found that cross-dating with delta O-18(TR) gave more accurate tree ring dates than using ring width. Our "isotope cross-dating approach" is confirmed with radiocarbon "bomb-peak" dates, and has the potential to greatly facilitate development of delta O-18(TR) records in the tropics, identify dating errors, and check annual ring formation in tropical trees. Six of the seven lowland species correlated significantly with C odorata, showing that variation in delta O-18(TR) has a coherent imprint across very different species, most likely arising from a dominant influence of source water delta O-18 on delta O-18(TR), In addition we show that delta O-18(TR) series cohere over large distances, within and between species. Comparison of two C. odorata delta O-18(TR) chronologies from sites several hundreds of kilometres apart showed a very strong correlation (r = 0.80, p < 0.001, 1901-2001), and a significant (but weaker) relationship was found between lowland C odorata trees and a Polylepis tarapacana tree growing in the distant Altiplano (r = 0.39, p < 0.01, 1931-2001). This large-scale coherence of delta O-18(TR) records is probably triggered by a strong spatial coherence in precipitation delta O-18 due to large-scale controls. These results highlight the strength of delta O-18(TR) as a precipitation proxy, and open the way for temporal and spatial expansion of precipitation reconstructions in South America.

AB In a rapidly changing world, ecology has the potential to move from empirical and conceptual stages to application and management issues. It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers).
   Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used.
   Synthesis and applications. Ecologists face several challenges to ensure the healthy development of an operational predictive ecological science: (i) clarity on the distinction between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (ii) developing new theories at the interface between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (iii) open data to test and validate predictions; (iv) making predictions operational; and (v) developing a genuine ethics of prediction.

FX This study is dedicated to the memory of the late Robert Barbault, who
   strongly contributed to renew scientific ecology in France and whose
   heritage will root deep, beyond our scientific field, into our society.
   This study is a contribution of the CNRS working group ECOPRED who met
   during the 2-day conference 'Prospective de l'Institut Ecologie et
   Environnement' held in Avignon on 24-25 October 2012. The authors would
   particularly like to thank Francoise Gaill and Stephanie Thiebault
   (former and current directors of the Institute Ecology and Environment
   of the CNRS) for their support and encouragement. The authors would like

AB Tropical coral reef organisms are predicted to be especially sensitive to ocean warming because many already live close to their upper thermal limit, and the expected rise in ocean CO2 is proposed to further reduce thermal tolerance. Little, however, is known about the thermal sensitivity of a diverse and abundant group of reef animals, the gastropods. The humpbacked conch (Gibberulus gibberulus gibbosus), inhabiting subtidal zones of the Great Barrier Reef, was chosen as a model because vigorous jumping, causing increased oxygen uptake ((M) over dot O-2), can be induced by exposure to odour from a predatory cone snail (Conus marmoreus). We investigated the effect of present-day ambient (417-454 mu atm) and projected-future (955-987 mu atm) PCO2 on resting ((M) over dot O-2,(rest)) and maximum ((M) over dot O-2,(max)) ((M) over dot O-2,O- (rest)), as well as MO2 during hypoxia and critical oxygen tension (PO2, crit), in snails kept at present-day ambient (28 degrees C) or projected-future temperature (33 degrees C). ((M) over dot O-2,O-rest), rest and ((M) over dot O-2,O-max), were measured both at the acclimation temperature and during an acute 5 degrees C increase. Jumping caused a 4-to 6-fold increase in ((M) over dot O-2), and ((M) over dot O-2,(max)) increased with temperature so that absolute aerobic scope was maintained even at 38 degrees C, although factorial scope was reduced. The humpbacked conch has a high hypoxia tolerance with a PO2, crit of 2.5 kPa at 28 degrees C and 3.5 kPa at 33 degrees C. There was no effect of elevated CO2 on respiratory performance at any temperature. Long-term temperature records and our field measurements suggest that habitat temperature rarely exceeds 32.6 degrees C during the summer, indicating that these snails have aerobic capacity in excess of current and future needs.

AB Disentangling the relative effects of forest loss versus fragmentation on species distribution and abundance is crucial for adopting efficient biodiversity conservation actions, which could change with the nature of the landscape matrix.
   We tested the moderating effect of landscape matrix on insectivorous bats response to forest loss and fragmentation.
   We conducted acoustic surveys at forest patches surrounded by either an agricultural-dominated matrix or a pine-dominated matrix. We related bat activity to forest amount and the number of forest patches at multiple spatial scales, and compared their effects between landscape matrices.
   Bat activity was associated with both predictors, however their effects varied with the matrix type. In agricultural landscapes, as the amount of forest increased, the activity of Histiotus montanus, Lasiurus cinereus and Tadarida brasiliensis increased, while activity of Myotis chiloensis decreased. Similarly, as fragmentation increased, the activity of Lasiurus varius and M. chiloensis increased, while activity of H. montanus decreased. In production-forest landscapes, only H. montanus decreased its activity with increasing forest amount. In contrast, activity of L. cinereus, M. chiloensis and T. brasiliensis increased with increasing fragmentation. Forest amount was a stronger predictor for agricultural landscapes than for production-forest landscapes, suggesting that low contrast matrices can mitigate the effects of forest loss.
   Fragmented landscapes with native forest patches surrounded by a low contrast matrix may support a higher activity of insectivorous bats. Management efforts in fragmented landscapes should aim to decrease the patch-matrix contrast, which will mitigate the effects of forest loss on bats.

AB The modern bioregionalization revival is marked by an abundance of revised biogeographical classifications along with new analyses at both local and global scales. Many of these new regionalizations are based on sophisticated geospatial and species distributional models whereas others focus on the information about area relationships as inferred from the phylogenetic relationships of taxa in the areas. This results in a dichotomy between geospatial and phylogenetic approaches: areas may have the same name, but different composition and relationships. We see an opportunity to move bioregionalizations forward by proposing new regions or revising well-known regions to reflect the advances that have been made in our understanding of phylogeny, biodiversity and Earth history during the past 50 years. Twenty-first century biogeographers can adopt the methods of phylogenetic systematics which prescribe how taxa and their characters may be used to infer hierarchical relationships. In an analogous way, natural bioregions may be discovered by treating biotic areas as taxa and finding aggregate patterns of distributional relationships - a general areagram - as specified by phylogenies of the clades that live in those areas. We demonstrate the differences in these two approaches - general areagrams versus distributional models - in bioregionalizations and definitions of the Australian and the Neotropical regions.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are the main component of soil microbial population in most agroecosystems. They forms a close association with more than 80 % of the plant species making immobilized mineral nutrients available to the plants in order to sustain normal growth and reproduction. In this study the diversity of mycorrhizal fungi has been examined in seven land use ecosystems of Arunachal Pradesh in Eastern Himalayan region. A total of 24 species of AM fungi belonging to 4 genera viz., Glomus, Scutellospora, Aculospora and Gigaspora were isolated from the soil samples collected from different land use systems. Glomus was the dominant genera and Glomus occulatum was the most abundant species in all the seven land use systems. Total spore number was highly variable among all the land use systems. Species richness was recorded highest in natural forest that maintains a faster nutrient cycle with the highest diversity index. The Jhum fallow land and tea garden has the least number of AM fungal species due to high disturbance of fire and application of fungicides and inorganic fertilizer. Further the plant species composition, particularly the ground vegetation coverage and disturbance level affects the distribution of the AM fungal species. In our study it has been shown that AMF diversity is significantly affected by the land use practices practiced by the people. Hence, the AM fungi isolated from different land use system may be useful in improving the agriculture practices particularly the plantation crops in the region.

AB This paper describes the regulatory and compliance context for Oregon's emerging ecosystem services (ES) market in riparian shade to meet water quality obligations. In Oregon's market as with many other ES programs, contracts and other regulatory documents not only delimit the obligations and liabilities of different parties, but also constitute a primary mechanism through which ES service delivery is measured. Through a review of compliance criteria I find that under Oregon's shade trades, permittees are held to a number of input-based criteria, which essentially affirm that parties comply with predetermined practices and procedures, and one 'pseudo output based' criterion, in which ES delivery is estimated through a model. The case presented in the paper critically engages with the challenges of measuring ES and in assessing the outcomes of ES projects. It places these challenges as interrelated and proposes that market designers, policymakers, and other stakeholders should consider explicit efficacy, efficiency, and equity targets.

AB The black southern cod, Patagonotothen tessellata, is the most important notothenioid fish species in terms of abundance in southern Chilean Patagonia. However, studies on its trophic ecology are scarce. Here we assessed the spatial variation in the diet of P. tessellata between two localities, one with oceanic influence (Staples Strait) and another with continental influence (Puerto Bories). We used permutation analysis combined with non-metric multi-dimensional scaling to evaluate spatial differences in diet. In addition, generalized additive models were used to identify the most significant environmental, biological and spatial predictors of variability in diet. The black southern cod presents spatial differences in diet composition among contrasting environmental localities. The diet in Staples Strait was characterized by the dominance of the polychaete Platynereis australis, whereas diet in Puerto Bories was characterized by crustaceans, mainly ostracods, gammarids and algae, mainly the filamentous green alga Rhizoclonium sp. and the red algae Polysiphonia sp. Diet composition did not show significant difference between sexes, whereas diet of small, medium and large fish differed to some degree. Smaller-sized P. tessellata were most likely to contain food. Salinity and temperature had significant influence on diet variability, suggesting that P. tessellata showed a greater diversity of prey items in environmental conditions with greater temperature and lower salinity. The results provide evidence of two dietary patterns depending on the type of environment in which they are distributed, highlighting the potential role of the environmental variables on the availability and abundance of potential prey and in structuring diet.

AB Populations of large mammals are severely depleted by hunting in tropical forests, with direct effects on plant regeneration. But indirect consequences on commensal taxa depending on them for food resources, like coprophagous beetlet, are less documented. Cascading effects of species loss across Scarabaeinae are expected, with likely significant negative implications for ecosystem functions. We examined dung beetle assemblages using pitfall traps at three rain forest sites in French Guiana ranging from intact mammalian fauna (Nouragues) to moderate (Kaw) and heavy (Matoury) defaunation. The site with the most depauperate mammalian fauna showed significantly lower dung beetle species richness than the two other two sites, which were not different from each other. Mean abundance and biomass per trap were not different across sites whereas community composition strongly differed among sites. A positive correlation was observed between body size and the individual contribution to dissimilarity between Nouragues and Kaw. The species contributing the most to dissimilarity were large. By contrast, one medium-sized species, dominant in Matoury, contributed the most to dissimilarity between Matoury and other sites. Diurnal genera of large tunnellers showed a higher diversity and abundance in Nouragues compared to other sites, whereas a nocturnal genus showed no differences. Large rollers were more abundant in Kaw compared to other sites. None of the groups of small beetles but one were affected by defaunation. Our results suggest that loss of large mammal populations affects dung beetle assemblage structure and causes decreasing abundance or disappearance of large tunnellers species that have a major impact on several dung beetle-mediated ecological processes.

AB Biological soil crust (BSC) communities control many functional processes in arid and semiarid ecosystems, where biological activity is closely influenced by soil wetting. Our goal was to analyze how the length of wetting events and the presence of BSC determine soil variables related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in a semiarid ecosystem. We applied three watering treatments (one, six and ten days) on soils from two microsites (BSC and bare ground) in a microcosm experiment. We analyzed multiple variables related to N and C cycling (N in microbial biomass [MB-N], dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], NH4+-N, N--N, resin-NH4+-N and resin-NO3--N, phenols and carbohydrates). For all treatments, minimum DON concentration appeared earlier in BSC than in bare ground, while maximum NO3- peaks appeared earlier in BSC than in the bare ground. Increases of NH4+ were only perceptible under BSC. Our results showed that longer lasting wetting events kept higher mineral and organic N as well as labile organic C in soils under BSC, which suggest that longer wetting events may be related to an enhancement in the decomposition rate that compensate for nutrient losses associated to short lasting wetting events. This trend is much less obvious in bare ground than under BSC. Our data suggest that changes in the length of wetting events and the presence of BSC with climate changes could alter future soil community structure and function. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Croplands have expanded dramatically during the last century, frequently leading to severe biodiversity losses within occupied areas. In addition to such direct influences, croplands may also have affected biodiversity within adjacent natural habitats, yet such potential indirect effects have rarely been quantified. Here, we test for effects of cornfields on small mammal communities inhabiting forest fragments in the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, Brazil. We test the hypotheses that cornfields increase the abundance and dominance of granivorous small mammals in adjacent forest fragments but reduce the abundance of nongranivorous species and community richness. To test these hypotheses, we used a replicated randomized block design, comparing communities located at forest interiors, forest-cornfield edges, and also forest-road edges. The abundance of granivorous small mammals was significantly higher at forest-cornfield edges compared to the other treatments, whereas insectivorous-omnivorous species had an apparently neutral response to the edges. Forest-cornfield edges harbored fewer small mammal species and tended to have a greater dominance of granivores. Forest-cornfield and forest-road edges harbored species characteristic of both forested and nonforested habitats. Our findings suggest that cornfields alter the structure of native small mammal communities, mostly by providing complementary resources for granivores.

AB Efforts to curb elephant poaching have focused on reducing demand, confiscating ivory and boosting security patrols in elephant range. Where land is under multiple uses and ownership, determining the local poaching dynamics is important for identifying successful conservation models. Using 2,403 verified elephant, Loxodonta africana, mortality records collected from 2002 to 2012 and the results of aerial total counts of elephants conducted in 2002, 2008 and 2012 for the Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem of northern Kenya, we sought to determine the influence of land ownership and use on diurnal elephant distribution and on poaching levels. We show that the annual proportions of illegally killed (i.e., poached) elephants increased over the 11 years of the study, peaking at 70% of all recorded deaths in 2012. The type of land use was more strongly related to levels of poaching than was the type of ownership. Private ranches, comprising only 13% of land area, hosted almost half of the elephant population and had significantly lower levels of poaching than other land use types except for the officially designated national reserves (covering only 1.6% of elephant range in the ecosystem). Communal grazing lands hosted significantly fewer elephants than expected, but community areas set aside for wildlife demonstrated significantly higher numbers of elephants and lower illegal killing levels relative to non-designated community lands. While private lands had lower illegal killing levels than community conservancies, the success of the latter relative to other community-held lands shows the importance of this model of land use for conservation. This work highlights the relationship between illegal killing and various land ownership and use models, which can help focus anti-poaching activities.

AB Release from specialist insect herbivores may allow invasive plants to evolve traits associated with decreased resistance and increased competitive ability. Given that there may be genetic trade-off between resistance and tolerance, invasive plants could also become more tolerant to herbivores. Although it is widely acknowledged that light availability affects tolerance to herbivores, little information is available for whether the effect of light availability on tolerance differ between the introduced and native populations. We conducted a common garden experiment in the introduced range of Alternanthera philoxeroides using ten invasive US and ten native Argentinean populations at two levels of light availability and in the presence or absence of a specialist stem-boring insect Agasicles hygrophila. Plant biomass (total and storage root biomass), two allocation traits (root/shoot ratio and branch intensity, branches biomass/main stem biomass) and two functional traits (specific stem length and specific leaf area), which are potentially associated with herbivore resistance and light capture, were measured. Overall, we found that A. philoxeroides from introduced ranges had comparable biomass and tolerance to specialist herbivores, lower branch intensity, lower specific stem length and specific leaf area. Moreover, introduced populations displayed higher shade tolerance of storage root biomass and lower plastic response to shading in specific stem length. Finally, light availability had no significant effect on evolution of tolerance to specialist herbivores of A. philoxeroides. Our results suggest that post-introduction evolution might have occurred in A. philoxeroides. While light availability did not influence the evolution of tolerance to specialist herbivores, increased shade tolerance and release from specialist insects might have contributed to the successful invasion of A. philoxeroides.

AB Species interactions can play a major role in shaping evolution in new environments. In theory, species interactions can either stimulate evolution by promoting coevolution or inhibit evolution by constraining ecological opportunity. The relative strength of these effects should vary as species richness increases, and yet there has been little evidence for evolution of component species in communities. We evolved bacterial microcosms containing between 1 and 12 species in three different environments. Growth rates and yields of isolates that evolved in communities were lower than those that evolved in monocultures, consistent with recent theory that competition constrains species to specialize on narrower sets of resources. This effect saturated or reversed at higher levels of richness, consistent with theory that directional effects of species interactions should weaken in more diverse communities. Species varied considerably, however, in their responses to both environment and richness levels. Mechanistic models and experiments are now needed to understand and predict joint evolutionary dynamics of species in diverse communities.

AB A new deforestation and land-use change scenario generator model (FOREST-SAGE) is presented that is designed to interface directly with dynamic vegetation models used in latest generation earth system models. The model requires a regional-scale scenario for aggregate land-use change that may be time-dependent, provided by observational studies or by regional land-use change/economic models for future projections. These land-use categories of the observations/economic model are first translated into equivalent plant function types used by the particular vegetation model, and then FOREST-SAGE disaggregates the regional-scale scenario to the local grid-scale of the earth system model using a set of risk-rules based on factors such as proximity to transport networks, distance weighted population density, forest fragmentation and presence of protected areas and logging concessions. These rules presently focus on the conversion of forest to agriculture and pasture use, but could be generalized to other land use change conversions. After introducing the model, an evaluation of its performance is shown for the land-cover changes that have occurred in the Central African Basin from 2001-2010 using retrievals from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Vegetation Continuous Field data. The model is able to broadly reproduce the spatial patterns of forest cover change observed by MODIS, and the use of the local-scale risk factors enables FOREST-SAGE to improve land use change patterns considerably relative to benchmark scenarios used in the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project integrations. The uncertainty to the various risk factors is investigated using an ensemble of investigations, and it is shown that the model is sensitive to the population density, forest fragmentation and reforestation factors specified.

AB Biodiversity loss has spurred the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research over a range of ecosystems. In Antarctica, however, the relationship of taxonomic and functional diversity with ecosystem properties (e.g., community biomass) has received less attention, despite the presence of sharp and dynamic environmental stress gradients that might modulate these properties. Here, we investigated whether the richness-biomass relationship in macrobenthic subtidal communities is still apparent after accounting for environmental stress gradients in Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica. Measurements of biomass of mobile and sessile macrobenthic taxa were conducted in the austral summer 2013/4 across two environmental stress gradients: distance from nearest glaciers and subtidal depth (from 5 to 30 m). In general, community biomass increased with distance from glaciers and water depth. However, generalised additive models showed that distance from glaciers and depth accounted for negligible proportions of variation in the number of functional groups (i.e., functional richness) and community biomass when compared to taxonomic richness. Functional richness and community biomass were positive and saturating functions of taxonomic richness. Large endemic, canopy-forming brown algae of the order Desmarestiales dominated the community biomass across both gradients. Accordingly, differences in the composition of taxa accounted for a significant and large proportion (51%) of variation in community biomass in comparison with functional richness (10%). Our results suggest that the environmental factors here analysed may be less important than biodiversity in shaping mesoscale (several km) biomass patterns in this Antarctic system. We suggest that further manipulative, hypothesis-driven research should address the role of biodiversity and species' functional traits in the responses of Antarctic subtidal communities to environmental variation.

AB A large reservoir of soil nitrate in desert subsoil zones has been demonstrated in previous studies; however, information on the subsoil nitrate reservoir and its distribution characteristics in the deserts of China is still limited. This study investigated the distribution patterns of soil total nitrogen (N), nitrate, ammonium, and stable isotopic ratios of N-15 (delta N-15) in shallow (1 m) and subsoil (5 m) profiles in three types of dunes in the Mu Us desert of China. We found that soil N retention of the fixed and semi-fixed dunes followed a progressive nutrient depletion pattern in shallow soil profiles, whereas the subsoil nitrate of the fixed, semi-fixed and mobile dunes maintained a conservative accumulation pattern. The results indicate that the subsoil of the Mu Us desert may act as a reservoir of available nitrate. Furthermore, a soil delta N-15 analysis indicate that the nitrate content of the fixed dune is likely derived from soil nitrification, whereas the nitrate content in the mobile dune is derived from atmospheric nitrate deposition. Within the context of looming climate change and intensifying human activities, the subsoil nitrate content in the deserts of northern China could become mobilized and increase environmental risks to groundwater.

AB We used imaging spectroscopy to perform a top-down mesoscale analysis of tropical tree species richness across a bioclimatic gradient in Panama. The expressed precipitation gradient from the wet Caribbean side to the dry Pacific side makes Panama an excellent study area for performing a mesoscale assessment of climate effects on tropical tree species richness. Spatial patterns in local spectral variability (expressed as the coefficient of variation) and spectral similarity (expressed as the spectral similarity index) were used as proxies for species area curves and species distance decay curves. Our analysis revealed significant spectral changes along the precipitation gradient. Highest spectral diversity was observed for moist forest sites while lowest diversity was observed for the driest forest sites. Most of the spectral variation came from changes in the visible (VIS) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) reflectance. Variation in the VIS was significantly higher for the dry compared to the moist and wet forests, while the opposite was true for the NIR and SWIR reflectance. Our spectral mesoscale analysis extends previous results suggesting that niche differentiation with respect to soil water availability is a direct determinant of both local- and regional-scale distributions of tropical trees. A next step would be to test the accuracy and scalability of our results with lower spatial resolution spectrometer data, simulating the observing conditions that will be achieved with future satellite missions such as the European Union's EnMap and NASA's HyspIRI missions.

AB Ethnopharmacological importance: The use of medicinal plants for treatment, cure and prevention of diseases has been described by many people since time immemorial. Because of this use, commercial and scientific interests have emerged, making it necessary to realize ethnobotanical surveys of medicinal plants species, which is important for subsequent chemical and pharmacological bioprospections. Aim of the study: This study aimed at surveying, identifying, cataloging and documenting the medicinal plants species used in the Valley of Juruena, Northwestern Mato Grosso, Legal Amazon Brazil for the treatment of various human diseases, as well as assessed the species of interest for bioprospecting potential.
   Materials and methods: Informants were interviewed using semi-structured form to capture information on socio-demographic and ethnopharmacological data of medicinal plants such as vernacular name, uses, geographic origin, habit, form of preparation and part used.
   Results were analyzed using descriptive and quantitative means: indices of use-report (Ur) and informant consensus factor (ICF), for the selection of plant species with therapeutic potential. Results: Three hundred and thirty two (332) plants species belonging to 90 families were reported for medicinal purposes and totaling 3973 use-reports were reported by 365 (92.9%) of the people interviewed. Asteraceae (32.2%), Fabaceae (26.7%) and Lamiaceae (24.4%) families were the most represented, with majority being species native (64.45%) to Brazil. Leaves (64.5%) were the part of the plant most used and infusion (45.7%) was the most utilized form. Gastrointestinal disorders followed by respiratory complaints topped the list of use-reports. The native or naturalized plants with the highest use reports in the order of decreasing absolute frequency per each emic-category are Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapfc (104), Mentha pulegium L (94), Arrabidaea chica (Humb. 82 Bonpl.) B. Verl. (97), Altemanthera brasiliana (L) Kuntze (71), Baccharis crispa Spreng (57), Phyllanthus niruri L (48), Gossypium barbadense L. (44), Solidago microglossa DC. (40) and Bauhinia forficata L. (20). And the most cited exotics are: Chenopodium ambrosioides L (151), Aloe vera (L) Burm. E, (89) and Rosmarinus officinalis L (72). In some cases, high ICF values were found, which reflects high degree of homogeneity of consensus among informants in this region on medicinal plants.
   Conclusion: The population of Valle of Juruena makes use of a wide array of medicinal plants distributed in all use categories with predominance of those use in the treatments of gastrointestinal and respiratory ailments. The therapeutic potential of some of the species of medicinal importance extensively utilized by the population of the region have been scientifically validated, and are therefore promising prototype of new drugs. However, there are some of these species whose ethnomedicinal uses are yet to be scientifically verified and thus constitute an unexplored terrain for future biological/pharmacological studies.

AB Diurnal human activity and domestic dogs in agro-forestry mosaics should theoretically modify the diurnal habitat use patterns of native carnivores, with these effects being scale-dependent. We combined intensive camera trapping data with Bayesian occurrence probability models to evaluate both diurnal and nocturnal patterns of space use by carnivores in a mosaic of land-use types in southern Chile. A total of eight carnivores species were recorded, including human-introduced dogs. During the day the most frequently detected species were the culpeo fox and the cougar. Conversely, during the night, the kodkod and chilla fox were the most detected species. The best supported models showed that native carnivores responded differently to landscape attributes and dogs depending on both the time of day as well as the spatial scale of landscape attributes. The positive effect of native forest cover at 250m and 500 m radius buffers was stronger during the night for the Darwin's fox and cougar. Road density at 250m scale negatively affected the diurnal occurrence of Darwin's fox, whereas at 500m scale roads had a stronger negative effect on the diurnal occurrence of Darwin's foxes and cougars. A positive effect of road density on dog occurrence was evidenced during both night and day. Patch size had a positive effect on cougar occurrence during night whereas it affected negatively the occurrence of culpeo foxes and skunks during day. Dog occurrence had a negative effect on Darwin's fox occurrence during day-time and night-time, whereas its negative effect on the occurrence of cougar was evidenced only during day-time. Carnivore occurrences were not influenced by the proximity to a conservation area. Our results provided support for the hypothesis that diurnal changes to carnivore occurrence were associated with human and dog activity. Landscape planning in our study area should be focused in reducing both the levels of diurnal human activity in native forest remnants and the dispersion rates of dogs into these habitats.

   MAINTENANCE; ASSUMPTION; EXCLUSION; EVOLUTION; INVASION
AB If two species live on a single resource, the one with a slight advantage will out-compete the other: complete competitors cannot coexist. This is known as the competitive exclusion principle. If no extinction occurs, it is because evolutionary adaptation to slightly different niches takes place. Therefore, it is widely accepted that ecological communities are assembled by evolutionary differentiation and progressive adaptation of species to different niches. However, some ecologists have recently challenged this classic paradigm highlighting the importance of chance and stochastidty. Using a synthetic framework for community dynamics, here we show that, while deterministic descriptors predict coexistence, species similarity is limited in a more restrictive way in the presence of stochasticity. We analyse the stochastic extinction phenomenon, showing that extinction occurs as competitive overlap increases above a certain threshold well below its deterministic counterpart. We also prove that the extinction threshold cannot be ascribed only to demographic fluctuations around small population sizes. The more restrictive limit to species similarity is, therefore, a consequence of the complex interplay between competitive interactions and ecological drift. As a practical implication, we show that the existence of a stochastic limit to similarity has important consequences in the recovery of fragmented habitats.

AB Ants are major contributors to ecological processes including soil development, nutrient cycling, and seed dispersal in the northeastern US and around the world. However, distributions of these influential invertebrates in the inland Pitch Pine barrens of New York State are poorly understood. I used quadrat searches and pitfall traps to systematically sample ant assemblages along transects in open habitats at 3 of these inland barrens. My results demonstrate that (1) inland Pitch Pine barrens in New York support high ant-species density, including rare species; (2) as in other regions, shrubland habitats appear to support higher ant-species density than grassland habitats in the Northeast; and (3) shrubland and grassland ant-assemblages in these barrens are compositionally distinct.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the growth and survival of seven native tree species in different treatments in a degraded area at COPASA Reserve (Juramento, MG). Approximately 1.2 ha area was used, where 899 seedlings were planted of seven native species (Anadenanthera colubrina, Copaifera langsdorffii, Dilodendron bipinatum, Miracrodruon urundeuva, Pterogyne nitens, Schinopsis brasiliensis and Senegalia polyphylla) followed for 24 months. The area was divided into five plots of 0.24 ha, which represented the following treatments: (T1) plot sown with grass (Brachiaria sp.); (T2) plot where the pits were treated with soil conditioner; (T3) plot sown with grass and legumes (Cajanus cajan) together; (T4) plot sown with legumes; and (T5) control. The mortality percentage was higher in T2 and lower in T3, and the species C. langsdorffii (43.66%) and S. brasiliensis (11.64%) were the ones with higher and lower mortality rate, respectively. The growth (height and diameter) of seedlings was higher in T2 (24.32 +/- 26.05 cm and 0.51 +/- 0.37 mm; respectively) and lowest in T1 (10,82 +/- 22,57 cm and 0,26 +/- 0,27 mm; respectively). The species with the largest growth in height were A. colubrina and S. polyphylla, and D. bipinatum and S. brasiliensis showed the highest growth in diameter Pterogyne nitens showed the lowest growth, and highest mortality, presenting low ability to establish in degraded environments.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the foraging dynamic of an ant community in an urban semideciduous mesophitic forest. A total of 4,297 individuals, distributed in 23 species, seven genera and four subfamilies were sampled in January, April, July and October of 2010. Four ant species guilds were found: leaf cutters, soil-dominant omnivores, soil and vegetation opportunists and large-sized epigaeic predators. There were no significant differences in total of species richness and abundance of individuals in samples among the months evaluated. However, there was a clear substitution (turnover) of species over the months. Nine species were sampled exclusively in the rainy period and five species were present only during the dry period. Thus, the species turnover over the months support the hypothesis that ant communities present a temporal dynamics in their foraging activities even in an urban forest fragment. In general, the abundance of ants foraging on soil was greatest during the months with greater rainfall. However, two species belonging to the guild of opportunistic ants from soil and vegetation doubled the number of foraging individuals in period during the months with less precipitation. These findings support that ant communities, independent of isolation and environment (urban or natural), have temporal dynamics that arise from factors relating to the biology and behavior of the group.

AB A variety of Amazonian mammals serve as sources of food for its human inhabitants, but hunting can have a strong negative impact on them. Diversity, abundance, biomass, and average group size of medium-sized and large mammals are compared across two forest areas of the northern Amazon: the Virua National Park (protected) and the Novo Paraiso settlement (a human settlement where hunting is permitted). Hunting pressure was also characterized in Novo Paraiso. A total of 33 mammal species were recorded. There were no significant differences in the sighting rates, relative abundance and biomass, and mammal group sizes between the two areas, although the totals of all these variables were higher in Virua due to the higher abundance of Tayassu pecari, which was not recorded at Novo Paraiso. It is suggested that T. pecari may be on the verge of local extinction, as it was the most hunted species in the settlement area. Through interviews with 50 hunters, we estimate that 541 mammals of 20 species were hunted during the study year, resulting in an estimated biomass take of 8517 kg. While the hunting intensity in Novo Paraiso may be sustainable in the short term, the reported decline of hunting efficiency, combined with the extirpation of T. pecari, suggests that mammal abundance may decline there in the near future. In the study year, 849 hunts were carried out in a hunting effort of 4575 hours, with a maximum distance travelled of 5.4 km. There was an average of 4.82 consumers for each hunt, and a per capita harvest rate of 2.24 individuals/consumer year. Hunting was not only for subsistence, but also for retaliation, although some species may not be hunted due to cultural taboos. The need for quantification of harvesting rates to maintain hunting at sustainable levels is highlighted.

AB Recruitment limitation, measured by the failure of some species to arrive and establish in a site, is potentially an important process contributing to the diversity of plant communities. Limited seed production, seed dispersal, and seedling emergence due to abiotic and/or niche-dependent factors result in opportunities for less abundant species to persist. Whereas limitations affecting early phases of plant establishment are relatively well known, the less-examined limitations upon recruitment into more advanced life history stages may also contribute to the maintenance of diversity. We tested this hypothesis by decomposing recruitment limitation into seed limitation, emergence limitation (to seedlings), establishment limitation (saplings) and persistence limitation (adults) in high- and low-diversity communities. We found evidences of recruitment limitation in all ontogenetic stages, but no differences between the examined communities. Limitations in seed, seedling, saplings and adults were explained mainly by abundance in the previous stage. The negative effect of abundance of a given stage on the abundance of the next stage (negative density-dependent plant establishment) was more evident in the high diversity community. There was a reduction in species' abundance and an increase in species richness from the seed to the adult stages, resulting in an increase in the evenness along ontogenetic stages in both communities; in all stages, the high-diversity community was richer than the low-diversity community. We found evidence that recruitment limitation operates at multiple stages and is density dependent in these two tropical forests. Our results also suggest that these effects may be stronger in the high-diversity community. Thus, recruitment limitation mediated by density dependence across multiple ontogenetic stages has to be considered in future studies of factors maintaining diversity in tropical forests.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Carbon (C) allocation to storage in woody tissues at the expense of growth is thought to promote shade tolerance, yet few studies on the subject examined C storage during maximum growth and considered stand influences. I asked how C storage in different plant tissues relates to shade tolerance in temperate forests with contrasting climates and physiognomies, and whether relationships vary during the growing season.
   METHODS: In the late spring and late summer, I harvested seedlings of eight species with contrasting light requirements from the understory of a cold rainforest and a Mediterranean forest in Chile. Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations and pools (i.e., biomass x NSC concentration) were determined in leaves, aboveground wood, and roots. The effects of shade tolerance and sampling date on the NSCs were analyzed for each forest and tissue with linear mixed-effects models.
   KEY RESULTS: In both forests, concentrations of NSC and soluble sugars in woody tissues, as well as fractions of NSC in these tissues, were lower in shade tolerant than in shade intolerant species. For root NSC concentrations, these trends depended on the sampling date: in the late spring the concentrations were similar in shade tolerant and intolerant species, while in the late summer they were lower in shade tolerant species.
   CONCLUSIONS: Shade tolerance is not linked to C storage in the two studied forests, suggesting that allocation to growth or defenses could be more advantageous for low light persistence. Alternatively, high levels of C storage could be also selected in shade intolerant species to face herbivory or drought.

AB Studies have shown that median distances of plants from the nearest reproductive conspecific (recruitment distance) shifts outward with increasing age or size class, and that plant spatial distribution changes over time in a predictable manner. However, observations and empirical evidence for such predictable changes are limited, and underlying mechanisms explaining such patterns for a wide range of individual sizes are not fully explored. In Costa Rican premontane wet forests, I empirically tested whether recruitment distance changes in a predictable manner with increasing size for five animal-dispersed tree species by considering all post-germination sizes. Specifically, I tested the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and the colonization hypothesis by considering distance, density, size, herbivory, biotic infection, and light availability simultaneously. Recruitment distance increased with increasing size (16-22m) for the four non-pioneer species, suggesting eventual regeneration success for seeds dispersed away from reproductive conspecifics. During the 2years of this study, I found positive distance-dependent survivorship and light availability were important for post-seedling survivorship, in agreement with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and the colonization hypothesis, respectively, but only for seedlings. However, seedlings did not escape aboveground herbivory or biotic infection better when the seeds were dispersed greater distances. Results highlight the importance of seed dispersal for successful regeneration, and suggest that changes in spatial distribution over time may be predictable in the vicinity of maternal trees for some non-pioneer tree species.
   Resumen Estudios han demostrado que la distancia media de los individuos a su mas cercano conspecifico reproductor (distancia de reclutamiento) se amplia con el aumento de la edad o clase de tamano, y que la distribucion espacial de las plantas puede cambiar con el tiempo de una manera predecible. Sin embargo, las observaciones y datos empiricos para tales los cambios previsibles son limitadas, y los mecanismos subyacentes que explican estos patrones para una amplia gama de tamanos individuales no son completamente explorado. En bosques humedos premonranos en Costa Rica, probe empiricamente si la distancia de reclutamiento cambia de una forma predecible con el aumento del tamano de cinco especies de arboles, dispersadas por animales, considerando todos los tamanos posteriores a la germinacion. En concreto, me demostrar la hipotesis Janzen-Connell y la hipotesis de colonizacion, considerando distancia, densidad, tamano, herbivoros, infeccion biotica, y disponibilidad de luz al mismo tiempo. La distancia de reclutamiento aumento con el aumento del tamano de (16-22m) cuatro de las especies no pioneras, lo que sugiere un eventual exito de las semillas dispersadas lejos de sus conspecificos reproductivos. Durante los dos anos de este estudio, he encontrado supervivencia dependiente positivamente de la distancia y la disponibilidad de luz fueron importantes para la sobrevivencia posterior a la germinacion, de acuerdo con la hipotesis Janzen-Connell, pero solo para plantulas. Sin embargo, las plantulas no se escaparon mejor de la herbivoria o la infeccion biotica cuando se las semillas se dispersaron a mayor distancia. Resultados aqui resaltan la importancia de la dispersion de semillas para una regeneracion exitosa, y sugieren que cambios en la distribucion espacial en el tiempo puede ser predecible en las cercanias los arboles maternales para algunas especies de arboles no pioneras.

AB Many leaf-cutter ant species are well known pests in Latin America, including species of the genera Acromyrtnex and Atta. An environmentally friendly strategy to reduce the number of leafcutter ants and avoid indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides is biological control. In this work we evaluated the effectiveness of a strain of the entomopathogen Putpureocillium lilacinum, against worker ants from six Acromyrmex lundii field colonies, after immersions in pure suspensions at a concentration of 1 x 10(6) conidia ml(-1). Survival of ants treated with P. lilacinum was significantly lower than that recorded in controls, and median lethal time (LT50) was 6-7 days. P. lilacinum was responsible for 85.6% (80.6-89.7) of the mortality in inoculated ants, in which we found that the percentage of other entomopathogens that naturally infected ants decreased also, suggesting a good competitive capability of the fungus. Horizontal transmission to non-inoculated ants was also evidenced, given that 58.5% (41.9-64.2) of them died because of P. lilacinum. Moreover, we tested pathogenicity for three concentrations of this strain (1.0 x 10(4), 10(6) and 10(8) conidia ml(-1)) and found a significantly faster mortality of ants and greater median percentage of infection at 10(6) conidia ml(-1) of P. lilacinum. CL50 value was 2.8 x 10(5) conidia ml(-1). We thus propose the use of P. lilacinum as a biological control agent of leafcutter ants in crops and plantations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding the role of predation in regulating prey diversity is a major goal in ecology, with profound consequences for community dynamics, ecosystem structure, and conservation practice. Deterministic differential equation models predict that same predation regimes, such as prey-switching predation, should promote prey coexistence and increase prey diversity. However, such models do not capture stochastic population fluctuations that are ubiquitous in empirical study sites and nature reserves. In this article, we examine the effects of prey-switching predation on the species richness of prey communities with demographic noise. We show that in finite, discrete prey populations, the ability of prey-switching predation to promote diversity depends on the carrying capacity of the prey community and the richness of the source pool for prey. Identical predation regimes may have opposite effects on prey diversity depending on the size and productivity of the habitat or the meta-community richness. Statistical properties of the fluctuations of prey populations determine the effect of stabilizing mechanisms on species richness. We discuss the implications of this result for empirical studies of predation in small study areas and for the management of small nature reserves.

AB Tropical forests store vast amounts of carbon and are the most biodiverse terrestrial habitats, yet they are being converted and degraded at alarming rates. Given global shortfalls in the budgets required to prevent carbon and biodiversity loss, we need to seek solutions that simultaneously address both issues. Of particular interest are carbon-based payments under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism to also conserve biodiversity at no additional cost. One potential is for REDD+ to protect forest fragments, especially within biomes where contiguous forest cover has diminished dramatically, but we require empirical tests of the strength of any carbon and biodiversity cobenefits in such fragmented systems. Using the globally threatened Atlantic Forest landscape, we measured above- ground carbon stocks within forest fragments spanning 13 to 23 442 ha in area and with different degrees of isolation. We related these stocks to tree community structure and to the richness and abundance of endemic and IUCN Red-listed species. We found that increasing fragment size has a positive relationship with above- ground carbon stock and with abundance of IUCN Red-listed species and tree community structure. We also found negative relationships between distance from large forest block and tree community structure, endemic species richness and abundance, and IUCN Red-listed species abundance. These resulted in positive congruence between carbon stocks and Red-listed species, and the abundance and richness of endemic species, demonstrating vital cobenefits. As such, protecting forest fragments in hotspots of biodiversity, particularly larger fragments and those closest to sources, offers important carbon and biodiversity cobenefits. More generally, our results suggest that macroscale models of cobenefits under REDD+ have likely overlooked key benefits at small scales, indicating the necessity to apply models that include finer-grained assessments in fragmented landscapes rather than using averaged coarse-grained cells.

AB Understanding the processes that underlie species diversity and abundance in a community is a fundamental issue in community ecology. While the species abundance distributions (SADs) of various natural communities may be well explained by Hubbell's neutral model, it has been repeatedly pointed out that Hubbell's SAD-fitting approach lacks the ability to detect the effects of non-neutral factors such as niche differentiation; however, our understanding of its quantitative effect is limited. Herein, we conducted extensive simulations to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the SAD-fitting method and other recently developed tests. For simulations, we developed a niche model that incorporates the random stochastic demography of individuals and the nonrandom replacements of those individuals, i.e. niche differentiation. It therefore allows us to explore situations with various degrees of niche differentiation. We found that niche differentiation has strong effects on SADs and the number of species in the community under this model. We then examined the performance of these neutrality tests, including Hubbell's SAD-fitting method, using extensive simulations. It was demonstrated that all these tests have relatively poor performance except for the cases with very strong niche structure, which is in accordance with previous studies. This is likely because two important parameters in Hubbell's model are usually unknown and are commonly estimated from the data to be tested. To demonstrate this point, we showed that the precise estimation of the two parameters substantially improved the performance of these neutrality tests, indicating that poor performance can be owed to overfitting Hubbell's neutral model with unrealistic parameters. Our results therefore emphasize the importance of accurate parameter estimation, which should be obtained from data independent of the local community to be tested.

AB Changes in weather and land use are transforming the spatial and temporal characteristics of fire regimes in Amazonia, with important effects on the functioning of dense (i.e., closed-canopy), open-canopy, and transitional forests across the Basin. To quantify, document, and describe the characteristics and recent changes in forest fire regimes, we sampled 6 million ha of these three representative forests of the eastern and southern edges of the Amazon using 24 years (1983-2007) of satellite-derived annual forest fire scar maps and 16 years of monthly hot pixel information (1992-2007). Our results reveal that changes in forest fire regime properties differentially affected these three forest types in terms of area burned and fire scar size, frequency, and seasonality. During the study period, forest fires burned 15% (0.3 million ha), 44% (1 million ha), and 46% (0.6 million ha) of dense, open, and transitional forests, respectively. Total forest area burned and fire scar size tended to increase over time (even in years of average rainfall in open canopy and transitional forests). In dense forests, most of the temporal variability in fire regime properties was linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related droughts. Compared with dense forests, transitional and open forests experienced fires twice as frequently, with at least 20% of these forests' areas burning two or more times during the 24-year study period. Open and transitional forests also experienced higher deforestation rates than dense forests. During drier years, the end of the dry season was delayed by about a month, which resulted in larger burn scars and increases in overall area burned later in the season. These observations suggest that climate-mediated forest flammability is enhanced by landscape fragmentation caused by deforestation, as observed for open and transitional forests in the Eastern portion of the Amazon Basin.

AB Deforestation and fragmentation influence the microclimate, vegetation structure, and composition of remaining patches of tropical forest. In the southern Amazon, at the frontier of cropland expansion, forests are converted and fragmented in a pattern that leaves standing riparian forests whose dimensions are mandated by the Brazilian National Forest Code. These altered riparian forests share many characteristics of well-studied upland forest fragments, but differ because they remain connected to larger areas of forest downstream, and because they may experience wetter soil conditions because reduction of forest cover in the surrounding watershed raises groundwater levels and increases stream runoff. We compared forest regeneration, structure, composition, and diversity in four areas of intact riparian forest and four areas each of narrow, medium, and wide altered riparian forests that have been surrounded by agriculture since the early 1980s. We found that seedling abundance was reduced by as much as 64% and sapling abundance was reduced by as much as 67% in altered compared to intact riparian forests. The most pronounced differences between altered and intact forest occurred near forest edges and within the narrowest sections of altered riparian forests. Woody plant species composition differed and diversity was reduced in altered forests compared to intact riparian forests. However, despite being fragmented for several decades, large woody plant biomass and carbon storage, the number of live or dead large woody plants, mortality rates, and the size distribution of woody plants did not differ significantly between altered and intact riparian forests. Thus, even in these relatively narrow forests with high edge : area ratios, we saw no evidence of the increases in mortality and declines in biomass that have been found in other tropical forest fragment studies. However, because of the changes in both species community and reduced regeneration, it is unclear how long this relative lack of change will be sustained. Additionally, Brazil recently passed a law in their National Forest Code allowing narrower riparian buffers than those studied here in restored areas, which could affect their long-term sustainability.

AB In Latin America, payment for environmental services (PES) is a tool for watershed conservation that is becoming increasingly promoted by some government agencies, international development organisations and environmental NGOs. However, in pursuit of conservation, PES initiatives implemented at the watershed level may conceal the environmental impacts on local communities of private actors funding PES initiatives. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, focus groups and archival research in the Cauca Valley, Colombia, we present the case of a PES scheme in which several commercial water users paid for the conservation of the upper part of the Nima watershed as a means of securing the flow of water upon which they rely. We show how the scheme was predicated upon very selective interpretations of degradation and conservation, and the roles of those deemed responsible for them, that were mobilised by those groups paying for environmental services to the detriment of other water users.

AB 1. The expansion of agriculture has led to forest loss and fragmentation, resulting in dramatic biodiversity impoverishment. Surprisingly, few studies have assessed forest fragmentation effects on leaf-cutting ant assemblages, and none has dealt with effects on their community richness and composition, despite their known role as key herbivores and ecosystem engineers.
   2. We analysed forest area and edge effects on leaf-cutting ant abundance, richness and assemblage composition, by recording and identifying colonies along edge and interior transects in 12 Chaco Serrano forest remnants of different sizes, in Central Argentina. We also explored leaf-cutting ant presence in the adjacent soybean matrix.
   3. We recorded five leaf-cutting ant species, in the genus Acromyrmex. In the soybean matrix, colonies of three species were observed, which were also found at the forest edge. Within the forest, edges sustained more species and colonies than interior habitats, whereas forest area was linked positively to colony abundance. Taxonomic composition of leaf-cutting ant assemblages reflected both area and edge effects.
   4. Our results revealed overall positive edge and area effects on leaf-cutting ant communities, highlighting differential species-specific responses and a possible role for Acromyrmex crassispinus as a forest status indicator. According to our findings, an increase in edge habitats may favour most leaf-cutting ant species, providing a suitable interface for access to the cultivated matrix, but hindering species associated with undisturbed forest conditions. As leaf-cutting ants are acknowledged as cornerstones of ecosystem functioning, the consequences of these trends may be far reaching.

AB Understanding coexistence in high biodiversity ecosystems requires knowledge of how rare and common species share the multidimensional environmental space. Climatic and edaphic conditions can provide a plethora of habitats, supporting different compositional and structural communities where species can adapt and differentiate. We used a large data set consisting of 580 tropical tree species sampled in 163 25x25m quadrats along an altitudinal gradient covering an area of 160km(2) of tropical rain forest in Jianfengling reserve (Hainan Island, China). For each plot, the data include tree species and abundance, altitude and six soil properties from which a two dimensional environmental space was constructed. With this extensive data set, we tested the hypothesis that different combination of environmental factors can generate multiple hotspots on three axes of diversity: species richness, Shannon-equivalent species richness and habitat preference, a measure of evenness in the distribution of individuals across an environmental gradient. We found that humid and cool areas with more nitrogen availability were occupied by richer and more diverse communities of wide range species. Rare (in terms of number of individuals) and range-restricted species instead, tended to prefer minor habitats, generally warmer with high potassium, calcium, magnesium and, in particular, phosphorous. As a result, wide and range-restricted species were segregated across the environmental space.Synthesis. Our findings indicate rare species tend to occur more frequently where common species are less abundant. A clear pattern of species richness and diversity was driven by a combination of several environmental factors (soil properties and climate). The complexity of the environment not only explains the different species distribution along each habitat, but also determines the relative abundance of each species in the entire community. Although some habitats have low species richness and diversity, they are highly preferred by rare species; therefore, biodiversity conservation efforts should consider protecting these fragile ecosystems.

AB Climate and initial litter quality are the major factors influencing decomposition rates on large scales. We established a comprehensive database of terrestrial leaf litter decomposition, including 785 datasets, to examine the relationship between climate and litter quality and evaluate the factors controlling decomposition on a global scale, the arid and semi-arid (AS) zone, the humid middle and humid low (HL) latitude zones. Initial litter nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration only increased with mean annual temperature (MAT) in the AS zone and decreased with mean annual precipitation (MAP) in the HL zone. Compared with nutrient content, MAT imposed less effect on initial litter lignin content than MAP. MAT were the most important decomposition driving factors on a global scale as well as in different climatic zones. MAP only significantly affected decomposition constants in AS zone. Although litter quality parameters also showed significant influence on decomposition, their importance was less than the climatic factors. Besides, different litter quality parameters exerted significant influence on decomposition in different climatic zones. Our results emphasized that climate consistently exerted important effects on decomposition constants across different climatic zones.

AB Primates along with many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic ecological conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats. One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest-savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non-tree species ( liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non-tree plants have been defined as fallback and non-preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forest-savannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We have a limited understanding of the relative contributions of different processes that regulate microbial communities, which are crucial components of both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The contributions of selective and neutral processes in defining community composition are often confounded in field studies because as one moves through space, environments also change. Managed ecosystems provide an excellent opportunity to control for this and evaluate the relative strength of these processes by minimising differences between comparable niches separated at different geographic scales. We use next-generation sequencing to characterize the variance in fungal communities inhabiting adjacent fruit, soil and bark in comparable vineyards across 1000 kms in New Zealand. By compartmentalizing community variation, we reveal that niche explains at least four times more community variance than geographic location. We go beyond merely demonstrating that different communities are found in both different niches and locations by quantifying the forces that define these patterns. Overall, selection unsurprisingly predominantly shapes these microbial communities, but we show the balance of neutral processes also have a significant role in defining community assemblage in eukaryotic microbes.

AB QuestionWhat are the conditions necessary for the establishment and development of seedlings and an early stage sapling community in an old-growth cloud forest? Cloud forests are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world; however, recruitment patterns in these forests remain largely unknown.
   LocationCloud Forest, Northern Peruvian Andes.
   MethodsWe constructed a sapling community model through the unconstrained technique of non-metric multidimensional scaling. We related the distribution of saplings of each species to the distance from conspecific adult (potential parent) trees through a point pattern analysis. We also used zero-inflated Poisson models to investigate the relationship between sapling distributions and environmental conditions and forest structure.
   ResultsWe found that recruitment in woody plant species tends to be widely spread throughout the forest. The distribution of some sapling species was either positively or negatively related to the position of adult conspecific trees. Several species tended to occur within particular microhabitat conditions, with some differentiation between canopy and understorey species.
   ConclusionsCloud forest species recruitment may require the cover provided by the forest canopy. Under closed canopy conditions, both dispersal assembly and niche assembly mechanisms appear to simultaneously influence sapling distribution. The different strategies of various species may result in a trade-off between the importance of microhabitat conditions and distance mechanisms, with one prevailing over the other, depending on species and forest structure conditions.

AB QuestionDo precipitation, temperature and seasonality drive variation in the seed size of Amazonian tree genera?
   LocationAmazonia.
   MethodsWe use a combination of global biodiversity information facility (GBIF) records, climatic data from BIOCLIM and seed size categories derived from the literature.
   ResultsTree genera with very small seeds were associated with lower temperatures and higher seasonality, but not with precipitation; the opposite patterns being observed for trees with large seeds. These correlations remained even when the numerically dominant (and ecologically specialized) Fabaceae were removed from the analysis.
   ConclusionsOur findings indicate that Amazonian tree genera with smaller seeds occur more frequently in transitional or seasonal forests, and genera with large seeds are more associated with climatically stable rain forests (warmer and less seasonality). These results are broadly consistent with the recruitment hypothesis', which predicts that large seeds have a competitive advantage in closed canopy forest vegetation.

AB The global oceans contribute to human wellbeing by providing marine ecosystermservices, but the ability of the oceans to continue providing these services is jeopardised by anthropogenic impacts. There is a limit to marine conservation that has not been adequately addressed: finance. This paper reviews the state of marine conservation funding, identifies associated challenges, and recommends possible ways forward. We identify five challenges: 1) funding for marine conservation is inadequate in terms of the size, duration, and diversity of revenue, 2) finance mechanisms are under-developed and under-utilised, 3) finance is often disconnected from conservation planning, 4) the environmental side-effects of economic activity increase the gap in global conservation funding, and 5) few individuals and programmes specialise in marine conservation finance and integrate its disparate lines of thinking. We then propose five solutions: 1) financial strategies for marine conservation, 2) increased research on and development of finance mechanisms, 3) integration of financial planning into conservation planning, 4) engagement of businesses in reducing the gap in conservation funding for marine ecosystems, and 5) definition, focus, and specialists for the emerging field of marine conservation finance. Multi-sector and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to reduce the marine conservation-funding gap and sustain marine ecosystem services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Brazilian Cerrado is recognized as one of the most threatened biomes in the world, as the region has experienced a striking change from natural Cerrado vegetation to intense cash crop production. This paper reviews the history of land conversion in the Cerrado and the development of soil properties and water resources under past and ongoing land use. We compared soil and water quality parameters from different land uses considering 80 soil and 18 water studies conducted in different regions across the Cerrado to provide quantitative evidence of soil and water alterations from land use change.
   Following the conversion of native Cerrado, significant effects on soil pH, bulk density and available P and K for croplands and less-pronounced effects on pastures were evident. Soil total N did not differ between land uses because most of the sites classified as croplands were nitrogen-fixing soybeans, which are not artificially fertilized with N. In contrast, water quality studies showed nitrogen enrichment in agricultural catchments, indicating fertilizer impacts and potential susceptibility to eutrophication. Regardless of the land use, P is widely absent because of the high-fixing capacities of deeply weathered soils and the filtering capacity of riparian vegetation. Pesticides, however, were consistently detected throughout the entire aquatic system. In several case studies, extremely high-peak concentrations exceeded Brazilian and European Union (EU) water quality limits, which were potentially accompanied by serious health implications. Land use intensification is likely to continue, particularly in regions where less annual rainfall and severe droughts are projected in the northeastern and western Cerrado. Thus, the leaching risk and displacement of agrochemicals are expected to increase, particularly because the current legislation has caused a reduction in riparian vegetation. We conclude that land use intensification is likely to seriously limit the Cerrado's future regarding both agricultural productivity and ecosystem stability. Because only limited data are available, we recommend further field studies to understand the interaction between terrestrial and aquatic systems. This study may serve as a valuable database for integrated modelling to investigate the impact of land use and climate change on soil and water resources and to test and develop mitigation measures for the Cerrado.

AB Australia's urban landscapes offer opportunities to marry socio-economic and biodiversity conservation objectives. Yet, information is needed on what urban landscape and habitat features are important for wildlife. In this article, we draw together our research from southeastern Australia to describe key lessons for biodiversity-sensitive cities and towns. Lesson 1: The effects of urbanization on wildlife extend into adjacent habitats. We recommend retaining large, undisturbed areas of habitat away from development, avoiding intensive development adjacent to important conservation areas, prioritizing areas of ecological and social significance, screening light and noise pollution at the urban fringe and around large nature reserves, and planting appropriately provenanced locally native species for public streetscapes, parks and gardens. Lesson 2: Strategic enhancement of urban greenspace offers biodiversity gains. We recommend increasing the total amount of greenspace cover, maintaining ecological structures as habitat islands, using landscaping techniques to minimize risks to human safety, and gardening with low-flowering native shrubs. Lesson 3: Large old trees need to be managed for long-term sustainability. We recommend retaining large old trees in new developments, increasing the maximum standing life of urban trees, protecting regenerating areas and planting more seedlings, supplementing habitat features associated with large trees, and ensuring that young trees have space to grow through time. Lesson 4: Education and engagement connects residents with nature and raises awareness. We recommend education programs to enhance opportunities for residents to experience and learn about biodiversity, engaging residents in the establishment and maintenance of wildlife habitat, providing 'cues to care', facilitating access to garden plants that benefit wildlife, and encouraging cat containment. These lessons provide an evidence-base for implementing conservation and management actions to improve the capacity of our cities and towns to support a diverse and abundant biota.

AB Recent analyses of Amazon runoff and gridded precipitation data suggest an intensification of the hydrological cycle over the past few decades in the following sense: wet season precipitation and peak river runoff (since approximate to 1980) as well as annual mean precipitation (since approximate to 1990) have increased, while dry season precipitation and minimum runoff have slightly decreased. There has also been an increase in the frequency of anomalously severe floods and droughts. To provide context for the special issue on Amazonia and its forests in a warming climate we expand here on these analyses. The contrasting recent changes in wet and dry season precipitation have continued and are generally consistent with changes in catchment-level peak and minimum river runoff as well as a positive trend of water vapor inflow into the basin. Consistent with the river records, the increased vapor inflow is concentrated to the wet season. Temperature has been rising by 0.7 degrees C since 1980 with more pronounced warming during dry months. Suggestions for the cause of the observed changes of the hydrological cycle come from patterns in tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Tropical and North Atlantic SSTs have increased rapidly and steadily since 1990, while Pacific SSTs have shifted during the 1990s from a positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase with warm eastern Pacific temperatures to a negative phase with cold eastern Pacific temperatures. These SST conditions have been shown to be associated with an increase in precipitation over most of the Amazon except the south and southwest. If ongoing changes continue, we expect forests to continue to thrive in those regions where there is an increase in precipitation with the exception of floodplain forests. An increase in flood pulse height and duration could lead to increased mortality at higher levels of the floodplain and, over the long term, to a lateral shift of the zonally stratified floodplain forest communities. Negative effects on forests are mainly expected in the southwest and south, which have become slightly drier and hotter, consistent with tree mortality trends observed at the RAINFOR Amazon forest plot network established in the early 1980s consisting of approximately 150 regularly censused 1ha plots in intact forests located across the whole basin.

AB Fires have consumed a large amount of terrestrial organic carbon and significantly influenced terrestrial ecosystems and the physical climate system over the past century. Although biomass burning has been widely investigated at a global level in recent decades via satellite observations, less work has been conducted to examine the century-scale changes in global fire regimes and fire influences on the terrestrial carbon balance. In this study, we investigated global pyrogenic carbon emissions and fire influences on the terrestrial carbon fluxes from 1901 to 2010 by using a process-based land ecosystem model. Our results show a significant declining trend in global pyrogenic carbon emissions between the early 20th century and the mid-1980s but a significant upward trend between the mid-1980s and the 2000s as a result of more frequent fires in ecosystems with high carbon storage, such as peatlands and tropical forests. Over the past 110years, average pyrogenic carbon emissions were estimated to be 2.43PgCyr(-1) (1Pg=10(15)g), and global average combustion rate (defined as carbon emissions per unit area burned) was 537.85gCm(-2) burned area. Due to the impacts of fires, the net primary productivity and carbon sink of global terrestrial ecosystems were reduced by 4.14PgCyr(-1) and 0.57PgCyr(-1), respectively. Our study suggests that special attention should be paid to fire activities in the peatlands and tropical forests in the future. Practical management strategies, such as minimizing forest logging and reducing the rate of cropland expansion in the humid regions, are in need to reduce fire risk and mitigate fire-induced greenhouse gases emissions.

AB Soil microorganisms regulate fundamental biochemical processes in plant litter decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) transformations. Understanding how microbial communities respond to changes in vegetation is critical for improving predictions of how land-cover change affects belowground carbon storage and nutrient availability. We measured intra-and interannual variability in soil and forest litter microbial community composition and activity via phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and extracellular enzyme activity across a well-replicated, long-term chronosequence of secondary forests growing on abandoned pastures in the wet subtropical forest life zone of Puerto Rico. Microbial community PLFA structure differed between young secondary forests and older secondary and primary forests, following successional shifts in tree species composition. These successional patterns held across seasons, but the microbial groups driving these patterns differed over time. Microbial community composition from the forest litter differed greatly from those in the soil, but did not show the same successional trends. Extracellular enzyme activity did not differ with forest succession, but varied by season with greater rates of potential activity in the dry seasons. We found few robust significant relationships among microbial community parameters and soil pH, moisture, carbon, and nitrogen concentrations. Observed inter- and intrannual variability in microbial community structure and activity reveal the importance of a multiple, temporal sampling strategy when investigating microbial community dynamics with land-use change. Successional control over microbial composition with forest recovery suggests strong links between above and belowground communities.

AB 1. In most ecosystems, ants are a dominant part of the arthropod community. A thorough understanding of their ecological impact, however, has been hampered by limited availability of data on ant abundance. Therefore, we developed a method allowing quick and non-destructive estimates of the biomass of Oecophylla smaragdina colonies in mango plantations.
   2. The method was based on assessments of ant nest volume in relation to ant trail density and biomass content in relation to nest volume. The relationships between these variables were modelled using Bayesian latent variable models. The resulting models predicted ant biomass from ant trail activity with a maximum uncertainty of approximately 75% of the predicted value.
   3. Five O. smaragdina colonies assessed in a mango plantation, ranged in size from 0.67 to 2.98 kg total ant biomass (fresh wt) and 84.578-376.635 workers for the smallest and largest colony respectively. Correspondingly, the density of ants in the plantation was 254 workers m(-2) and a total biomass of 2.0 g ant fresh wt m(-2).
   4. With this proposed method, estimates of O. smaragdina abundance can be obtained non-destructively with a minimum of workload and it enables the scaling up of physiological experiments on per capita rates. Thus, O. smaragdina can serve as a model species providing information on the impact of ants in tropical ecosystems.

AB Premise of research. This represents one of the first studies of the ecology, diversity, and structure of campos de murundus termite savannas in the vast seasonal wetlands of southern Amazonia. We aimed to improve understanding of this threatened system by assessing species richness, abundance, and co-occurrence among trees and herbs of murundus (earth mounds), investigating the environmental and biological mechanisms underlying these patterns, and discussing implications for biodiversity conservation.
   Methodology. We identified every tree, shrub, subshrub, and herb on 373 murundus across 11 ha at Araguaia State Park, southern Amazonia. We constructed species abundance distributions of trees and herbs, assessed best-fit models, and tested for nonrandom patterns of species co-occurrence using checkerboard scores. Using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), we assessed the affinities among tree species and their positions in murundus.
   Pivotal results. A total of 166 species, 123 genera, and 49 families occupied the murundus. The species abundance distribution of trees followed a lognormal distribution, whereas that of herbs was best described by a Mandelbrot distribution. Observed C-score indices for trees and herbs were significantly larger than expected by chance, indicating nonrandom distributions and species segregation among murundus. DCA revealed a strong gradient in species occurrence within murundus, suggesting that internal structuring may be hydrologically based (e.g., variation in mound microrelief).
   Conclusions. Environmental (e.g., flooding) and biological (e.g., competition between plants) factors are important for controlling the occurrence of tree and herb species on the murundus. The murundus function as critical bases for the maintenance of species diversity in this extensive floodplain, thereby deserving recognition among ecosystems with high conservation priorities.

AB Predicting the diet diversity of animals is important to basic and applied ecology. Knowledge of diet diversity in animals helps us understand niche partitioning, functional diversity and ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control and seed dispersal. There is a negative relationship between the length of the digestive tract and diet diversity in animals; however, the role of digestive physiology in determining diet diversity has been ignored. This is especially important in vertebrates with powered flight because, unlike non-flying vertebrates, they have limitations that may constrain gut size. Here, we evaluate the relationship between digestive capacity and diet diversity in Carollinae and Stenodermatinae frugivorous bats. These bats disperse the seeds of plants that are key to Neotropical forest regeneration. Our results show that digestive capacity is a good predictor of diet diversity in Carollinae and Stenodermatinae frugivorous bats (R-2=077). Surprisingly, the most phylogenetically closely related species were not similar in their digestive capacity or diet diversity. The lack of a phylogenetic signal for the traits evaluated implies differences in digestive physiology and diet in closely related species. Our results highlight the predictive usefulness of digestive physiology for understanding the feeding ecology of animals.

AB Aim(1) To synthesize data on the physical and phylogeographical history of the Mexican highlands, with a focus on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), and (2) to propose approaches and analyses needed for examining the interaction of climate and volcanism.
   LocationMexico.
   MethodsWe performed a literature and data survey of the climatic, geological and phylogeographical history of the Mexican highlands. We then assessed how the expected effects of topographic isolation, co-occurring palaeoclimatic fluctuations and volcanism can be tested against the distribution of genetic diversity of high-elevation taxa.
   ResultsThe Mexican highlands present a complex biogeographical, climatic and geological history. Montane taxa have been exposed to a sky-island dynamic through climate fluctuations, allowing for long-term insitu population persistence, while also promoting recent divergence and speciation events. Volcanic activity transformed part of the Mexican highlands during the Pleistocene, mainly in the TMVB, leading to co-occurring climate and topographical changes. The TMVB highlands provide a suitable template to examine how low-latitude mountains can facilitate both the long-term persistence of biodiversity as well as allopatric and parapatric speciation driven by climatic and geological events.
   Main conclusionsClimate fluctuations, together with recent volcanism, have driven the diversification and local persistence of biodiversity within the Mexican highlands. The climate-volcanism interaction is challenging to study; however, this can be overcome by coupling genomic data with landscape analyses that integrate the geological and climatic history of the region.

AB The evolution of self-pollination has long been considered an adaptive strategy to cope with low or variable pollinator service; however, alternative reproductive strategies, such as generalized pollination (>1 pollinator functional group), may also ensure plant reproductive success in environments with inadequate pollinator visitation. Island-mainland systems provide ideal settings to assess the interaction between pollination and breeding systems in response to pollinator visitation because islands are often pollinator-depauperate. This study compared 28 insular and 26 mainland species of Caribbean Gesneriaceae to test the hypothesis that low diversity and possibly low pollinator service on islands would lead to a greater frequency of generalized plant-pollinator interactions and/or a higher potential for autonomous self-pollination in insular than in mainland species. We also assessed the hypothesis that epiphytic species should have greater autofertility than species occurring in other habitats. Pollinator observations conducted in the field from 2004 to 2014 revealed bat, bee, butterfly, hummingbird, moth, and generalized pollination systems. Functional specialization in pollination systems was high in insular (71% of the species) and mainland sites (all species), but generalized and bat-pollinated species were more common on islands. Overall, pollinator visitation rates did not differ between island and mainland; however, for hummingbird-pollinated species, visitation rate was on average three times higher in mainland than island species. Autofertility indices (fruit set of bagged/outcross flowers) ranged from 0 to 1 and did not differ between island and mainland species. Species growing on rocks (rupiculous) and trees (epiphytic) had on average higher autofertility than terrestrial species.Synthesis. This study revealed that alternative reproductive strategies are used in pollinator-depauperate environments. Pollinator visitation is lower in insular hummingbird-pollinated species (the ancestral pollination system of insular Gesneriaceae); therefore, generalized pollination may be considered a reproductive assurance mechanism evolved primarily on island environments. Contrary to the long-standing tenet, however, autonomous self-pollination was similar in island and mainland Gesneriaceae suggesting that: (i) generalized pollination provides a viable alternative to selfing in pollinator-depauperate environments, (ii) autofertility as a reproductive assurance mechanism may be frequent in plant species from mainland regions in environments with unpredictable pollinator visitation and resource availability.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) mediate plant interspecific competition and community structure. However, the magnitude and direction of AMF effects and underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here, we synthesized the results of 304 studies to evaluate how AMF affect plant competition and community structure and which abiotic and biotic conditions in experimental design modify these AMF effects. The magnitude and direction of AMF effects on plant competitive ability (in terms of competitive response) differed markedly among plant functional groups. When AMF inoculum was added, competitive ability was strongly enhanced in N-fixing forbs and was significantly suppressed in C-3 grasses, whereas no effect was observed in C-4 grasses, non-N-fixing forbs and woody species. Furthermore, AMF inoculation increased competitive ability of perennial species when their competitors were annual species. AMF inoculation differentially influenced separate aspects of plant community structure and species composition. AMF inoculation significantly increased plant diversity but had no effects on plant productivity. Response of dominant plant species to AMF inoculation was the determining factor in explaining variations in how and to what degree plant diversity was influenced by AMF inoculation. When dominant species derived strong benefits from AMF, their dominance level was increased by AMF inoculation, which consequently decreased plant diversity. We did not find stronger AMF effects on plant diversity and productivity when greater numbers of AMF species were used in the inoculation.Synthesis. Despite large variations in AMF effects among studies, a unifying mechanism was observed that the mycorrhizal responsiveness (differences in plant growth between AMF and non-AMF colonization treatments) of target and neighbouring plant species can determine AMF effects on the competitive outcome among plant species, which in turn influenced plant species diversity and community composition. Given that plant traits, soil nutrient conditions and probably mycorrhizal fungal traits are all factors determining the degree of mycorrhizal response of plant species, future studies should explicitly consider each of these factors in experimental design to better understand AMF effects on plant coexistence, plant community dynamics and ecosystem processes.

AB Adaptations to resource availability strongly shape patterns of community composition along successional gradients in environmental conditions. In the present study, we examined the extent to which variation in functional composition explains shifts in trait-based functional strategies in young tropical secondary forests during the most dynamic stage of succession (0-20 years). Functional composition of two size classes in 51 secondary forest plots was determined using community-weighted means of seven functional traits, which were intensively measured on 55 woody plant species (n = 875-1,761 individuals). Along the successional gradient in forest structure, there was a significant and consistent shift in functional strategies from resource acquisition to resource conservation. Leaf toughness and adult plant size increased significantly, while net photosynthetic capacity (A (mass)) decreased significantly during succession. Shifts in functional strategies within size classes for A (mass) and wood density also support the hypothesis that changes in functional composition are shaped by environmental conditions along successional gradients. In general, 'hard' functional traits, e.g., A (mass) and leaf toughness, linked to different facets of plant performance exhibited greater sensitivity to successional changes in forest structure than 'soft' traits, such as leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content. Our results also suggested that stochastic processes related to previous land-use history, dispersal limitation, and abiotic factors explained variation in functional composition beyond that attributed to deterministic shifts in functional strategies. Further data on seed dispersal vectors and distance and landscape configuration are needed to improve current mechanistic models of succession in tropical secondary forests.

AB Quercus germana is an endemic species from the cloud forest of Mexico. The selection pressure resulting from fragmentation and environmental changes suggests the presence of phenotypic differentiation. We evaluated the relationship between the environment and the leaf morphology of Q. germane at six sites in the area of Xalapa, Veracruz. Ten leafs of 30 specimens per site were collected. Ten leafs morphometric and seven environmental characteristics were measured and variance analyses were performed with a discriminant analysis. Additionally, UPGMA phylogenetic trees were constructed and the Mahalanobis distances were compared using a Mantel test to estimate the relationship between morphometry and the environment. The morphological variables that best separated the sites were mucrones, ribs and petiole size. Environmentally, the most discriminant variables were light, temperature and loss of humidity. The Mantel test did not show any relationship between the morphometric and the environmental differences (r = 0.090, P = 0.3060), so there is not any association between the two. Because morphological differences were found in sub-populations despite of the short distance between them, these may be affected by fragmentation even without environmental influences.

AB Three options are proposed to improve the accuracy of national forest biomass estimates and decrease the uncertainty related to tree model selection depending on available data and national contexts.
   Different tree volume and biomass equations result in different estimates. At national scale, differences of estimates can be important while they constitute the basis to guide policies and measures, particularly in the context of climate change mitigation.
   Few countries have developed national tree volume and biomass equation databases and have explored its potential to decrease uncertainty of volume and biomasttags estimates. With the launch of the GlobAllomeTree webplatform, most countries in the world could have access to country-specific databases. The aim of this article is to recommend approaches for assessing tree and forest volume and biomass at national level with the lowest uncertainty. The article highlights the crucial need to link allometric equation development with national forest inventory planning efforts.
   Models must represent the tree population considered. Data availability; technical, financial, and human capacities; and biophysical context, among other factors, will influence the calculation process.
   Three options are proposed to improve accuracy of national forest assessment depending on identified contexts. Further improvements could be obtained through improved forest stratification and additional non-destructive field campaigns.

AB Precise identification of plant species requires a high level of knowledge by taxonomists and presence of reproductive material. This represents a major limitation for those working with seedlings and juveniles, which differ morphologically from adults and do not bear reproductive structures. Near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) has previously been shown to be effective in species discrimination of adult plants, so if young and adults have a similar spectral signature, discriminant functions based on FT-NIR spectra of adults can be used to identify leaves from young plants. We tested this with a sample of 419 plants in 13 Amazonian species from the genera Protium and Crepidospermum (Burseraceae). We obtained 12 spectral readings per plant, from adaxial and abaxial surfaces of dried leaves, and compared the rate of correct predictions of species with discriminant functions for different combinations of readings. We showed that the best models for predicting species in early developmental stages are those containing spectral data from both young and adult plants (98% correct predictions of external samples), but even using only adult spectra it is still possible to attain good levels of identification of young. We obtained an average of 75% correct identifications of young plants by discriminant equations based only on adults, when the most informative wavelengths were selected. Most species were accurately predicted (75-100% correct identifications), and only three had poor predictions (27-60%). These results were obtained despite the fact that spectra of young individuals were distinct from those of adults when species were analyzed individually. We concluded that FT-NIR has a high potential in the identification of species even at different ontogenetic stages, and that young plants can be identified based on spectra of adults with reasonable confidence.

AB Natural assemblages are structured by a complex combination of positive and negative interactions, and the relative importance of each interaction can vary across spatial scales. By using a simple interaction web (barnacles-grazers-microphytobenthos) in a rocky intertidal system, we tested the hypothesis that the relative strength of positive and negative interactions would vary as a function of different environmental stress between 2 latitudinal levels and local environmental conditions. We manipulated the cover of barnacles and the presence of limpets at 2 sites in northern and southern Italy and non-destructively examined the response of microphytobenthos (MPB) (photosynthetic biomass, F-0, and maximum efficiency, F-v/F-m) and of its small-sized grazers (littorinids). At northern sites, a density-dependent facilitative effect of barnacles on F-0 was detected. The effect was likely due to the addition of favourable secondary habitat (i.e. barnacle shells) and amelioration of abiotic conditions to nearby rock. At southern sites, a positive effect of increasing barnacle cover was observed on littorinid density. The subsequent indirect trophic effect on F0, in addition to local nutrient input from anthropogenic activities, likely masked the positive effects of increasing cover of barnacles on F0 at this latitude. No factors influenced F-v/F-m, suggesting a lack of changes in the relative abundance of MPB species. There was no effect of excluding herbivores at either latitude. Results suggest that species interactions supported by foundation species might be undermined by the concomitant action of temperature-related changes and local anthropogenic stressors, whose interactive effects are likely to become more severe with global climate change.

AB We examine the effects of forest fragmentation on the structure and composition of tree assemblages within three seasonal and aseasonal forest types of southern Brazil, including evergreen, Araucaria, and deciduous forests. We sampled three southernmost Atlantic Forest landscapes, including the largest continuous forest protected areas within each forest type. Tree assemblages in each forest type were sampled within 10 plots of 0.1 ha in both continuous forests and 10 adjacent forest fragments. All trees within each plot were assigned to trait categories describing their regeneration strategy, vertical stratification, seed-dispersal mode, seed size, and wood density. We detected differences among both forest types and landscape contexts in terms of overall tree species richness, and the density and species richness of different functional groups in terms of regeneration strategy, seed dispersal mode and woody density. Overall, evergreen forest fragments exhibited the largest deviations from continuous forest plots in assemblage structure. Evergreen, Araucaria and deciduous forests diverge in the functional composition of tree floras, particularly in relation to regeneration strategy and stress tolerance. By supporting a more diversified light-demanding and stress-tolerant flora with reduced richness and abundance of shade-tolerant, old-growth species, both deciduous and Araucaria forest tree assemblages are more intrinsically resilient to contemporary human-disturbances, including fragmentation-induced edge effects, in terms of species erosion and functional shifts. We suggest that these intrinsic differences in the direction and magnitude of responses to changes in landscape structure between forest types should guide a wide range of conservation strategies in restoring fragmented tropical forest landscapes worldwide.

AB We report the first record of the beetle tribe Xylographellini (Ciidae) from the continental Palaearctic Region, represented by five new species discovered in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, China: Scolytocis danae sp. nov., Syncosmetus euryale sp. nov., Sync. medusa sp. nov., Sync. perseus sp. nov. and Sync. stheno sp. nov. Illustrations and identification keys are provided for these new species, and in order to facilitate further research of Ciidae we present an open-access DNA barcode library (dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-SYNCOSM) containing 114 records (of 44 species in 14 genera), 15 of which belong to the newly described species. A phylogenetic analysis based on the barcode fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I gene did not recover much tree structure within Ciidae, however both Xylographus Mellie and Syncosmetus Sharp were recovered as clades, with a single Scolytocis Blair being the sister to the latter.

AB Fertilization via nutrient deposition and agricultural inputs is one of the most important factors driving decreases in plant diversity. However, we still do not fully understand which processes (niche process or neutral process) are more important in leading to decreases in plant diversity caused by fertilization. A hypothesis-based approach was used to test the relative importance of niche versus neutral processes along a fertilization gradient in an alpine meadow community on the eastern Tibetan plateau, China. Niche overlap values were calculated for species biomass, and the null model was used to generate the values of niche overlap expected at random. A linear regression modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and leaf total nitrogen concentration) and species relative abundance. Our results demonstrated that observed niche overlap for species biomass was significantly higher than expected at lower fertilization gradients. Moreover, we also found a significantly negative correlation between species relative abundance and specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content, but a significantly positive correlation between relative abundance and leaf nitrogen concentration at lower fertilization gradients. However, these relationships were not significant at higher fertilization gradients. We concluded that community assembly is dynamic progression along the environmental gradients, and niche and neutral processes may together determine species diversity loss in response to fertilization.

AB Conservation initiatives to protect and restore valued species communities in human-dominated landscapes face challenges linked to their potential costs. Conservation easements on private land may represent a cost-effective alternative to land purchase, but long-term costs to monitor and enforce easements, or defend legal challenges, remain uncertain. We explored the cost-effectiveness of conservation easements, defined here as the fraction of the high-biodiversity landscape potentially protected via investment in easements versus land purchase. We show that easement violation and dispute rates substantially affect the estimated long-term cost-effectiveness of an easement versus land purchase strategy. Our results suggest that conservation easements can outperform land purchase as a strategy to protect biodiversity as long as the rate of disputes and legal challenges is low, pointing to a critical need for monitoring data to reduce costs and maximize the value of conservation investments.

AB Species range-limits are influenced by a combination of several factors. In our study we aimed to unveil the drivers underlying the expansion of the Egyptian mongoose in Portugal, a carnivore that was confined to southern Portugal and largely increased its range during the last three decades. We evaluated the expansion of the species in three periods (1980-1990, 1990-2000 and 2000-2010), by projecting the presence/absence data of the species in each temporal range and proposed four hypotheses to explain this sudden expansion associated to changes in the barrier effects of human infrastructure and topographic features, and in the availability of suitable areas due to climate change or land use. An exploratory analysis was made using Spearman rank correlation, followed by a hierarchical partitioning analysis to select uncorrelated potential explanatory variables associated with the different hypotheses. We then ran Generalized Linear Models (GLM) for every period for each hypothesis and for every combination of hypotheses. Our main findings suggest that dynamic transitions of land-use coupled with temperature and rainfall variations over the decades are the main drivers promoting the mongoose expansion. The geographic barriers and the human infrastructures functioned as barriers for mongoose expansion and have shaped its distribution. The expansion of the Egyptian mongoose across the Portuguese territory was due to a variety of factors. Our results suggest a rapid shift in species range in response to land-use and climate changes, underlining the close link between species ranges and a changing environment.

AB Quantification of spatial and temporal changes in forest cover is an essential component of forest monitoring programs. Due to its cloud free capability, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an ideal source of information on forest dynamics in countries with near-constant cloud-cover. However, few studies have investigated the use of SAR for forest cover estimation in landscapes with highly sparse and fragmented forest cover. In this study, the potential use of L-band SAR for forest cover estimation in two regions (Longford and Sligo) in Ireland is investigated and compared to forest cover estimates derived from three national (Forestry2010, Prime2, National Forest Inventory), one pan-European (Forest Map 2006) and one global forest cover (Global Forest Change) product. Two machine-learning approaches (Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees) are evaluated. Both Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees classification accuracies were high (98.1-98.5%), with differences between the two classifiers being minimal (<0.5%). Increasing levels of post classification filtering led to a decrease in estimated forest area and an increase in overall accuracy of SAR-derived forest cover maps. All forest cover products were evaluated using an independent validation dataset. For the Longford region, the highest overall accuracy was recorded with the Forestry2010 dataset (97.42%) whereas in Sligo, highest overall accuracy was obtained for the Prime2 dataset (97.43%), although accuracies of SAR-derived forest maps were comparable. Our findings indicate that spaceborne radar could aid inventories in regions with low levels of forest cover in fragmented landscapes. The reduced accuracies observed for the global and pan-continental forest cover maps in comparison to national and SAR-derived forest maps indicate that caution should be exercised when applying these datasets for national reporting.

TI Environmental Costs of Government-Sponsored Agrarian Settlements in
   Brazilian Amazonia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LAND-USE CHANGE; DEFORESTATION; COVER; RESETTLEMENT; FRONTIER
AB Brazil has presided over the most comprehensive agrarian reform frontier colonization program on Earth, in which similar to 1.2 million settlers have been translocated by successive governments since the 1970's, mostly into forested hinterlands of Brazilian Amazonia. These settlements encompass 5.3% of this similar to 5 million km(2) region, but have contributed with 13.5% of all land conversion into agropastoral land uses. The Brazilian Federal Agrarian Agency (INCRA) has repeatedly claimed that deforestation in these areas largely predates the sanctioned arrival of new settlers. Here, we quantify rates of natural vegetation conversion across 1911 agrarian settlements allocated to 568 Amazonian counties and compare fire incidence and deforestation rates before and after the official occupation of settlements by migrant farmers. The timing and spatial distribution of deforestation and fires in our analysis provides irrefutable chronological and spatially explicit evidence of agropastoral conversion both inside and immediately outside agrarian settlements over the last decade. Deforestation rates are strongly related to local human population density and road access to regional markets. Agrarian settlements consistently accelerated rates of deforestation and fires, compared to neighboring areas outside settlements, but within the same counties. Relocated smallholders allocated to forest areas undoubtedly operate as pivotal agents of deforestation, and most of the forest clearance occurs in the aftermath of government-induced migration.

AB Selective logging gives currently a major contribution to ongoing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia. On satellite images, log-landing sites (LLS) are well visible, and they serve as a proxy to selective logging activities. In this study we analysed the spatial patterns of the LLS collected during the years 2000-2009 in a part of the Brazilian Amazonia, using spatial statistical methods. The purpose was to reveal important spatial and temporal characteristics of selective logging. After the spatial analysis, the patterns formed by the LLS were modelled using the higher-order Gibbs interaction models due to their suitability to model clustered patterns. The area-interaction model and Geyer's saturation model proved effective in modelling the clustered patterns in the absence of information about covariates. Results of both models conform closely to each other. We conclude that spatial statistical methods are powerful tools for analysing and interpreting the spatial patterns formed by selective logging.

AB The objective of the present study was to characterise the floristic and phytosociological composition on a stretch of dense "Terra Firme" rainforest located in the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant area of influence, located in the state of Para, Brazil. All trees with DAP > 10 cm situated in 75 permanent plots of 1 ha were inventoried. 27,126 individuals trees (361 ind. ha-1), distributed in 59 botanical families, comprising 481 species were observed. The families with the largest number of species were Fabaceae (94), Araceae (65) and Arecaceae (43), comprising 43.7% of total species. The species Alexa grandiflora (4.41), Cenostigma tocantinum (2.50) and Bertholletia excelsa (2.28) showed the highest importance values (IV). The ten species with greater IV are concentrated (22%). The forest community has high species richness and can be classified as diverse age trees, heterogeneous and of medium conservation condition.

AB When forest ecosystems develop over millennia, trees live five centuries, and mortality unfolds over decades, direct repeated observation (hereafter, longitudinal data) may be the only way to understand the fate of forests. Longitudinal data sets contribute greatly to our understanding, complementing experimental, modeling, and chronosequence approaches. Changing climate is changing forests, perhaps most rapidly through altered mortality regimes, and the elusive nature of integrated mechanistic understanding requires refinements and extensions to historically productive protocols. Changing climate reduces the inferential power of chronosequence techniques and changes model parameterization, and only some of the different factors contributing to tree mortality are expected to respond to climate variability and change. Because annual tree mortality rates are 5% to 1% for trees >= 1 cm dbh in young and old forests (respectively), detecting changes in mortality rates requires tracking thousands of trees, particularly to examine rare sub-populations of concern (e.g., large-diameter trees). And because mortality factors can be spatially aggregated and density-dependent, the causes and rates of tree mortality depend on the relationships between forest spatial structure and the direct and indirect effects of climate. Permanent plots with a combination of larger size, higher spatial precision, and greater sampling frequency will be required to further elucidate spatially explicit aspects of western forest demography. The combination of the longitudinal protocols developed by the Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science, originally for studying tropical forest species diversity, and those developed by the US Geological Survey for annual tree mortality assessment together uniquely allow robust investigation of climate-mediated change in temperate forests.

AB In natural systems, organisms are simultaneously engaged in mutualistic, competitive, and predatory interactions. Theory predicts that species persistence and community stability are feasible when the beneficial effects of mutualisms are balanced by density-dependent negative feedbacks. Enemy-mediated negative feedbacks can foster plant species coexistence in diverse communities, but empirical evidence remains mixed. Disparity between theoretical expectations and empirical results may arise from the effects of mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we build a multiprey species/predator model combined with a bidirectional resource exchange system, which simulates mutualistic interactions between plants and fungi. To reach population persistence, (1) the per capita rate of increase of all plant population must exceed the sum of the negative per capita effects of predation, interspecific competition, and costs of mycorrhizal association, and (2) the per capita numerical response of enemies to mycorrhizal plants must exceed the magnitude of the per capita enemy rate of mortality. These conditions reflect the balance between regulation and facilitation in the system. Interactions between plant natural enemies and mycorrhizal fungi lead to shifts in the strength and direction of net mycorrhizal effects on plants over time, with common plant species deriving greater benefits from mycorrhizal associations than rare plant species.

AB Clean Development Mechanism afforestation often involves the creation of fast growing tree plantations on non-forest lands. To estimate the possible impacts of afforestation on the biodiversity of local species, we compared the diversity of dung beetles collected using baited pitfall traps placed in grasslands, plantations of Acacia mangium, and intact natural forests in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The species richness in plantations was higher than that on grasslands but lower than that in intact natural forests. Ordination analysis revealed that the structures of beetle assemblages in plantations were intermediate between intact natural forests and grasslands. However, the indicator species for the intact natural forests were never or rarely seen in the plantations. These results suggest that afforestation increases the local native diversity of dung beetles but that plantations are not readily colonized by the indicators of intact natural forests. Conversely, it is suggested that afforestation decreases the abundances of two grassland specialists.

Based on the overlap of 20 individual tracks, four generalized tracks constituted by different numbers of species were identified; two of them are located in the Nearctic region and the Mexican transition zone (tracks "A" and "B"), and the other two are distributed in the Neotropical region and the South America transition zone ("C", "D"). Six nodes were recognized: Two of them are included in the Nearctic Region, node 'I' located in northern USA and node 'II' located in southwestern USA, both at the intersection of the tracks "A" and "B". The other four are included in the Neotropical Region at the intersection of the tracks "C" and "D": Node 'III' is located in Chaco province; node 'IV' is located in Parana Forest province; node 'V' is located in the northwest of Argentina in Puna province, and node 'VI' is located in Monte province.

AB Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is an alternative land use because it reduces damage to forest cover in comparison with clear-cut practices. However, management practices adopted in RIL can affect wood availability and, consequently, fauna associated with dead wood during part of their life cycle (saproxylic). In this study, we evaluated whether aquatic saproxylic macroinvertebrates are affected by reduced-impact logging in Central Amazonia. We selected six streams in areas under reduced-impacted logging and six in primary forest areas and collected submerged woody debris. We did not find any differences in water pH, conductivity, and wood availability between reduced-impacted forest and primary forest streams. We found 248 saproxylic aquaticmacroinvertebrates belonging to 37 taxa. We found five wood specialist (Dryops, Lutrochus, Stenochironomus, Oukuriella, and Endotribelos) and 32 generalists, totalling 98 and 150 individuals, respectively. In general, our results show that reduced-impact logging does not affect richness, abundance, and composition of saproxylic macroinvertebrates. The main explanation for this pattern is that management practices do not change important macroinvertebrate niche dimensions, including wood availability and the water's chemical and physical variables. Thus, controlled logging, such as applied in the area of the Central Amazonian streams studied, opens a new prospect for insect conservation and commercial exploitation of wood, which is not possible when clear-cut practices are adopted.

AB Analyses of morphological and molecular data indicate the existence of an unrecognized and unnamed species of soft-haired mouse, genus Abrothrix. Here, we name and describe this new species, which inhabits the Valdivian ecoregion, from the north of Chiloe Island onto the mainland in the Chilean regions of Los Lagos and Los Rios; it also occurs at a single locality in the Argentinean province of Neuquen. Long confused with A. sanborni, the new species presents a unique combination of characters that differentiate it in external, cranial, phallic, and dental terms from its congeners. Phylogenetic analysis, based on cytochrome-b gene sequences, indicates that the new species is sister to a clade formed by the austral species A. lanosa and A. sanborni and differs on average from them by 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Results based on the nuclear Fgb-I7 locus are less conclusive regarding the phylogenetic position of the new species but also show its distinction. We comment on the conservation significance of our findings, considering that forests of the Valdivian ecoregion are suffering substantial human disturbance through intensive logging.

AB Brazil seeks to rapidly increase its agricultural production to meet future demands, especially for sugarcane, which is an agricultural commodity and a biofuel source. In this paper, we explore how to achieve this increase without compromising existing forestlands. We propose that it is possible to substantially expand sugarcane production in Brazil while avoiding further environmental losses and the indirect land use changes often associated with them, such as deforestation. This task could be accomplished by converting existing pasturelands with agricultural potential into cropland. A great deal of pastureland exists in Brazil. Thus, we addressed the following questions in this study: (I) where are the most suitable pasturelands for sugarcane located geographically and (2) what potential do these pasturelands have for sugarcane production regarding their physical suitability and other significant factors, such as infrastructure availability and socioeconomic factors. We conducted a land suitability analysis using a spatial location model based on multicriteria decision-making and geographic information systems (GIS) to identify the cultivated pasturelands most suitable for conversion to sugarcane production in Brazil. "What if" scenarios were built to determine how changes in the subjectively derived weights of the priority criteria would modify the spatial distribution of the suitability classes relative to the MCDA model and demonstrate the robustness of the crop suitability assessment. The most suitable pastureland areas for conversion to sugarcane production were predominantly located in Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Parana, Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso and Para. These zones have large contiguous areas of pasture with moderate and high agricultural potentials for sugarcane production. The total estimated area of cultivated pasturelands with moderate or high suitability for sugarcane production was 50 million hectares, which is much larger than the area currently used for sugarcane production in Brazil.

AB Forest recovery is occurring in Panama and several other tropical countries following decades of deforestation. Theory on such 'forest transitions' describes urbanization and agricultural modernization as underling factors. Tropical country governments may seek to harness these factors to promote a tropical forest transition within the REDD+ scheme. Yet tropical forest transitions remain poorly described due to limited data and inappropriate modeling. To determine the nature of a tropical forest transition I derive canonical correlations of (a) socio-agrarian transformation observed via respondent-level census records and (b) forest-cover change observed via satellite imagery, for 82% of Panamanian counties over 1980-1990-2000-2008. The Panamanian forest transition centered on multi-decadal in situ shifts in employment from agriculture to off-farm activity, particularly by women. Agricultural modernization and decline were coincident but of lesser importance. Urbanization entailed increasingly connected small urban centers in otherwise rural landscapes. Net forest gains per decade were similar to 1.52% of the area of influence of the socio-agrarian transformations, which concentrate in economically and agriculturally favored regions. Governments may conceivably nurture forest transitions already underway via economic policies, but they cannot coordinate them. Even so, inefficiencies may be prohibitively high, and challenges significant. A history of failure of similar 'social engineering' endeavors urges caution in this respect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Tropical conservation and research focus primarily on protected areas and often ignore conservation values of surrounding agricultural lands. Understanding how species utilize agricultural land will maximize conservation efforts. We compared bird community composition in four habitats in northeastern Costa Rica: shade-grown cacao, live fences, riparian forest buffers, and preserved late-successional rainforest. Point counts over 2 months found 167 species from 36 families. Rainforest contained the most species unique to a habitat although richness per point was lower than in agricultural habitats. Half, 31, of the rainforest species did not occur in other habitats, while 106 species, mostly those preferring open areas, occurred in agroforest habitats but not rainforest. While agricultural habitats had fairly similar species composition to each other as determined by distance in an ordination, each also contained significant numbers, 9-30, of unique species. While intact rainforest remains central to conservation of tropical birds, agricultural lands with substantial trees, e.g., live fences, riparian buffers, and plantations with shade trees, can support a high richness of birds. These avian communities are not simply subsets of the rainforest species but include substantial numbers of unique species. Conservation contributions of these lands to species richness and complexity should be considered in conservation, and trees in these habitats preserved.

AB Ecosystem engineering is increasingly recognized as a relevant ecological driver of diversity and community composition. Although engineering impacts on the biota can vary from negative to positive, and from trivial to enormous, patterns and causes of variation in the magnitude of engineering effects across ecosystems and engineer types remain largely unknown. To elucidate the above patterns, we conducted a meta-analysis of 122 studies which explored effects of animal ecosystem engineers on species richness of other organisms in the community. The analysis revealed that the overall effect of ecosystem engineers on diversity is positive and corresponds to a 25% increase in species richness, indicating that ecosystem engineering is a facilitative process globally. Engineering effects were stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes, likely because new or modified habitats provided by engineers in the tropics may help minimize competition and predation pressures on resident species. Within aquatic environments, engineering impacts were stronger in marine ecosystems (rocky shores) than in streams. In terrestrial ecosystems, engineers displayed stronger positive effects in arid environments (e.g. deserts). Ecosystem engineers that create new habitats or microhabitats had stronger effects than those that modify habitats or cause bioturbation. Invertebrate engineers and those with lower engineering persistence (<1 year) affected species richness more than vertebrate engineers which persisted for >1 year. Invertebrate species richness was particularly responsive to engineering impacts. This study is the first attempt to build an integrative framework of engineering effects on species diversity; it highlights the importance of considering latitude, habitat, engineering functional group, taxon and persistence of their effects in future theoretical and empirical studies.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Following herbivore attack, plants can either reduce damage by inducing defenses or mitigate herbivory effects through compensatory growth and reproduction. It is increasingly recognized that such induced defenses in plants are herbivore-specific, but less is known about the specificity of compensatory responses. Damage by multiple herbivores may also lead to synergistic effects on induction and plant fitness that differ from those caused by a single herbivore species. Although largely unstudied, the order of arrival and damage by different herbivore species might also play an important role in the impacts of herbivory on plants.
   METHODS: We investigated the specificity of defense induction (phenolics) and effects on growth (number of stems and leaves) and reproduction (number of seeds, seed mass, and germination rate) from feeding by two generalist leaf-chewing herbivores (Spodoptera eridania and Diabrotica balteata) on Phaseolus lunatus plants and evaluated whether simultaneous attack by both herbivores and their order of arrival influenced such dynamics.
   KEY RESULTS: Herbivory increased levels of leaf phenolics, but such effects were not herbivore-specific. In contrast, herbivory enhanced seed germination in an herbivore-specific manner. For all variables measured, the combined effects of both herbivore species did not differ from their individual effects. Finally, the order of herbivore arrival did not influence defense induction, plant growth, or seed number but did influence seed mass and germination.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study highlights novel aspects of the specificity of plant responses induced by damage from multiple species of herbivores and uniquely associates such effects with plant lifetime fitness.

AB The jaguar is an endangered species in Brazil and one of the major threats is the hunting, sometimes as a result of livestock depredation. Understanding the ecological and anthropogenic factors that favor the predation of livestock by jaguar can help to reduce the number of attacks and thus, decrease cases of hunting in retaliation. We used field data on livestock depredation and environmental and anthropogenic variables to model the risk of depredation by jaguar along the Transamazon highway, a frontier region where ranching has been the main driver of deforestation. We used five algorithms and a final ensemble model in order to obtain a map of depredation risk, as well as to identify the variables related with it. The variables most related with depredation risk were distance to deforestation (negatively related) and cattle density (positively related). The major factors driving livestock depredation are related to anthropogenic disturbance, this means that the spatial distribution of risk is not a stable feature, but is likely to change dynamically following shifts in the deforestation frontier and in the livestock herd. Based on our results, it is reasonable to expect an increase in depredation of livestock in this area. The use of ecological niche modeling to identify potential hotspots of depredation of livestock is a recent innovation that holds potential to guide the allocation of conservation and management efforts over large areas at relatively low costs.

AB Ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are becoming scarcer due to continued deforestation as demand for forest benefits increases with the growing population. There is need for comprehensive valuation of key ecosystem services in order to inform policy and implement better management systems to enhance the supply of ecosystem services. This study estimates local economic value of key ecosystem services provided by Kakamega rainforest and examines how the information can support sustainable forest management in Kenya. This is the only rainforest in Kenya and it has exceptional biocliversity value including several unique species not found anywhere else in the country. Kakamega rainforest also provides a classic case of conflict between conservation and exploitation goals given the dense population around it We carried out elaborate household and visitors surveys to collect data used to estimate the economic value of three main ecosystem services. We estimated the total economic value of key ecosystem services (excluding biodiversity value) at about US$ 74 million per year or US$ 415 ha(-1) yr(-1). The local economic benefits are considerably less than forgone returns from agricultural activities if the forest were to be converted to the best agricultural uses. Arguably, continued protection of this forest is justified on the basis of the unknown value of its rich biodiversity and capacity to sequester CO2. Empirical findings show that the existing forest management system was less effective due to resource constraints and institutional weaknesses. Our study provides insights for the need to manage this forest for multiple uses. We recommend an integrated management strategy that balances local resource needs with biodiversity conservation. We suggest that improved stakeholder collaboration can facilitate sustainable management of this forest resource. Besides, carefully crafted payment for ecosystem services mechanisms and broad environmental education programs can support sustainable forest conservation for this arid other similar forest ecosystems in Africa.

AB Low molecular weight organic acids exuded by plants roots enhance inorganic P-i release into soil solution and thereby increases plant-available Pi in soils. Low molecular weight organic acids may also induce organic P (P-o) release into soil solution, but kinetics of both Pi and Po displacement from the soil matrix into soil solution of agricultural soils is poorly understood, and the mechanism for P-o release is not well explained. This study used kinetic experiments to determine the concentrations and release rates of P-i and P-o induced by oxalic acid, citric acid, and malic acid in calcareous, neutral and acidic soils. Kinetic data were well described by Elovich (r(2)= 0.801-0.993, P < 0.001) and power functions models (r(2) = 0.721-0.977, P < 0.001). Low molecular weight organic acids at 10 mmol kg(-1) soil induced the exponential release of both P-i and P-o, which reached a plateau approx. 480- 2,880 min after the start of the experiment. Cumulative P-o release induced by low molecular weight organic acids was ranked as oxalic acid (0.63-3.17 mg kg(-1)) > citric acid (0.61-2.82 mg kg(-1)) > malic acid (0.52-1.76 mg kg(-1)) and mainly resulted from the release of labile P-o (NaHCO3-P-o) regardless of soil type. By contrast, oxalic acid was most effective in enhancing P-i release from the HCl-P-i (Ca-P-i) fraction of the calcareous soil, and citric acid was most effective in releasing P-i from the NaOH-P-i (Fe/Al-P-i) fraction of the neutral and acidic soils. Therefore, the mechanism for the kinetics of P-o release induced by low molecular weight organic acids is ascribed to their ability to mobilize the labile P-o (NaHCO3-P-o) rather than their ability to chelate cations (i.e., Fe3+, Al3+) bound to P-o in soil.

AB The Mexican transition zone is the complex and varied area in which the Neotropical and Nearctic biotas overlap. In a series of contributions, Gonzalo Halffter provided a coherent theory that explains how sets of taxa that evolved in different geographical areas assembled in this transition zone. Halffter's theory developed gradually, being refined and clarified in successive contributions from him and other authors. After a review of the historical development of the Mexican transition zone, including the characterization of the dispersal or distributional patterns recognized by Halffter, its relevance for evolutionary biogeography is discussed briefly. The Mexican transition zone in the strict sense includes the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala (Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre del Sur and Chiapas Highlands provinces), whereas northern Mexico and the southern United States are clearly Nearctic, and the lowlands of southern Mexico and Central America are clearly Neotropical. The distributional patterns recognized by Halffter are considered to represent cenocrons (sets of taxa that share the same biogeographical history, constituting identifiable subsets within a biota by their common biotic origin and evolutionary history). The development of the Mexican transition zone is summarized into the following stages: (1) Jurassic-Cretaceous: the four Paleoamerican cenocrons extend in Mexico; (2) Late Cretaceous-Palaeocene: dispersal from South America of the Plateau cenocron; (3) Oligocene-Miocene: dispersal from the Central American Nucleus of the Mountain Mesoamerican cenocron; (4) Miocene-Pliocene: dispersal from North America of the Nearctic cenocron; and (5) Pleistocene: dispersal from South America of the Typical Neotropical cenocron.
   Resumen La zona de transicion Mexicana de Halffter (1962-2014), los cenocrones y la biogeografia evolutiva La zona de transicion Mexicana es un area compleja y variada donde se superponen las biotas neotropical y neartica. En una serie de contribuciones, Gonzalo Halffter proporciono una teoria coherente que explica como conjuntos de taxones que evolucionaron en diferentes areas geograficas se ensamblaron en esta zona de transicion. La teoria de Halffter se desarrollo gradualmente, siendo refinada y clarificada en sucesivas contribuciones de el y otros autores. Luego de revisar el desarrollo historico de la zona de transicion Mexicana, incluyendo la caracterizacion de los patrones de dispersion o distribucionales reconocidos por Halffter, se discute brevemente su relevancia para la biogeografia evolutiva. La zona de transicion Mexicana en sentido estricto incluye las tierras altas de Mexico y Guatemala (provincias de la Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Faja Volcanica Transmexicana, Sierra Madre del Sur y Tierras Altas de Chiapas), mientras que el norte de Mexico y el sur de los Estados Unidos son claramente nearticos y que las tierras bajas del sur de Mexico y America Central son claramente neotropicales. Los patrones distribucionales reconocidos por Halffter se consideran cenocrones (conjuntos de taxones que comparten una misma historia biogeografica, constituyendo subconjuntos identificables dentro de una biota por su origen biotico comun y su historia evolutiva). El desarrollo de la zona de transicion Mexicana se resume en las siguientes etapas: (1) Jurasico-Cretacico: los cuatro cenocrones paleoamericanos se extienden en Mexico; (2) Cretacico Superior-Paleoceno: dispersion desde America del Sur del cenocron del Altiplano; (3) Oligoceno-Mioceno: dispersion desde el Nucleo Centroamericano del cenocron Mesoamericano de Montana; (4) Mioceno-Plioceno: dispersion desde America del Norte del cenocron Neartico; y (5) Plioceno-Pleistoceno: dispersion desde America del Sur del cenocron Neotropical Tipico.

AB Weaver ants (genus Oecophylla) are tropical carnivorous ant species living in high numbers in the canopies of trees. The ants excrete copious amounts of fecal matter on leaf surfaces, and these feces may provide nutrients to host trees. This hypothesis is supported by studies of ant-plant interactions involving other ant species that have demonstrated the transfer of nutrients from ants to plants. In this 7-months study, a GC-MS-based metabolomics approach along with an analysis of total nitrogen and carbon levels was used to study metabolic changes in ant-hosting Coffea arabica plants compared with control plants. The results showed elevated levels of total nitrogen, amino acids, fatty acids, caffeine, and secondary metabolites of the phenylpropanoid pathway in leaves from ant-hosting plants. Minor effects were observed for sugars, whereas little or no effect was observed for organic acids, despite the fact that lower levels of total carbon were found in ant-hosting plants. The increased levels of total nitrogen, amino acids, fatty acids and caffeine and the decreased total carbon were consistent with changes observed in plants grown with an increased supply of nitrogen-containing nutrients. The up-regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway could indicate biotic stress and/or nutrient deficiency. However, because nutrient deficiency was contradicted by the remaining results, this pathway up-regulation was ascribed to biotic stress caused by the physical presence of the weaver ants.

AB Groundbreaking research on the universality and diversity of microorganisms is now challenging the life sciences to upgrade fundamental theories that once seemed untouchable. To fully appreciate the change that the field is now undergoing, one has to place the epochs and foundational principles of Darwin, Mendel, and the modern synthesis in light of the current advances that are enabling a new vision for the central importance of microbiology. Animals and plants are no longer heralded as autonomous entities but rather as biomolecular networks composed of the host plus its associated microbes, i.e., "holobionts." As such, their collective genomes forge a "hologenome," and models of animal and plant biology that do not account for these intergenomic associations are incomplete. Here, we integrate these concepts into historical and contemporary visions of biology and summarize a predictive and refutable framework for their evaluation. Specifically, we present ten principles that clarify and append what these concepts are and are not, explain how they both support and extend existing theory in the life sciences, and discuss their potential ramifications for the multifaceted approaches of zoology and botany. We anticipate that the conceptual and evidence-based foundation provided in this essay will serve as a roadmap for hypothesis-driven, experimentally validated research on holobionts and their hologenomes, thereby catalyzing the continued fusion of biology's subdisciplines. At a time when symbiotic microbes are recognized as fundamental to all aspects of animal and plant biology, the holobiont and hologenome concepts afford a holistic view of biological complexity that is consistent with the generally reductionist approaches of biology.

AB In French Guiana, the leaf and cambium phenologies should not be considered only as exogenous-driven processes, as the dry season, but also as endogenous-driven, as tree development stage.
   Studies of the periodicity of wood formation provide essential data on tree age and on factors that control tree growth. The aim of this work was to investigate cambial phenology and its relation with leaf phenology and climatic seasonality in two briefly deciduous tropical rainforest species belonging to the genus Parkia. Wood microcores were collected every 15 days from April 2009 to February 2012 from five trees of each species. The microcores were stained with cresyl violet acetate to facilitate counting the number of cells in the cambial zone, in the radial enlargement zone and wall-thickening zone. At the same time, we observed leaf shedding pattern in the crown of the same trees. In both species, cambial activity was significantly reduced during the leafless period. In P. nitida, these two concomitant events were observed during the dry season whereas in P. velutina they can occur anytime in the year with no apparent link with seasonality. In conclusion, the period of reduced cambial activity in some tropical rainforest trees may be independent of rainfall seasonality and not necessarily follow an annual cycle. It appears that leaf phenology is a good proxy to estimate cambial activity.

AB Avian insectivores of the tropical rainforest understory ("understory insectivores") are common, diverse, and often sensitive to disturbance of tropical forest, making them useful as sentinels of rainforest ecosystem change. At the 2013 joint American Ornithologists' Union and Cooper Ornithological Society meeting in Chicago, USA, researchers convened a symposium to address the ecology and conservation of understory insectivores. This Special Issue of Biological Conservation is the result of that symposium: a collection of articles that unites our efforts to further understand and conserve understory insectivores. In this introductory paper, we review the diversity and ecology of understory insectivores, identify threats to the guild, discuss hypotheses on drivers of population declines, and make suggestions for future research. Deforestation and forest degradation are the immediate threats to this guild, with agricultural expansion (particularly oil palm plantations), urbanization, road expansion and logging leading the list. Although vulnerabilities of this guild are most evident in the Neotropics, there are few studies from Asia and fewer still from Africa we recommend increased geographic coverage. If we are to understand the vulnerabilities of understory insectivores from a pantropical perspective, researchers should prioritize understanding the most serious threats (e.g., edge effects, deforestation, fragmentation, etc.) and standardize efforts to gauge understory insectivores' response to these threats (e.g., via species richness, abundance, demographic metrics). A coordinated approach by researchers working in tropical rainforests across the globe can help us understand the ecology of understory insectivores and meaningfully apply conservation and management actions.

AB Tropical forest fragmentation influences community composition via differential species-level effects. Avian responses to fragmentation at La Selva Biological Station are, in part, responsible for the particular concern over the fate of understory insectivorous species. However, since the 1990s, much previously deforested land within and surrounding La Selva has reverted to forest, providing an opportunity to test hypotheses explaining ongoing avifaunal change. Analyses of 23 years (1989-2011) of Christmas Bird Counts reveal that 63 of 202 species have increased whereas 44 are declining, with declines occurring more rapidly than increases. Habitat association was an important predictor of population trends, as understory birds continue to decline whereas forest generalists increased. Our results differ from previous work in the tropics by revealing that, at La Selva, insectivores are not currently suffering greater declines than birds of other dietary guilds. Instead, body size was more strongly associated with population change than was diet, with smaller birds having more negative population trends than larger birds. These results suggest that we must consider additional hypotheses that may explain ongoing population declines of tropical birds. In particular, the associations between population trends and body size implicate physiological mechanisms influencing population change, which may result from direct or indirect consequences of changing climates.

AB We investigated how legal logging history and recent illegal logging affected forest bird community structure in Ghana. Ghanaian forests belong to West Africa's highly fragmented Upper Guinea rain forests, part of a global priority "biodiversity hotspot" under intense pressure from anthropogenic degradation. Between 1995 and 2010, officially-reported legal logging intensities increased up to similar to 600%, while illegal logging, which now accounts for 80% of timber extraction in Ghana, has driven logging intensities to similar to 6 times greater than the maximum sustainable rate. We collected data in 2008-2010 and used a comparable dataset collected in 1993-1995 to assess impacts of recent logging on understory bird communities in large forest fragments (100-524 km(2)) in southwest Ghana. Forest understory bird species abundance declined by >50% during this period. Species richness also showed declining trends. Whereas analysis based on data collected in 1993-1995 estimated a partial post-logging recovery of the understory bird community at that time, data from 2008-2010 showed no indication of post,logging recovery, likely due to ongoing illegal logging following intensive legal logging operations. Forest generalist species and sallying insectivores declined significantly in logged compared to unlogged forests. These severe declines of Upper Guinea forest understory birds indicate the rapidly deteriorating conservation status of a biodiversity hotspot and could signal collapsing ecosystem processes. Immediate conservation actions are urgently required to protect surviving forest fragments from further degradation and avian declines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although a growing number of studies address how Neotropical birds respond to anthropogenic disturbance and deforestation, we continue to poorly understand responses of groups of interacting species, such as mixed-species flocks in the Andes. In this study, we examined how attributes at landscape (i.e., percentage of forest cover within 1-km(2)) and local (i.e. structural complexity of microhabitat) scales shaped mixed-species flocks within five broadly-defined habitat types in the Northern and Central Andes. From 2007 to 2010, we systematically surveyed flocks along line transects in 97 1-km(2) plots distributed from Venezuela to Peru based on a stratified-random design. We recorded 220 avian species in 186 mixed-species flocks, with the greatest species richness and largest flocks detected in forested habitats. Understory insectivores were most closely associated with mature and secondary forests. Increasing forest cover promoted species richness and size of flocks, with particularly strong associations in successional habitats and shade coffee. Structural complexity was positively associated with flock size in early successional and silvopastoral habitats, where 20% increases in complexity doubled flock size. However, the opposite pattern was true in shade coffee and secondary forests. Encounter rates of flocks were poorly explained by simple metrics of forest cover and structural complexity. Unlike flocks reported in many lowland forests, Andean flocks tended to span all vertical strata, with fewer understory-specializing flocks (e.g. flocks led by Basileuterus warblers and Chlorospingus tanagers). Nonetheless, in such flocks, understory insectivores were most closely associated with mature and secondary forests. Our research supports the idea that managed habitats with overstory trees can contribute to flock conservation. Overall, our results further suggested that understory birds require the more forested of habitats (e.g., mature forest held almost twice as many understory specialists as other habitats), and may be less amenable to conservation with agroecosystems or working landscapes.

AB Habitat destruction and degradation are major drivers of biodiversity loss and attention is increasingly focused on how different traits of species affect their vulnerability. Dietary traits are critical in this respect, and are typically examined by assigning species to different feeding and foraging guilds. However, such guilds may mask large variation in species' trophic interactions, limiting our understanding of species' responses. Here we use stable isotopes to quantify trophic positions within a Family of insectivorous understory birds, the Timaliidae (babblers), within Bornean rainforests. We then relate changes in species' abundances following intensive selective logging of forest to their trophic positions, body sizes and foraging heights. We found that trophic positions within this single feeding guild spanned more than an entire trophic level. Moreover, changes in abundance following logging were significantly and independently related to mean trophic position in primary forest, body size and foraging height: large ground-feeding species occupying high trophic positions were more adversely affected than small understory-feeders with lower trophic positions. These three variables together explained 81% of the variance in species' responses to logging. The single most important predictor, however, was a species' mean trophic position. Species recorded in both habitats also had significantly higher trophic positions in logged forest. These data provide critical new understanding of species' responses to disturbance. They also indicate previously unrecognised functional changes to species assemblages following logging, highlighting the importance of numerical assessments of trophic position within individual feeding guilds.

AB The management of rainforest ecosystems for multi-species conservation must assess the impacts of habitat degradation at different spatial scales as well as determine which species are vulnerable to landscape change. Our research objectives were to (1) evaluate the effects of life history traits on the patch occupancy and vulnerability of rainforest birds, (2) determine the relative effects of stand, landscape and patch structure on species richness, and (3) evaluate the relative contributions of deforestation and fragmentation to species richness. We collected presence-absence data for 29 bird species in 46 rainforest patches in South East Queensland, Australia. We used a multi-species occupancy model that accounted for incomplete detection to evaluate hypotheses for occupancy and species richness. Avian occupancy was strongly influenced by life history traits, including population density, foraging behavior, dispersal strategy, clutch size, body mass and diet. Sedentary species with low population sizes, low clutch sizes, large body sizes and insectivorous diets, such as the ground-dwelling Albert's Lyrebird (Menura alberti) and canopy-dwelling Paradise Riflebird (Ptiloris paradiseus), were the most vulnerable to landscape change. After accounting for life history, the positive effect of stand basal area was the best predictor of species richness followed by the positive effects of rainforest and dry eucalypt forest in the landscape, with less support for the positive effect of patch size and negative effect of patch isolation. Deforestation was more detrimental to the bird community than rainforest fragmentation. Conservation actions that retain high stand basal area, promote unmodified landscape mosaics and maintain moderate patch sizes near large rainforest tracts are expected to be effective strategies for managing the rainforest bird community. Landscape conservation strategies to minimize habitat loss are expected to be more effective than managing the configuration of rainforest patches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given rates of deforestation, disturbance, and secondary forest accumulation in tropical rainforests, there is a great need to quantify habitat use and movement among different habitats. This need is particularly pronounced for animals most sensitive to disturbance, such as insectivorous understory birds. Here we use multistate capture-recapture models with radiotelemetry data to determine the successional stage at which within-day movement probabilities of Amazonian birds in secondary forest are similar to those in primary forest. We radio-tracked three common understory insectivore species in primary and secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments project near Manaus, Brazil: two woodcreepers, Glyphorynchus spirurus (n = 19) and Xiphorhynchus pardalotus (n = 18), and the terrestrial antthrush Formicarius colma (n = 19). Forest age was a strong predictor of fidelity to a given habitat. All three species showed greater fidelity to primary forest than to 8-14-year-old secondary forest, indicating the latter's relatively poor quality. The two woodcreeper species used 12-18-year-old secondary forest in a manner comparable to continuous forest, but F. colma avoided moving even to 27-31-year-old secondary forest the oldest at our site. Our results suggest that managers concerned with less sensitive species can assume that forest reserves connected by 12-18-year-old secondary forest corridors are effectively connected. On the other hand, >30 years are required after land abandonment before secondary forest serves as a primary forest-like conduit for movement by F. colma; more sensitive terrestrial insectivores may take longer still.

AB Many insectivorous birds of the tropical rainforest understory, particularly terrestrial species, are prone to local extinctions in fragmented forests. We evaluated the hypothesis that vegetation structural changes in rainforest fragments reduce the availability of microhabitats used by terrestrial insectivores. Near Manaus, Brazil, we compared the vegetation in forest fragments to the vegetation in a continuous forest site where nine species of terrestrial insectivores were observed foraging. Our focal species included those that are extinction prone in fragments (Myrmornis torquata [Wing-banded Antbird], Grallaria varia [Variegated Antbird], Hylopezus macularius [Spotted Antpitta]), a fragmentation-tolerant species (Myrmothera campanisona [Thrush-like Antpitta]), and species that have and intermediate response (Myrmeciza ferruginea [Ferruginous-backed Antbird], Formicarius colma [Rufous-capped Anttrush], Formicarius analis [Black-faced Antthrush], Conopophaga aurita [Chestnut-belted Gnateater], and Corythopis torquata [Ringed Antpipit]). To quantify vegetation, we measured sixteen habitat variables in 8-m radius plots where birds were observed foraging as well as random points in continuous forest and forest fragments of 1-, 10-, and 100-ha. Four principal components were produced from a principal component analysis and we selected a variable (leaf litter depth, plant cover 3-10 m, density of plants 1-2 m, and plant cover >20 m) from each principal component for our fragment vs continuous forest comparisons. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, we estimated the probabilities that the density of plants 1-2 m, proportion of plant cover 3-10 m, and leaf litter depth increased with decreasing fragment area and also exceeded the values associated with fragmentation-sensitive species. We also tested the prediction that plant cover >20 m decreased in forest fragments and that those sites became more open than typical sites used by our focal species. Our predictions were strongly supported: decreasing fragment size was correlated with increasing density of tall plants, increasing mid-story vegetation cover, decreased canopy cover, and increasing leaf litter depth. Even if our focal species are able to disperse to small forest fragments, our results suggest that they may not find enough appropriate habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The policy implications for success in the next-stage Grain-for-Green Project (GFGP) in China are analyzed from the perspectives of farmers' willingness. The ecological protection belt of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area was chosen as the case study area, where 1207 valid questionnaire surveys based on participatory rural appraisal were collected in 2012. Our study found that farmers with lower levels of education, older age, and higher livelihood dependency on farmland were more prone to reclamation if the compensation ended. Females and non-migrants were more reluctant to participate in the next GFGP than others. Nevertheless, traditional farming was no longer a preferred livelihood by all respondents. The majority of respondents (74.4 %) wished to be liberated from the low-income farmland work through the next GFGP, and half of them (50.6 %) hoped to get non-cash compensation. The Willingness to Accept (WTA) values of the next GFGP showed significant social heterogeneity and regional difference, with an average of annual RMBAyen16,665 ha(-1), about 4.5 times the local compensation standard in 2000. By revealing some limitations of the uniform nationwide compensation standard system and the single payment form in adapting to evolving socioeconomic conditions, our study highlighted the importance of developing a region-based compensation standard system, integrating the next GFGP into regional sustainable development organically by more comprehensive alternative policy, and bonding a vertical partnership between the local community and the nation. Our study revealed some key elements for success in the future design of restoration projects in China.

AB Selective logging is becoming more and more influential in forest use in the tropics, especially as it provides local communities and regions with timber resources. Logging greatly alters abiotic and biotic factors which are fundamental in seedling establishment and spatial heterogeneity of tree recruitment. Niche and dispersal processes may affect post-logging seedling establishment, particularly in water-constrained tropical dry forests (TDF). To understand how selective logging affects tree recruitment and how forest exploitation can become a sustainable practice, a theoretical framework has been set up based on these processes. We assessed post-logging seedling establishment in a Bolivian Chiquitano TDF by: (i) characterizing logging microsites and the variability in abiotic (canopy openness, soil compaction and soil water content) and biotic (short and long-distance dispersal) factors among them, (ii) evaluating the roles played by those factors, here considered surrogates of niche and dispersal processes, on seedling establishment, and (iii) providing guidelines to ensure tree regeneration in similar logged TDFs. One year after logging, seedling establishment of five canopy tree species was assessed in four microsite types created by selective logging and in undisturbed TDF. Dispersal processes were described by interpolated kernel estimates of abundance of adult trees, i.e. potential seed sources. After logging, the abiotic environment was considerably altered, especially in the most disturbed logging microsites, leading to significant changes in canopy openness and soil compaction, the most important factors determining seedling establishment in four out of the five studied species. Dispersal processes also influenced regeneration in three tree species. Since the spatial distribution of adult trees influences post-logging regeneration, this should be considered to improve sustainability in logging operations across the tropics.

AB The Chinese steppe is undergoing a drastic increase in nitrogen (N) deposition, and the precipitation in this region is predicted to increase. However, the response of soil N2O emissions to the coupling changes of precipitation and N deposition in grassland ecosystem has been seldom discussed. A manipulative field experiment was conducted to investigate the individual and interactive effects of precipitation increase and N deposition on soil N2O efflux in semi-arid temperate grassland in Inner Mongolia during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011.The treatments included four N addition levels [20 g N m(-2) y(-1) (N20) 10 gN m(-2) y(-1) (N10), 5 g N m(-2) y(-1) (N5), and a zero-N control (CK)] and two water application levels [natural precipitation for dry (D) and 15% increase of long-term mean annual precipitation for wet (W) treatments]. Results indicated that N and water addition both significantly increased soil N2O effluxes < 0.01). The maximum N2O emissions were observed within 2-3 days after N addition to all treatments, and the N2O effluxes in W treatments were generally higher than in D treatments for the same N input level. For the treatments without N inputs, the N2O emission peak of WCK was 9.8% higher than DCK in 2010. The effect of water addition on N2O emission was more evident when more N fertilizer was applied. For the high N input treatments, the maximum N2O emission of WN20 treatment was 222.6% higher than DN20 in 2010. The changes in N and water availabilities accounted for 91.3% (2010) and 75.6% (2011) of the N2O cumulative efflux variation among different treatments (P < 0.01). The N2O effluxes were significantly affected by the interactive effect between N and water in 2010 and 2011 (P < 0.05). Significant interannual variability in the cumulative N2O emissions was observed, the cumulative N2O emissions in 2011 were significantly lower than those in 2010 even though the summer of 2011 experienced higher rainfall (P < 0.01). Temperature also significantly influenced soil N2O emission apart from the effects of water and N. The temperature change accounted for 41.3% (W) to 47.2% (D) of the temporal variations in N2O emission during the relatively dry 2010. The combined changes in soil moisture, NH4+-N, and temperature accounted for 43.1% (D) to 54.5% (W) of the temporal variations in N2O emission in the relatively wet year of 2011.

AB Recent studies indicate that morphologically cryptic species may be ecologically more different than would be predicted from their morphological similarity and phylogenetic relatedness. However, in biodiversity research it often remains unclear whether cryptic species should be treated as ecologically equivalent, or whether detected differences have ecological significance. In this study, we assessed the ecological equivalence of four morphologically cryptic species of the amphipod genus Niphargus. All species live in a small, isolated area on the Istrian Peninsula in the NW Balkans. The distributional ranges of the species are partially overlapping and all species are living in springs. We reconstructed their ecological niches using morphological traits related to feeding, bioclimatic niche envelope and species' preference for epi-hypogean habitats. The ecological meaning of differences in niches was evaluated using distributional data and co-occurrence frequencies. We show that the species comprise two pairs of sister species. All species differ from each other and the degree of differentiation is not related to phylogenetic relatedness. Moreover, low co-occurrence frequencies in sympatric zones imply present or past interspecific competition. This pattern suggests that species are not differentiated enough to reduce interspecific competition, nor ecologically equivalent to co-exist via neutral dynamics. We tentatively conclude that the question of ecological equivalence relates to the scale of the study: at a fine scale, species' differences may influence dynamics in a local community, whereas at the regional level these species likely play roughly similar ecological roles.

TI Identifying Shifts in Leaf-Litter Ant Assemblages (Hymenoptera:

AB Global or regional environmental changes in climate or land use have been increasingly implied in shifts in boundaries (ecotones) between adjacent ecosystems such as beech or oak-dominated forests and forest-steppe ecotones that frequently co-occur near the southern range limits of deciduous forest biome in Europe. Yet, our ability to detect changes in biological communities across these ecosystems, or to understand their environmental drivers, can be hampered when different sampling methods are required to characterize biological communities of the adjacent but ecologically different ecosystems. Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) have been shown to be particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and vegetation and they require different sampling methods in closed vs. open habitats. We compared ant assemblages of closed-forests (beech-or oak-dominated) and open forest-steppe habitats in southwestern Carpathians using methods for closed-forest (litter sifting) and open habitats (pitfall trapping), and developed an integrated sampling approach to characterize changes in ant assemblages across these adjacent ecosystems. Using both methods, we collected 5,328 individual ant workers from 28 species. Neither method represented ant communities completely, but pitfall trapping accounted for more species (24) than litter sifting (16). Although pitfall trapping characterized differences in species richness and composition among the ecosystems better, with beech forest being most species poor and ecotone most species rich, litter sifting was more successful in identifying characteristic litter-dwelling species in oak-dominated forest. The integrated sampling approach using both methods yielded more accurate characterization of species richness and composition, and particularly so in species-rich forest-steppe habitat where the combined sample identified significantly higher number of species compared to either of the two methods on their own. Thus, an integrated sampling approach should be used to fully characterize changes in ant assemblages across ecosystem boundaries, or with vegetation change over time, and particularly so in species-rich habitats such as forest-steppe ecotones.

AB Similar environmental driving forces can produce similarity among geographically distant ecosystems. Coastal oceanic upwelling, for example, has been associated with elevated biomass and abundance patterns of certain functional groups, e.g., corticated macroalgae. In the upwelling system of Northern Chile, we examined measures of intertidal macrobenthic composition, structure and trophic ecology across eighteen shores varying in their proximity to two coastal upwelling centres, in a hierarchical sampling design (spatial scales of >1 and >10 km). The influence of coastal upwelling on intertidal communities was confirmed by the stable isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of consumers, including a dominant suspension feeder, grazers, and their putative resources of POM, epilithic biofilm, and macroalgae. We highlight the utility of muscle delta N-15 from the suspension feeding mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, as a proxy for upwelling, supported by satellite data and previous studies. Where possible, we used corrections for broader-scale trends, spatial autocorrelation, ontogenetic dietary shifts and spatial baseline isotopic variation prior to analysis. Our results showed macroalgal assemblage composition, and benthic consumer assemblage structure, varied significantly with the intertidal influence of coastal upwelling, especially contrasting bays and coastal headlands. Coastal topography also separated differences in consumer resource use. This suggested that coastal upwelling, itself driven by coastline topography, influences intertidal communities by advecting nearshore phytoplankton populations offshore and cooling coastal water temperatures. We recommend the isotopic values of benthic organisms, specifically long-lived suspension feeders, as in situ alternatives to offshore measurements of upwelling influence.

AB The ecological and physiological significance of body size is well recognized. However, key macroevolutionary questions regarding the dependency of body size trends on the taxonomic scale of analysis and the role of environment in controlling long-term evolution of body size are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate these issues for decapod crustaceans, a group that diversified in the Mesozoic. A compilation of body size data for 792 brachyuran crab and lobster species reveals that their maximum, mean and median body size increased, but no increase in minimum size was observed. This increase is not expressed within lineages, but is rather a product of the appearance and/or diversification of new clades of larger, primarily burrowing to shelter-seeking decapods. This argues against directional selective pressures within lineages. Rather, the trend is a macroevolutionary consequence of species sorting: preferential origination of new decapod clades with intrinsically larger body sizes. Furthermore, body size evolution appears to have been habitat-controlled. In the Cretaceous, reef-associated crabs became markedly smaller than those in other habitats, a pattern that persists today. The long-term increase in body size of crabs and lobsters, coupled with their increased diversity and abundance, suggests that their ecological impact may have increased over evolutionary time.

AB Individuals vary within a species in many ecologically important ways, but the causes and consequences of such variation are often poorly understood. Foraging behavior is among the most profitable and risky activities in which organisms engage and is expected to be under strong selection. Among social insects there is evidence that within-colony variation in traits such as foraging behavior can increase colony fitness, but variation between colonies and the potential consequences of such variation are poorly documented. In this study, we tested natural populations of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, for the existence of colony and regional variation in foraging behavior and tested the persistence of this variation over time and across foraging habitats. We also reared single-lineage colonies in standardized environments to explore the contribution of colony lineage. Fire ants from natural populations exhibited significant and persistent colony and regional-level variation in foraging behaviors such as extra-nest activity, exploration, and discovery of and recruitment to resources. Moreover, colony-level variation in extra-nest activity was significantly correlated with colony growth, suggesting that this variation has fitness consequences. Lineage of the colony had a significant effect on extra-nest activity and exploratory activity and explained approximately half of the variation observed in foraging behaviors, suggesting a heritable component to colony-level variation in behavior.

AB Background
   What are the determinant factors of community assemblies in the most diverse ecosystem in the ocean? Coral reefs can be divided in continental (i.e., reefs that develop on the continental shelf, including siliciclastic reefs) and oceanic (i.e., far off the continental shelf, usually on volcanic substratum); whether or not these habitat differences impose community-wide ecological divergence or species exclusion/coexistence with evolutionary consequences, is unknown.
   Methods
   Studying Caribbean octocorals as model system, we determined the phylogenetic community structure in a coral reef community, making emphasis on species coexistence evidenced on trait evolution and environmental feedbacks. Forty-nine species represented in five families constituted the species pool from which a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using mtDNA. We included data from 11 localities in the Western Caribbean (Colombia) including most reef types. To test diversity-environment and phenotype-environment relationships, phylogenetic community structure and trait evolution we carried out comparative analyses implementing ecological and evolutionary approaches.
   Results
   Phylogenetic inferences suggest clustering of oceanic reefs (e.g., atolls) contrasting with phylogenetic overdispersion of continental reefs (e.g., reefs banks). Additionally, atolls and barrier reefs had the highest species diversity (Shannon index) whereas phylogenetic diversity was higher in reef banks. The discriminant component analysis supported this differentiation between oceanic and continental reefs, where continental octocoral species tend to have greater calyx apertures, thicker branches, prominent calyces and azooxanthellate species. This analysis also indicated a clear separation between the slope and the remaining habitats, caused by the presence or absence of Symbiodinium. K statistic analysis showed that this trait is conserved as well as the branch shape.
   Discussion
   There was strong octocoral community structure with opposite diversity and composition patterns between oceanic and continental reefs. Even habitats with similar depths and overall environmental conditions did not share similar communities between oceanic and continental reefs. This indicates a strong regional influence over the local communities, probably due to water transparency differences between major reef types, i.e., oceanic vs. continental shelf-neritic. This was supported by contrasting patterns found in morphology, composition and evolutionary history of the species between atolls and reef banks.

TI Relationships between Community Level Functional Traits of Trees and

AB Most of the previous studies on functional traits focus exclusively on either seedlings or trees. Little knowledge exists on the relationships between community level functional traits of trees and seedlings during succession. Here, we examine variations of the community-level functional traits for trees and seedlings and their correlations along a secondary successional and environmental gradient in a tropical lowland rainforest after shifting cultivation. The results showed that the dynamic patterns in community level functional traits of seedlings were generally consistent with those of the trees during secondary succession. Compared with seedlings, community level traits for trees were less affected by abiotic factors during secondary succession. Correlations between community level functional traits of trees and seedlings were significant for: leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen concentration in the 18-year-old fallow; leaf chlorophyll content in the 30-year-old fallow; specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen concentration in the 60-year-old fallow; and leaf nitrogen concentration in old growth. However, these traits except specific leaf area for the tree and seedling communities were all significantly correlated if all the successional stages were combined. Our results suggest that the correlations between community level functional traits of trees and those of seedlings depend on the actual traits and the successional stages examined. However, if all the four successional stages are combined, then four out of five of the community level functional traits for trees could be well predicted by those of the seedlings in the tropical lowland rain forest.

AB Gap phase dynamics are the dominant mode of forest turnover in tropical forests. However, gap processes are infrequently studied at the landscape scale. Airborne lidar data offer detailed information on three-dimensional forest structure, providing a means to characterize fine-scale (1 m) processes in tropical forests over large areas. Lidar-based estimates of forest structure (top down) differ from traditional field measurements (bottom up), and necessitate clear-cut definitions unencumbered by the wisdom of a field observer. We offer a new definition of a forest gap that is driven by forest dynamics and consistent with precise ranging measurements from airborne lidar data and tall, multi-layered tropical forest structure. We used 1000 ha of multi-temporal lidar data (2008, 2012) at two sites, the Tapajos National Forest and Ducke Reserve, to study gap dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon. Here, we identified dynamic gaps as contiguous areas of significant growth, that correspond to areas > 10 m(2), with height < 10 m. Applying the dynamic definition at both sites, we found over twice as much area in gap at Tapajos National Forest (4.8 %) as compared to Ducke Reserve (2.0 %). On average, gaps were smaller at Ducke Reserve and closed slightly more rapidly, with estimated height gains of 1.2 m y(-1) versus 1.1 m y(-1) at Tapajos. At the Tapajos site, height growth in gap centers was greater than the average height gain in gaps (1.3 m y(-1) versus 1.1 m y(-1)). Rates of height growth between lidar acquisitions reflect the interplay between gap edge mortality, horizontal ingrowth and gap size at the two sites. We estimated that approximately 10% of gap area closed via horizontal ingrowth at Ducke Reserve as opposed to 6 % at Tapajos National Forest. Height loss (interpreted as repeat damage and/or mortality) and horizontal ingrowth accounted for similar proportions of gap area at Ducke Reserve (13% and 10 %, respectively). At Tapajos, height loss had a much stronger signal (23 % versus 6 %) within gaps. Both sites demonstrate limited gap contagiousness defined by an increase in the likelihood of mortality in the immediate vicinity (similar to 6 m) of existing gaps.

AB Payments for environmental services (PES) are often viewed as a way to simultaneously improve conservation outcomes and the wellbeing of rural households who receive the payments. However, evidence for such win-win outcomes has been elusive. We add to the growing literature on conservation program impacts by using primary household survey data to evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of participation in Costa Rica's PES program. Despite the substantial cash transfers to voluntary participants in this program, we do not detect any evidence of impacts on their wealth or self-reported well-being using a quasi-experimental design. These results are consistent with the common claim that voluntary PES do not harm participants, but they beg the question of why landowners participate if they do not benefit. Landowners in our sample voluntarily renewed their contracts after five years in the program and thus are unlikely to have underestimated their costs of participation. They apparently did not invest additional income from the program in farm inputs such as cattle or hired labor, since both decreased as a result of participation. Nor do we find evidence that participation encouraged moves off-farm. Instead, semi-structured interviews suggest that participants joined the program to secure their property rights and contribute to the public good of forest conservation. Thus, in order to understand the social impacts of PES, we need to look beyond simple economic rationales and material outcomes.

AB Among the acanthocephalans, Neoechinorhynchus is one of the most speciose genera, with 116 described species distributed worldwide. The adults of Neoechinorhynchus are found in the intestine of freshwater and brackish water fish, as well as in freshwater turtles. In this study, a checklist of the congeneric species of Neoechinorhynchus occurring in Middle-American fish and turtles is presented. The checklist contains the records established in all published accounts, as well as novel data from survey work conducted in the region comprising Neotropical areas of Mexico, as well as some localities in Central America. The species delimitation criteria used to discriminate among species is based on molecular data. In the last years, a large database derived from sequences of the D2 + D3 domains of the large subunit of rDNA (28S) was generated for 262 specimens corresponding to nine species of Neoechinorhynchus. This molecular marker has shown to be useful in establishing species limits within Neoechinorhynchus and in resolving phylogenetic relationships at species level. Based on our results, the domains D2 + D3 of the 28S rDNA could be considered as potential DNA barcodes to complement mitochondrial DNA to discriminate among acanthocephalan species.

AB Species may reduce competitive interactions by temporal separation in activity times. Similarly to other animals, ants also partition their niches by being active during specific periods of the year or at specific times of the day. However, if several species share the same temporal niches, interspecific competition may give rise to behavioural dominance hierarchies, territoriality or spatial mosaics. Thus, our first aim was to study daily activity patterns of alpine communities to investigate their temporal dynamics at both general and specific levels. Due to short distances among different ecosystems, montane systems are ideal models to study the effect of geographic variation on community structure. On the other hand, ants represent an excellent model to analyze beta-diversity because they are one of the most ecologically significant components of many ecosystems. Nevertheless, there is a lack of ecological studies on ant communities in Italy and, in particular, on alpine ants. Therefore, the second aim of this work was to study ant species richness and distribution in order to update information on alpine ant fauna. As ants can simultaneously exhibit multiple trophic roles, assessing the feeding habits of an ant community may help to clarify how these insects can influence their ecosystem. Thus, the third aim of this research was to evaluate ant food preferences in alpine environments. Samplings were conducted in Soana Valley, inside the Gran Paradiso National Park, during summer 2011: pitfall traps and food baits were placed in order to collect data on species richness, abundances and food preferences. The acquired results on activity patterns showed that ants were more active in the late morning. The analysis of food preferences revealed that sugary solutions were the favourite resources. Finally, concerning species spatial distribution, there was a higher level of biodiversity at intermediate elevations, probably due to an increase of temperature and spatial heterogeneity.

AB We evaluated the effects of fire on the vegetative phenological behavior (crown foliage cover, sprouting, mature and young leaves) of woody species at two sites in the Brazilian savanna, one of which had been accidentally burned. We used generalized additive mixed models to test the hypothesis that: 1) fire damages total foliage cover, thus leading to changes in vegetative phenological patterns. As this hypothesis was corroborated, we also tested whether 2) the damage caused by fire to the total crown foliage cover and mature leaves is greater in evergreen than in deciduous species, and 3) the negative effects of fire on vegetative phenology persist after the first fire-free year. The first two hypotheses were corroborated, but the third was not. Fire effects on total crown foliage cover and mature leaves were greatest during the first three months following the fire, and were significantly greater in evergreen species. For shoots and young leaves, the greatest differences found between three and seven months post-fire. On the other hand, no differences were observed in phenological events between burned and unburned sites in the second year post-fire, indicating that marked effects of the fire were only observed over a short period. Our results showed immediate negative effects on the vegetative phenophases, but also that these effects are transient, and cannot be discerned after the first fire-free year.

AB The paper examines the ways in which states facilitate 'new enclosures' of natural resources, and the challenges of this as a strategy of development and environmental sustainability. We argue that enclosures introduce significant changes in property regimes, which redefine conditions for the access and control of land and forest, especially for tribal and indigenous communities. In this context, we analyse two state-initiated projects-the iSimangaliso Wetland Park in South Africa, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the Socio Bosque incentive conservation programme in Ecuador.

AB Commodity crop expansion in the tropics presents the challenge of preserving tropical moist forest (TMF) ecosystems and their role in carbon sequestration. We propose an algorithm, specific to the TMF biome, which identifies 125 million ha of degraded, low-carbon density land (LCDL) in the Pantropical TMF belt for agricultural expansion. About 65 million ha of LCDL are in contiguous tracts >5,000 ha and <500 m elevation, meeting the prerequisites for commercial-scale oil palm production, the fastest-expanding industrialized commodity crop in the TMF. These areas could support expansion of commercial agriculture for another 25-50 years without further conversion of TMF. Confining agricultural expansion to the LCDL can avoid the release of approximately 13 billion tons of CO2 while saving valuable tropical biodiversity. The simplicity and transparency of this easily monitored metric could prove useful to producers, governments, investors, environmental stewards, and consumers and enhance good governance in tropical regions.

AB The research was done in the Atacora Mountain chain in Togo which tended to assess the change of vegetation cover during a 24-year period. It also aims to evaluate the dynamic of the net primary productivity (NPP) of the living plants over the same period. The Landsat imagery covering three different periods (1987, 2000, and 2011) was pre-processed to correct atmospheric and radiometric parameters as well as gapfilling the 2011 SCL-off images. Then, the vegetation indices such as NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), SR (simple ratio vegetation index), SAVI (soil-adjusted vegetation index), and CASA (carnegie- ames- stanford approach)model for NPP were applied on these images after masking the study area. The results showed a quiet decrease in the vegetation cover. The vegetation loss was more significant from 2000 to 2011 than from 1987 to 2000, and anthropogenic activities can be deemed as the main cause of the vegetation loss. The biomass assessment by NPP computation also showed a decrease over the time. Similar to the change of the vegetation cover, the ecosystem net productivity was very low in 2011 compared to 2000 and 1987. It seems that the general health condition of the vegetation, including its potentiality in carbon sinking, was negatively affected in this area, which has already been under threatened. A perpetual monitoring of these ecosystems by means of efficient techniques could enhance the sustainable management tools of in the framework of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).

AB In this paper, we study a multi-trophic prey predator system composed by top- and intermediate-level consumers and two food sources. Biomass fluxes across trophic levels are modeled by means of Holling-II type functional responses and one of the sources is subject to periodic impulsive events consisting in biomass injections. Referring to this system, we analyze the local and global stability properties of periodic eradicated solutions and establish permanence properties for the populations in terms of relations between the model parameters and the intensity of the impulses. Secondly, we formulate an optimal control problem for this system as well as an Iterative Dynamic Programming (IDP) scheme for its solution. By means of the proposed algorithm we specify the intensity of the impulsive controls to be applied periodically in order to regulate the biomass levels along time. In our formulation, the intensity of the periodic impulsive events depends on the biomass of the upper-level consumer population, as we can often see in an agricultural framework wherein the quantity of human workforce can significantly affect the size of crop periodically collected.

AB Respecification of structural models allows evaluating new hypothesis and enhances understanding of how changes in one pool can affect the other pools in the model. The aim of this study was to evaluate the theoretical concept of P pools (unmeasurable variables-latent) using data from Hedley's sequential extraction method for a better understanding of the P cycle in tropical soils. The theoretical concept being tested is the degree to which available P is controlled by different soil P pools as measured by extraction techniques. The respecified models were adequate and able to represent a generalization of P cycling in soils. The best structural model including latent variables with multiple indicators was consistent with the theoretical concept that the indicators of soil P pools are P fractions determined by the sequential extraction method. In this model, not only is there a direct relationship between the organic, occluded and primary mineral pools and the available P pool, but the indirect relationships via the organic pool were theoretically and statistically adequate. Thus, the model showed the interrelationships of geochemical and biological processes on the available P and it corroborated the hypothesis of the dependence of the available P pool to the organic pool in unfertilized tropical soils.

AB Direct seeding is a promising technique for ecological restoration, but it has been poorly studied in neotropical savannas. Different types of plant cover (no cover, crops, or green manure) and fertilization (unfertilized, synthetic fertilizer, or poultry litter) were used to verify if survival and growth of different tree species after direct seeding could be enhanced by the use of any combination of these techniques. Seedling emergence, establishment, and growth were followed for 2 years for six savanna tree species sown in an agricultural field in Central Brazil. Germination was high (52%, on average) for Anacardium occidentale, Aspidosperma macrocarpon, Hymenaea stigonocarpa, Dipteryx alata, Eugenia dysenterica, and Magonia pubescens. Six additional species were planted, but less than 5% of these seeds germinated. Crops (60% shade) did not affect seedling survival and biomass compared with the control treatment, supporting the use of this strategy during the initial phase of restoration to involve farmers in the process. In contrast, the excessive shading (95%) from the green manure treatment decreased the survival of two species and the growth in biomass and diameter of five species, especially when combined with fertilization. Seedling growth was very slow throughout the experiment, requiring extended weed management. This study supports the use of direct seeding of the studied species for savanna restoration, but methods could be improved to include a larger number of species.

AB In this contribution we present a new species of horned turtle, Gaffneylania auricularis gen. et sp. nov., from the Paleogene of Patagonia. The specimens come from the lower section of the Sarmiento Formation (Middle Eocene) at Cerro Verde (Canadon Hondo area, Province of Chubut, Argentina). The level containing turtles and crocodyliforrmes is located at the base of the section and it consists of laminated, fine tuffs interpreted as shallow pond sediments. It underlies another fossiliferous level comprising lenticular, massive sandstones bearing skeletal remains of mammals, referred by previous authors to the Casamayoran SALMA. Gaffneylania auricularis represents one of the most complete meiolaniids from South America found to date and it is distinguished from other meiolaniids by the presence of a peculiar half-moon-shaped, thick rim surrounding the cavum tympani, the presence of three cranial scutes K and an unenclosed canalis chorda tympani mandibularis, among others. This new species sheds new light on the evolution and palaeobiogeographical history of the clade Meiolaniidae in Australasia and South America during the Cainozoic. The break up of southern Gondwana provoked major global climatic changes during the Cainozoic that probably influenced the evolution of meiolaniid turtles. The co-evolution of meiolaniids with other amniotes (e.g. chelid turtles, mammals) suggests a common palaeobiogeographical history of those clades in southern Gondwana.

AB Aim Resource bottlenecks - periods of severe restriction in resource availability - triggered by increased climate variability represent important and little-understood mechanisms through which climate change will affect biodiversity. In this review, we aim to synthesize the key global change processes that exacerbate the severity of bottlenecks in resource availability on animal populations, and outline how adaptation responses can help buffer the impacts.
   Location Global.
   Methods We collate examples from the literature of population-level impacts of resource bottlenecks induced by extreme weather and climate events to explore the types of population impacts that have most frequently been recorded, and the type of extreme events associated with them. We then develop a conceptual framework that captures the factors contributing to species' vulnerability to climate-induced spatial and temporal resource bottlenecks in increasingly variable environments.
   Results Increases in the frequency, severity and/or duration of extreme weather and climate events can trigger resource bottlenecks that act as powerful demographic constraints on terrestrial fauna, and often exacerbate other human-induced pressures such as land use change. Such phenomena are likely to become more frequent and severe, with potentially nonlinear increases in impact. Forty-nine instances of population-level impacts from climate-induced resource bottlenecks were recorded from the literature, including four extinctions and ten population crashes. Anthropogenic land use change interacts with increasing climatic variability to exacerbate these resource 'crunches', but can sometimes act as a buffer for species.
   Main Conclusions Resource bottlenecks are likely to be a large class of climate-sensitive stressors whose impacts may play out at the population scale, even well within a species' apparent climatic envelope. More effective conservation responses to climate-related threats include explicit actions, such as managing protected area networks for spatial and temporal resource complementarities, that buffer vulnerable species against bottlenecks.

AB Interactions among neighboring individuals influence plant performance and should create spatial patterns in local community structure. In order to assess the role of large trees in generating spatial patterns in local species richness, we used the individual species-area relationship (ISAR) to evaluate the species richness of trees of different size classes (and dead trees) in circular neighborhoods with varying radius around large trees of different focal species. To reveal signals of species interactions, we compared the ISAR function of the individuals of focal species with that of randomly selected nearby locations. We expected that large trees should strongly affect the community structure of smaller trees in their neighborhood, but that these effects should fade away with increasing size class. Unexpectedly, we found that only few focal species showed signals of species interactions with trees of the different size classes and that this was less likely for less abundant focal species. However, the few and relatively weak departures from independence were consistent with expectations of the effect of competition for space and the dispersal syndrome on spatial patterns. A noisy signal of competition for space found for large trees built up gradually with increasing life stage; it was not yet present for large saplings but detectable for intermediates. Additionally, focal species with animal-dispersed seeds showed higher species richness in their neighborhood than those with gravity- and gyration-dispersed seeds. Our analysis across the entire ontogeny from recruits to large trees supports the hypothesis that stochastic effects dilute deterministic species interactions in highly diverse communities. Stochastic dilution is a consequence of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity in species-rich communities where the identities of the nearest neighbors of a given plant are largely unpredictable. While the outcome of local species interactions is governed for each plant by deterministic fitness and niche differences, the large variability of competitors causes also a large variability in the outcomes of interactions and does not allow for strong directed responses at the species level. Collectively, our results highlight the critical effect of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity in structuring local spatial patterns of tropical forest diversity.

AB Ecologists have long recognized that plant performance is affected by the density and composition of neighbouring individuals. With the advent of highly resolved species-level phylogenies, it has become possible to test whether such density-dependent neighbourhood interactions are also phylogenetically dependent. Most studies of density dependence have focused on a single life stage; however, the relative importance of different neighbourhood interactions may shift over the lifetime of an individual. We examined effects of conspecific neighbour density, heterospecific neighbour density and average phylogenetic relatedness of heterospecific neighbours on the survival of seedlings, saplings, juveniles and adult trees of 29 focal tree species using long-term, spatially explicit forest dynamics data and a highly resolved DNA barcode phylogeny from the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Our results show a decline in the strength of conspecific negative density dependence across life stages: strong negative conspecific neighbour effects at early life stages gave way to weak positive conspecific neighbour effects for adult trees. In contrast, the effect of heterospecific neighbour density on survival showed no clear trend with life stage. We found evidence of phylogenetic density dependence in the BCI forest, with a significant negative impact of neighbourhood relatedness on focal tree survival, but only for later life stages. In contrast to studies from other tropical forests, neighbourhood relatedness had a significant positive effect on seedling survival. Furthermore, we found that focal species varied much more widely in their sensitivity to conspecific neighbour density than in their reactions to heterospecific neighbour density or phylogenetic relatedness.Synthesis. Overall, our results demonstrate that both conspecific density dependence and phylogenetic density dependence influence tropical tree survival, but that their relative importance varies with life stage and among species. Our study highlights the need to incorporate multiple life stages and multiple species when assessing the factors contributing to individual survival and species coexistence for long-lived organisms.

AB Forest biophysical structure - the arrangement and frequency of leaves and stems - emerges from growth, mortality and space filling dynamics, and may also influence those dynamics by structuring light environments. To investigate this interaction, we developed models that could use LiDAR remote sensing to link leaf area profiles with tree size distributions, comparing models which did not (metabolic scaling theory) and did allow light to influence this link. We found that a light environment-to-structure link was necessary to accurately simulate tree size distributions and canopy structure in two contrasting Amazon forests. Partitioning leaf area profiles into size-class components, we found that demographic rates were related to variation in light absorption, with mortality increasing relative to growth in higher light, consistent with a light environment feedback to size distributions. Combining LiDAR with models linking forest structure and demography offers a high-throughput approach to advance theory and investigate climate-relevant tropical forest change.

AB Although the distribution ranges and abundance of many plant species have declined dramatically in recent decades, detailed analysis of these changes and their cause have only become possible following the publication of second- and third-generation national distribution atlases. Decline can now be compared both between species and in different parts of species' ranges. We extracted data from distribution atlases to compare range persistence of 736 plant species common to both the UK and Estonia between survey periods encompassing almost the same years (1969 and 1999 in the UK and 1970 and 2004 in Estonia). We determined which traits were most closely associated with variation in species persistence, whether these were the same in each country, and the extent to which they explained differences in persistence between the countries. Mean range size declined less in Estonia than in the UK (24.3% vs. 30.3%). One-third of species in Estonia (239) maintained >90% of their distribution range compared with one-fifth (141) in the UK. In Estonia, 99 species lost >50% of their range compared with 127 species in the UK. Persistence was very positively related to original range in both countries. Major differences in species persistence between the studied countries were primarily determined by biogeographic (affiliation to floristic element) and ecoevolutionary (plant strategy) factors. In contrast, within-country persistence was most strongly determined by tolerance of anthropogenic activities. Decline of species in the families Orchidaceae and Potamogetonaceae was significantly greater in the UK than in Estonia. Almost all of the 736 common and native European plant species in our study are currently declining in their range due to pressure from anthropogenic activities. Those species with low tolerance of human activity, with biotic pollination vectors and in the families referred to above are the most vulnerable, especially where human population density is high.

AB Tropical forest responses to climatic variability have important consequences for global carbon cycling, but are poorly understood. As empirical, correlative studies cannot disentangle the interactive effects of climatic variables on tree growth, we used a tree growth model (IBTREE) to unravel the climate effects on different physiological pathways and in turn on stem growth variation. We parameterized the model for canopy trees of Toona ciliata (Meliaceae) from a Thai monsoon forest and compared predicted and measured variation from a tree-ring study over a 30-year period. We used historical climatic variation of minimum and maximum day temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide (CO2) in different combinations to estimate the contribution of each climate factor in explaining the inter-annual variation in stem growth. Running the model with only variation in maximum temperature and rainfall yielded stem growth patterns that explained almost 70% of the observed inter-annual variation in stem growth. Our results show that maximum temperature had a strong negative effect on the stem growth by increasing respiration, reducing stomatal conductance and thus mitigating a higher transpiration demand, and - to a lesser extent - by directly reducing photosynthesis. Although stem growth was rather weakly sensitive to rain, stem growth variation responded strongly and positively to rainfall variation owing to the strong inter-annual fluctuations in rainfall. Minimum temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration did not significantly contribute to explaining the inter-annual variation in stem growth. Our innovative approach - combining a simulation model with historical data on tree-ring growth and climate - allowed disentangling the effects of strongly correlated climate variables on growth through different physiological pathways. Similar studies on different species and in different forest types are needed to further improve our understanding of the sensitivity of tropical tree growth to climatic variability and change.

AB The aim of the study was to explore the effects of climate-induced soil properties on nitrogen (N) transformation and N2O emissions in the tropical region.
   Soil samples were collected from the soils developed from granite and covered with secondary forest vegetation along with the aridity gradient in the Hainan Islands, China, in which the annual mean temperature ranged from 24 to 25 A degrees C, but the annual precipitation from 1,000 to 2,166 mm, and the annual evaporation from 1,861 to 2,409 mm within about 180 km. The gross of N transformation rates and N2O emissions in the soils were determined by employing N-15 tracing methods at laboratory incubation under conditions of 60 % WHC and 25 A degrees C.
   The gross rate of mineralization and turnover rate of soil organic N increased significantly (P < 0.05 for both), but net mineralization rate did not differ significantly with the increase of aridity index (Di) (P > 0.05). Gross and net rate of nitrification increased significantly (P < 0.05 for both), while cumulative N2O emissions over the incubation period did not differ significantly along the aridity gradient (P > 0.05). Statistical analysis showed that soil pH, which was correlated significantly with Di, was correlated significantly with the gross rate of N mineralization, turnover rate of soil organic N, gross nitrification, and the ratio of N2O in nitrification products.
   The investigation indicated that the climate-induced soil properties had significant effects on the gross and net N transformation rates, but not on net mineralization and N2O emissions in the tropical secondary forests in the Hainan Island.

AB The ability of phenotypically similar species to coexist at local scales is paradoxical given that species that closely resemble each other should compete strongly for resources and thus be subject to competitive exclusion. Although theory has identified the key requirements for species to stably coexist, empirical tests of coexistence have rarely been conducted. We explored a key requirement for species to stably coexist: a species can invade a community when it is initially rare. We also assessed whether primary productivity (manipulated using phosphorus availability) affected invasion success by increasing the amount of resources available. Using two mesocosm experiments and an assemblage of phenotypically similar amphipod species in the genus Hyalella, we found no evidence for invasion success among the three Hyalella species. Further, patterns of species exclusions differed among the species, which suggests that one species is an especially poor competitor. Finally, these patterns were consistent regardless of whether mesocosms were fertilized with low or high levels of phosphorus. Our results, suggest that species differences in resource competition and predator avoidance ability found in previous studies using these Hyalella species may not be sufficient to allow for coexistence. Moreover, our study demonstrates the importance of using a variety of empirical approaches to test species coexistence theory.

AB AimsAcross tropical regions, large forest areas have been converted to different agricultural land uses. These uses impose ecological disturbances affecting forest regeneration potential after field abandonment. Finding ways to identify those agricultural land uses limiting forest regeneration is a critical issue for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. Here, we developed a fast and inexpensive index, useful for quantifying ecological disturbance regimes associated with agricultural land uses, and tested its power to predict forest regeneration potential.
   LocationMunicipality of Marques de Comillas, southeast Mexico.
   MethodsInterviews were conducted with local farmers to quantify disturbance components (size, duration and severity) associated with agricultural land uses. The scaled values of these disturbance components were added in a simple ecological disturbance index (EDI). In each one of nine recently abandoned fields representing a wide range of EDI values, two 10-m(2) plots, one close to and one far from nearby forest remnants, were established. On each plot, all woody plants of 10-100m in height were counted, identified and measured in four 1-m(2) subplots, at the time of field abandonment and 2yr later. In addition, at each plot, 18 site condition (microclimate and soil) attributes were quantified at the time of abandonment. Plant density, biomass, species richness and species diversity were used as regeneration variables, and EDI and site condition attributes as independent ones.
   ResultsTwo years after abandonment, most regeneration variables declined exponentially with EDI. Biomass was not explained by EDI but changed positively with light availability. EDI was strongly correlated to vapour pressure deficit, which also predicted regeneration potential (except biomass).
   ConclusionsEDI is a cheap and easy tool for quantifying the ecological disturbance produced by a wide range of agricultural land uses. The index predicted several regeneration variables as well as or better than direct measurements of the site condition at the time of abandonment. EDI can be used to identify biodiversity-friendly agricultural land uses in human-modified landscapes.

AB Fire can change the species composition, diversity, and structure of savanna vegetation, thus altering growth and mortality rates. Such changes in the woody vegetation of burned savanna forest were evaluated over four years in comparison to unburned savanna forest All woody plants with a diameter at breast height > 10 cm were measured in 100 permanent plots. Six months later, 38 of these plots were burned. Three and a half years later, all surviving individuals were re-sampled. Species richness, diversity, and the number of individuals did not change in the burned plots, although they had significantly higher (p < 0.05) increases in basal area and mortality rates (5.1% year(-1)) than the unburned plots (3.0% year(-1)). Tachigali vulgaris had the greatest post-fire increase in basal area (53%). The results indicate that fire alters the dynamics and structure of the savanna forest, excluding the less fire-tolerant species and smaller individuals (<= 15cm). Tachigali vulgaris is a key species for the recovery of savanna forest biomass due to its considerable post-fire gains in basal area, at least over the short term due to its short life cycle. It follows that frequent burning of savanna forest would result in a marked change in the species composition and structure of its woody vegetation.

AB AimNaupactini are highly diverse weevils, widespread in the Neotropical region. Their evolution may have been driven by geological and environmental changes. Our main goals were to explain the biotic diversification of this tribe in South America and to test previous hypotheses on the relationships between distribution areas.
   LocationNeotropical South America.
   MethodsWe compiled geographical records for 165 species of South American Naupactini. We then applied a track analysis and a parsimony analysis of paralogy-free subtrees to obtain generalized tracks and a general area cladogram, respectively.
   ResultsWe retrieved 11 generalized tracks that coincided broadly with biogeographical areas of Neotropical South America: Northern Venezuelan, Galapagos Islands, Ecuadorian, Yungas, Cerrado, Caatinga, Puna+Pacific coastal deserts, Chacoan, Atlantic+Parana forests, Monte and Pampean. The single general area cladogram obtained showed the following topology: ((Northern Venezuelan-Ecuadorian) (Galapagos Islands-Puna+Pacific coastal deserts) (Yungas (Cerrado (Monte (Pampean (Chacoan-Atlantic+Parana forests)))))).
   Main conclusionsThe general patterns identified agree with biogeographical provinces of modern regionalizations, assumed to have been caused by vicariance. These biogeographical units form two main components, one from north-western South America and the other from south-eastern South America, separated by the barrier of the Andean cordillera. The absence of other discernible geological barriers and the influence of the Plio-Pleistocene cycles make it difficult to elucidate the historical relationships between most forest areas and nearby open areas of South America. These observations indicate that the taxa under consideration underwent dispersal at different times, contributing to complex biogeographical patterns.

AB Community genetics studies frequently focus on individual communities associated with individual plant genotypes, but little is known about the genetically based relationships among taxonomically and spatially disparate communities. We integrate studies of a wide range of communities living on the same plant genotypes to understand how the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of one community may be constrained or modulated by its underlying genetic connections to another community. We use pre-existing data sets collected from Populus angustifolia (narrowleaf cottonwood) growing in a common garden to test the hypothesis that the composition of pairs of distinct communities (e.g. endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, soil microbes) covary across tree genotypes, such that individual plant genotypes that support a unique composition of one community are more likely to support a unique composition of another community. We then evaluate the hypotheses that physical proximity, taxonomic similarity, time between sampling (time attenuation), and interacting foundation species within communities explain the strength of correlations. Three main results emerged. First, Mantel tests between communities revealed moderate to strong (=0.25-0.85) community-genetic correlations in almost half of the comparisons; correlations among phyllosphere endophyte, pathogen and arthropod communities were the most robust. Secondly, physical proximity determined the strength of community-genetic correlations, supporting a physical proximity hypothesis. Thirdly, consistent with the interacting foundation species hypothesis, the most abundant species drove many of the stronger correlations. Other hypotheses were not supported.Synthesis. The field of community genetics demonstrates that the structure of communities varies among plant genotypes; our results add to this field by showing that disparate communities covary among plant genotypes. Eco-evolutionary dynamics between plants and their associated organisms may therefore be mediated by the shared connections of different communities to plant genotype, indicating that the organization of biodiversity in this system is genetically based and non-neutral.

AB There has been an explosion of research on host-associated microbial communities (i.e., microbiomes). Much of this research has focused on surveys of microbial diversities across a variety of host species, including humans, with a view to understanding how these microbiomes are distributed across space and time, and how they correlate with host health, disease, phenotype, physiology and ecology. Fewer studies have focused on how these microbiomes may have evolved. In this paper, we develop an agent-based framework to study the dynamics of microbiome evolution. Our framework incorporates neutral models of how hosts acquire their microbiomes, and how the environmental microbial community that is available to the hosts is assembled. Most importantly, our framework also incorporates a Wright-Fisher genealogical model of hosts, so that the dynamics of microbiome evolution is studied on an evolutionary timescale. Our results indicate that the extent of parental contribution to microbial availability from one generation to the next significantly impacts the diversity of microbiomes: the greater the parental contribution, the less diverse the microbiomes. In contrast, even when there is only a very small contribution from a constant environmental pool, microbial communities can remain highly diverse. Finally, we show that our models may be used to construct hypotheses about the types of processes that operate to assemble microbiomes over evolutionary time.

AB Growth of secondary forest (capoeira) is an important factor in absorption of carbon from the atmosphere. Estimates of this absorption vary greatly, in large part due to the effect of different land-use histories on the estimates available in the literature. We relate land-use history to aboveground biomass accumulation of secondary vegetation in plots on land that had been used for agriculture (unmechanized manioc and maize) and for pasture in small rural properties in the Taruma-Mirim settlement near Manaus in central Amazonia, Brazil. We evaluated influence of (a) age of the second growth vegetation, (b) time of use as agriculture or pasture and (c) number of times the area was burned. Biomass data were obtained by destructive sampling of all plants with diameter at breast height >1 cm in 24 parcels of secondary vegetation ranging from 1 to 15 years of age in abandoned pasture (n = 9) and agriculture (n = 15). As compared to secondary vegetation in abandoned agricultural fields, vegetation in abandoned cattle pasture (the predominant use history for Amazonian secondary vegetation) grows 38% more slowly to age 6 years. Number of burns also negatively affects biomass recovery. Applying the growth rates we measured to the secondary forests reported in Brazil's Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change suggests that carbon uptake by this vegetation is overestimated by a factor of four in the report.

AB Despite the importance of invertebrate resources for Pacific coral reef islands, few studies have specifically addressed the effects of harvesting on invertebrate assemblages including targeted and non-targeted species. The impacts of recreational harvesting on reef and seagrass invertebrate assemblages in New Caledonia (South Pacific) are investigated by comparing communities in non-MPA and MPA areas. Sampling was done using a standard core method on seagrasses and by visual survey along belt transects on reefs. A total of 371 species were recorded, 174 on seagrasses and 254 on reefs, with 57 common species. Reef and seagrass invertebrate communities were very different in MPA and non-MPA areas. On both habitats, MPAs were identified as undisturbed areas while non-MPAs were defined as moderately disturbed with a predominance of small-sized and opportunistic species. Fishing not only affects target species but also non-target species through secondary effects. These results highlight the necessity of a community based approach for the conservation of resources in tropical poorly known environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conflicts over the equitability of transboundary natural resource conservation and management schemes have created barriers to effective policy implementation and practice. In seeking to overcome these barriers in the context of progressing transboundary oceanic fisheries conservation, we explore the divide between equity as defined in principle and as applied in practice in international policy and law. Searching for cross-cutting lessons and themes, we first review multilateral environmental agreements to see how equity is commonly being defined, understood, and then applied in principle. From this analysis, we identify common elements that can facilitate the conceptual framing and application of equitable principles in practice. Framed within these elements, we then explore how applications of equitable principles have performed in two current transboundary conservation and management case studies in regional fisheries management and international climate change policy. From this analysis, we conclude with some lessons learned which show that finding solutions to equity-driven barriers to transboundary conservation, while challenging, are well within our existing capacity to develop and execute.

AB Gaps play a crucial role in maintaining species diversity, yet how community structure and composition influence gap formation is still poorly understood. We apply a spatially structured community model to predict how species diversity and intraspecific aggregation shape gap patterns emerging after climatic events, based on species-specific mortality responses. In multispecies communities, average gap size and gap-size diversity increased rapidly with increasing mean mortality once a mortality threshold was exceeded, greatly promoting gap recolonization opportunity. This result was observed at all levels of species richness. Increasing interspecific difference likewise enhanced these metrics, which may promote not only diversity maintenance but also community invasibility, since more diverse niches for both local and exotic species are provided. The richness effects on gap size and gap-size diversity were positive, but only expressed when species were sufficiently different. Surprisingly, while intraspecific clumping strongly promoted gapsize diversity, it hardly influenced average gap size. Species evenness generally reduced gap metrics induced by climatic events, so the typical assumption of maximum evenness in many experiments and models may underestimate community diversity and invasibility. Overall, understanding the factors driving gap formation in spatially structured assemblages can help predict community secondary succession after climatic events.

AB Understanding the role of predators in food webs can be challenging in highly diverse predator/prey systems composed of small cryptic species. DNA based dietary analysis can supplement predator removal experiments and provide high resolution for prey identification. Here we use a metabarcoding approach to provide initial insights into the diet and functional role of coral-dwelling predatory fish feeding on small invertebrates. Fish were collected in Moorea (French Polynesia) where the BIOCODE project has generated DNA barcodes for numerous coral associated invertebrate species. Pyrosequencing data revealed a total of 292 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) in the gut contents of the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), the flame hawkfish (Neocirrhites armatus) and the coral croucher (Caracanthus maculatus). One hundred forty-nine (51%) of them had species-level matches in reference libraries (>98% similarity) while 76 additional OTUs (26%) could be identified to higher taxonomic levels. Decapods that have a mutualistic relationship with Pocillopora and are typically dominant among coral branches, represent a minor contribution of the predators' diets. Instead, predators mainly consumed transient species including pelagic taxa such as copepods, chaetognaths and siphonophores suggesting non random feeding behavior. We also identified prey species known to have direct negative interactions with stony corals, such as Hapalocarcinus sp, a gall crab considered a coral parasite, as well as species of vermetid snails known for their deleterious effects on coral growth. Pocillopora DNA accounted for 20.8% and 20.1% of total number of sequences in the guts of the flame hawkfish and coral croucher but it was not detected in the guts of the arc-eye hawkfish. Comparison of diets among the three fishes demonstrates remarkable partitioning with nearly 80% of prey items consumed by only one predator. Overall, the taxonomic resolution provided by the metabarcoding approach highlights a highly complex interaction web and demonstrates that levels of trophic partitioning among coral reef fishes have likely been underestimated. Therefore, we strongly encourage further empirical approaches to dietary studies prior to making assumptions of trophic equivalency in food web reconstruction.

AB The identification of an ecological niche specific to the regeneration phase has mobilised significant attention. However, the importance of the regeneration niche concept remains unclear. Our main objective was to study the existence of such a regeneration niche for a leguminous shrub, Ulex europaeus. This study was carried out in southwest France in the context of water and nutrient stresses (mainly phosphorus limitation) due to the presence of nutrient-poor sandy soils. We analysed the regeneration of the species from the germination of seeds and emergence of new seedlings until the seedlings reached young shrub size. Our design included a P fertilisation treatment. We also investigated microsite characteristics (micro-topography and vegetation development) as they can interact with meteorological conditions and determine water availability for seeds and seedlings. We found that P availability controlled seedling growth and the time necessary to reach young shrub size. Water availability appeared to impact the species germination and seedlings survival. We also found that P and water availability depended on the interactions between microsite characteristics and climatic variations. Finally we found evidence that P and water availability are important ecological factors shaping the regeneration niche of the species, but we found weak evidence that any microsite would be appropriate for the regeneration of the species in the long term. Future studies regarding regeneration niches need to distinguish more clearly the ecological factors important for regeneration (the regeneration niche per se) and the physical world where the seedlings appear and develop (the regeneration habitat).

AB Investigating patterns of phylogenetic structure across different life stages of tree species in forests is crucial to understanding forest community assembly, and investigating forest gap influence on the phylogenetic structure of forest regeneration is necessary for understanding forest community assembly. Here, we examine the phylogenetic structure of tree species across life stages from seedlings to canopy trees, as well as forest gap influence on the phylogenetic structure of forest regeneration in a forest of the subtropical region in China. We investigate changes in phylogenetic relatedness (measured as NRI) of tree species from seedlings, saplings, treelets to canopy trees; we compare the phylogenetic turnover (measured as beta(NRI)) between canopy trees and seedlings in forest understory with that between canopy trees and seedlings in forest gaps. We found that phylogenetic relatedness generally increases from seedlings through saplings and treelets up to canopy trees, and that phylogenetic relatedness does not differ between seedlings in forest understory and those in forest gaps, but phylogenetic turnover between canopy trees and seedlings in forest understory is lower than that between canopy trees and seedlings in forest gaps. We conclude that tree species tend to be more closely related from seedling to canopy layers, and that forest gaps alter the seedling phylogenetic turnover of the studied forest. It is likely that the increasing trend of phylogenetic clustering as tree stem size increases observed in this subtropical forest is primarily driven by abiotic filtering processes, which select a set of closely related evergreen broad-leaved tree species whose regeneration has adapted to the closed canopy environments of the subtropical forest developed under the regional monsoon climate.

AB Habitat loss is the dominant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in terrestrial environments. In this study, we used an a priori classification of bird species based on their dependence on native forest habitats (forest-specialist and habitat generalists) and specific food resources (frugivores and insectivores) to evaluate their responses to forest cover reduction in landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. From the patch-landscapes approach, we delimited 40 forest sites, and quantified the percentage of native forest within a 2 km radius around the center of each site (from 6 - 85%). At each site, we sampled birds using the point-count method. We used a null model, a generalized linear model and a four-parameter logistic model to evaluate the relationship between richness and abundance of the bird groups and the native forest amount. A piecewise model was then used to determine the threshold value for bird groups that showed nonlinear responses. The richness and abundance of the bird community as a whole were not affected by changes in forest cover in this region. However, a decrease in forest cover had a negative effect on diversity of forest-specialist, frugivorous and insectivorous birds, and a positive effect on generalist birds. The species richness and abundance of all ecological groups were nonlinearly related to forest reduction and showed similar threshold values, i.e., there were abrupt changes in individuals and species numbers when forest amount was less than approximately 50%. Forest sites within landscapes with forest cover that was less than 50% contained a different bird species composition than more extensively forested sites and had fewer forest-specialist species and higher beta-diversity. Our study demonstrated the pervasive effect of forest reduction on bird communities in one of the most important hotspots for bird conservation and shows that many vulnerable species require extensive forest cover to persist.

AB Previous studies on self-thinning have almost exclusively dealt with even-aged monocultures and the aim of such studies was to present some limiting relationship between average plant size and density. Our knowledge regarding density patterns and maximum densities in uneven-aged natural forests, and the ecological mechanisms that produce such patterns, is still very limited. This study analyses the density patterns in two species-rich forests in North-Eastern China. Each of the two 28 hectare field plots with mapped trees was subdivided into (320 and 312) cells, each cell measuring 30 m x 30 m. The limiting relationships for the two study areas were estimated using exponential models and percentile regression. The allometric exponents between tree size and tree density are surprisingly similar for Jiaohe (-1.17) and Liangshui (-1.14), and considerably lower than those found in even-aged plantations. Another objective of the study was to study the relationship between cell density and forest structure. High density cells with a basal area mean value of 45 m(2)/ha were compared with low density cells with a basal area mean value of 18 m(2)/ha. High density cells had a significantly higher species richness and higher diameter coefficient of variation than cells with low density. The density patterns in the canopy and understory layers were also found to be different, understory trees showing higher mortality rates with increasing tree size than canopy trees. Finally, either habitat heterogeneity or dispersal limitations are insufficient to explain maximum density patterns on their own. Our results show, however, that their joint effect may determine the formation of maximum density patterns in the two forests. Further studies in species-rich natural forests ecosystems are needed to explain density patterns in different ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gap disturbance is assumed to maintain species diversity by creating environmental heterogeneity. However, little is known about how interactions with neighbours, such as competition and facilitation, alter the emerging gap patterns after extreme events. Using a spatially explicit community model we demonstrate that negative interactions, especially intraspecific competition, greatly promote both average gap size and gap-size diversity relative to positive interspecific interaction. This suggests that competition would promote diversity maintenance but also increase community invasibility, as large gaps with a wide size variety provide more diverse niches for both local and exotic species. Under interspecific competition, both gap metrics interestingly increased with species richness, while they were reduced under intraspecific competition. Having a wider range of species interaction strengths led to a smaller average gap size only under intraspecific competition. Increasing conspecific clumping induced larger gaps with more variable sizes under intraspecific competition, in contrast to interspecific competition. Given the range of intraspecific clumping in real communities, models or experiments based on randomly synthesized communities may yield biased estimates of the opportunities for potential colonizers to fill gaps. Overall, our "static" model on gap formation offers perspectives to better predict recolonization opportunity and thus community secondary succession under extreme event regimes.

AB In southern New England forests, small mammals provide essential contributions to ecosystem functioning via food-web interactions and seed dispersal. This region has been exposed to extensive habitat fragmentation due to residential and agricultural development, resulting in a considerable amount of edge habitat, in addition to naturally occurring landscape heterogeneity. Limited research has been conducted relating small-mammal species richness and abundance to different types of edge habitat in this region. Studies incorporating an analysis of variation in both fine-scale vegetation and coarse-scale landscape variation are even more limited. We compared small-mammal richness, total abundance, and abundance of Peromyscus maniculatus (Deer Mouse), Peromyscus leucopus (White-footed Mouse), Myodes gapperi (Red-backed Vole), Tamias striatus (Eastern Chipmunk), and Tamiasciurus hudsonicus (Eastern Red Squirrel) at developed-edge, wetland-edge, and forest-interior sites. We also measured vegetation and landscape variables to understand how variation in characteristics at different scales affected small-mammal measures. We selected 4 sites of each edge type and used Sherman live-traps during the summers of 2009-2010 to survey small-mammal populations (75 traps for 4 nights at 12 sites for 2 y = 7200 trap-nights). We did not find differences among edge types and interior forest for total abundance, richness, and abundance of the 5 small-mammal species with sufficient data for analysis. However, vegetation variables and landscape variables were significantly associated with small-mammal populations. Step-wise linear regression included vegetation variables for 4 of the 5 species, and various landscape scales were included in all analyses except abundance of Peromyscus adults. Patch size was included in 4 analyses (positive for total abundance, White-footed Mouse, and Red-backed Vole; negative for Eastern Chipmunk). We found conifer basal area to have a positive relationship with abundance of Peromyscus adults and Red-backed Voles, but a negative relationship with abundance of Peromyscus juveniles and Eastern Red Squirrels. Species abundance and richness of small-mammal communities and populations in northeastern Massachusetts were related to both fine-scale vegetation differences and coarse-scale landscape metrics, but these relationships were complex and scale-dependent.

AB Structural and determinate factors for the composition of assemblages of species are diverse. Two theories attempt to explain the pattern of species composition in assemblies using different approaches-i.e., Niche Theory and Neutral Theory. Anurans have complex responses to habitat structure. Species of Pristimantis are good indicators for conservation because they are organisms with direct development. The effect of habitat structure on species of Pristimantis in a bamboo -dominated remnant forest located in southwestern Amazonia is analyzed herein. Active visual and auditory searches in 10 plots of the Biodiversity Research Program (PPBio) were conducted between November 2012 and May 2013. Four hundred and sixty individuals of five species were recorded: Pristimantis altamazonicus, P. diadematus, P. fenestratus, P. reichlei, and P. skydmainus. Neither spatial distance nor the structure of the habitat of the plots affected the composition of Pristimantis. The first axis of PCA explained 45.6% variation of the characterization habitat structure, correlated significantly with the number of Pristimantis, species increasing with trees between 10 <= dbh < 30 cm and decreased with density of bamboo. The increase in litter depth and canopy cover influenced in the occurrence of P. reichlei, the occurrence of P. skydmainus decreased with increased density of bamboo and trees dbh 30 cm and the occurrence of P. diadematus decreased relative to increased canopy cover. Pristimantis diadematus and P. skydmainus were the most restricted species in terms of habitat and were especially susceptible to bamboo density.

AB The Island of New Guinea is renowned for its high biodiversity, which arises in part from its complex geology and topographical variability. The island is, however, relatively understudied. We surveyed forest plant communities in the poorly studied Naoro-Brown catchment of the West Koiari region of Papua New Guinea. We identified four forest types-riverine successional forest, lower montane forest, hill forest, and riverine mixed forest-along a 13-km transect, and examined forest structure (tree height, stand density, and biomass) and tree species diversity (species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and composition) in these forest types. We also assessed the effect of local topography on floristic patterns. Forest structure and species diversity varied greatly among the forest types, with topography strongly affecting species assemblages. These results suggest that highly varied landscapes may contain high beta diversity via intense segregation and establishment of varied vegetation communities. Beta diversity in New Guinea may be higher than expected as such highly varied landscapes are common, yet poorly studied. To effectively conserve biodiversity in New Guinea's forests, protection must include forested landscapes that best represent the topographical variability throughout the island to account for locally endemic species restricted to specific ecological niches.

AB Statutes, regulations, and forest restoration represent measures aimed at promoting the conservation of threatened species. We analyzed the abundance of red-listed tree species within three conservation zones with differing levels of protection in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve in north-western Vietnam, a rarely studied region within a biodiversity hotspot. The study area included: (1) the undisturbed core zone; (2) the low intensity traditional forest use buffer zone; and (3) the forest restoration zone. Red-listed tree species richness (IUCN and Vietnamese Red Lists combined) amounted to 16 in the core zone, 10 in the buffer zone, and five in the restoration zone; a similar declining trend was found for all tree species at 193, 173 and 135 for each respective zone. Differences between zones were even more pronounced when species richness was predicted using the Chao2 estimator. Most red-listed species, such as Fujian Cypress (Fokienia hodginsii), reached their highest densities in the core zone, but one species (Quercus platycalyx) was quite abundant in the restoration zone. For some red-listed tree species, canonical correspondence analysis suggested relationships among the presence of footpaths, canopy closure and basal area, suggesting reduced abundance caused by human activities. Our data indicate that conservation effectiveness is related to the level of statutory protection afforded to a particular area, with full protection ensuring more robust conservation outcomes.

AB The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex causes tuberculosis in humans and nonhuman primates and is a global public health concern. Standard diagnostics rely upon host immune responses to detect infection in nonhuman primates and lack sensitivity and specificity across the spectrum of mycobacterial infection in these species. We have previously shown that the Oral Swab PCR (OSP) assay, a direct pathogen detection method, can identify the presence of M. tuberculosis complex in laboratory and free-ranging Old World monkeys. Addressing the current limitations in tuberculosis diagnostics in primates, including sample acquisition and pathogen detection, this paper furthers our understanding of the presence of the tuberculosis-causing bacteria among New World monkeys in close contact with humans. Here we use the minimally invasive OSP assay, which includes buccal swab collection followed by amplification of the IS6110 repetitive nucleic acid sequence specific to M. tuberculosis complex subspecies, to detect the bacteria in the mouths of Peruvian New World monkeys. A total of 220 buccal swabs from 16 species were obtained and positive amplification of the IS6110 sequence was observed in 30 (13.6%) of the samples. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of M. tuberculosis complex DNA in a diverse sample of Peruvian Neotropical primates.

ID TROPICAL DEFORESTATION; CHALLENGES
AB The dynamics in livelihood needs of people at the fringes of tropical forests have increased the stakes and management challenges of biodiversity worldwide. Since the adoption of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the importance of biodiversity has been emphasized in several international agreements. However, the incentives to implement such agreements in poor countries are lacking. The present study characterised the determinants of deforestation, and forest management practices within Mabira Forest Reserve (MFR) in central Uganda. This was done within the context of the evolution of the policy and legal frameworks of Uganda. Literature on MFR as well as the policy and legal framework on forests and related resources was reviewed. The results show that evolution of the forest policy was characterised by limited input from key stakeholders. Moreover, there has been political interference and limited sharing of benefits amid failure to harmonize the forestry policy with relevant policies of related sectors. Consequently, deforestation has continued. To address this anomaly, we encourage the involvement of all key stakeholders including local people in designing management guidelines and sharing benefits from forests as an incentive for participation to promote sustainable forest growth. This is crucial for the success of forest restoration programmes in the tropics.

AB Here we expand our previous study to provide more detailed information on the relationship between the male eastern sucker-footed bat Myzopoda aurita and the traveler's tree Ravenala madagascariensis in south-eastern Madagascar, during six month-long field work sessions carried out over two years. We caught 593 bats, 229 newly caught and 364 recaptures, exclusively males, roosting in 37 day roosts in the partially unfurled central leaves of R. madagascariensis. No bats were found in any other roosting situation. To analyse potential roost availability, we monitored partially unfurled central leaves on R. madagascarienis on four transects and 12% appeared suitable as M. aurita roosts. These leaves took three to 25 days to unfurl, and roosts became available between one and 19 days after unfurling commenced. Day roosts were occupied for one to 12 days. Bats were more likely to occupy roosts in taller trees. The size of roosting groups varied between one and 36 individuals. Movements of bats between roosts were recorded on 35 occasions and between two and nine individuals of M. aurita found in one roost were subsequently found together in a different roost. Myzopoda aurita occurs in degraded forests and anthropogenic habitats of eastern Madagascar where it may be affected by loss of roosts since R. madagascariensis is used extensively for building and thatching houses.

AB We describe the ant fauna of Iguazu National Park (INP), a region of high biodiversity and endemism in northeastern Argentina that includes the southernmost protected area of the Atlantic Forest (AF). Ants were sampled over seven periods from 1998 to 2011 using a variety of techniques. We also surveyed museum collections and the scientific literature to obtain additional records of ants from INP. In addition to providing a species list, we compare ant composition of INP to other sites in the Upper Parana, Serra do Mar Coastal Forest and Araucaria ecoregion of AF. A total of 172 ant species belonging to 56 genera are reported; 56 species are new records for Misiones Province and 39 species are reported from Argentina for the first time. Alto Parana and Canindeyu departments in Paraguay present the most similar ant fauna to INP. Serra da Bodoquena in Brazil and Pilcomayo in Argentina showed higher similarity with the Upper Parana AF ecoregion, despite that Serra da Bodoquena is composed of a mix of ecoregions. Ant diversity was lower in Upper Parana than in Serra do Mar Coastal Forest ecoregion. This difference may result from higher primary productivity and a greater altitudinal variation in the coastal region.

AB Biotic and abiotic factors affect the species richness and abundance of ants inhabiting arid and semiarid zones. We evaluated how soil surface temperature, texture, percentage of surface coarse fragments, and vegetation affected the composition, diversity, and distribution of ants inhabiting a mosaic of environmental conditions in a semiarid zone in central Mexico. We captured 22 ant species at five sites studied, with the top of Cutac hill (1,750 m altitude) and Terrace 2 (1,376 m altitude) the richest sites with 10 species each. Based on redundancy analyses, the percentage of clay followed by the percentage of coarse fragments at the surface of the soil were the variables most related to the composition of ants in these communities. Percentage of clay ranged from 16 to 26 and was positively related to abundance of Pheidole sp. 1 and negatively related to abundance of Dorymyrmex bureni Trager (R-2 = 0.76, P = 0.04; R-2 = 0.86, P = 0.02, respectively), whereas percentage of soil surface coarse fragments ranged from 0.8 to 59 and were negatively correlated to Pheidole sp. 1 (R-2 = 0.76, P = 0.05), but positively correlated to abundance of Brachymyrmex sp. (R-2 = 0.86, P = 0.06). When ants were analyzed by functional group, vegetative structure (ranging from 109 to 246 hits with vegetation) and percentage of coarse fragments in the soil were most correlated with their distribution. Although results of the redundancy analyses were not statistically significant, preliminary analysis of variables might explain the composition and distribution of an ant community. We suggested that soil characteristics might be important for explaining ant distribution and community composition.

AB This study investigated the influence of forest edges on the leaf galls induced by Mikiola fagi (Hartig) on oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky). Two main objectives of this study were a) to compare the effects of forest edges on the number of leaf galls, and b) to compare the forest edges and forest interiors concerning the length and weight of the galls. Investigations on this subject were conducted in 2013-2014 in the Forest Enterprise Chief of Tezcan in Kastamonu located in Western Blacksea region of Turkey. The results showed that 1) the number of leaf galls was greater along the forest edges than in the forest interiors, 2) the length and the weight of the galls did not differ significantly between forest edges and forest interiors.

AB Payments for watershed services (PWS) as a policy tool for enhancing water quality and supply have gained momentum in recent years, but their ability to lead to sustainable watershed outcomes is uncertain. Consequently, the demand for effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of PWS impacts on coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) and their implications for watershed sustainability (WS) is increasing. The theoretical foundations and practical applications of WS frameworks, which integrate biophysical and socioeconomic indicators to assess progress toward WS goals, have been extensively explored but rarely applied to PWS. We develop the PWS-WS framework as an approach for guiding indicator selection to improve knowledge about the complex drivers, interactions, and feedback between PWS and CHANS. A review of the PWS and WS literatures provides a basis for comparing and contrasting indicators. Using two case studies, we illustrate how applying the PWS-WS framework using a place-based, contextualized approach enhances potential for sustainable watershed outcomes.

AB The south-eastern Amazon rainforest is subject to ongoing deforestation and is expected to become drier due to climate change. Recent analyses of the distribution of tree cover in the tropics show three modes that have been interpreted as representing alternative stable states: forest, savanna and treeless states. This situation implies that a change in environmental conditions, such as in the climate, could cause critical transitions from a forest towards a savanna ecosystem. Shifts to savanna might also occur if perturbations such as deforestation exceed a critical threshold. Recovering the forest would be difficult as the savanna will be stabilized by a feedback between tree cover and fire. Here we explore how environmental changes and perturbations affect the forest by using a simple model with alternative tree-cover states. We focus on the synergistic effects of precipitation reduction and deforestation on the probability of regime shifts in the south-eastern Amazon rainforest. The analysis indicated that in a large part of the south-eastern Amazon basin rainforest and savanna could be two alternative states, although massive forest dieback caused by mean-precipitation reduction alone is unlikely. However, combinations of deforestation and climate change triggered up to 6.6 times as many local regime shifts than the two did separately, causing large permanent forest losses in the studied region. The results emphasize the importance of reducing deforestation rates in order to prevent a climate-induced dieback of the south-eastern Amazon rainforest. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relative importance of niche-based (e.g., competitive or stress-based) and stochastic (e.g., random dispersal) processes in structuring ecological communities is frequently analyzed by studying trait distributions of co-occurring species. While filtering processes, such as the exclusion of stress-intolerant species from particular habitats, increase the trait similarity between co-occurring species, other processes, such as resource competition, can limit the similarity of co-occurring species. Comparing the observed trait distribution patterns in communities to null expectations from randomized communities (e.g., a draw of the same observed richness from the regional pool) therefore gives a first indication of the dominant process driving community assembly.
   However, such comparisons do not inform us about the relative contribution of these different processes in shaping community compositions in case of their joint operation (a likely scenario). Using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach, we develop a new method that allows inference of the relative importance of dispersal, filtering, and limiting similarity processes for the assembly of observed communities with known species and trait composition. We applied this approach to a tree community data set, collected across 20 plots along strong rainfall and fire gradients in a South African savanna.
   Based on comparisons with simulations, we find that our new approach is powerful in identifying which community assembly scenario has the highest probability to generate the observed trait distribution patterns, while traditional null model comparisons perform poorly in detecting signs of limiting similarity. For the studied savanna tree communities, our analysis yields that dispersal processes are most important in shaping the functional trait distribution patterns. Furthermore, our models indicate that filtering processes were relatively most important in areas with high fire frequencies, while limiting similarity processes were relatively most important in areas with low fire frequency and high rainfall. We conclude that our new method is a promising improvement on current approaches to estimate the relative importance of community assembly processes across different species groups, ecosystems, and biomes. Future model modifications (e.g., the inclusion of individual-based processes) could provide further steps in uncovering the underlying assembly processes behind observed community patterns.

AB The use of well-sampled regions and insightful environmental gradients can provide important theoretical knowledge for understanding the drivers of tropical forest patterns and processes, which are necessary for biological conservation. We investigated the variation in tree species composition across a vegetation gradient in the Subtropical Atlantic Forest, as well as various predictors that could impact such patterns. The exploratory and confirmatory analyses included 178 sampling units distributed among 13 different forest types containing binary occurrence records for 935 species from 25,546 trees. Confirmatory analyses were conducted considering spatial autocorrelation, a well-known factor responsible for type I error inflations. The floristic heterogeneity of the study area was revealed by clear patterns of floristic differentiation between vegetation types, as well as by the significant improvements in local models (GWR-geographically weighted regressions) over global models (OLS-ordinary least squares). We found that the observed floristic variation has most likely been driven by humidity from the Atlantic Ocean, low temperature extremes and geographic distance. The latter was revealed by the high contribution of spatial components to the partial models. These results from a shrinking biological hotspot, particularly those concerning the importance of temperature extremes, represent crucial data for identifying conservation priorities, especially considering the seriousness of the temperature shifts predicted by global climate change scenarios.

AB We describe observed long-term adaptive responses to light conditions in the morphology of saplings of Thujopsis dolabrata var. hondai Makino, a shade-tolerant conifer species. Under stably bright conditions, the crown shape was slender and conical. In contrast, in stably dark conditions, the crowns had a highly distinctive broad, shallow, bowl-like shape, due to the formation of characteristic orthotropic lateral branches with higher apices than the stem. Leaf display by these branches may reduce self-shading and stem elongation requirements for leaf arrangement in dark conditions, thereby minimizing increases in maintenance costs associated with increasing tree size. Epicormic terminal leaders were frequently present on long branches in the lower part of the crowns. These branches did not show vigorous growth or contribute to crown expansion. However, the low-hanging branches in the lowest quarter of the crown may frequently touch the ground, particularly under snow pressure, and produce adventitious roots under these leaders, thereby increasing numbers of ramets. The snow pressure may also cause stem layering and restrain saplings from increasing their height to more than 1m. These morphological and reproductive traits of lateral branches may contribute to shade tolerance and improve survival of the saplings.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that density dependence, whether at early or late life stages, is an important mechanism regulating plant population structure. However, the opposing effects of habitat heterogeneity and species-level variation might have confounded the prevalence of density dependence in natural forests. These compatible ideas were rarely considered simultaneously. In this study, we applied a spatial statistical technique to examine (i) the prevalence of density dependence at late life stages after controlling for habitat heterogeneity and (ii) the relationships between species traits and the strength of density dependence in a newly established, 25 ha subtropical mountain forest plot in central China. Of the 88 (75%) tree species analyzed, 66 were found to exhibit density dependence predominantly at very close distances among neighbors in the species-rich subtropical forest. In addition, the strength of density dependence was associated with species traits. Our findings identified strong density dependence among trees that had greater stature and were rarer. We concluded that density dependence was a prevalent mechanism for regulating the population structure of most tree species and both habitat heterogeneity and species-level variation played crucial roles in shaping the strength of density dependence in natural forests.

AB Diversity-manipulation experiments suggest a positive effect of biodiversity on ecosystem properties (EPs), but variable relationships between species richness and EPs have been reported in natural communities. An explanation for this discrepancy is that observed richness-EPs relationships in natural communities change with environment and species functional identities. But how the relationships change along broad-scale climatic gradients has rarely been examined. In this paper, we sampled 848 plots of 20 x 30 m(2) from boreal to tropical forests across China. We examined plot biomass with respect to environmental factors, tree species richness and functional group identity (FGI, i.e. evergreen vs deciduous, and coniferous vs broadleaf). Variation partitioning was used to evaluate the relative effects of the three classes of factors. We found that, most of the effects' (percentage of variation explained) of richness and FGI on forest biomass were shared with environmental factors, but species richness and FGI still revealed significant effects in addition to environment for plots across China. Richness and FGI explained biomass mainly through their shared effects instead of independent effects, suggesting that the positive biodiversity effect is closely associated with a sampling effect. The relative effects of richness, FGI and environment varied latitudinally: the independent effects of environment and richness decreased from boreal to subtropical forests, whereas the total effect of FGI increased. We also found that the slope of richness-biomass relationship decreased monotonically from boreal to subtropical forests, possibly because of decreasing complementarity and increasing competition with increasing productivity. Our results suggest that while species richness does have significant effects on forest biomass it is less important than environmental gradients and other biotic factors in shaping large-scale biomass patterns. We suggest that understanding how and why the diversity-EPs relationships change along climatic gradient would be helpful for a better understanding of real biodiversity effects in natural communities.

AB Sympatric cryptic lineages are a challenge for the understanding of species coexistence and lineage diversification as well as for management, conservation, and utilization of plant genetic resources. In higher plants studies providing insights into the mechanisms creating and maintaining sympatric cryptic lineages are rare. Here, using microsatellites and chloroplast sequence data, morphometric analyses, and phenological observations, we ask whether sympatrically coexisting lineages in the common wetland plant Juncus effusus are ecologically differentiated and reproductively isolated. Our results show two genetically highly differentiated, homoploid lineages within J.effusus that are morphologically cryptic and have similar preference for soil moisture content. However, flowering time differed significantly between the lineages contributing to reproductive isolation and the maintenance of these lineages. Furthermore, the later flowering lineage suffered less from predispersal seed predation by a Coleophora moth species. Still, we detected viable and reproducing hybrids between both lineages and the earlier flowering lineage and J.conglomeratus, a coexisting close relative. Flowering time differentiation between the lineages can be explained by neutral divergence alone and together with a lack of postzygotic isolation mechanisms; the sympatric coexistence of these lineages is most likely the result of an allopatric origin with secondary contact.

AB Located in central Uganda, the grasslands of Nakasongola face devastation of herbaceous vegetation by subterranean termites. Reduction in the preferred food of termites (plant litter), and loss of their natural predators and parasites are known to be major factors contributing to the damage imposed by termites on grassland vegetation. This review analyzes the situation with respect to termites in the area to draw the attention of ecologists, conservationists, policy makers and farmers, to the current and future threats of subterranean termites to the functioning and sustainability of this ecosystem. The suppressive effect of anthropogenic activities on termites' food resources, populations of natural enemies and the resultant escalation in termite populations is discussed. I hypothesize that tree cutting, overgrazing and overhunting are reducing the food resources and predator populations and, consequently, are enhancing the current destructive behavior of termites in the rangelands of Uganda. It is suggested that intervention for sustainable management of termites in the area should consider restoring their natural food sources and predators to reestablish the ecological equilibrium between termites and other components of the ecosystem.

AB Deforestation is the most critical issue of climate change in Indonesia, as well as in other tropical countries, meanwhile major forests is managed under concession or permit system. This paper investigates the effect of forest permits on deforestation in Indonesia. Two major forest permits are taken into analysis, resulting that logging permit is insignificantly correlated to forest cover loss, whereas plantation conversion permit diminishes more forest cover in Indonesia. These results pose a question on the effectiveness of the current forest moratorium policy as well as the forest tariff policy to the attempts in mitigating deforestation. At the end, this paper summarises possible alternative forest policies derived from the empirical findings, from both short and long term perspectives.

AB By creating novel habitats, habitat-modifying species can alter patterns of diversity and abundance in marine communities. Many sea urchins are important habitat modifiers in tropical and temperate systems. By eroding rocky substrata, urchins can create a mosaic of urchin-sized cavities or pits separated by exposed, often flat surfaces. These microhabitats appear to harbor distinct assemblages of species. We investigated how a temperate rocky intertidal community uses three small-scale (<100cm(2)) microhabitats created by or adjacent to populations of the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus): pits occupied by urchins, unoccupied pits, and adjacent flat spaces. In tidepools, flat spaces harbored the highest percent cover of algae and sessile fauna, followed by empty pits and then occupied pits. The Shannon diversity and richness of these sessile taxa were significantly higher in flat spaces and empty pits than in occupied pits. The composition of these primary space holders in the microhabitats also varied. Unlike primary space holders, mobile fauna exhibited higher diversity and richness in empty pits than in flat spaces and occupied pits, although results were not significant. The protective empty pit microhabitat harbored the highest densities of most trophic functional groups. Herbivores, however, were densest in flat spaces, concordant with high algal coverage. These results suggest the habitats created by S.purpuratus in addition to its biological activities alter community structure at spatial scales finer than those typically considered for sea urchins.

AB The biological traits of different species usually predispose them to dissimilar levels of extinction risk. Accordingly, we analysed genetic variation and population genetic structure of two endangered forest monkeys to determine how they were influenced by habitat change. The Tana River red colobus and mangabey are of similar body size, are sympatric and endemic to forests in Kenya. The mangabey is frugivorous, terrestrial and exhibits female philopatry but the colobus is folivorous, arboreal and both sexes exhibit natal dispersal. We predicted that both species would have low genetic variation due to high genetic drift, and possible inbreeding, because their populations are relatively small and subdivided in forest fragments. Nevertheless, we expected the mangabeys to have a higher genetic variation because they have a larger population, and their higher vagility would enhance gene flow. Thus, we expected a stronger population genetic structure in the colobus because lower vagility would constrain dispersal and increase genetic differentiation. Finally, we expected both species to exhibit isolation by distance due to greater gene flow among populations in close geographic proximity. We genotyped 146 colobus and 76 mangabeys with nine microsatellite markers and found that both species had relatively high heterozygosities but low allelic richness. Furthermore, allelic richness, heterozygosity and genetic differentiation were all higher in the mangabey and only the mangabey exhibited isolation by distance. Taken together, our results suggest that species with divergent behavioral ecologies may exhibit differential vulnerabilities to genetic erosion due to habitat change.

TI Leaf-litter breakdown in tropical streams: is variability the norm?

AB Many forested headwater streams are heterotrophic ecosystems in which allochthonous inputs of plant litter are a major source of energy. Leaves of riparian vegetation entering the stream are broken down by a combination of biotic and abiotic processes and, in most temperate and boreal streams, provide food and habitat for dense populations of detritivorous invertebrates. However, tropical streams in different parts of the world show substantial variability in the number and diversity of leaf-shredding detritivores (hereafter detritivores). We used data obtained with standardized methods from multiple streams in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australia to test the hypothesis that this variability would lead to differences in the relative role of detritivores and microorganisms in the breakdown process. We also tested the hypotheses that variability in litter breakdown rates changes with litter type (native litter mixtures vs nonnative alder [Alnus glutinosa]) and is higher across regions within than outside the tropics. We found that litter breakdown rates were highly variable across sites, with no consistent pattern within geographic areas, although litter consumption by detritivores was negligible at several sites, all in America. Geographic patterns of litter breakdown also varied between litter types, with higher breakdown rates for alder than for native litter in most but not all regions. When litter breakdown rates at the tropical sites were compared to previously reported values from temperate and boreal regions, we found that differences in variability between tropical and temperate sites were inconsistent, with great differences among studies. Further global-scale studies will be needed to assess the extent to which latitudinal changes in the diversity and composition of microbial and detritivore assemblages contribute to variability in litter breakdown rates.

AB Understanding how indigenous peoples' management practices relate to biological diversity requires addressing contemporary changes in indigenous peoples' way of life. This study explores the association between cultural change among a Bolivian Amazonian indigenous group, the Tsimane', and tree diversity in forests surrounding their villages. We interviewed 86 informants in six villages about their level of attachment to traditional Tsimane' values, our proxy for cultural change. We estimated tree diversity (Fisher's Alpha index) by inventorying trees in 48 0.1-ha plots in old-growth forests distributed in the territory of the same villages. We used multivariate models to assess the relation between cultural change and alpha tree diversity. Cultural change was associated with alpha tree diversity and the relation showed an inverted U-shape, thus suggesting that tree alpha diversity peaked in villages undergoing intermediate cultural change. Although the results do not allow for testing the direction of the relation, we propose that cultural change relates to tree diversity through the changes in practices and behaviors that affect the traditional ecological knowledge of Tsimane' communities; further research is needed to determine the causality. Our results also find support in the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and suggest that indigenous management can be seen as an intermediate form of anthropogenic disturbance affecting forest communities in a subtle, non-destructive way.

AB We undertake a review of academic literature that examines the effectiveness and equity-related performance of PES initiatives targeting biodiversity conservation in tropical and sub-tropical countries. We investigate the key features of such analyses as regards their analytical and methodological approach and we identify emerging lessons from PES practice, leading to a new suggested research agenda. Our results indicate that analyses of PES effectiveness have to date focused on either ecosystem service provision or habitat proxies, with only half of them making explicit assessment of additionality and most describing that payments have been beneficial for land cover and biodiversity. Studies evaluating the impact of PES on livelihoods suggest more negative outcomes, with an uneven treatment of the procedural and distributive considerations of scheme design and payment distribution, and a large heterogeneity of evaluative frameworks. We propose an agenda for future PES research based on the emerging interest in assessing environmental outcomes more rigorously and documenting social impacts in a more comparative and contextually situated form.

AB The role of livestock grazing in regulating woody cover and biomass in grass-dominant systems is well recognized. However, the way in which woody plant populations in respond when livestock are removed from grazing in the absence of other disturbances, such as fire, remains unclear. We conducted a 10-year, replicated fencing experiment in a sandy semiarid rangeland in northern China (which has a mean annual rainfall of 365mm), where fires have been actively suppressed for decades. Fencing dramatically influenced the growth and age structure of the native tree species, Ulmus pumila, which is the sole dominant tree in the area. After a decade, the density of the U.pumila tree population in the fencing plots increased doubly and canopy cover increased triply. The proportion of both saplings (U-2) and young trees (U-3) increased in fencing plots but decreased in grazing plots after the 10-year treatment period. The effects of fencing on U.pumila trees varied by age class, with potential implications for the future structure of the U.pumila tree community. Decadal fencing led to approximately 80-fold increase in recruitment and a nearly 2.5-fold decrease in the mortality of both U-2 and U-3. Further, livestock grazing generated a browsing trap to the recruitment of both U-2 and U-3, and had a small impact on the mortality of old trees. A long-term, fencing-driven shift in woody species composition was mediated via its effects on both recruitment and mortality rates.Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that in the long-term absence of both fire and livestock, native woody plant encroachment tends to occur in sandy rangelands, transforming the woody plant demography in the process. The feasibility of full livestock exclusion in sandy rangelands requires further discussion. A balanced amount of livestock grazing may provide critical ecosystem services by regulating woody cover and mediating woody plant encroachment.

ID COVER; IMPACTS
AB The Jeseniky Mountains tourism in Czech Republic is unique for its floristic richness. This is caused mainly by the altitude division and polymorphism of the landscape, climate and soil structure. This study assesses the impacts of tourism on the land cover in the Jeseniky Mountain region by comparing multi-temporal Landsat imageries (1991, 2001 and 2013) to describe the rate and extent of land-cover changes. This was achieved through spectral classification of different land cover classes and by assessing the change in forest; settlements; pasture and agriculture in relation to increasing distances (5, 10 and 15 km) from three tourism sites with the help of ArcGIS software. The results indicate that the area was deforested (11.13%) from 1991 to 2001 than experienced forest regrowth (6.71%) from 2001 to 2013. In the first decade pasture and agriculture areas increased and then in next decade decreased. The influence of tourism facilities on land cover is also variable. Around each of the tourism site sampled, there was a general trend of forest removal decreasing as the distance from each village increased, which indicates tourism does have a negative impact on forests. However there was an opposite trend from 2001 to 2013 that indicates conservation area. The interplay among global (tourism, climate), regional (national policies, large-river management) and local (construction and agriculture, energy and water sources to support the tourism industry) factors drives a distinctive but complex pattern of land-use and land-cover disturbance.

AB Although several studies have reported rates of deforestation and spatial patterns of native forest fragmentation, few have focused on the role of natural forest regeneration and exotic tree plantations on landscape dynamics. The objective of this study was to analyze the dynamics of land cover change in order to test the hypothesis that exotic tree plantations have caused a major transformation of temperate forest cover in southern Chile during the last three decades. We used three Landsat satellite images taken in 1985 (TM), 1999 (ETM+), and 2011 (TM) to quantify land cover change, together with a set of landscape indicators to describe the spatial configuration of land cover. Our results showed that the major changes were dynamic conversion among forest, exotic tree plantation and shrubland. During the study period, the area covered by exotic tree plantations increased by 168% (20,896-56,010 ha), at an annual rate of 3.8%, mostly at the expense of native forest and shrubland. There was a total gross loss of native forest of 30% (54,304 ha), but a net loss of initial cover of only 5.1% (9130 ha), at an annual net deforestation rate of 0.2%. The difference between gross and net loss of native forest was mostly the result of conversion of shrubland and agricultural and pasture land to secondary forest following natural regeneration. Over the course of the study period, exotic tree plantations showed a constant increase in patch density, total edge length, nearest-neighbor distance, and largest patch index; maximum mean patch size occurred in the middle of the study period. Native forest exhibited an increase and then a decrease in patch density and total edge length, whereas mean patch size and largest patch index were lowest in the middle of the period. Overall, the observed trends indicate expansion of exotic tree plantations and increase in native forest loss and fragmentation, particularly between 1985 and 1999. Forest loss included both old-growth and secondary forests, while native forest established after secondary succession differed in diversity, structure, and functionality from old-growth and old growth/secondary forests. Since different successional stages influence the provision of ecosystem services, the changes observed in our study are likely to have consequences for humans that extend beyond immediate changes in land use patterns.

AB The prehistoric archaeology of Sri Lanka is of considerable significance for investigations of the evolution, dispersal and adaptation of our species within a variety of environments beyond Africa during the Late Pleistocene. In particular, the archaeological and fossil sequences of Sri Lanka's 'Microlithic tradition', c. 38,000-3,000 cal. years BP, have yielded some of the earliest Homo sapiens fossils, microlithic technologies, osseous toolkits, and evidence for symbolic ornamentation and long-distance contacts anywhere in South Asia. The further association of the Late Pleistocene portion of these records with the tropical rainforest of Sri Lanka's Wet Zone also makes Sri Lanka of particular interest for debates regarding the viability of tropical rainforest for early human foraging and specialization. Yet beyond mentions of its fossil evidence, the archaeology and palaeoenvironmental contexts of the 'Microlithic tradition' have remained little-explored in the international literature. Here we present the first critical review of this period of Sri Lankan prehistory, examining its local chronologies, the spatial and diachronic patterns of its material cultural sequence, and relating its technological and fossil record to broader international archaeological, anthropological and genetic debates.

AB Plants adapt phenotypically to different conditions of light and nutrient supply, supposedly in order to achieve colimitation of these resources. Their key variable of adjustment is the ratio of leaf area to root length, which relies on plant biomass allocation and organ morphology. We recorded phenotypic differences in leaf and root mass fractions (LMF, RMF), specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) of 12 herbaceous species grown in factorial combinations of high/low irradiance and fertilization treatments. Leaf area and root length ratios, and their components, were influenced by nonadditive effects between light and nutrient supply, and differences in the strength of plant responses were partly explained by Ellenberg's species values representing ecological optima. Changes in allocation were critical in plant responses to nutrient availability, as the RMF contribution to changes in root length was 2.5x that of the SRL. Contrastingly, morphological adjustments (SLA rather than LMF) made up the bulk of plant response to light availability. Our results suggest largely predictable differences in responses of species and groups of species to environmental change. Nevertheless, they stress the critical need to account for adjustments in below-ground mass allocation to understand the assembly and responses of communities in changing environments.

AB Impacts of habitat edges on wildlife populations have received considerable attention, yet few researchers have quantified changes in animal community structure on both sides of an interface between distinct habitats. To gain a better understanding of the ways in which species-specific responses scale up to produce community patterns across habitat boundaries, we examined the response of avian communities to forest-suburb edges in northeastern Illinois, USA. We surveyed bird assemblages using replicated point-transects (n = 21) that crossed boundaries between remnant forest patches and suburban residential areas in order to compare differences in community composition, species distributions, and densities. Forest and suburban bird communities were distinct, and community composition changed with distance-from-edge in forests but not suburbs. Abundances of many species that were common in the forest increased with distance-from-edge in the forest, whereas numbers of common species in the suburbs were largely unaffected by distance-from-edge. Using a new metric that we termed "tolerance," we found many forest species avoided the edge and suburbs, and suburban species were present near the edge but did not venture far into forest. Overall, distance to the forest-suburb boundary was more influential in structuring avian communities in the forest. Some species of conservation concern crossed edges into the suburbs, suggesting that management activities may improve suburban biodiversity. Many other imperiled forest species, however, will only be retained in urban environments through the protection of forest interior habitat.

AB Understanding the habitat requirements of great apes is essential for effective conservation strategies. We examined annual habitat use of a bonobo group in the Wamba field site within the Luo Scientific Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Using satellite imagery, we categorized the group's ranging area into three forest types: (1) primary and old secondary forest (P/OS), (2) young secondary forest and agriculture (YS/Ag), and (3) swamp forest (Sw). We tracked the group for 1 year (2007-2008) and compared usage of the three forest types for ranging, feeding, and night-sleeping. We also recorded what the bonobos ate and monitored monthly fruit availability in each forest type. The group ranged and fed more often in P/OS and less often in YS/Ag and Sw than expected based on habitat availability. Also, the group slept mostly in P/OS (94% of nights monitored), but also in YS/Ag (1%), and Sw (5%). Fruit availability in P/OS had no significant effect on habitat selection, but the group fed in YS/Ag most often during the two months when fruits in P/OS were least abundant. In June, when fruit of Uapaca spp. (selectively eaten by bonobos) was generally abundant in Sw, the group mostly ranged and slept there. The bonobos fed most often on herbaceous plants in all three forest types. In Sw, the bonobos frequently ate mushrooms. Our results show that semi-open forest with abundant herbaceous plants such as YS/Ag could be an important feeding habitat and may provide fallback food for bonobos when fruits are scarce. Furthermore, Sw can serve seasonally as a main habitat to complement P/OS if adequate food resources and tree nesting opportunities are available. We conclude that bonobos use diverse habitats depending on their needs and we highlight the importance of minor-use habitats for sustaining populations of target species in conservation planning. Am.

AB One popular concept used to explain the high biodiversity of some ecosystems is the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, which states that the distribution of conspecifics is controlled by species-specific pathogens or predators that are attracted to adults or to their reproductive output. The distribution of the affected species would then display a distinct pattern, with survivorship increasing at greater distance from the conspecific adult (negative density dependence), leaving a vacant area around the adult where other species can survive. The giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta, is an abundant and long-lived sponge on Caribbean coral reefs that is actively grazed by sponge-eating fishes and is susceptible to disease. We tested the Janzen-Connell hypothesis on barrel sponges on Conch Reef, Florida, by examining their distribution as a function of size using spatial point pattern analyses. Clark and Evans tests and a series of Ripley's K function analyses revealed no consistent distribution pattern, with most analyses resulting in a random pattern of sponge distribution. While predation by sponge-eating fishes has recently been discovered to structure sponge communities on reefs across the Caribbean, these top-down effects do not translate to spatial distributions of X. muta that support Janzen-Connell predictions.

AB During the past century, humans converted extensive areas of tropical forest into cultivated lands. Three distinct processes, each predominant during a different historical period, have driven the destruction of the forests. This review describes each of these deforestation dynamics: natural resource degrading poverty traps that predominated during the colonial era, new land settlement schemes that prevailed for two decades after decolonization, and finally, financialized, large enterprise dynamics that have predominated during the past quarter century. Each dynamic has, over time, given rise to different opportunities for conservation. Peasants emigrated from the sites of the poverty traps, and regrowth began to cover these degraded landscapes. Smallholders in the new land settlement areas became better acquainted with tropical tree species and allowed some trees to recolonize their fields, creating silvopastoral and agroforested landscapes. The heads of large enterprises relied on credit to clear land, so government regulators found that they could curb corporate-led deforestation by restricting access to credit when landowners failed to comply with laws against forest clearing. These links between deforestation's dynamics during past eras and conservation policies during the present era illustrate how a historical understanding of tropical deforestation can provide the basis for effective conservation policies.

   IMPACTS
AB Montane regions worldwide have experienced relatively low plant invasion rates, a trend attributed to increased climatic severity, low rates of disturbance, and reduced propagule pressure relative to lowlands. Manipulative experiments at elevations above the invasive range of non-native species can clarify the relative contributions of these mechanisms to montane invasion resistance, yet such experiments are rare. Furthermore, global climate change and land use changes are expected to cause decreases in snowpack and increases in disturbance by fire and forest thinning in montane forests. We examined the importance of these factors in limiting montane invasions using a field transplant experiment above the invasive range of two non-native lowland shrubs, Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and Spanish broom (Spartium junceum), in the rain-snow transition zone of the Sierra Nevada of California. We tested the effects of canopy closure, prescribed fire, and winter snow depth on demographic transitions of each species. Establishment of both species was most likely at intermediate levels of canopy disturbance, but at this intermediate canopy level, snow depth had negative effects on winter survival of seedlings. We used matrix population models to show that an 86% reduction in winter snowfall would cause a 2.8-fold increase in population growth rates in Scotch broom and a 3.5-fold increase in Spanish broom. Fall prescribed fire increased germination rates, but decreased overall population growth rates by reducing plant survival. However, at longer fire return intervals, population recovery between fires is likely to keep growth rates high, especially under low snowpack conditions. Many treatment combinations had positive growth rates despite being above the current invasive range, indicating that propagule pressure, disturbance, and climate can all strongly affect plant invasions in montane regions. We conclude that projected reductions in winter snowpack and increases in forest disturbance are likely to increase the risk of invasion from lower elevations.

AB Terrestrial invertebrates constitute most of described animal biodiversity and soil is a major reservoir of this diversity. In the classical attempt to undetstand the processes supporting biodiversity, ecologists are currently seeking to unravel the differential roles of environmental filtering and competition for resources in niche partitioning processes: these processes are in principle distinct although they may act simultaneously, interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and are often confounded in studies of soil communities. We used a novel combination of methods based on stable isotopes and trait analysis to resolve these processes in diverse oribatid mite assemblages at spatial scales at which competition for resources could in principle be a major driver. We also used a null model approach based on a general neutral model of beta diversity. A large and significant fraction of community variation was explainable in terms of linear and periodic spatial structures in the distribution of organic C, N and soil structure: species were clearly arranged along an environmental, spatially structured gradient. However, competition related trait differences did not map onto the distances separating species along the environmental gradient and neutral models provided a satisfying approximation of beta diversity patterns. The results represent the first robust evidence that in very diverse soil arthropod assemblages resource-based niche partitioning plays a minor role while environmental filtering remains a fundamental driver of species distribution.

AB Several forest plants known to supply medicine are under pressure worldwide. We carried out a study of four tree species (Warburgia ugandensis Sprague, Fleroya rubrostipulata (K.Schum.) Y.F.Deng, Syzygium guineense DC. and Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl.) that are highly demanded for malaria treatment. The study was undertaken between 2006 and 2009 in the Sango Bay Forest Reserve, southern Uganda. The aim was to determine the conservation status of trees targeted for malaria treatment. We assessed the level of damage inflicted on trees during harvesting of medicinal parts and determined the population density of target species in the forest. We used 95 plots established along nineteen transects. Survival of the most preferred species, F. rubrostipulata, is of particular concern as its population suffered from a combination of extensive damage due to poor methods of harvesting and poor regeneration. The density of trees with diameter 5cm differed between species and sites, demonstrating different recruitment and survival strategies. Management of Protected Areas should augment strategies to monitor the legal and illegal harvest of medicinal plants, by adopting low impact harvesting methods, and designating the temporal and spatial patterns of harvesting. This might reduce tree damage and mortality.

AB Recent phylogenetic studies in Sapotaceae have demonstrated that many genera need to be redefined to better correspond to natural groups. The Neotropical genus Pradosia is believed to be monophyletic and includes 26 recognized species. Here we reconstruct the generic phylogeny by a species-tree approach using *BEAST, 21 recognized species (36 accessions), sequence data from three nuclear markers (ITS, ETS, and RPB2), a relaxed lognormal clock model, and a fossil calibration. We explore the evolution of five selected morphological characters, reconstruct the evolution of habitat (white-sand vs. clayish soils) preference, as well as space and time by using a recently developed continuous diffusion model in biogeography. We find Pradosia to be monophyletic in its current circumscription and to have originated in the Amazon basin at similar to 47.5 Ma. Selected morphological characters are useful to readily distinguish three clades. Preferences to white-sand and/or clay are somewhat important for the majority of species, but speciation has not been powered by habitat shifts. Pradosia brevipes is a relative young species (similar to 1.3 Ma) that has evolved a unique geoxylic life strategy within Pradosia and is restricted to savannahs. Molecular dating and phylogenetic pattern indicate that Pradosia reached the Brazilian Atlantic coast at least three times: at 34.4 Ma (P. longipedicellata), at 11.7 Ma (P. kuhlmannii), and at 3.9 Ma (weakly supported node within the red-flowered clade).

AB The effectiveness of ecological researches on small mammals strongly depends on trapping techniques to survey communities and populations accurately. The main goal of this study was to assess the efficiency of three types of traps (Sherman, Tomahawk and Pitfall) to capture non-volant small mammals. We installed traps in 22 forest fragments in the southern Brazilian Amazonia. We captured 873 individuals belonging to 21 species; most of the individuals (N = 369) and species (N = 19) were trapped using Pitfalls, followed by Shermans (N = 271 individuals; N = 15 species) and Tomahawks (N = 233 individuals; N = 15 species). Pitfalls trapped a richer community subset of small mammals than the two other types of traps, and a more abundant community subset than Tomahawks. Proechimys sp. was the most abundant species trapped (N = 125) and Tomahawk was the most efficient type of trap to capture this species (N = 97 individuals). Neacomys spinosus and Marmosops bishopi were more trapped in Pitfalls (N = 92 and 100 individuals, respectively) than Shermans and Tomahawks. Monodelphis glirina was more trapped in Shermans and Pitfalls than Tomahawks. Species composition trapped using the three types of traps were distinct. Pitfalls captured a more distinct subset of the small mammal community than the two other live traps. We recommend the association of the three types of traps to reach a more comprehensive sampling of the community of small mammals. Thus, as stated by previous studies, we also recommend the complementary use of Shermans, Tomahawks and Pitfalls to account for a thorough sampling of the whole small mammal community in researches conducted in the tropical forests of Amazonia.

AB Desiccation stress is a major limiting factor for many organisms in the intertidal zone. Sessile mollusks often reduce water loss by isolating themselves from the external environment upon aerial exposure, which can result in other stressful conditions within their sealed mantle cavity. Interestingly, some intertidal animals willfully expose their tissues to the air when emersed ('gaping,' 'mushrooming,' or ` lifting' behavior). This basic behavior-and the desiccation tolerance-of the cosmopolitan gastropod Crepidula fornicata have not been thoroughly investigated. We found that individuals of Crepidula fornicata almost always have their shells lifted off of the substrate when submerged, but that they also perform this lifting behavior periodically when exposed to air. The lifting behavior was costly, however, as air-exposed juveniles that were free to lift lost significantly more water than those that were artificially clamped to the substrate. We found no measurable difference in desiccation tolerance between intertidal and subtidal adults, which all survived aerial exposures of up to 10 h. In contrast, most small juvenile Crepidula fornicata died following only 2 to 6 h of exposure, after losing between 38.5 and 75.5% of their tissue water. Because juveniles lost water so quickly, desiccation stress may be an important limiting factor for Crepidula fornicata, unless juveniles can move to wet areas when exposed to air until they are large enough to withstand longer periods of aerial exposure.

AB The phytogeographical regions and sub-regions of Australia are revised in light of new data from a recent analysis by Gonzalez-Orozco, Ebach et al. (2014). The new revision includes two new regions, Northern regio nova and Northern Desert regio nova, and five new sub-regions, Nullarbor sub-regio nova, Central Desert sub-regio nova, Great Sandy Desert Interzone sub-regio nova, Central Queensland sub-regio nova and, Southwestern sub-regio nova. This new revised version of the phytogeographical regions and sub-regions of Australia's land plants provides an updated classification based on historical nomenclature. The analysis by Gonzalez-Orozco, Ebach et al. (2014) is a biogeographically centered classification that generated the first exclusively taxonomic regionalisation of Australia's land plants, used here to update the ABA phytogeographical regions.

AB Tropical lowland rain forest (TLRF) biodiversity is under threat from anthropogenic factors including deforestation which creates forest fragments of different sizes that can further undergo various internal patterns of logging. Such interventions can modify previous equilibrium abundance and spatial distribution patterns of offspring recruitment and/or pollen dispersal. Little is known about how these aspects of deforestation and fragmentation might synergistically affect TLRF tree recovery demographics and population genetics in newly formed forest fragments. To investigate these TLRF anthropogenic disturbance processes we used the computer program NEWGARDEN (NG), which models spatially-explicit, individual-based plant populations, to simulate 10% deforestation in six different spatial logging patterns for the plant functional type of a long-lived TLRF canopy tree species. Further, each logging pattern was analyzed under nine varying patterns of offspring versus pollen dispersal distances that could have arisen post-fragmentation. Results indicated that gene dispersal condition (especially via offspring) had a greater effect on population growth and genetic diversity retention (explaining 98.5% and 88.8% of the variance respectively) than spatial logging pattern (0.2% and 4.7% respectively), with 'Near' distance dispersal maximizing population growth and genetic diversity relative to distant dispersal. Within logged regions of the fragment, deforestation patterns closer to fragment borders more often exhibited lower population recovery rates and founding genetic diversity retention relative to more centrally located logging. These results suggest newly isolated fragments have populations that are more sensitive to the way in which their offspring and pollen dispersers are affected than the spatial pattern in which subsequent logging occurs, and that large variation in the recovery rates of different TLRF tree species attributable to altered gene dispersal regimens will be a likely outcome of fragmentation. Conservation implications include possible manual interventions (manual manipulations of offspring dispersers and/or pollinators) in forest fragments to increase population recovery and genetic diversity retention.

AB Local abundance of adult trees impedes growth of conspecific seedlings through host-specific enemies, a mechanism first proposed by Janzen and Connell to explain plant diversity in forests. While several studies suggest the importance of this mechanism, there is still little information of how the variance of negative density dependence (NDD) affects diversity of forest communities. With computer simulations, we analyzed the impact of strength and variance of NDD within tree communities on species diversity. We show that stronger NDD leads to higher species diversity. Furthermore, lower range of strengths of NDD within a community increases species richness and decreases variance of species abundances. Our results show that, beyond the average strength of NDD, the variance of NDD is also crucially important to explain species diversity. This can explain the dissimilarity of biodiversity between tropical and temperate forest: highly diverse forests could have lower NDD variance. This report suggests that natural enemies and the variety of the magnitude of their effects can contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity.

AB Current theoretical studies on mechanisms promoting species co-existence in diverse communities assume that species are fixed in their mating behavior. Each species is a discrete evolutionary unit, even though most empirical evidence indicates that inter-specific gene flow occurs in plant and animal groups. Here, in a data-driven meta-community model of species co-existence, we allow mating behavior to respond to local species composition and abundance. While individuals primarily out-cross, species maintain a diminished capacity for selfing and hybridization. Mate choice is treated as a variable behavior, which responds to intrinsic traits determining mate choice and the density and availability of sympatric inter-fertile individuals. When mate choice is strongly limited, even low survivorship of selfed offspring can prevent extinction of rare species. With increasing mate choice, low hybridization success rates maintain community level diversity for extended periods of time. In high diversity tropical tree communities, competition among sympatric congeneric species is negligible, because direct spatial proximity with close relatives is infrequent. Therefore, the genomic donorship presents little cost. By incorporating variable mating behavior into evolutionary models of diversification, we also discuss how participation in a syngameon may be selectively advantageous. We view this behavior as a genomic mutualism, where maintenance of genomic structure and diminished inter-fertility, allows each species in the syngameon to benefit from a greater effective population size during episodes of selective disadvantage. Rare species would play a particularly important role in these syngameons as they are more likely to produce heterospecific crosses and transgressive phenotypes. We propose that inter-specific gene flow can play a critical role by allowing genomic mutualists to avoid extinction and gain local adaptations.

AB This article focuses on the use of governmentality as a technique of government and its effects, with reference to a protected landscape. Drawing on ethnographic materials from the Azores, it demonstrates that governmentality is not always practised by governments in the way it is meant to be. Although the state's conservation efforts in Sete Cidades meet the accepted criteria of a governmental programme, they do not transform local subjectivities as intended. The protected landscape of Sete Cidades is a government initiative, but also a tool used strategically by certain social groups living and working within this landscape to object to the appropriation of the space upon which their livelihood relies, and to understand, communicate and legitimise their place in the world.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition can influence carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems. However, a general recognition of how soil microorganisms respond to increasing N deposition is not yet reached. We explored soil microbial responses to two levels of N addition (2.5 and 5 gN m(-2) yr(-1)) in interplant soil and beneath shrubs of Haloxylon ammodendron and their consequences to soil respiration in the Gurbantunggut Desert, northwestern China from 2011 to 2013. Microbial biomass and respiration were significantly higher beneath H. ammodendron than in interplant soil. The responses of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial respiration (MR) showed opposite responses to N addition in interplant and beneath H. ammodendron. N addition slightly increased MBC and MR in interplant soil and decreased them beneath H. ammodendron, with a significant inhibition only in 2012. N addition had no impacts on the total microbial physiological activity, but N addition decreased the labile carbon substrate utilization beneath H. ammodendron when N addition level was high. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis showed that N addition did not alter the soil microbial community structure as evidenced by the similar ratios of fungal to bacterial PLFAs and gram-negative to gram-positive bacterial PLFAs. Microbial biomass and respiration showed close correlations with soil water content and dissolved carbon, and they were independent of soil inorganic nitrogen across three years. Our study suggests that N addition effects on soil microorganisms and carbon emission are dependent on the respiratory substrates and water availability in the desert ecosystem.

AB General patterns of forest dynamics and productivity in the Andes Mountains are poorly characterized. Here we present the first large-scale study of Andean forest dynamics using a set of 63 permanent forest plots assembled over the past two decades. In the North-Central Andes tree turnover (mortality and recruitment) and tree growth declined with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. In addition, basal area increased in Lower Montane Moist Forests but did not change in Higher Montane Humid Forests. However, at higher elevations the lack of net basal area change and excess of mortality over recruitment suggests negative environmental impacts. In North-Western Argentina, forest dynamics appear to be influenced by land use history in addition to environmental variation. Taken together, our results indicate that combinations of abiotic and biotic factors that vary across elevation gradients are important determinants of tree turnover and productivity in the Andes. More extensive and longer-term monitoring and analyses of forest dynamics in permanent plots will be necessary to understand how demographic processes and woody biomass are responding to changing environmental conditions along elevation gradients through this century.

AB The modification of typical age-related growth by environmental changes is poorly understood, In part because there is a lack of consensus at individual tree level regarding age-dependent growth responses to climate warming as stands develop. To increase our current understanding about how multiple drivers of environmental change can modify growth responses as trees age we used tree ring data of a mountain subtropical pine species along an altitudinal gradient covering more than 2,200 m of altitude. We applied mixed-linear models to determine how absolute and relative age-dependent growth varies depending on stand development; and to quantify the relative importance of tree age and climate on individual tree growth responses. Tree age was the most important factor for tree growth in models parameterised using data from all forest developmental stages. Contrastingly, the relationship found between tree age and growth became non-significant in models parameterised using data corresponding to mature stages. These results suggest that although absolute tree growth can continuously increase along tree size when trees reach maturity age had no effect on growth. Tree growth was strongly reduced under increased annual temperature, leading to more constant age-related growth responses. Furthermore, young trees were the most sensitive to reductions in relative growth rates, but absolute growth was strongly reduced under increased temperature in old trees. Our results help to reconcile previous contrasting findings of age-related growth responses at the individual tree level, suggesting that the sign and magnitude of age-related growth responses vary with stand development. The different responses found to climate for absolute and relative growth rates suggest that young trees are particularly vulnerable under warming climate, but reduced absolute growth in old trees could alter the species' potential as a carbon sink in the future.

AB We recorded the species composition of mixed bird flocks, during 366h of fieldwork in seven localities along an altitudinal gradient on the Central Andes of Colombia. We observed 164 species in 212 mixed bird flocks. Species composition varied along the altitudinal gradient and 27 species could have a cohesive role in the flock, but almost all of them were different among localities. The number of species per mixed flock varied from two to 30. The mean number of species per flock also varied among localities, and the differences among the whole set of species joining mixed flocks in each locality seem to be related with both differences in altitude and geographic distance.

AB Leaf cutting ants are dominant herbivores and influential ecosystem engineers in the Neotropics. It has been suggested that habitat disturbances alter the architecture of foraging trail systems for colonies in their vicinity; however, the evidence remains scarce. In this study we investigated the effect of unpaved roads dissecting tropical lowland forest habitat on the structure of leafcutter foraging trail systems and foraging effort. We mapped trail systems for 16 mature Atta colombica colonies located at different distances from unpaved roads. Our results suggest exploitation of unpaved roads by leafcutters provides favorable foraging conditions, causing significant differences in foraging trail structure.

ID DEFORESTATION
AB Selective logging gives currently a major contribution to ongoing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia. The spatial distribution of log landing sites (LLS), i.e. the sites where logged trees are collected, serves as a proxy to the intensity of selective logging activities. In this study we analysed the LLS pattern in a study area that has a rapid deforestation. Actual LLS locations were extracted from a Landsat image of 2000 that covers a large part of the study area. We first used the inhomogeneous J-function. A kernel bandwidth of 20 km best modelled the non-stationarity, showing a strongly clustered LLS distribution. Second, the Area-interaction point process model incorporating information about distance of LLS to roads and to clear-cut deforested areas was applied. The model well explained the clustered LLS pattern and showed a significant effect of distance to roads. We concluded that this spatial statistical study helped to quantify and better understand the LLS pattern. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID COMMUNITY ECOLOGY
AB L.G. Ramensky (1884-1953) was an outstanding Soviet geobotanist of the first part of XX century. Considered is his theoretical legacy and its contribution to modern vegetation science. L.G. Ramensky formulated the principle of vegetation continuum based on which the modern paradigm of vegetation science has been put into shape. The scientist made a contribution to the development of such important theoretical conceptions as types of plant strategy, coenosis and coenobiosis (coexistence of species), patterns of interannual variability in plant communities, ecological successions. The unique ecological scales were established by L.G. Ramensky that characterize the distribution of 1400 species over the gradients of soil moistening, richness, and salinization as well as moistening variability, pastoral digression, and alluvial intensity. He came out against mechanistic notions by V.N. Sukachev on a biogeocoenosis structure. The scientist did not offer his own method of plant communities classification but his well-reasoned criticism of dominant classification played a great role in adoption of floristical classification principles (Braun-Blanquet approach) by phytocenology in our country.

AB Advances in phytoremediation research require the selection of new hyperaccumulators or accumulators and investigations of their tolerance and accumulation of heavy metals. Two concentration gradient experiments (preliminary and verification), involving the same soil Cd concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg kg(-1)), were conducted to study Cd accumulation and tolerance in Capsella bursa-pastoris. In the preliminary and verification concentration gradient experiments, the Cd content in shoots of C. bursa-pastoris exceeded 100 mg kg(-1) at a soil Cd concentration of 50 mg kg(-1), and the maxima of Cd contents in shoots were 307.67 and 369.20 mg kg(-1) at 125 mg kg(-1) Cd in soil, respectively. The shoot bioconcentration factor of C. bursa-pastoris was greater than 1, but the translocation factor was less than 1.0 in the preliminary and verification concentration gradient experiments. In the verification concentration gradient experiment, the malondialdehyde content and the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase increased compared with the control. Therefore, C. bursa-pastoris is a Cd-accumulator with strong tolerance to Cd, and could be used to remediate Cd-contaminated farmland soil in winter.

AB Different species are usually thought to have specific adaptations, which allow them to occupy different ecological niches. But recent neutral ecology theory suggests that species diversity can simply be the result of random sampling, due to finite population sizes and limited dispersal. Neutral models predict that species are not necessarily adapted to specific niches, but are functionally equivalent across a range of habitats. Here, we evaluate the ecology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the most important microbial species in human history. The artificial collection, concentration and fermentation of large volumes of fruit for alcohol production produce an environment in which S. cerevisiae thrives, and therefore it is assumed that fruit is the ecological niche that S. cerevisiae inhabits and has adapted to. We find very little direct evidence that S. cerevisiae is adapted to fruit, or indeed to any other specific niche. We propose instead a neutral nomad model for S. cerevisiae, which we believe should be used as the starting hypothesis in attempting to unravel the ecology of this important microbe.

AB Facing increasing human demands on Earth, understanding how endangered species may survive in isolated remnants of natural habitat within heavily transformed landscapes is key to contemporary conservation biology. Against this background we here investigate the factors affecting pond occupancy in the endangered European tree frog (Hyla arborea L.) within an urban landscape, being located in north-eastern Germany where the species is still fairly common. Our survey revealed that 58 out of 122 ponds were occupied by H. arborea. Ponds with a higher percentage of floating vegetation, being deeper and surrounded by higher percentages of crop fields and forests were more likely to be occupied, while factors associated with urbanization such as the percentage of built-up area were strongly detrimental. Habitat requirements of H. arborea were complex as occurrence was simultaneously affected by different spatial scales, including the landscape scale, the immediate surroundings of ponds and the ponds themselves. H. arborea avoided highly urbanized areas, but occurred frequently in agricultural areas surrounding the city. The latter suggests that this species is fairly tolerant towards human-induced transformations, and that vast arable fields yielded positive rather than negative effects on H. arborea occurrence. We conclude that the most important conservation issues for supporting H. arborea populations at the periphery of urbanized areas are (1) maintaining an open (agricultural) landscape structure, (2) providing undisturbed overwintering habitats, and (3) maintaining pond quality by halting shrub and tree encroachment.

AB Plants defense against herbivore damage is achieved through resistance and tolerance, of which resistance is composed of avoidance and antibiosis. Plants have developed various adaptations that facilitate escape from herbivory. We hypothesized that post-anthesis prostrate scapes in Taraxacum is an adaptation for avoidance of capitulum grazing by large herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we divided flowering into the following four stages based on the external appearance of the capitulum: green bud, yellow corolla, brown corolla, and white pappus stages. We conducted an experiment in natural pasture in Mongolia to artificially raise capitula and rosette leaves of T. collinum. We measured the natural height of capitula and rosette leaves of the Mongolian pasture and urban species, T. collinum and T. ceratophorum, respectively, and of the Japanese rural and exotic urban species, T. japonicum and T. officinale, respectively. We investigated natural grazing by livestock in the field of the capitula and rosette leaves of the two Mongolian species. In Mongolia, naturally short capitula at the green bud and brown corolla stages and rosette leaves of T. collinum were not grazed. However, artificially raised capitula and rosette leaves of T. collinum and the naturally high capitula and leaves of T. ceratophorum were grazed. Short capitulum and leaf height was shown to be effective for avoidance of livestock grazing in Mongolia. In Japan, T. japonicum and T. officinale showed similar scape behavior to T. collinum and T. ceratophorum, respectively. We discuss the reasons for the capitulum behavior differences in Japan.

AB Negative density dependence contributes to seedling dynamics in forested ecosystems, but the relative importance of this factor for different woody plant life-forms is not well-understood. We used 1yr of seedling survivorship data for woody seedlings in 17 different plots of lower to mid-montane rain forests on the island of Dominica to examine how seedling height, abiotic factors, and biotic factors such as negative density dependence are related to seedling survival of five different life-forms (canopy, midstory, and understory trees; shrubs; and lianas). Across 64 species, taller seedlings in seedling plots with higher canopy openness, greater seedling density, lower relative abundance of conspecific seedlings, and lower relative abundance of conspecific adults generally had a greater probability of surviving. Height was the strongest predictor of seedling survival for all life-forms except lianas. Greater seedling density was positively related to survival for canopy and midstory trees but negatively related to survival for the other life-forms. For trees, the relative abundance of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors had weak and strong negative effects on survival respectively. Neither shrub nor liana seedling survival was affected by the relative abundance of conspecific neighbors. Thus, negative density dependence is confirmed as an important structuring mechanism for tree seedling communities but does not seem to be important for lianas and shrubs in Dominican rain forests. These results represent the first direct assessment of controls on seedling survival of all woody life-forms - an important step in understanding the dynamics and structure of the entire woody plant community.

AB Gap dynamics theory proposes that treefall gaps provide high light levels needed for regeneration in the understory, and by increasing heterogeneity in the light environment allow light-demanding tree species to persist in the community. Recent studies have demonstrated age-related declines in leaf area index of individual temperate trees, highlighting a mechanism for gradual changes in the forest canopy that may also be an important, but less obvious, driver of forest dynamics. We assessed the prevalence of age-related crown thinning among 12 tropical canopy tree species sampled in lowland forests in Panama and Puerto Rico (total N=881). Canopy gap fraction of individual canopy tree crowns was positively related to stem diameter at 1.3m (diameter at breast height) in a pooled analysis, with 10 of 12 species showing a positive trend. Considered individually, a positive correlation between stem diameter and canopy gap fraction was statistically significant in 4 of 12 species, all of which were large-statured canopy to emergent species: Beilschmiedia pendula, Ceiba pentandra, Jacaranda copaia, and Prioria copaifera. Pooled analyses also showed a negative relationship between liana abundance and canopy gap fraction, suggesting that lianas could be partially obscuring age-related crown thinning. We conclude that age-related crown thinning occurs in tropical forests, and could thus influence patterns of tree regeneration and tropical forest community dynamics.

AB River damming has created fragmented landscapes in parts of the Amazon basin. The resulting decrease in forest area could directly affect amphibian species if large areas of habitat are required to guarantee the presence of specific types of breeding sites. Here, we describe the anuran assemblages on islands created by damming of the Tocantins River twenty years ago in the eastern Amazon basin. We surveyed 10 undisturbed islands varying in size from 3 to 2140ha and located at distances of up to 6.7km from the margin of the reservoir. We identified 32 frog species, of which 15, 14, and 3 have aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial development, respectively. The number of frog species increased significantly with island area but was not affected by island distance from the margin. Species with aquatic or semiaquatic development tended to be absent from the smaller islands, regardless of the degree of isolation from the mainland. These findings emphasize the need to preserve specific microhabitats on smaller land-bridge islands to maintain amphibian diversity in reservoir environments.

Neste estudo avaliamos as assembleias de anuros remanescentes em ilhas de florestas originadas apos o represamento do Rio Tocantins, Amazonia Oriental. Nos amostramos 10 ilhas que variaram de tres a 2140ha de area, e localizadas ate 6.7km de distancia da margem do reservatorio. Nos encontramos 32 especies de anuros, 15 com desenvolvimento direto, 14 com desenvolvimento semi-aquatico e tres com desenvolvimento terrestre. O numero de especies aumentou significativamente com a area da ilha, mas nAo foi influenciado pela distancia da margem do reservatorio. As especies com desenvolvimento aquatico ou semi-aquatico tenderam a nAo ocorrer nas ilhas menores, independente delas estarem perto ou longe da margem do reservatorio. Estes resultados tem importante implicacAo para a conservacAo e restauracAo de ilhas formadas pelo represamento de rios para a construcAo de hidreletricas, enfatizando a necessidade de se preservar ilhas menores que tenham especificos habitats ou ilhas grandes o suficiente para manter sitios reprodutivos que contribuam para a manutencAo da diversidade de anfibios nestes ambientes remanescentes.

AB Conversion of tropical forests to agriculture affects vertebrate assemblages, but we do not know how fast or to what extent these assemblages recover after field abandonment. We addressed this question by examining amphibians and reptiles in secondary forests in southeastern Mexico. We used chronosequence data (12 secondary forests fallow for 1-23yr and 3 old-growth forest sites) to analyze successional trajectories and estimate recovery times of assemblage attributes for amphibians and reptiles. We conducted 6 surveys at each site over 14mo (1200 person-hours) and recorded 1552 individuals, including 25 species of amphibians and 36 of reptiles, representing 96 and 74 percent of the expected regional number of species, respectively. Abundance, species richness, and species diversity of amphibians increased rapidly with successional age, approaching old-growth forest values in < 30yr. Species richness and species diversity of reptiles reached old-growth forest values in < 20yr. By contrast, the abundance of reptiles and the assemblage composition of amphibians and reptiles recovered more slowly. Along the chronosequence, we observed more species replacement in reptile assemblages than in amphibian assemblages. Several species in the old-growth forest were absent from secondary forests. Dispersal limitation and harsh conditions prevailing in open sites and early successional environments appear to preclude colonization by old-growth forest species. Furthermore, short fallow periods and isolation of forest remnants lead to the formation of new assemblages dominated by species favored by human disturbances.
   Resumen La conversion de los bosques tropicales en campos agropecuarios afecta a los ensambles de vertebrados, pero no sabemos en que medida y con que rapidez estos ensambles se recuperan despues del abandono de los campos. Exploramos este aspecto para el caso de los anfibios y reptiles en el sureste de Mexico. Basados en datos de una cronosecuencia (12 bosques secundarios con edades de 1-23 anos de desarrollo y tres sitios de bosques maduro), analizamos trayectorias sucesionales para estimar los tiempos de recuperacion de diferentes atributos de los ensambles de anfibios y reptiles. En cada sitio, se llevaron a cabo seis muestreos a lo largo de 14 meses (1200 horas persona en total). Globalmente, se registraron 1552 individuos, 25 especies de anfibios y 36 de reptiles, lo que represento el 96% y el 74% del numero esperado de especies regionales, respectivamente. La abundancia, la riqueza de especies y la diversidad de especies de anfibios se incrementaron rapidamente con la edad sucesional, acercandose a los valores del bosque maduro en menos de tres decadas. La riqueza de especies y la diversidad de especies de reptiles alcanzaron valores del bosque maduro en menos de 20 anos. Por el contrario, la recuperacion de la abundancia de reptiles fue mucho mas lenta como fue tambien el caso de la composicion del ensamble de anfibios y reptiles. A lo largo de la cronosecuencia, hubo una mayor sustitucion de especies en los ensamblajes de reptiles que en los de anfibios. Varias especies que se encontraron en el bosque maduro estuvieron ausentes en los bosques secundarios. Discutimos que la limitacion de la dispersion y las duras condiciones que prevalecen en los sitios abiertos y en los ambientes sucesionales tempranos impiden a las especies que habitan en el bosque maduro la colonizacion de esos habitats. Ademas, los periodos de barbecho corto y el aislamiento de los remanentes de bosques llevan a la formacion de nuevos ensambles dominados por especies favorecidas por las perturbaciones humanas.

ID POLITICS
AB In the Brazilian Amazon, a questAo fundiaria (the land question) has been asked and answered in a variety of ways since the region was opened up to large-scale migration and development projects in the 1960s. The question of who is entitled to land and under what conditions is at the heart of most debates concerning the region's future, but recent attempts to reform and simplify rural land tenure in Amazonia confront a history of contradictory land-use policies and a legacy of impunity. In response to economic and demographic pressures, the Brazilian state aims to combat the illicit occupation, sale, and transformation of lands. This article presents an ethnographic approach to the land question in Amazonia by studying the knowledge-making practices associated with the Programa Terra Legal (Legal Land Program), Brazil's effort to create a cadastral registry for rural holdings in the region. It argues that tenure regularization dedicated to securing smallholders' rights and to instituting environmental regulations is being used by rural elites as a mechanism to accumulate land and power. By showing how a reform program gets remade in the thrall of local interests and vernacular dispositions of property, this article reveals how knowledge both illuminates and obscures subjects of governance.

AB Demographic equivalence is the central assumption of the neutral theory of species diversity and has attracted much criticism, since species clearly differ from each other in many traits. Two simple answers-that is, dispersal limitation and demographic trade-offs-have been suggested to resolve this problem. Both processes are considered to be capable of making interspecific differences in fitness smaller on their own, thus potentially reconciling neutrality with reality. However, when the two mechanisms operate simultaneously, as they must do in natural communities, we are surprised to find that they interfere with each other in such a way that dispersal limitation favors more fecund species. Fitness equivalence is no longer guaranteed by a perfect trade-off, and contrary to popular belief, dispersal limitation is found to impede rather than facilitate the stochastic coexistence of species. Still, more species can coexist than allowed through demographic equivalence, providing a potentially alternative explanationfor biodiversity maintenance in nature.

AB The Atlantic Forest encompasses a high level of biodiversity, endemism and degradation; hence, it is a biome of particular interest for biological conservation. We aimed to investigate the actual geographic distribution of tree species and, among the indicator species of each vegetation type, the conservation status and potential distribution of each species along a vegetation gradient of the Subtropical Atlantic Forest. We analysed the species' relative constancy to determine their actual distribution, obtained 21 indicator species of the different vegetation types and modelled their potential distribution using the maximum entropy algorithm. The potential distribution models were pooled to yield a single map, which was used to predict the distribution of climatic suitability for these species in South America. Our results showed that the actual geographic distribution is restricted for most species (similar to 72 %). Araucaria angustifolia and Euterpe edulis were categorized as threatened species. The sum of the indicator-species maps showed reduced climatic suitability across most of South America. The southern region of Brazil and the southeastern Brazilian highlands, as well as a few areas of seasonal forests on higher elevations of the Bolivian Chiquitania and Andean Piedmont, exhibited the best climatic suitability. Elevation was the most important variable in our models. Given the concerning level of forest degradation and the presence of endangered and geographic restricted species, our results are a relevant contribution to biodiversity conservation in the Subtropical Atlantic Forest areas, highlighting their floristic and environmental uniqueness and, therefore, the urgent necessity of preserving their biological heritage.

AB In many tropical areas, monospecific tree plantations are replacing natural forest. The ecology of these plantations is quite different from that of natural forests, including the diversity and community structure of vascular and cryptogamic epiphytes. Few studies have looked at the ecology of guilds of epiphytes in plantations versus natural forest. Here, we investigated epiphytic, lirellate species of the family Graphidaceae, the largest family of tropical lichen fungi, which are widely distributed and abundant in tropical regions. We compared species richness and community structure in a monospecific plantation of the introduced tree species Eucalyptus globulus versus native oak forest dominated by Quercus humboldtii. Overall species richness was substantially higher in the natural oak forest (41 vs. 14 species, with eight shared between both stands, for a total of 47), whereas species abundance was significantly higher in the gum plantation. While species richness per tree (alpha diversity) was comparable between both stands, average species turnover between trees within each stand (beta diversity) was significantly higher in the natural oak forest, resulting in substantially higher overall species richness (gamma diversity). We conclude that the monospecific gum plantation exhibits both de-diversification (lower overall species richness) and homogenization (more similar communities between trees) of these epiphytic lichen guilds. This is not an effect of phorophyte diversity since in both stands, only a single tree species each was considered. Among the lichens identified, we detected six new to the Neotropics and 29 new records for Colombia.

AB Land-cover change detection using satellite remote sensing is largely confined to the era of Landsat satellites, from 1972 to present. However, the Corona, Argon, and Lanyard intelligence satellites operated by the U.S. government between 1960 and 1972 have the potential to provide an important extension of the long-term record of Earth's land surface. Recently declassified, the archive of images recorded by these satellites contains hundreds of thousands of photographs, many of which have very high ground resolution- 6-9 ft (1.8-2.7 m) even by today's standards. This paper demonstrates methods for extending the span of forest-cover change analysis from the Landsat-5 and -7 era (1984 to present) to the previous era covered by the Corona archive in two study areas: one area covered predominantly by urban and sub-urban land uses in the eastern US and another area by tropical forest in central Brazil. We describe co-registration of Corona and Landsat images, extraction of texture features from Corona images, classification of Corona and Landsat images, and post-classification change detection based on the resulting thematic dataset. Second-order polynomial transformation of Corona images yielded geometric accuracy relative to Landsat-7 of 18.24 m for the urban area and 29.35 m for the tropical forest study area, generally deemed adequate for pixel-based change detection at Landsat resolution. Classification accuracies were approximately 95% and 96% for forest/non-forest discrimination for the temperate urban and tropical forest study areas, respectively. Texture within 7 x 7- to 9 x 9-pixel (similar to 13.0-16.5 m) neighborhoods and within 11 x 11-pixel (similar to 30 m) neighborhoods were the most informative metrics for forest classification in Corona images in the temperate and tropical study areas, respectively. The trajectory of change from the 1960s to 2000s differed between the two study areas: the average annual forest loss rate in the urban area doubled from 0.68% to 1.9% from the 1960s to the mid-1980s and then decreased during the following decade. In contrast, deforestation in the Brazilian study area continued at a slightly increased pace between the 1960s and 1990s at annual loss rate of 0.62-0.79% and quickly slowed down afterward. This study demonstrates the strong potential of declassified Corona images for detecting historical forest changes in these study regions and suggests increased utility for retrieving a wide range of land cover histories around the world.

AB In this study, we tested the hypothesis that functional traits associated with nutrient impoverishment contribute to enhancing shade-tolerance (survival at low light) for the juveniles of canopy tree species in Bornean rain forests. To test the hypothesis, survival and functional traits (biomass allocation, leaf dynamics and foliar nutrient concentration) were investigated as a function of light conditions for saplings of 13 species in three forests with different levels of nutrient availability. As predicted by the hypothesis, the species in the severely nutrient-poor site (a tropical heath forest on nutrient-poor soils) showed greater shade-tolerance (>91% survival for 8 mo at 5% global site factor) than in the other two sites (mixed dipterocarp forests) (54-87% survival). Across the species, greater shade-tolerance was associated with a higher biomass allocation to roots, a slower leaf production and a higher foliar C concentration, which are considered as C-conservation traits under nutrient impoverishment. These results suggest that the juveniles of the canopy species occurring on nutrient-poor soils can enhance shade-tolerance by the same mechanisms as the adaptation to nutrient impoverishments. Tree species in nutrient-poor environments may be selected for surviving also in shaded conditions.

AB Leafcutter ants are considered the most important herbivores in the Neotropics. Atta vollenweideri is a rangeland pest that competes with cattle for grass, reducing the carrying capacity of pastures. However, there is much controversy regarding their degree of herbivory, pest status and competition with cattle. Furthermore, their economic injury level (EIL) has not been determined. We studied A. vollenweideri in competition with cattle in a natural pasture in Argentina, quantifying primary productivity, as well as herbivory by ants alone and together with cattle. Productivity and herbivory by ants were contrasted with cattle dietary requirements under two grazing regimes. We estimated the first EIL for leaf-cutting ants in rangelands. Productivity was highly variable throughout the seasons. Competition between ants and cattle was evident during the low productivity periods, with evidence of ants being more affected by cattle unless ants store food during the productivity peak in summer and autumn. The EIL was 0.29 ant nests per hectare, although it likely overestimates the importance of these ants as pests. We discuss the shortcomings of a classic EIL formula for estimating the damage potential of social insects.

AB Originality measures how different a given species is from all other co-occurring species regarding either their phylogenetic history or functional traits. Since it is important to preserve the various aspects of diversity and original species carry more phylogenetic or functional information, originality may be used to assign conservation priorities. Our goal was to evaluate the relationships between phylogenetic and functional originalities, and their simulated losses under extinction scenarios based on abundance, fire tolerance and habitat preference. We placed 100 plots in a cerrado reserve located in central Brazil, sampled all woody plants species within the plots, measured 14 functional traits and measured fire history. We assembled a phylogenetic tree and a functional dendrogram, with which we calculated the originalities. Phylogenetic- and functional-based originalities were correlated. However, the loss of functional originality was different from random extinctions on the abundance and fire tolerance scenarios, whereas the loss of phylogenetic originality was not. When compared with phylogenetic originality, functional originality brought more information to be used in conservation strategies because it was sensitive to differences in species abundance and fire tolerance. Thus, the extinction of rare or fire-sensitive species would result in important functional changes due to loss of distinctive traits.

AB Large mammals are vulnerable to extinction, and respond directly to ecological gradients within the forest and to the intensity of forest product use by humans. In this study, we evaluated the effects of differences in forest structure and human occupation history on the composition of medium and large-sized mammal assemblages of the terra-firme forests of the Anavilhanas National Park, one of the most oligotrophic Amazonian ecosystems. Mammal surveys were conducted along 11 linear transects of 4km, six of which were located in areas once inhabited by people and managed until the year that the park was created (over 30 years ago), and five in areas that were not inhabited at that time. We detected 469 individuals of 26 species during diurnal and nocturnal sampling, and 11 additional species outside transects. Human occupation history was strongly related to forest structure components. Fruit biomass, canopy cover and tree size were strongly associated with uninhabited areas, and influenced the structure of mammal assemblages. A direct relationship between diet category and species size was observed. Large frugivore-herbivores and carnivores were more closely associated with areas with more fruit, larger trees and greater canopy cover. In contrast, small arboreal frugivore-omnivores associated more closely with open canopy and smaller trees. Our study indicated that the effects of human occupation history on forest structure are still evident three decades after the removal of local people from the park. This long-term effect can be explained by the low resilience of the Anavilhanas environments, demonstrating the fragility of mammal assemblages in face of anthropogenic variation in forest structure in the oligotrophic ecosystems of the Negro River basin.

AB AimThe aim of this study was to understand the biogeography of Brachygastra. As the spatial component of evolution is of fundamental importance to understanding the processes shaping the evolution of taxa, the known geological history of the Neotropical region was used together with the current phylogeny and distribution of species to investigate questions concerning the biogeography of Brachygastra: the ancestral ranges of Brachygastra species; their areal relationships and their congruence with previously published hypotheses; the possible associated vicariance events and the influence of land bridges between North and South America, and the split between the Amazon and Atlantic forests.
   LocationNeotropical region, from Mexico to central Argentina and southern USA.
   MethodsStatistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA) was used to reconstruct the possible ancestral ranges of Brachygastra species based on their phylogeny (divided into three groups, lecheguana, scuttelaris and smithii). A Brooks parsimony analysis (BPA) and component analysis were performed to reconstruct the areal relationships of these species within the Neotropics.
   ResultsS-DIVA suggested a widespread, South American ancestral region for Brachygastra. The ancestral B. azteca probably reached the Nearctic before a posterior vicariance event separated it from the species groups ((lecheguana (scutellaris + smithii))), that stayed in the Atlantic forest. The ancestral (scutellaris + smithii groups) possibly reached the Amazon by dispersal, and the subsequent vicariance event splitting the Atlantic forest and Amazon separated the groups into scutellaris in the Atlantic forest and smithii in the Amazon. BPA and component analyses suggested that the Nearctic was a sister area to other regions, the Andes and Mesoamerica was a sister area to the Neotropical regions and the Amazon was closely related to the Atlantic forest.
   Main conclusionsThe phylogeny and distribution of Brachygastra suggest the influence of a land bridge between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres affecting the cladogenesis of B. azteca and the importance of the formation of the two blocks of forests in South America to the cladogenesis of the main groups of Brachygastra. Future comparisons between the distribution patterns of other taxa should enable a more precise identification of the possible events and outcomes, adding robustness to the hypothesized areal relationships.

AB QuestionsWhat are the driving factors for the species richness of understorey herbs of isolated forest patches? How can the relative direct and indirect effects of patch area, site quality, habitat isolation and continuity be disentangled? What are the effects on different species groups?
   LocationEutrophic hardwood forest patches in northwestern Germany. The isolation of these patches results from extensive agricultural land use and prevailing poor soil conditions in the surrounding landscape. Thus, the patches are embedded within a matrix of both open habitats and species-poor acidic forests.
   MethodsWe surveyed 76 eutrophic forest patches and recorded all understorey herb species. Several measured site variables were divided into soil and structural components, and into variables describing mean site conditions and site heterogeneity. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to determine the direct and indirect effects of patch area, site heterogeneity, mean site conditions, isolation and habitat continuity on species richness of several species groups.
   ResultsThe most important factor determining species richness was patch area, which showed the strongest direct effect on eutrophic forest specialist species. Richness of forest matrix species, which also occur in the surrounding forest areas, was not directly influenced by area. Soil heterogeneity as well as structural heterogeneity increased with area, but only soil heterogeneity was relevant for species richness. Soil heterogeneity was more important for forest species in general and stress tolerators than for generalist species, open habitat species, competitors and ruderals. Mean site conditions influenced species richness of generalists, open habitat species, competitors and nutrient-demanding species. Isolation had a (negative) effect only on habitat specialists.
   ConclusionsThe relative effects of driving factors varied considerably between species groups. From our results for eutrophic forest specialists, we conclude that large and well-connected habitat patches are especially important for the successful conservation of the unique and partly endangered flora of eutrophic hardwood forests.

AB Suspension-feeding organisms living in the intertidal zone experience reduced feeding times associated with periodic aerial exposure. The potential morphological and physiological adaptations to this reduced feeding time were investigated for two closely related gastropods, Crepidula fornicata and Crepipatella peruviana. Intertidal C. fornicata had heavier gills than subtidal conspecifics, a difference mediated by larger gill surface areas and greater numbers of gill filaments among intertidal individuals of a given size. In contrast, the gills of intertidal and subtidal C. peruviana were morphologically indistinguishable. Despite relatively larger food-collecting organs, individuals of C. fornicata from the intertidal zone had clearance rates (CR) that were not significantly different from those of subtidal conspecifics. In contrast, the CR of intertidal C. peruviana were significantly lower than those of subtidal conspecifics. The low CR of intertidal C. peruviana may be partially explained by significantly lower measured particle transport velocities across their gills. In the context of feeding, intertidal individuals of C. fornicata performed at least as well as subtidal conspecifics, resulting in a population whose adults were as large as those found subtidally. This suggests that C. fornicata has had a long interaction with the environmental heterogeneity associated with intertidal life. In contrast, intertidal individuals of C. peruviana were on average smaller than subtidal individuals and may be stressed in the intertidal.

AB The high-altitude Southeastern Brazilian Cattleya coccinea clade includes two taxonomically challenging species, Cattleya coccinea and Cattleya mantiqueirae, the latter considered restricted to the mountain range of Serra da Mantiqueira. To hypothesize the existence of evolutionary independent lineages corresponding to these species, we inferred phylogenetic relationships and described patterns of population genetic diversity and structure of populations from six localities based on ISSR and cpDNA sequence data. Results do not support the species C. coccinea and C. mantiqueirae as previously circumscribed. Most analyses recovered southwestern and northeastern groups along the two mountain ranges, suggesting geography rather than morphology as an important criteria for species delimitation. However, due to the lack of information on the type locality of C. coccinea and the topological complexity of the southwestern area, the taxonomic circumscription of C. coccinea and C. mantiqueirae must be evaluated by additional population sampling. We also propose that the northeastern group comprise at least one distinct species. Also, specimens from Lima Duarte from Serra da Mantiqueira clearly do not belong to neither of the two groups and demand further investigation concerning a possible hybridization scenario of C. coccinea/C. mantiqueirae and C. brevipedunculata. Population genetic patterns of variation are in agreement with pollination observations for this group and with a drift-selection model of speciation. Owing to the high genetic differences among populations, with low levels of variation within populations, conservation priorities should favour protecting as many populations as possible.

AB The tree growth is influenced by several factors intrinsic and extrinsic, varying not only between species but between also responding to environmental changes and ecological conditions, or site factors. However, the weather, specifically the air temperature and precipitation stand out as the climatic variables that play a greater influence on the diameter growth of several species of temperate and subtropical climate, and often tropical climate. dendrochronological studies of native species present data to generate information relevant to conservation management and production, and potential use in climate reconstruction of the region. Araucaria angustifolia species is characteristic of the Araucaria Forest, with striking character in this forest type and thus arousing the interest of research conservationist standpoint and productive potential. The aim of this study was to research related to dendrochronology and influence of climatic variables on the growth of A. angustifolia in areas of native forests. It can be seen that in general, the most limiting factor in a most critical time is likely to express greater response, or precipitation and / or low temperatures coinciding with the beginning of the growing season tend to form more narrow annual rings, and thus a lower annual growth. According to the analyzed studies it can be noted that the greater precipitation and higher average temperature during the growing season, higher annual rings tend to be found, although this influence appears to be very tied to site conditions.

AB The extent of the Amazon rainforest is projected to drastically decrease in future decades because of land-use changes. Previous climate modelling studies have found that the biogeophysical effects of future Amazonian deforestation will likely increase surface temperatures and reduce precipitation locally. However, the magnitude of these changes and the potential existence of tipping points in the underlying relationships is still highly uncertain. Using a regional climate model at a resolution of about 50 km over the South American continent, we perform four ERA-interim-driven simulations with prescribed land cover maps corresponding to present-day vegetation, two deforestation scenarios for the twenty-first century, and a totally-deforested Amazon case. In response to projected land cover changes for 2100, we find an annual mean surface temperature increase of 0.5 degrees C over the Amazonian region and an annual mean decrease in rainfall of 0.17 mm/day compared to present-day conditions. These estimates reach 0.8 degrees C and 0.22 mm/day in the total-deforestation case. We also compare our results to those from 28 previous (regional and global) climate modelling experiments. We show that the historical development of climate models did not modify the median estimate of the Amazonian climate sensitivity to deforestation, but led to a reduction of its uncertainty. Our results suggest that the biogeophysical effects of deforestation alone are unlikely to lead to a tipping point in the evolution of the regional climate under present-day climate conditions. However, the conducted synthesis of the literature reveals that this behaviour may be model-dependent, and the greenhouse gas-induced climate forcing and bio-geochemical feedbacks should also be taken into account to fully assess the future climate of this region.

AB Copulatory wounding (CW) is widespread in the animal kingdom, but likely underreported because of its cryptic nature. We use four case studies (Drosophila flies, Siphopteron slugs, Cimex bugs, and Callosobruchus beetles) to show that CW entails physiological and life-history costs, but can evolve into a routine mating strategy that, in some species, involves insemination through the wound. Although interspecific variation in CW is documented, few data exist on intraspecific and none on individual differences. Although defensive mechanisms evolve in the wound recipient, our review also indicates that mating costs in species with CW are slightly higher than in other species. Whether such costs are dose-or frequency-dependent, and whether defense occurs as resistance or tolerance, decisively affects the evolutionary outcome. In addition to sexual conflict, CW may also become a model system for reproductive isolation. In this context, we put forward a number of predictions, including (1) occasional CW is more costly than routine CW, (2) CW is more costly in between-than within-population matings, and (3) in the presence of CW, selection may favor the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases if they induce resource allocation. Finally, we outline, and briefly discuss, several medical implications of CW in humans.

AB Poorly planned, large-scale ecological restoration projects may displace agricultural activities and potentially lead to the clearance of native vegetation elsewhere, with associated impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Yet few studies have considered these risks and the ways in which restoration can increase competition for land. Here, we address this issue by examining whether large-scale restoration of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could displace cattle production, as a result of land shortages. Although the risks of displacement are indeed high when reforestation is planned in areas with high cattle productivity, we discuss how these risks can be minimized through a combination of productivity increases, a regional restoration planning framework, and the prioritization of marginal agricultural land for restoration. We also consider how restoration can, in some circumstances, be made more economically sustainable by incorporating income-generating activities such as exploitation of timber and non-timber forest products, certification, and payments for ecosystem services.

AB Elevated ultraviolet (UV) radiation has been demonstrated to stimulate litter decomposition. Despite years of research, it is still not fully understood whether the acceleration in litter degradation is primarily attributed to abiotic photodegradation or the combined effects of abiotic photodegradation and microbial decomposition. In this study, we used meta-analysis to synthesize photodegradation studies and compared the effects of UV radiation on litter decomposition between abiotic and biotic conditions. We also conducted a microcosm experiment to assess the effects of UV radiation on litter biodegradability and microbial activity. Overall, our meta-analysis found that under abiotic photodegradation, UV radiation reduced the remaining litter mass by 1.44% (95% CI: 0.85% to 2.08%), did not affect the remaining lignin and increased the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration by 14.01% (1.49-23.67%). Under combined abiotic photodegradation and microbial decomposition, UV radiation reduced the remaining litter mass and lignin by 1.60% (0.04-3.58%) and 16.07% (9.27-24.23%), respectively, but did not alter DOC concentration. UV radiation had no significant impact on soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), but it reduced microbial respiration by 44.91% (2.26-78.62%) and altered the composition of the microbial community. In addition, UV radiation reduced nitrogen (N) immobilization by 19.44% (4.77-37.92%). Our microcosm experiment further indicated that DOC concentration and the amount of respired C in UV-treated litter increased with UV exposure time, suggesting that longer UV exposure resulted in greater biodegradability. Overall, our study suggested that UV exposure could increase litter biodegradability by increasing the microbial accessibility of lignin, as well as the labile carbon supply to microbes. However, the remaining litter mass was not different between the abiotic and biotic conditions, most likely because the positive effect of UV radiation on litter biodegradability was offset by its negative effect on microbial activity. Our results also suggested that UV radiation could alter the N cycle during decomposition, primarily by inhibiting N immobilization.

AB Global urbanisation is rapidly expanding and most of the world's humans now live in cities. Most ecological studies have, however, focused on protected areas. To address this issue, we tested predictions from studies of protected areas in urban ecosystems. Because most cities are heterogeneous habitat mosaics which include habitats with varying levels of chronic environmental stress, we focused on predictions from studies of less modified ecosystems about community-wide responses to variation in chronic stress. We sampled ants across Manhattan's urban habitat mosaic, at sites with varying levels of chronic environmental stress. Many predictions derived from less modified ecosystems were supported by our findings: despite being the most intensively sampled habitat, high stress urban medians had less variability in ant composition -both within and among sites - than either urban parks or urban forests, the lowest stress habitat - urban forests-had significantly more accumulated species and a higher number of unique species than higher stress habitats, and urban parks, which have intermediate levels of chronic environmental stress, also had intermediate levels of variation in among-site species composition, accumulated species richness, and the incidence of unique species. The most common species also differed across Manhattan's urban habitat mosaic. Nevertheless, the prediction that exotic species would occur more frequently in higher stress habitats was not supported; exotic species were equally common across all habitats. These findings suggest that fine-scale heterogeneity in the chronic stress of urban habitats may be an underappreciated, but important structuring force for urban animal communities.

AB In plant-pollinator networks, the floral morphology of food plants is an important determinant of the interaction niche of pollinators. Studies on foraging preferences of pollinators combining experimental and observational approaches may help to understand the mechanisms behind patterns of interactions and niche partitioning within pollinator communities. In this study, we tested whether morphological floral traits were associated with foraging preferences of hummingbirds for artificial and natural flower types in Costa Rica. We performed field experiments with artificial feeders, differing in length and curvature of flower types, to quantify the hummingbirds' interaction niche under unlimited nectar resources. To quantify the interaction niche under real-world conditions of limited nectar resources, we measured foraging preferences of hummingbirds for a total of 34 plant species. Artificial feeders were visited by Eupherusa nigriventris and Phaethornis guy in the pre-montane forest, and Lampornis calolaemus in the lower montane forest. Under experimental conditions, all three hummingbird species overlapped their interaction niches and showed a preference for the short artificial flower type over the long-straight and the long-curved flower types. Under natural conditions, the two co-occurring hummingbird species preferred to feed on plant species with floral traits corresponding to their bill morphology. The short-billed hummingbird E.nigriventris preferred to feed on short and straight flowers, whereas the long- and curved-billed P.guy preferred long and curved natural flowers. The medium-size billed species L.calolaemus preferred to feed on flowers of medium length and did not show preferences for plant species with specific corolla curvature. Our results show that floral morphological traits constrain access by short-billed hummingbird species to nectar resources. Morphological constraints, therefore, represent one important mechanism structuring trophic networks. In addition, other factors, such as competition and differences in resource quantity or quality, define the interaction niches of consumer species in real-world communities, enforcing patterns of niche segregation between co-occurring consumer species. This suggests that experimental studies are needed to disentangle effects of morphological constraints from those of competition for resources in plant-pollinator interactions and other types of trophic interactions.

Nineteen species are recognized as new records for Singapore. The substantial diversity of Graphidaceae in this reserve suggests that many more taxa are awaiting discovery, even in such a highly urbanized location.

TI Swarms of swift scavengers: ecological role of marine intertidal hermit
   crabs in California

AB While marine hermit crabs are well known for being omnivorous filter feeders, less is known about the role they may play as active carrion scavengers in intertidal ecosystems. Prior studies have revealed that intertidal hermit crabs can be attracted to chemical cues from predated gastropods. Yet their attraction is usually assumed to be driven primarily by the availability of new shells rather than by food. We conducted field experiments to assess hermit crabs' potential role as generalist carrion scavengers on the California Coast, examining their speed of attraction and the size of the aggregations they formed in response to chemical cues from freshly smashed gastropods and mussels, both of which indicated available carrion. Compared to all other marine species, hermit crabs (Pagurus samuelis, P. hirsutiusculus, and P. granosimanus) were the fastest to arrive at the provisioning sites. Hermit crabs also dominated the provisioning sites, accumulating in the largest numbers, with aggregations of up to 20 individuals, which outcompeted all other scavengers for carrion. Notably, hermit crabs arrived equally quickly for both smashed gastropod and mussel, even though the latter does not offer suitable shells for hermit crabs and even though the former only yields shell-related chemical cues over time frames longer than our experiments. These results thus suggest that shell availability is not the only, or even the primary, reason marine intertidal hermit crabs aggregate at carrion sites; they also aggregate to forage, thereby playing an important role as active carrion scavengers in intertidal ecosystems.

AB Phenotypic plasticity is one of the important mechanisms relevant to exotic plant invasions, and high plasticity is likely to influence the potential invasiveness of species. Phenotypic plasticity is broadly defined as the ability of organisms to alter their morphological and/or physiological traits in response to varying environments. Morphological and physiological plasticity are thought to have different mechanisms, resource costs and ecological implications. However, our understanding on how morphological and physiological plasticity contribute to invasiveness is still limited. We explored plant growth, morphological and physiological traits to compare the plasticity in response to variations in light availability in phylogenetically related invasive and non-invasive species from South China. We hypothesized that fast-growing and poorly shade-tolerant invasive species may exhibit higher physiological but not morphological plasticity compared with non-invasive species, prompting their successful invasion with variable light resources. On average, the examined invasive species exhibited a higher biomass accumulation under high light conditions than the non-invasive species. The interaction of light and origin had no significant effect on any of the variables in the morphological traits. However, highly significant effects were found in four of the six variables in the physiological traits: the maximum photosynthesis rate, apparent quantum yield, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and photosynthetic energy use efficiency. In some cases, the invasive species displayed higher physiological but not morphological plasticity than the non-invasive species. However, contrary to the theory, higher overall mean plasticity was not observed in the invasive plants. Our data support the idea that biological invasion is a complicated process and that strong phenotypic plasticity is merely one of the possibilities leading to the successful invasion of exotic plants.

AB The bird pollination systems of the New and Old Worlds evolved independently, and differ in many aspects. New World plants are often presented as those adapted to hovering birds while Old World plants to perching birds. Most Neotropical studies also demonstrate that in hummingbird species rich assemblages, only a small number of highly specialized birds exploits the most specialized plants with long corollas. Nevertheless, recent research on bird-plant pollination interactions suggest that sunbird pollination systems in the Old World have converged more with the highly specialized hummingbird pollination systems than previously thought. In this study we focus on the pollination systems of the bird pollination syndrome Impatiens species on Mt. Cameroon, West Africa. We show that despite the high diversity of sunbirds on Mt. Cameroon, only Cyanomitra oritis appear to be important pollinator of all Impatiens species. This asymmetry indicates the absence of pair wise co-evolution and points to a diffuse co-evolutionary process resulting in guilds of highly specialized plants and birds; a situation well known from hummingbirds and specialized plant communities of the New World. Additionally, the herbaceous habits of Impatiens species, the frequent adaptations to pollination by hovering birds, and the habitat preference for understory in tropical forests or epiphytic growth, resemble the highly specialized Neotropical plants.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 115, 127-133.

AB Large-scale studies are needed to increase our understanding of how large-scale conservation threats, such as climate change and deforestation, are impacting diverse tropical ecosystems. These types of studies rely fundamentally on access to extensive and representative datasets (i.e., "big data"). In this study, I asses the availability of plant species occurrence records through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the distribution of networked vegetation census plots in tropical South America. I analyze how the amount of available data has changed through time and the consequent changes in taxonomic, spatial, habitat, and climatic representativeness. I show that there are large and growing amounts of data available for tropical South America. Specifically, there are almost 2,000,000 unique geo-referenced collection records representing more than 50,000 species of plants in tropical South America and over 1,500 census plots. However, there is still a gaping "data void" such that many species and many habitats remain so poorly represented in either of the databases as to be functionally invisible for most studies. It is important that we support efforts to increase the availability of data, and the representativeness of these data, so that we can better predict and mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances.

AB A new species of the didelphid marsupial genus Monodelphis is described from southeastern Brazil. The new species is closely related to Monodelphis kunsi Pine, 1975, and other members of the M. adusta group, but differs from those species and from other congeneric taxa by unique external and cranial characters and by cytochrome-b and nuclear DNA sequences. Diagnostic morphological characters of the new species include uniformly brownish dorsolateral pelage without distinct stripes or other sharp pigment discontinuities; diminutive eyes and ears; a remarkably long and narrow rostrum; apparent loss of an interparietal ossification; and the presence of diastemata between C1 and P1, P1 and P2, c1 and p1, p1 and p2, and p2 and p3. The new species is known from the Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlantica) of southeastern Brazil, where it occurs sympatrically with four other congeners (M. americana, M. iheringi, M. scalops, M. dimidiata) and seems to be restricted to montane habitats.

AB We estimate the effects on deforestation that have resulted from policy interactions between parks and payments and between park buffers and payments in Costa Rica between 2000 and 2005. We show that the characteristics of the areas where protected and unprotected lands are located differ significantly. Additionally, we find that land characteristics of each of the policies and of the places where they interact also differ significantly. To adequately estimate the effects of the policies and their interactions, we use matching methods. Matching is implemented not only to define adequate control groups, as in previous research, but also to define those groups of locations under the influence of policies that are comparable to each other. We find that it is more effective to locate parks and payments away from each other, rather than in the same location or near each other. The high levels of enforcement inside both parks and lands with payments, and the presence of conservation spillovers that reduce deforestation near parks, significantly reduce the potential impact of combining these two policies.

AB The stable isotopes of carbon were analysed in total wood and cellulose from the tree-rings of the tropical wood species Cariniana micrantha (Ducke). The aim was to examine the isotopic relationship between total wood and its cellulose over the last two and a half centuries. Although the correlation for the whole time period is very high (r = 0.96) it is remarkable that different sub-periods deviate strongly from this close relationship. Consequently, a good correlation from the subset of a longer isotopic record cannot necessarily prove its validity for the whole record. The study indicates that changes of the carbon isotopes of cellulose and of total wood show sometimes during short sub-periods different isotope patterns presumably caused by different environmental effects. Thorough calculations indicate that strong variations within the isotopic record especially changes of the isotopic level along a chronology lead to high correlations between delta C-13(wood) and delta C-13(cel). Contrary thereto subsections with low isotopic variability lead to low correlations. The results imply that long term trends provide similar patterns. Therefore, if long term trends are of interest such as e.g. in climate reconstruction then total wood can be analysed in favour of cellulose, thus saving a tremendous amount of work. However, if short term aspects from a longer record are of interest, cellulose and total wood may sometimes provide different information. In addition it is hypothesized that during intervals of low isotopic variability the proportions of the various wood components may change relative to each other, leading for certain time intervals to different isotope patterns.

AB Flooded rice fields are not only a global food source but also a major biogenic source of atmospheric methane. Using metatranscriptomics, we comparatively explored structural and functional succession of paddy soil microbiomes in the oxic surface layer and anoxic bulk soil. Cyanobacteria, Fungi, Xanthomonadales, Myxococcales, and Methylococcales were the most abundant and metabolically active groups in the oxic zone, while Clostridia, Actinobacteria, Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter, Anaerolineae, and methanogenic archaea dominated the anoxic zone. The protein synthesis potential of these groups was about 75% and 50% of the entire community capacity, respectively. Their structure-function relationships in microbiome succession were revealed by classifying the protein-coding transcripts into core, non-core, and taxon-specific transcripts based on homologous gene distribution. The differential expression of core transcripts between the two microbiomes indicated that structural succession is primarily governed by the cellular ability to adapt to the given oxygen condition, involving oxidative stress, nitrogen/phosphorus metabolism, and fermentation. By contrast, the non-core transcripts were expressed from genes involved in the metabolism of various carbon sources. Among those, taxon-specific transcripts revealed highly specialized roles of the dominant groups in community-wide functioning. For instance, taxon-specific transcripts involved in photosynthesis and methane oxidation were a characteristic of the oxic zone, while those related to methane production and aromatic compound degradation were specific to the anoxic zone. Degradation of organic matters, antibiotics resistance, and secondary metabolite production were detected to be expressed in both the oxic and anoxic zones, but by different taxonomic groups. Cross-feeding of methanol between members of the Methylococcales and Xanthomonadales was suggested by the observation that in the oxic zone, they both exclusively expressed homologous genes encoding methanol dehydrogenase. Our metatranscriptomic analysis suggests that paddy soil microbiomes act as complex, functionally coordinated assemblages whose taxonomic composition is governed by the prevailing habitat factors and their hierarchical importance for community succession.

TI Diversity of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies increases during

   BIODIVERSITY; COEXISTENCE; TRAITS
AB Plant species diversity increases as soil phosphorus availability declines during long-term ecosystem development(1,2). The increase in plant species diversity is associated with a decline in above-ground functional diversity, because leaf traits converge on a high phosphorus-use efficiency strategy on old and infertile soils(3,4). In contrast, the response of below-ground traits that directly influence nutrient acquisition remains poorly understood(3,5); yet it might be key to understanding how soil fertility drives patterns of plant species diversity(1). Here we show a marked increase in the richness and diversity of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies with declining soil phosphorus availability during long-term ecosystem development in a global biodiversity hotspot. Almost all nutrient-acquisition strategies currently known were found in plants from the most infertile soils, despite these being some of the most phosphorus-impoverished soils on Earth. Mycorrhizal plants declined in relative abundance by >30%, although the decline was compensated by an increase in non-mycorrhizal, carboxylate-exuding species that 'mine' phosphorus from the soil using different strategies. Plant species richness within individual nutrient-acquisition strategies also increased dramatically, with the species richness of many strategies more than doubling between the youngest and oldest soils. These results reveal increasing functional diversity of below-ground traits related to nutrient acquisition during ecosystem development, suggesting that no single combination of traits, including those related to nutrient-acquisition strategies, is superior to all others at extremely low soil fertility. Furthermore, the increasing diversity of nutrient-acquisition strategies with declining soil fertility, despite functional convergence of above-ground traits(4,6), suggests that fundamentally different plant community assembly processes operate above-and below-ground.

AB The spatial structure of species richness is often characterized by the species-area relationship (SAR). However, the SAR approach rarely considers the spatial variability of individual plants that arises from species interactions and species' habitat associations. Here, we explored how the interactions of individual plants of target species influence SAR patterns at a range of neighborhood distances. We analyzed the data of 113,988 woody plants of 110 species from the Fushan Forest Dynamics Plot (25 ha), northern Taiwan, which is a subtropical rainforest heavily influenced by typhoons. We classified 34 dominant species into 3 species types (i.e., accumulator, repeller, or no effect) by testing how the individual speciesarea relationship (i.e., statistics describing how neighborhood species richness changes around individuals) of target species departs (i.e., positively, negatively, or with no obvious trend) from a null model that accounts for habitat association. Deviation from the null model suggests that the net effect of species' interactions increases (accumulate) or decreases (repel) neighborhood species richness. We found that (i) accumulators were dominant at small interaction distances (<10-30 m); (ii) the detection of accumulator species was lower at large interaction distances (>30 m); (iii) repellers were rarely detected; and (iv) largesized and abundant species tended to be accumulators. The findings suggest that positive species interactions have the potential to accumulate neighborhood species richness, particularly through size- and density-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesized that the frequently disturbed environment of this subtropical rainforest (e.g., typhoon-driven natural disturbances such as landslides, soil erosion, flooding, and windthrow) might create the spatial heterogeneity of species richness and promote positive species interactions.

AB Rationale: Microbiome studies typically focus on bacteria, but fungal species are Common in many body sites and can have profound effects on the host. Wide gaps exist in the understanding of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) and its relationship to lung disease.
   Objectives: To characterize the mycobiome at different respiratory tract levels in persons with and without HIV infection and in HIV-infected individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Methods: Oral washes (OW), induced sputa (IS), and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected from 56 participants. We performed 18S and internal transcribed spacer sequencing and used the neutral model to identify fungal species that are likely residents of the lung. We used ubiquity ubiquity plots, random forest, logistic regression, and metastats to compare fungal communities by HIV status and presence of COPD.
   Measurements and Main Results: Mycobiomes of OW, IS, and BAL shared common organisms, but each also had distinct members. Candida was dominant in OW and IS, but BAL had 39 fungal species that were disproportionately more abundant than in the OW. Fungal communities in BAL differed significantly by HIV status and by COPD, with Pneumocystis jirovecii significantly overrepresented in both groups. Other fungal species were also identified as differing in HIV and COPD.
   Conclusions: This study systematically examined the respiratory tract mycobiome in a relatively large group. By identifying Pneumocystis and other fungal species as overrepresented in the lung in HIV and in COPD, it is the first to determine alterations in fungal communities associated with lung dysfunction and/or HIV, highlighting the clinical relevance of these findings.

AB Nature conservation relies largely on peoples' rule adherence. However, noncompliance in the conservation context is common: it is one of the largest illegal activities in the world, degrading societies, economies and the environment Understanding and managing compliance is key for ensuring effective conservation, nevertheless crucial concepts and tools are scattered in a wide array of literature. Here I review and integrate these concepts and tools in an effort to guide compliance management in the conservation context. First, I address the understanding of compliance by breaking it down into five key questions: who?, what?, when?, where? and why?. A special focus is given to 'why?' because the answer to this question explains the reasons for compliance and noncompliance, providing critical information for management interventions. Second, I review compliance management strategies, from voluntary compliance to coerced compliance. Finally, I suggest a system, initially proposed for tax compliance, to balance these multiple compliance management strategies. This paper differs from others by providing a broad yet practical scope on theory and tools for understanding and managing compliance in the nature conservation context (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We have little knowledge of how climatic variation (and by proxy, habitat variation) influences the phylogenetic structure of tropical communities. Here, we quantified the phylogenetic structure of mammal communities in Africa to investigate how community structure varies with respect to climate and species richness variation across the continent. In addition, we investigated how phylogenetic patterns vary across carnivores, primates, and ungulates. We predicted that climate would differentially affect the structure of communities from different clades due to between-clade biological variation. We examined 203 communities using two metrics, the net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon (NTI) indices. We used simultaneous autoregressive models to predict community phylogenetic structure from climate variables and species richness. We found that most individual communities exhibited a phylogenetic structure consistent with a null model, but both climate and species richness significantly predicted variation in community phylogenetic metrics. Using NTI, species rich communities were composed of more distantly related taxa for all mammal communities, as well as for communities of carnivorans or ungulates. Temperature seasonality predicted the phylogenetic structure of mammal, carnivoran, and ungulate communities, and annual rainfall predicted primate community structure. Additional climate variables related to temperature and rainfall also predicted the phylogenetic structure of ungulate communities. We suggest that both past interspecific competition and habitat filtering have shaped variation in tropical mammal communities. The significant effect of climatic factors on community structure has important implications for the diversity of mammal communities given current models of future climate change.

AB Ecosystem services are strongly influenced by the landscape configuration of natural and human systems. So they are heterogeneous across landscapes. However lack of the knowledge of spatial variations of ecosystem services constrains the effective management and conservation of ecosystems. We presented a spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of the geographic variations in ecosystem services for the Fuzhou City in 2009 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and semivariance analysis. Results confirmed a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation, and revealed several hot-spots and cold-spots for the spatial distribution of ecosystem service intensity (ESI) in the study area Also the trend surface analysis indicated that the level of ESI tended to be reduced gradually from north to south and from west to east, with a trough in the urban central area, which was quite in accordance with land-use structure. A more precise cluster map was then developed using the range of lag distance, deriving from semivariance analysis, as neighborhood size instead of default value in the software of ESRI ArcGIS 10.0, and geographical clusters where population growth and land-use pressure varied significantly and positively with ESI across the city were also created by geographically weighted regression (GWR). This study has good policy implications applicable to prioritize areas for conservation or construction, and design ecological corridor to improve ecosystem service delivery to benefiting areas.

TI Tropical Rain Forest Structure, Tree Growth and Dynamics along a 2700-m
   Elevational Transect in Costa Rica
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MOUNT-KINABALU; RANGE SHIFTS; BIOMASS; CLIMATE; GRADIENTS; MORTALITY
AB Rapid biological changes are expected to occur on tropical elevational gradients as species migrate upslope or go extinct in the face of global warming. We established a series of 9 1-ha plots in old-growth tropical rainforest in Costa Rica along a 2700 m relief elevational gradient to carry out long-term monitoring of tropical rain forest structure, dynamics and tree growth. Within each plot we mapped, identified, and annually measured diameter for all woody individuals with stem diameters >10 cm for periods of 3-10 years. Wood species diversity peaked at 400-600 m and decreased substantially at higher elevations. Basal area and stem number varied by less than two-fold, with the exception of the 2800 m cloud forest summit, where basal area and stem number were approximately double that of lower sites. Canopy gaps extending to the forest floor accounted for <3% of microsites at all elevations. Height of highest crowns and the coefficient of variation of crown height both decreased with increasing elevation. Rates of turnover of individuals and of stand basal area decreased with elevation, but rates of diameter growth and stand basal area showed no simple relation to elevation. We discuss issues encountered in the design and implementation of this network of plots, including biased sampling, missing key meteorological and biomass data, and strategies for improving species-level research. Taking full advantage of the major research potential of tropical forest elevational transects will require sustaining and extending ground based studies, incorporation of new remotely-sensed data and data-acquisition platforms, and new funding models to support decadal research on these rapidly-changing systems.

TI Detection of Mitochondrial COII DNA Sequences in Ant Guts as a Method

AB Termites and ants contribute more to animal biomass in tropical rain forests than any other single group and perform vital ecosystem functions. Although ants prey on termites, at the community level the linkage between these groups is poorly understood. Thus, assessing the distribution and specificity of ant termitophagy is of considerable interest. We describe an approach for quantifying ant-termite food webs by sequencing termite DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, COII) from ant guts and apply this to a soil-dwelling ant community from tropical rain forest in Gabon. We extracted DNA from 215 ants from 15 species. Of these, 17.2 % of individuals had termite DNA in their guts, with BLAST analysis confirming the identity of 34.1 % of these termites to family level or better. Although ant species varied in detection of termite DNA, ranging from 63% (5/7; Camponotus sp. 1) to 0% (0/7; Ponera sp. 1), there was no evidence (with small sample sizes) for heterogeneity in termite consumption across ant taxa, and no evidence for species-specific ant-termite predation. In all three ant species with identifiable termite DNA in multiple individuals, multiple termite species were represented. Furthermore, the two termite species that were detected on multiple occasions in ant guts were in both cases found in multiple ant species, suggesting that anttermite food webs are not strongly compartmentalised. However, two ant species were found to consume only Anoplotermes-group termites, indicating possible predatory specialisation at a higher taxonomic level. Using a laboratory feeding test, we were able to detect termite COII sequences in ant guts up to 2 h after feeding, indicating that our method only detects recent feeding events. Our data provide tentative support for the hypothesis that unspecialised termite predation by ants is widespread and highlight the use of molecular approaches for future studies of ant-termite food webs.

AB Introduced species can establish self-replacing populations in introduction sites despite climatic differences between these sites and the native range. Schizolobium parahyba (Fabaceae) is a fast-growing tree from the Atlantic Forest in Brazil and is invasive in semideciduous forests. We studied the allometry and population structure of S. parahyba within its native and invaded ranges. We expected to find differences in allometric relationships and ontogenetic stage sizes between forest types. We measured individuals within native and invaded ranges and analysed height : diameter allometry using standardised major axis regression. We used the chi-squared test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance to compare the frequencies of individuals of each ontogenetic stage between native and invasive populations. We found that allometry differed between forest types for seedlings, but only marginally for adults. The population structure differed between ranges and suggests active recruitment of juvenile and subadult plants in invaded sites, where the species is naturalising.

AB Predatory traces, in which the tracemaker has damaged the prey animal's skeleton to kill and consume it, have a deep fossil history and have received much scientific attention. Several types of predatory traces have been assigned to ichnotaxa, but one of the most studied predatory traces, the wedge-shaped excision produced as a result of attacks mainly by crustaceans on the apertures of gastropod shells, has yet to be described as an ichnotaxon. We propose the ichnogenus Caedichnus to describe the shell damage produced by aperture peeling behavior. Caedichnus is produced by predators that are unable to crush their prey's shells outright. Depending on the predator's peeling ability and the prey's withdrawal depth within the shell, the trace can extend through several whorls of the shell. Aperture peel attacks may fail, allowing such damage to be repaired by surviving gastropods. Thus, the types of attacks that produce Caedichnus may exert selective pressure on prey to evolve better-defended shells (in the case of gastropods) or to inhabit better-defended shells (in the case of hermit crabs). The identification of these trace fossils will enhance our understanding of how predation influences the morphological, and even behavioral, evolution of prey organisms.

AB The objective of this paper is to investigate the current and potential future impacts of climate change on tourism resources and tourism activities in Mu Ko Surin National Park. The research method for this paper involved the collection of information from interviews with key informants, non-participant observation, and secondary data. The results found that the park has experienced changes in climate, including increasing temperatures, changes in precipitation, rising sea surface temperature, and sea-level rise. The impact of increasing temperature can lead to mass coral bleaching. The beach was shown to have eroded at a rate of about 0.38 m per year. However, water resources are still sufficient for tourism activities. The impacts of climate change have led to coral reefs and fish being less attractive and reduced in quantity, some snorkeling and diving sites being closed. Therefore, for sustainable tourism management, adaptation action should take place in this area.

AB Current intensification of agricultural activities in Indonesia has led to increased use of tropical peat swamp forests for agriculture. Ideally, peat swamp ecosystems should not be disturbed as they provide essential services such as soil erosion control, ecosystem stabilization and moderation of climate and energy fluxes as well as reducing carbon emission and conserving biodiversity. In this study, agricultural land from Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu Biosphere Reserve in Indonesia was evaluated to assess the impact of oil palm (burning and without burning) and rubber (5-10 and >40 years old) plantations on soil properties through comparisons with soils from a natural forest (NF). Substantial changes in the physico-chemical properties of soils from both plantations were observed including significant reductions in soil organic matter (4-18%) and water holding capacity (22-53%), but an increase in bulk density (rho b) (0.08-0.17 g cm(-3)). A significant increase in bacterial biomass was also observed following conversion of the NF to plantation (p<0.05). However, the oil palm plantation (OPP) (without burning) showed reduced microbial activities and the lowest Shannon diversity values (2.90) compared to other samples. Community-level physiological profiling showed impaired community function only in soils from the OPP but higher CO2 exchange rates in most plantation soils. Soils from the rubber plantation (RP) were less impaired in terms of their natural function and therefore RPs appeared to be more suitable for sustainable agricultural use than OPP.

AB In tropical forests light and water availability are the most important factors for seedling growth and survival but an increasing frequency of drought may affect tree regeneration. One central question is whether drought and shade have interactive effects on seedling growth and survival. Here, we present results of a greenhouse experiment, in which seedlings of 10 Ghanaian tree species were exposed to combinations of strong seasonal drought (continuous watering versus withholding water for nine weeks) and shade (5% irradiance versus 20% irradiance). We evaluated the effects of drought and shade on seedling survival and growth and plasticity of 11 underlying traits related to biomass allocation, morphology and physiology. Seedling survival under dry conditions was higher in shade than in high light, thus providing support for the "facilitation hypothesis" that shade enhances plant performance through improved microclimatic conditions, and rejecting the trade-off hypothesis that drought should have stronger impact in shade because of reduced root investment. Shaded plants had low biomass fraction in roots, in line with the trade-off hypothesis, but they compensated for this with a higher specific root length (i.e., root length per unit root mass), resulting in a similar root length per plant mass and, hence, similar water uptake capacity as high-light plants. The majority (60%) of traits studied responded independently to drought and shade, indicating that within species shade-and drought tolerances are not in trade-off, but largely uncoupled. When individual species responses were analysed, then for most of the traits only one to three species showed significant interactive effects between drought and shade. The uncoupled response of most species to drought and shade should provide ample opportunity for niche differentiation and species coexistence under a range of water and light conditions. Overall our greenhouse results suggest that, in the absence of root competition shaded tropical forest tree seedlings may be able to survive prolonged drought.

AB The mobility of butterflies determines their ability to find host plant species, and thus their potential host plant range, as well as their ability to maintain meta-populations in fragmented habitats. While butterfly movement has been extensively studied for temperate species, very little is known for tropical forest species. A mark-release-recapture study of the three most common butterfly species in the understory of a lowland primary rainforest in Papua New Guinea included 3,705, 394 and 317 marked individuals of Danis danis, Taenaris sp. and Parthenos aspila respectively, with 1,031, 78 and 40 butterfly individuals recaptured at least once. Over a period of 6 weeks there were almost 22,000 individuals belonging to these three species hatching within or entering our four study plots totaling 14.58 ha in area. The most abundant species, D. danis, with 20,000 individuals, showed highly variable population densities during the study. The residency time in the studied plots was highest for P. aspila (84 days), as individual butterflies stayed mostly in a single gap; we estimated that less than 1 % of individuals disperse 1 km or more. Similar movement probability was found in D. danis whilst in Taenaris sp., 10 % of the population disperses a parts per thousand yen1 km. Movement distances of D. danis were more than sufficient to locate its host plant, Derris elliptica, which occurred in 61 % of the 20 x 20 m subplots within a 50 ha plot. Compared with temperate species, our three species have much longer life spans, but their movement patterns remain within the known mobility estimates of temperate species. The mobility of D. danis is close to the average for temperate Lycaenidae, while Taenaris sp. is more mobile and P. aspila less mobile than the mean for all temperate species.

AB This article offers a reflection on the question of the image in science, thinking about how visual practices contribute towards the construction of knowledge and territories. The growing centrality of the visual in current scientific practices shows the need for reflection that goes beyond the image. The object of discussion will be the scientific images used in the monitoring and visualization of territory. The article looks into the relations between visuality and a number of other factors: the researchers that construct it; the infrastructure involved in the construction; and the institutions and policies that monitor the territory. It is argued that such image-relations do not just visualize but help to construct the territory based on specific forms. Exploring this process makes it possible to develop a more complex understanding of the forms through which sciences and technology help to construct realities.

AB The characteristics of the multiple bands of Haloxylon ammodendron (C.A. Mey) Bunge tree-ring were studied in three edaphic types. Age equations were derived relating ground diameter and tree height, and the effects of irrigation on numbers and widths of growth bands at the longest radius were analyzed. Results showed that the number of growth bands ranged from 3.3 to 6.3 per year, the widths ranged between 0.181 mm and 0.473 mm. Multiple growth bands formed every growing season, leading to the conclusion that multiple growth bands in H. ammodendron tree-ring are a natural feature. A dark brown layer and a light brown one make up one growth band. The dark brown layers consists of fibres and vessels as well as some ray parenchyma, and each fibres layers with 22-35 cell layers; the light brown layers formed by vessels, fibres and abundant paratracheal axial parenchyma are 4-15 cell layers. The widths of growth bands at the longest radius increased significantly as the irrigation amount increased in three edaphic types (p<0.01). The numbers of growth bands at the longest radius had significant positive correlation with irrigation times. The ratio of dark brown layers to light brown layers of growth bands at the longest radius appeared to have a rising tendency with the increase in irrigation amount and times.

AB The effect of seed mass of Acacia ehrenbergiana Hayne on seedling growth and gas exchange activity under glass house conditions was investigated. Seeds were collected from three locations (Al Madinah (24 degrees 89'N, 39 degrees 16'E), Aseer (17 degrees 55' N, 42 degrees 11' E) and Baha (19 degrees 13' N, 41 degrees 80'E) in Saudi Arabia. The seeds were categorized into large, medium and small on the basis of the seed mass. Seeds were sown in potted soil (sand, clay and peat moss, 2:2:1 v/v) for six months. Seedling growth parameters and gas exchange were measured. Seedlings emerged from large seeds exhibited significantly faster growth in terms of shoot and root length and more dry weight, higher RGR (relative growth rate) and greater net photosynthetic and transpiration rates and stomatal conductance than those emerged from medium and small seeds. Leaf number also increased with seed mass but inconsistently.

AB Many plants interact with scatterhoarding animals as mutualists (seed dispersers) and antagonists (seed predators) simultaneously, but the net effects of scatterhoarding animals are rarely measured. In seed-dispersal mutualisms, plant benefits (recruitment) received from dispersal agents should outweigh the costs, resulting in a relative fitness gain. Otherwise, plant populations cannot be sustained and would go extinct. Here we present a framework to quantify costs and benefits of scatterhoarding for animal-dispersed plants and propose three models with the three separate scales (seed, tree and population) to quantify the costs and benefits for plants from scatterhoarding rodents. Since scatterhoarding is an adaptive dispersal strategy for many large-seeded plants, tree- and population-based models are needed to determine the costs and benefits for the plants. In the models presented here, all relevant parameters can be measured by regular surveys. Our tree- and population-based models can be extended to seed plants that have dispersal agents other than scatter hoarding rodents.

AB Fire is a major form of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems, mainly in tropical savannas. In these ecosystems, the effects of large wildfires are potentially high on small and relatively less mobile animals, like small mammals. We investigated the effects of an extensive wildfire (approximate to 6,240 ha) in September 2011 on populations of 2 arboreal-scansorial small mammals-the gracile mouse opossum, Gracilinanus agilis, and the long-tailed climbing mouse, Rhipidomys macrurus-in 4 savanna woodland patches (1 burned, 3 unburned) of the highly threatened Brazilian Cerrado. We assessed population densities from 2009 to 2013 and for G. agilis, we estimated apparent survival and recapture probabilities with Cormack-Jolly-Seber models. Both species showed strong, negative fire responses, including sudden collapse and slow recovery (at least more than 1 year). These observed responses were probably a consequence of both the phytophysiognomic features of the habitat and severity of the fire with the resulting changes on the vertical structure of vegetation. The studied species of Cerrado forested formations were not as resilient to fire disturbance as typical species from savanna or temperate woodlands. As a consequence of human activities and climate changes, fire events are predicted to become larger and more frequent in the Brazilian Cerrado. Therefore, it is imperative to create new management strategies to protect forested physiognomies from fire, especially cerradao, which is very fire sensitive and has a limited and scattered distribution in the landscape.

AB Forest regeneration may reduce the current loss of species due to tropical deforestation, but little is known about the extent and inter-specific variability of this effect. We compared the probability with which nine parrot species use old-growth and secondary forests in a similar to 400 km(2) Amazonian landscape, while considering two types of habitat use: perching and flyover use. Perching use, when individuals stop at a sampling site, implies resting, foraging, or breeding activities; flyover merely implies that parrots fly through, above the canopy at a site. We established 155 sampling sites spanning old growth and approximately 30-year-old secondary forest, and sampled them repeatedly using autonomous audio recorders. Perching and flyover use were distinguished based on the temporal variation of intensity in parrot vocalization sonograms. We modeled our data with a set of species-specific, multi-state occupancy models that estimate the probability of each type of use for both habitats while accounting for imperfect species detection. Models were fit in a maximum likelihood framework and ranked according to the Akaike information criterion. All but one species fly over both habitats with the same probability, while seven out of nine show a higher probability of perching in old growth than in secondary forest. Interspecific variation in response to habitat change was not explained by variation in body mass or relative brain size. After three decades of forest regeneration in our study area, there are still measurable differences in habitat use, with a broad tendency for parrots to favor old growth over secondary forest.

AB Species differ in their need for conservation action and in their relative importance for conserving current and historic ecological and evolutionary diversity. Given the present biodiversity crisis and the lack of resources, threatened species must be differentiated from each other so that those presenting higher conservation priority can be attended first. Here we propose a novel approach to calculate a priority index (PI) for species within monophyletic groups, by combining life history traits, extrinsic factors, ecological singularity, and phylogenetic distinctness. To test our approach we used a group of Neotropical snakes, the pseudoboines, as our model lineage. To create the PI we combined four different indices: intrinsic vulnerability to extinction (IVE, comprised by six factors), extrinsic vulnerability to extinction (EVE, comprised by three factors), ecological oddity (EO, four factors) and phylogenetic distinctness (PD). Intrinsic vulnerability to extinction was evenly distributed across the clade and EVE was higher in species present in the Brazilian hotspots of Biodiversity, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. As expected due to the nature of the index, a few species that differ from the average phenotype presented high EO values, whereas PD values did not vary greatly among pseudoboines. Representatives from almost all clades within the pseudoboines appear among the ten highest PI values, maximizing the phylogenetic diversity of the prioritized taxa. Although it is not possible to compare values obtained in studies to different lineages (indices are clade-specific), extending this approach to more inclusive lineages (e.g., families) might enhance the quality of future prioritization processes. The method we propose would be especially useful for taxonomically driven conservation action plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Agroforestry systems are widely recognized as an important way to address numerous environmental challenges in tropical areas. They represent a sustainable alternative form of land-use for small-scale agriculture, responding to the economic development needs of communities and offering a number of ecosystem services. This article presents an evaluation of the short- and medium-term profitability of two experimental agroforestry systems where fruit trees are predominant, which were established in 2009 in the Tapajos region of the Brazilian Amazon, state of Para. An analysis of net present value (NPV) confirms that the two experimental systems studied recover their total implementation and operating costs within a 20 years time horizon. These results underlie that prices of inputs are stable and farmers have access to markets, credit, and agricultural knowledge. The two experimental systems are compared to plots under traditional slash- and-burn cultivation, and Bragantino system. The results support changes to public policies in order to facilitate alternatives to slash- and-burn cultivation by supporting access to credit, knowledge of alternative agricultural practices, transportation systems, and industries that transform agricultural products. The consideration of ecosystem services should add a supplementary argument in favour of policies that promote agroforestry systems and thus limit the practice of slash- and-burn subsistence agriculture.

AB Species persistence in human-altered landscapes can depend on factors operating at multiple spatial scales. To understand anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, it is useful to examine relationships between species traits and their responses to land-use change. A key knowledge gap concerns whether these relationships vary depending on the scale of response under consideration. We examined how local- and large-scale habitat variables influence the occupancy dynamics of a bird community in cloud forest zones in the Colombian Choco-Andes. Using data collected across a continuum of forest and agriculture, we examined which traits best predict species responses to local variation in farmland and which traits best predict species responses to isolation from contiguous forest. Global range size was a strong predictor of species responses to agriculture at both scales; widespread species were less likely to decline as local habitat cover decreased and as distance from forest increased. Habitat specialization was a strong predictor of species responses only at the local scale. Open-habitat species were particularly likely to increase as pasture increased, but they were relatively insensitive to variation in distance to forest. Foraging plasticity and flocking behavior were strong predictors of species responses to distance from forest, but not their responses to local habitat. Species with lower plasticity in foraging behaviors and obligate flock-following species were more likely to decline as distance from contiguous forest increased. For species exhibiting these latter traits, persistence in tropical landscapes may depend on the protection of larger contiguous blocks of forest, rather than the integration of smaller-scale woodland areas within farmland. Species listed as threatened or near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List were also more likely to decline in response to both local habitat quality and isolation from forest relative to least-concern species, underlining the importance of contiguous forests for threatened taxa.

AB The American lobster, Homarus americanus, is an important benthic consumer in the Gulf of Maine and supports an extremely valuable fishery in New England and eastern Canada. Meanwhile, there is substantial interest in restoring large predator fish species to the Gulf of Maine, and these predators may impact lobster populations both by consuming them and by inducing them to alter their behavior. Lobster tethering experiments were used to examine the susceptibility of a range of lobster size classes to predation in Saco Bay, Maine. The most susceptible sizes of lobsters were then exposed to three different fish predators (Atlantic striped bass Morone saxatilis, Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, and sea raven Hemitripterus americanus) separately in experimental mesocosm tanks. Juvenile lobsters moved less and spent more time in shelter when in the presence of cod or sea raven. By contrast, striped bass did not induce lobsters to alter their behavior. Striped bass are highly mobile, active pursuit predators, which are thought to induce weaker behavioral responses in prey than sit-and-pursue predators like sea ravens. Thus, differences in lobster sheltering behavior corresponded with differences in predator foraging behavior. These predator-induced changes in behavior can result in less foraging activity, which may translate into reduced lobster growth and reproduction. Efforts to model marine communities and ecosystems will benefit from a more holistic understanding of whether predators induced prey to modify their foraging behavior and habitat usage.

AB Key message Analyses of tree-ring anatomical features showed to be more sensitive to specific intra-seasonal environmental factors than tree-ring width in Tectona grandis and Pinus caribaea growing in a subtropical region.
   Abstract Earlywood vessels (EWV) and intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in tree rings are influenced by intra-seasonal environmental factors, as have mostly been studied in temperate climate areas. However, it is not clear whether such anatomical traits can also be used as climate proxies in tropical regions. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to analyse the relationship between the anatomical features of two tropical species growing in Piracicaba, State of Sao Paulo, Southeast Brazil-EWV in Tectona grandis and IADFs in Pinus caribaea- and the climate. Wood cores were extracted by increment borer and processed using the classical methodology of dendrochronology. Chronologies of the mean vessel cross-sectional area of the first row of each tree ring (FRV) and the entire earlywood (EWV) in T. grandis, and of IADF in earlywood (IADF-E) and latewood (IADF-L) in P. caribaea were developed for the period 1988-2011 and 1982-2011, respectively. Our results showed a significant correlation of EWV and FRV with mean accumulated precipitation during the summer season (DJF) and with mean temperature in December. The IADF-Es in P. caribaea were related to the precipitation of DJF as well as the temperature of April, whereas IADF-Ls were linked to precipitation in fall (MAM). In general, the tree-ring anatomical variables were more influenced by intra-seasonal environmental factors than tree-ring width in both species, indicating their great potential for dendroecological studies in subtropical regions.

AB Litter decomposition is a key biogeochemical process that strongly affects carbon and nutrient cycling. Our understanding of the controls over decomposition in arid and semi-arid systems is currently limited by a lack of capability to measure or predict litter moisture. Despite its potential importance in controlling litter decomposition, litter moisture has rarely been continuously monitored due to the technical constraints in doing so. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using inexpensive, commercially available relative humidity (RH) loggers (iButtons) to continuously estimate the litter moisture. We incubated two types of litter (conifer and broadleaf) in microcosms and tested RH-litter moisture relationships during a series of dry-down events. The results showed that we could successfully predict litter gravimetric moisture using iButton RH measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FLORISTIC ELEMENTS; PATTERNS; IMPROVE; ZONES
AB Terms such as element, chorotype and component are widely used to indicate biogeographical units. As a result of variation in approaches and methodologies, these terms do not have a single definitive meaning, and similar concepts have been defined under different labels. As originally defined, element denotes a group of species that occur in previously defined biogeographical areas, while chorotype denotes a group of species with a similar distribution. The term component is widely used in ecology to denote the biotic or abiotic constituent of an ecosystem; within biogeography it has typically been used as a synonym for element. Applying the original meanings, current usage within the tradition of systematic biogeography should regard element as referring to groups of taxa defined according to the biogeographical areas they occupy. Within quantitative and evolutionary biogeography, chorotype should be used to define patterns of distribution that can be used to generate hypotheses about their causes and origins. In this paper I argue that component expresses a generic concept rather than a chorological category and should be avoided in biogeography.

AB AimForest fragmentation is often accompanied by an increase in hunting intensity. Both factors are known drivers of species extirpations, but understanding of their independent effects is poor. Our goal was to partition the effects of hunting and fragmentation on bird species extirpations and to identify bird traits that make species more vulnerable to these two stressors.
   LocationMenglun, Yunnan, SW China
   MethodsWe studied the landscape within 10km radius of Menglun town, where forests have become highly fragmented by monoculture rubber plantations. We compiled data on birds recorded between 1954 and 1983 before forest loss and compared it with a checklist prepared between 2011 and 2014. We used countryside and matrix-calibrated species-area models (SAMs) to estimate the observed slope of forest bird extirpations in Menglun and compared it with the slope expected in the absence of hunting. We also investigated six ecological traits to determine those that best explained bird extirpation probability (EP).
   ResultsWe found that 34% of the bird fauna had been extirpated from the study landscape, and the estimated slopes of countryside and matrix-calibrated SAMs for forest birds were around 1.4 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than the 0.35 expected without hunting. Bird EP was strongly associated with size, and understorey insectivores that are known to be susceptible to fragmentation were less susceptible to hunting than frugivores. Given evidence of past and present hunting activity in the area, and the lack of support for alternative explanations, we suggest that hunting increased forest bird extirpations by around 1.3- to 1.6-fold.
   ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of using species-area relationships to separate area effects from the impacts of hunting. Our results suggest that hunting substantially increases species extirpations in tropical fragmented landscapes and conservation interventions that only target deforestation will therefore be inadequate.

AB Simplification of natural habitats has become a major conservation challenge and there is a growing consensus that incorporating and enhancing habitat complexity is likely to be critical for future restoration efforts. Habitat complexity is often ascribed an important role in controlling species diversity, however, despite numerous empirical studies the exact mechanism(s) driving this association remains unclear. The lack of progress in untangling the relationship between complexity and diversity is partly attributable to the considerable ambiguity in the use of the term 'complexity'. Here, we offer a new framework for conceptualizing ecological complexity, an essential prerequisite for the development of analytical methods for creating and comparing habitat complexity. Our framework distinguishes between two fundamental forms of complexity: information-based complexity and systems-based complexity. Most complexity-diversity studies are concerned with informational complexity which can be measured in the field through a variety of metrics (e.g. fractal dimensions, rugosity, etc.), but these metrics cannot be used to re-construct three-dimensional complex habitats. Drawing on our operational definition of informational complexity, it is possible to design habitats with different degrees of physical complexity. We argue that the ability to determine or modify the variables of complexity precisely has the potential to open up new lines of research in diversity theory and contribute to restoration and reconciliation by enabling environmental managers to rebuild complexity in anthropogenically-simplified habitats.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; CONSERVATION; ECONOMICS; WORLDS
AB Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is commonly defined as a market based environmental policy instrument to efficiently achieve ecosystem services provision. However, an increasing body of literature shows that this prescriptive conceptualization of PES cannot be easily generalized and implemented in practice, and that the commodification of ecosystem services (ES) is problematic and may lead to unfair situations for relevant PES actors. This paper synthesizes case studies in Indonesia, the Philippines and Nepal to provide empirical observations on emerging PES mechanisms in Asia. Lessons learned show that fairness and efficiency objectives must be achieved simultaneously in designing and implementing a sustainable PES scheme, especially in developing country contexts. Neither fairness nor efficiency is a primary aim but an intermediate 'fairly efficient and efficiently fair' PES may bridge the gap between PES theory and practice to increase sustainable ES provision and improve livelihoods.

AB Local government planning agencies play an important role in conserving biodiversity in human-altered landscapes. Such agencies frequently have a limited knowledge of wildlife biology and few resources to carry out research, and therefore require simple, practical guidelines for biodiversity conservation. We propose a landscape design framework for biodiversity conservation that is sequential, prescriptive, and supported by current landscape ecological science. Unlike existing guidelines, our framework can be implemented in any given landscape using only land cover data and it explicitly considers constraints on land use planning. The steps of our framework, in the order in which they should be implemented are: (1) select land cover data and decide which land cover classes constitute unaltered or altered land covers; (2) list the constraints on land use planning (e.g., economic, social) that exist for the landscape; (3) maximize the total amount and diversity of unaltered land cover, especially near water; (4) minimize human disturbance within altered land cover, especially near water; and (5) aggregate altered land covers associated with high-intensity land uses, especially away from water. We illustrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a hypothetical landscape and comparing the outcome to those from the application of traditional ecological guidelines to inform land use planning.

Despite large differences, these ecosystems share an important characteristic: their soils are strongly weathered and phosphorus (P) is a key growth-limiting nutrient. Soil-borne pathogens are increasingly being recognized as drivers of plant diversity in lowland tropical rainforests, but have received little attention in species-rich shrublands. We suggest a trade-off in which the species most proficient at acquiring P have ephemeral roots that are particularly susceptible to soil-borne pathogens. This could equalize out the differences in competitive ability among co-occurring species in these ecosystems, thus contributing to coexistence. Moreover, effective protection against soil-borne pathogens by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi might explain the occurrence of monodominant stands of ECM trees and shrubs amongst otherwise species-rich communities. We identify gaps in our knowledge which need to be filled in order to evaluate a possible link between P limitation, fine root traits, soil-borne pathogens and local plant species diversity. Such a link may help to explain how numerous plant species can coexist in hyperdiverse rainforests and shrublands, and, conversely, how monodominant stands can develop in these ecosystems.

AB Tropical forests are important in worldwide carbon (C) storage and sequestration. C sequestration of these forests may especially be determined by the growth of canopy trees. However, the factors driving variation in growth among such large individuals remain largely unclear. We evaluate how crown traits [total leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen (N) concentration] and stem traits [sapwood area (SA) and sapwood N concentration] measured for individual trees affect absolute biomass growth for 43 tropical canopy trees belonging to four species, in a moist forest in Bolivia. Biomass growth varied strongly among trees, between 17.3 and 367.3 kg year(-1), with an average of 105.4 kg year(-1). We found that variation in biomass growth was chiefly explained by a positive effect of SA, and not by tree size or other traits examined. SA itself was positively associated with sapwood growth, sapwood lifespan and basal area. We speculate that SA positively affects the growth of individual trees mainly by increasing water storage, thus securing water supply to the crown. These positive roles of sapwood on growth apparently offset the increased respiration costs incurred by more sapwood. This is one of the first individual-based studies to show that variation in sapwood traits-and not crown traits-explains variation in growth among tropical canopy trees. Accurate predictions of C dynamics in tropical forests require similar studies on biomass growth of individual trees as well as studies evaluating the dual effect of sapwood (water provision vs. respiratory costs) on tropical tree growth.

AB Burnings, which cause major changes to the environment, can be effectively monitored via satellite data, regarding both the identification of active fires and the estimation of burned areas. Among the many orbital sensors suitable for mapping burned areas on global and regional scales, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), on board the Terra and Aqua platforms, has been the most widely utilized. In this study, the performance of the MODIS MCD45A1 burned area product was thoroughly evaluated in the Brazilian savanna, the second largest biome in South America and a global biodiversity hotspot, characterized by a conspicuous climatic seasonality and the systematic occurrence of natural and anthropogenic fires. Overall, September MCD45A1 polygons (2000-2012) compared well to the Landsat-based reference mapping (r(2) = 0.92) and were closely accompanied, on a monthly basis, by MOD14 and MYD14 hotspots (r(2) = 0.89), although large omissions errors, linked to landscape patterns, structures, and overall conditions depicted in each reference image, were observed. In spite of its spatial and temporal limitations, the MCD45A1 product proved instrumental for mapping and understanding fire behavior and impacts on the Cerrado landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Coastal habitats are exposed to increasing human and natural disturbances, including extraction of organisms and extreme climatic events. Patterns of recovery (i.e. convergence towards an unmanipulated control) of the structure of benthic assemblages, the total number, and the abundance of individual taxa were examined over a period of 15 mo after the end of a previous experiment. In that experiment, crossed manipulations of levels of mussel harvesting and of the temporal patterns of storm-related mechanical disturbance (in terms of changes in variance but not in the overall intensity) were performed on north Portugal rocky shores. Effects of past disturbances were mostly detected at 3 and 9 mo after the end of disturbances, while no significant differences between unmanipulated and treated assemblages were present after 15 mo. These findings confirm that intertidal assemblages subjected to even extreme combinations of past disturbances can recover in a relatively short time. Important effects present after 3 to 9 mo were associated with the timing of disturbance, likely depending on interactions with life-history traits such as peaks in reproduction and recruitment. Contrary to theories considering disturbances as opportunities for some organisms to replace competitors that dominate space in undisturbed conditions, we observed changes in the abundances of the same taxa rather than their replacement. The present evidence contributes to the understanding of how multiple anthropogenic pressures affect the ability of intertidal assemblages to recover after disturbance.

AB In studies of ant-plant mutualisms, the role that ants play in increasing the growth rates of their plant partners is potentially a key beneficial service. In the field, we measured the growth of Cecropia glaziovii saplings and compared individuals that were naturally colonized by Azteca muelleri ants with uncolonized plants in different seasons (wet and dry). We also measured light availability as well as attributes that could be influenced by the presence of Azteca colonies, such as herbivory, leaf nutrients (total nitrogen and delta N-15), and investments in defense (total phenolics and leaf mass per area). We found that colonized plants grew faster than uncolonized plants and experienced a lower level of herbivory in both the wet and dry seasons. Colonized plants had higher nitrogen content than uncolonized plants, although the d15N, light environment, total phenolics and leaf mass per area, did not differ between colonized and uncolonized plants. Since colonized and uncolonized plants did not differ in the direct defenses that we evaluated, yet herbivory was lower in colonized plants, we conclude that biotic defenses were the most effective protection against herbivores in our system. This result supports the hypothesis that protection provided by ants is an important factor promoting plant growth. Since C. glaziovii is widely distributed among a variety of forests and ecotones, and since we demonstrated a strong relationship with their ant partners, this system can be useful for comparative studies of ant-plant interactions in different habitats. Also, given this study was carried out near the transition to the subtropics, these results help generalize the geographic distribution of this mutualism and may shed light on the persistence of the interactions in the face of climate change.

AB We assess the additional forest cover protected by 13 rural communities located in the southern state of Chiapas, Mexico, as a result of the economic incentives received through the country's national program of payments for biodiversity conservation. We use spatially explicit data at the intra-community level to define a credible counterfactual of conservation outcomes. We use covariate-matching specifications associated with spatially explicit variables and difference-in-difference estimators to determine the treatment effect. We estimate that the additional conservation represents between 12 and 14.7 percent of forest area enrolled in the program in comparison to control areas. Despite this high degree of additionality, we also observe lack of compliance in some plots participating in the PES program. This lack of compliance casts doubt on the ability of payments alone to guarantee long-term additionality in context of high deforestation rates, even with an augmented program budget or extension of participation to communities not yet enrolled.

AB Australian rainforests have been fragmented due to past climatic changes and more recently landscape change as a result of clearing for agriculture and urban spread. The subtropical rainforests of South Eastern Queensland are significantly more fragmented than the tropical World Heritage listed northern rainforests and are subject to much greater human population pressures. The Australian rainforest flora is relatively taxonomically rich at the family level, but less so at the species level. Current methods to assess biodiversity based on species numbers fail to adequately capture this richness at higher taxonomic levels. We developed a DNA barcode library for the SE Queensland rainforest flora to support a methodology for biodiversity assessment that incorporates both taxonomic diversity and phylogenetic relationships. We placed our SE Queensland phylogeny based on a three marker DNA barcode within a larger international rainforest barcode library and used this to calculate phylogenetic diversity (PD). We compared phylo-diversity measures, species composition and richness and ecosystem diversity of the SE Queensland rainforest estate to identify which bio subregions contain the greatest rainforest biodiversity, subregion relationships and their level of protection. We identified areas of highest conservation priority. Diversity was not correlated with rainforest area in SE Queensland subregions but PD was correlated with both the percent of the subregion occupied by rainforest and the diversity of regional ecosystems (RE) present. The patterns of species diversity and phylogenetic diversity suggest a strong influence of historical biogeography. Some subregions contain significantly more PD than expected by chance, consistent with the concept of refugia, while others were significantly phylogenetically clustered, consistent with recent range expansions.

AB Over the last 200 years the wetlands of the Upper Tiete and Upper Paraiba do Sul basins, in the southeastern Atlantic Forest, Brazil, have been almost-completely transformed by urbanization, agriculture and mining. Endemic to these river basins, the Sao Paulo Marsh Antwren (Formicivora paludicola) survived these impacts, but remained unknown to science until its discovery in 2005. Its population status was cause for immediate concern. In order to understand the factors imperiling the species, and provide guidelines for its conservation, we investigated both the species' distribution and the distribution of areas of suitable habitat using a multiscale approach encompassing species distribution modeling, fieldwork surveys and occupancy models. Of six species distribution models methods used (Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Classification Tree Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest), Random Forest showed the best fit and was utilized to guide field validation. After surveying 59 sites, our results indicated that Formicivora paludicola occurred in only 13 sites, having narrow habitat specificity, and restricted habitat availability. Additionally, historic maps, distribution models and satellite imagery showed that human occupation has resulted in a loss of more than 346 km2 of suitable habitat for this species since the early twentieth century, so that it now only occupies a severely fragmented area (area of occupancy) of 1.42 km2, and it should be considered Critically Endangered according to IUCN criteria. Furthermore, averaged occupancy models showed that marshes with lower cattail (Typha dominguensis) densities have higher probabilities of being occupied. Thus, these areas should be prioritized in future conservation efforts to protect the species, and to restore a portion of Atlantic Forest wetlands, in times of unprecedented regional water supply problems.

AB There has been a growing recognition that the narrow linear strips of uncultivated vegetation that lie between roads and agricultural crops, referred to as roadside right-of-ways or verges, can serve as areas for the conservation of wildlife. The features of right-of-ways that should influence the composition of wildlife communities vary considerably. Our goal was to determine what features of right-of-ways increased the conservation potential of right-of-ways for wildlife in a grassland system dominated by agricultural production. We sampled 100 right-of-ways for birds and 92 right-of-ways for small mammals in McDonough and Warren Counties in west-central Illinois. We found that the sizes of right-of-ways and the amount of traffic on the adjacent roads synergistically worked to influence wildlife communities. On roads with low traffic, avian species richness increased rapidly with increased right-of-way width, while on roads with high traffic, avian richness increased only slightly with increasing right-of-way widths. We found that wider roadside right-of-ways (preferably across the road from equally wide right-of-ways) with thicker and taller vegetation had the greatest conservation value for birds and small mammals. The features that enhanced the conservation value of right-of-ways in our study area were uncommon. Efforts to create or enhance these features for the benefit of wildlife would likely face numerous obstacles. Nonetheless, from a grassland conservation perspective, working with stakeholders to implement specific strategies to enhance these often neglected areas may be an effective complement to purchasing and restoring conservation lands away from roads.

AB In much of the world, soil-nesting ants are among the leading agents of biomantling and bioturbation, depositing excavated soil on the surface or in underground chambers. Colonies of the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius excavate a new nest once a year on average, depositing 0.1 to 12 L (3 L average) of soil on the surface. Repeated surveys of a population of about 400 colonies yielded the frequency of moves (approximately once per year), the distance moved (mean 4 m), and the direction moved (random). The area of the soil disc correlated well with the volume and maximum depth of the nest, as determined by excavation and mapping of chambers. The population-wide frequency distribution of disc areas thus yielded the frequency distribution of nest volumes and maximum depths. For each surveyed colony, the volume of soil excavated from six specified depth ranges and deposited on the surface was estimated. These parameters were used in a simulation to estimate the amount of soil mantled over time by the observed population of P. badius colonies. Spread evenly, P. badius mantling would create a soil layer averaging 0.43 cm thick in a millennium, with 10-15% of the soil deriving from depths greater than 1 m. Biomantling by P. badius is discussed in the context of the ant community of which it is a part, and in relation to literature reports of ant biomantling.

AB Differences in litter quality, microbial activity or abiotic conditions cannot fully account for the variability in decomposition rates observed in semiarid ecosystems. Here we tested the role of variation in litter quality, water supply, and UV radiation as drivers of litter decomposition in arid lands. And show that carry-over effects of litter photodegradation during dry periods can regulate decomposition during subsequent wet periods. We present data from a two-phase experiment, where we first exposed litter from a drought-deciduous and an evergreen shrub to natural UV levels during five, rainless summer months and, subsequently, in the laboratory, we assessed the carry-over effects of photodegradation on biomass loss under different irrigation treatments representing the observed range of local rainfall variation among years (15-240 mm). Photodegradation of litter in the field produced average carbon losses of 12%, but deciduous Proustia pungens lost > 25%, while evergreen Porlieria chilensis less than 5%. Natural exposure to UV significantly reduced carbon-to-nitrogen and lignin:N ratios in Proustia litter but not in Pot-tier-fa. During the subsequent wet phase, remaining litter biomass was lower in Proustia than in Porlieria. Indeed UV exposure increased litter decomposition of Proustia under low and medium rainfall treatments, whereas no carry-over effects were detected under high rainfall treatment. Consequently, for deciduous Proustia carry-over effects of UV exposure were negligible under high irrigation. Litter decomposition of the evergreen Porlieria depended solely on levels of rainfall that promote microbial decomposers. Our two-phase experiment revealed that both the carry-over effects of photodegradation and litter quality, modulated by inter-annual variability in rainfall, can explain the marked differences in decomposition rates and the frequent decoupling between rainfall and litter decomposition observed in semiarid ecosystems.

AB Understanding the mechanisms enabling coevolution in complex mutualistic networks remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that a tropical plant species has the capacity to discriminate among floral visitors, investing in reproduction differentially across the pollinator community. After we standardized pollen quality in 223 aviary experiments, successful pollination of Heliconia tortuosa (measured as pollen tube abundance) occurred frequently when plants were visited by long-distance traplining hummingbird species with specialized bills ((x) over bar pollen tubes = 1.21 +/- 0.12 SE) but was reduced 5.7 times when visited by straight-billed territorial birds (x pollen tubes = 0.20 +/- 0.074 SE) or insects. Our subsequent experiments revealed that plants use the nectar extraction capacity of tropical hummingbirds, a positive function of bill length, as a cue to turn on reproductively. Furthermore, we show that hummingbirds with long bills and high nectar extraction efficiency engaged in daily movements at broad spatial scales (similar to 1 km), but that territorial species moved only short distances (< 100 m). Such pollinator recognition may therefore affect mate selection and maximize receipt of high-quality pollen from multiple parents. Although a diffuse pollinator network is implied, because all six species of hummingbirds carry pollen of H. tortuosa, only two species with specialized bills contribute meaningfully to its reproduction. We hypothesize that this pollinator filtering behavior constitutes a crucial mechanism facilitating coevolution in multispecies plant-pollinator networks. However, pollinator recognition also greatly reduces the number of realized pollinators, thereby rendering mutualistic networks more vulnerable to environmental change.

AB Tropical seasonal forests in Southeast Asia are among the most important biomes in terms of global and local hydrologic and carbon fluxes, and their vulnerability to climate change. We conducted eddy flux measurements in a teak (Tectona grandis Linn. f.) plantation in northern Thailand over a 6-year period; this forest undergoes a drastic seasonal change in foliage with somewhat constant incident radiative energy. We used a combination of actual evapotranspiration (ET) flux data and an inversed version of a simple two-layer ET model for estimating the mean canopy stomatal conductance (g(s)). The main novelty of this analysis is that canopy conductance can be extracted from total surface conductance (including the canopy and forest floor effects), and thus environmental and biological controls of g(s) are explicitly compared among seasons and years. The relationship between seasonal variations in the leaf area index (LAI) and g(s) revealed an apparent effect of leaf age on leaf gas exchange capacity: within a year, g(s) peaked earlier than full-leaf expansion and abruptly declined after the peak of LAI. We used this result to classify three leaf age stages: leaf-out, mid-growing, and leaf-senescence seasons. Then, two ecophysiological parameters, the reference value of g(s) (g(sref)), and the sensitivity of g(s) to atmospheric demand (m), as well as their proportion (m/g(sref)), were derived from the logarithmic response curve of g(s) to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for each season. We showed seasonal variation in g(sref) as follows: leaf-out season approximate to mid-growing season > leaf-senescence season. m demonstrated little seasonality and little interannual variation was observed in either parameter. This resulted in a value of almost 0.6 for m/g(sref) during the leaf-senescence season and of less than 0.6 in the leaf-out and mid-growing seasons, which suggests that the teak trees had strict stomatal regulation to prevent excessive xylem cavitation during the leaf-senescence season (i.e., under drought conditions) and less strict stomatal regulation during the leaf-out and mid-growing seasons (i.e., under moist conditions) when little risk of water stress-induced hydraulic failure would occur. In addition, we obtained a simple linear relationship between soil moisture and g(sref), which can be a powerful tool for further research of land atmosphere interactions using global climate and vegetation dynamics models.

AB Assessing the relative importance of different processes that determine the spatial distribution of species and the dynamics in highly diverse plant communities remains a challenging question in ecology. Previous modelling approaches often focused on single aggregated forest diversity patterns that convey limited information on the underlying dynamic processes. Here, we use recent advances in inference for stochastic simulation models to evaluate the ability of a spatially explicit and spatially continuous neutral model to quantitatively predict six spatial and non-spatial patterns observed at the 50 ha tropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The patterns capture different aspects of forest dynamics and biodiversity structure, such as annual mortality rate, species richness, species abundance distribution, beta-diversity and the species-area relationship (SAR). The model correctly predicted each pattern independently and up to five patterns simultaneously. However, the model was unable to match the SAR and beta-diversity simultaneously. Our study moves previous theory towards a dynamic spatial theory of biodiversity and demonstrates the value of spatial data to identify ecological processes. This opens up new avenues to evaluate the consequences of additional process for community assembly and dynamics.

AB Intergenomic evolutionary conflicts increase biological diversity. In sexual conflict, female defence against males is generally assumed to be resistance, which, however, often leads to trait exaggeration but not diversification. Here, we address whether tolerance, a female defence mechanism known from interspecific conflicts, exists in sexual conflict. We examined the traumatic insemination of female bed bugs via cuticle penetration by males, a textbook example of sexual conflict. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed large proportions of the soft and elastic protein resilin in the cuticle of the spermalege, the female defence organ. Reduced tissue damage and haemolymph loss were identified as adaptive female benefits from resilin. These did not arise from resistance because microindentation showed that the penetration force necessary to breach the cuticle was significantly lower at the resilin-rich spermalege than at other cuticle sites. Furthermore, a male survival analysis indicated that the spermalege did not impose antagonistic selection on males. Our findings suggest that the specific spermalege material composition evolved to tolerate the traumatic cuticle penetration. They demonstrate the importance of tolerance in sexual conflict and genitalia evolution, extend fundamental coevolution and speciation models and contribute to explaining the evolution of complexity. We propose that tolerance can drive trait diversity.

AB We describe two new species of Anomaloglossus from Roraima State, Brazil, that are likely endemic to single mountains currently isolated among lowland forest and savanna ecosystems. The first species, Anomaloglossus tepequem sp. nov. was collected in 1986 and 1992 along a single stream at >500 m elevation on a tepui-like mountain named Tepequem, but was not detected during recent investigations. It is mainly diagnosed from other Anomaloglossus species by its well developed foot webbing, immaculate cream abdomen colouration and small body size (males: 18.2-20.1 mm, females: 21.7-24.5). The second species, Anomaloglossus apiau sp. nov. was found along several streams between 500 and 1400 m elevation on Serra do Apiau, and is mainly diagnosed from congeners by its weakly webbed feet, males with swollen third finger and ventrolateral stripe formed by white dots, and its advertisement call; a long trill ( up to almost 40 s) consisting of pairs of very short pulses. The discovery of these two apparently microendemic species suggests that additional Anomaloglossus species remain to be described in the Guiana Shield. Both species should be considered critically endangered given their seemingly reduced range size, association with highland habitat, and the anthropogenic pressure they currently face.

AB Background: Although fire is an important factor in determining cerrado vegetation, information about its effect on seed banks is sparse. Cerrado fires are rapidly moving surface fires with low residence time, producing only short-term heating of the uppermost centimetres of the soil. However, the reduction in vegetation cover and deposition of ashes increases the daily amplitude of soil temperature by as much as 35 degrees C.
   Aims: To assess the effect of post-fire daily soil temperatures on the germination of one alien and nine native grasses.
   Methods: Seeds were stored at alternating temperatures of 45 oC/10 oC (10h/14h) for 7d or 30d, simulating two different storage times in the soil seed bank before the onset of the rainy season. Germination was monitored over 30d.
   Results: The variation in temperature had a significant effect on the rate of seed germination in some species, either enhancing it (Aristida setifolia) or reducing it (Schizachyrium sanguineum). Increased storage time reduced the viability of S. sanguineum and Echinolaena inflexa. The invasive Melinis minutiflora had the highest germination rate and it also showed the best toleration of post-fire conditions (45 oC/10 oC) after 7d, with significant reduction in the germination time after 30d.
   Conclusions: Fire seems to have a significant effect in the early life of cerrado grasses. Some native species responded positively to temperature oscillation, suggesting that they should be better prepared to compete with alien species after a fire, with more of their seeds germinating and/or at a more rapid rate.

AB Whale-watching is one of the fastest growing tourism industries worldwide, often viewed as a sustainable, non-consumptive strategy for the benefits of cetacean conservation and the coastal communities, alternative to and incompatible with whaling. Yet, there is paucity of research on how things actually work out at the community-level. Drawing on the research literature and my own ethnographic fieldwork, this article bridges a knowledge gap in this field while examining an Azorean context where tourism has brought a re-commodification of the whale for the community (observing wildlife as opposed to harpooning it) in the last 20 years. The analysis is focused on four main community-level implications: governance of common maritime resources, and tourism's contribution to economic sustainability, cultural identity and social relations. It is shown that whale-watching, as any other form of community-based ecotourism, is not a panacea that always promotes biodiversity conservation and economic and sociocultural sustainability for the host communities. Moreover, expanding on the theorisation of emerging institutional fields by Lawrence and Phillips, the political, historical, economic and sociocultural context of the community involved is a key factor for understanding local agency and the local specific features of new fields.

AB Quantification of factors that modulate small-scale, individual patterns of location and behaviour is fundamental for ecology, as the behaviour of animals within habitats affects many components of fitness. At the smallest scale, animals show variations in orientation, which can interact with small-scale habitat variability and is probably modified by individual identity. Limpets on steeply-sloped substrata have a population-level downwards bias in orientation. We tested the hypotheses that (1) patterns of orientation are maintained by limpets orientating in the same direction when located within the same resting site, and (2) that the strength of this relationship depends on the identity of an individual. We showed that microhabitat level variation contributed strongly to orientation patterns. Different limpets occupying the same resting site orientated in the same direction, and this pattern was consistent at multiple temporal scales. In resting sites occupied by the same limpet, the strength of the association between habitat and orientation increased. The assumption that environmental factors drive patterns of orientation is widespread, but we have demonstrated that habitat properties may be equally as important. Ecologists must be conscious of habitat properties and individual identity when trying to understand the distribution and alignment of individuals.

AB The Schizolobium parahyba, popularly known as "guapuruvu", has distinct growth rings evidenced by increased thickening of the walls in the late wood and the presence of marginal parenchyma bands. In this context, the aim of this study was to construct a chronology of the growth rings of S. parahyba trees, occurring in Biological Reserve Tingua, RJ, in order to generate knowledge about the growth dynamic of the species, as well as the sensitivity of the formation of growth rings by climatic factors. From the 30 selected trees, four radial trunk samples were collected using a Pressler borer. The samples suffered mechanical polishing for better visualization of the growth rings and subsequent delineation and measurement of the width of these rings. The statistical program COFECHA was used to check the synchronization of the width of growth rings and generate a series of master chronology of the specie. The species has a great dendrochronological potential, which was confirmed by a high correlation of the width of growth rings within and between trees. Moreover, the species has a high average sensitivity coefficient, which shows a response to environmental variations. The growth of the species is correlated with precipitation in the dry season.

AB Contradicting the notion that non-pioneer tree species are less tolerant to high irradiance due to their lower plasticity, some non-pioneer tropical species have shown high capacities to adjust to full sun. This ability has been attributed to the greater plasticity related to photosynthesis variables rather than morphological variables. To test this hypothesis, we performed the present study to identify the phenotypic variables of greatest plasticity in the non-pioneer species Cariniana estrellensis (Raddi) Kuntze, Cedrela odorata L., and Manilkara salzmannii (A. DC.) H.J. Lam., which are very representative of the rainforests of Brazil and have a large potential for reforestation. After 150 days of cultivation in full sun (1,820 +/- 110 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) or shade (250 +/- 84 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), measurements were made of growth, chloroplast pigments, net assimilation rate (NAR), soluble carbohydrates (glucose, fructose and sucrose), catalase and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity, and leaf and stem anatomy. The pigments and NAR showed greater plasticity than did the biochemical (carbohydrates and enzyme), growth or anatomy variables. Although the growth variables demonstrated low plasticity, the leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf area ratio (LAR) had plasticity index values over 0.5. Cedrela odorata was concluded to be the most plastic specie in leaf area, SLA, LAR, NAR, Carotenoids, APX, and the thickness of the periderm. The tolerance of Cariniana estrellensis, Cedrela odorata, and Manilkara salzmannii to full sun was attributed to the high plasticity of their physiological variables NAR and chloroplast pigments.

AB The tribe Tigridieae (Iridoideae: Iridaceae) is an American and a monophyletic group. The centers of diversification are found in Mexico and the Andean range of South America. Based on 2 769 georeferenced records and using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we analyzed the richness and distribution of Tigridieae in North America by political region, terrestrial ecoregion, and a 45x45 km cell grid. Tigridieae is represented by 66 species and 7 subspecies. Fifty four species and 7 subspecies are endemic. Tigridia is the most diverse genus including 43 species and 6 subspecies. The Mexican states of Oaxaca, Mexico and Jalisco have the greatest species richness. The Transmexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forest, the has the highest number of taxa (36 taxa). The most diverse grid cell (14 taxa) is located where the Transmexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forest, Bajio dry forest and the Balsas dry forest ecoregions intersect.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationships between the spectra in the Vis-NIR range and the soil P concentrations obtained from the P-M and P-rem extraction methods as well as the effects of these relationships on the construction of models predicting P concentration in Oxisols. Soil samples' spectra and their P-M and P-rem extraction solutions were determined for the Vis-NIR region between 400 and 2500 nm. Mineralogy and/ or organic matter content act as primary attributes allowing correlation of these soil phosphorus fractions with the spectra, mainly at wavelengths between 450-550, 900-1100 nm, near 1400 nm and between 2200-2300 nm. However, the regression models generated were not suitable for quantitative phosphate analysis. Solubilization of organic matter and reactions during the P-M extraction process hindered correlations between the spectra and these P soil fractions. For P-rem,, the presence of Ca in the extractant and preferential adsorption by gibbsite and iron oxides, particularly goethite, obscured correlations with the spectra.

AB Local-scale environmental heterogeneity can provide microhabitats that influence the spatial distribution of competing species. Microhabitats may influence the distribution of seagrasses along elevation gradients, but difficulty measuring intertidal microtopography has hindered quantification. Using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), we mapped and monitored a 1.84 ha study site for three years to understand spatial and temporal patterns of sediment microtopography. We performed high-accuracy GPS surveys and vegetation surveys of a native and an invasive seagrass. TLS provided sub-decimeter scale precision in digital elevation models (DEMs) of the tideflat. The location and shape of microtopographic features were stable from year to year, but the magnitude of local relief varied. A simple index of topographic context predicted the shoot density of the native seagrass, Zostera marina and the invasive seagrass, Zostera japonica, but the shoot density of the invasive seagrass was better predicted by the shoot density of Z. marina than by topographic context. Microtopographic relief at this site appears to exert a strong influence on the meter-scale distribution of seagrass. We demonstrate the potential for TLS mapping of habitat-relevant microtopography in a soft sediment intertidal environment where TLS faces substantial challenges but promises unique insights.

AB For endozoochorous seed dispersal systems, the extant dung beetle assemblage at seed deposition sites may influence site suitability as burial activity may change the probability that seeds germinate and seedlings establish. This study tested if the different conditions of the two main seed-deposition habitats of a western lowland gorilla population of south-east Cameroon (sleeping sites and old secondary forest) influenced dung beetle assemblages and consequently the seed relocation patterns. In March 2012, in both habitats, burial patterns (proportion and depth) were described in eight stations based on two 300-g experimental faeces with known number of Uapaca spp. seeds (N = 75) left for 48 h, and beetle assemblages were described based on one 48h-dung-baited pitfall trapping session in five of these stations. To assess the impact of burial pattern on seedling emergence, Uapaca seedling emergence trials were performed in a nursery (75 seeds per depth treatment). Assemblage at sleeping sites had a higher species richness (non-significant) and was significantly more abundant than in old secondary forests. Conversely, significantly more seeds were buried in old secondary forests than sleeping sites and at significantly greater depths (mean: 14.9 cm vs. 8.7 cm). As trials suggested that burial depth >= 7 cm prevented Uapaca seedling emergence, dung beetles are assumed to induce seed loss more strongly in old secondary forests than sleeping sites (20.5% vs. 6.7% of initial seed crop). The demonstration that dung beetles may exert a negative influence on seed fate overall, and that the degree to which this occurs may vary depending on habitat, highlights the complexity in determining the suitability of deposition sites for recruitment.

AB A pattern of seasonal changes in the morphological and anatomical leaf traits is reported for Potentilla argentea L. var. tenuiloba (Jord.) Sw. of temperate-climate areas in central Poland. Leaf area, perimeter, dry mass and lamina thickness were measured in summer and autumn leaves of the same individuals. Dissection index, density and specific leaf area were calculated. Significant differences were obtained between summer and autumn leaves obtained from the same individuals. The shapes of leaves of the P. argentea plants varied in the extent of incisions between teeth and the number of teeth on the margins. Fully expanded autumn leaves were larger in weight and area than summer leaves. The autumn leaves had lower leaf mass area and density than the summer leaves. Leaves were covered by considerably more trichomes in summer than in autumn. Anatomical leaf structure also changed with the season. The summer leaves were thick, with a lower number of chloroplasts in the cells of the compact mesophyll. Autumn leaves are thinner, with loose mesophyll. Chloroplasts from the two seasonal types of leaves differ on account of starch grain and plastoglobule content. The large variations in leaf density and thickness recorded here confirm great differences in cell size and amounts of structural tissue within species. Seasonal dimorphism of leaves may result from seasonal drought or from seasonality in leaf production, leaf fall or incoming solar radiation. Within this new context of seasonal leaf dimorphism, P. argentea can still be distinguished by the absence of deeply divided leaflets on late-formed leaves. The results confirmed the presence of several morpho- anatomical leaf traits of P. argentea that allow the species to adapt to environmental seasonal conditions.

AB In order to make an inventory and learn more about the corticolous lichens diversity on the tree layers of the different environments of the cloud forest (Bosque Mesofilo de Montana, BMM) in La Cortadura, Veracruz, a transect along the best preserved hill of the forest was delimited, in which 100 m(2) squared plots were delineated every 25 m and with different orientations on the slope. Lichen coverage was estimated among trees that had a DBH higher than 20 cm, on the orientation with the greatest lichen coverage. A non-quantitative and opportunistic sampling was done as well, among the same phorophytes. The data were analyzed using the principal component analysis. For each orientation on the hill, a Shannon diversity index was obtained. The species indicator analysis was applied, as well as the circular distribution method. The results indicate that within every 100 m 2 square plot, there were 62 individuals on average of the different phorophyte taxa, which host 108 lichen species: 52 (49.5%) correspond to foliose lichens, 47 (44.8%) to crustose lichens, 4 (3.8%) to fruticose lichens and 2 (1.9%) to dimorphic lichen thalli. In the BMM, in spite of being heterogeneous, the genus Quercus predominates, which benefits the lichen community, even though it is subject to changes in the forest structure, the available substratum, and to its capability to disperse.

AB Both the length of the growing season and the intensity of herbivory often vary along climatic gradients, which may result in divergent selection on plant phenology, and on resistance and tolerance to herbivory. In Sweden, the length of the growing season and the number of insect herbivore species feeding on the perennial herb Lythrum salicaria decrease from south to north. Previous common-garden experiments have shown that northern L.salicaria populations develop aboveground shoots earlier in the summer and finish growth before southern populations do. We tested the hypotheses that resistance and tolerance to damage vary with latitude in L.salicaria and are positively related to the intensity of herbivory in natural populations. We quantified resistance and tolerance of populations sampled along a latitudinal gradient by scoring damage from natural herbivores and fitness in a common-garden experiment in the field and by documenting oviposition and feeding preference by specialist leaf beetles in a glasshouse experiment. Plant resistance decreased with latitude of origin, whereas plant tolerance increased. Oviposition and feeding preference in the glasshouse and leaf damage in the common-garden experiment were negatively related to damage in the source populations. The latitudinal variation in resistance was thus consistent with reduced selection from herbivores towards the northern range margin of L. salicaria. Variation in tolerance may be related to differences in the timing of damage in relation to the seasonal pattern of plant growth, as northern genotypes have developed further than southern have when herbivores emerge in early summer.

AB This review is an analysis of the dimensions of termite infestation in African savannas. The aim of this work is to draw the attention of ecologists, conservationists, policy makers and farmers to the current and future threats of subterranean termites to the functioning and sustainability of such ecosystem habitats. This study analyzes and describes termite problem (questionable changes in density and assemblage structure) in selected African savannah ecosystems, synthesizes information on the effects of various human induced habitat disturbance regimes on termites' assemblage structure, predators, nests and feed resources to generate hypotheses relating termite infestation with anthropogenic activities; it describes and critiques existing termite management practices. The review is suggestive that the infestation and resultant undesirable effects of subterranean termites in African savannahs are largely a consequence of the inappropriate savannah management practices (overgrazing, indiscriminate tree cutting and overhunting) undertaken by humans in pursuit of various livelihood options. Based on the evidence presented herein, we hypothesized that (1) human induced habitat disturbance in savanna ecosystems alters the feeding group composition of termites' assemblages, favoring grass harvesters and polyphagus termite feeders that forage on more abundant food items, paying little attention to rarer food items and (2) habitat disturbance through activities like heavy grazing and overhunting results in decline in the populations of both macro and microscopic termite predators, which eventually enhances the proliferation of termite populations, escalates the density of termite nests particularly epigeal mounds and intensifies consumption of herbaceous savannah vegetation. The review calls for dedicated efforts to develop ecological thresholds of savannah biotic and abiotic ecosystem components in which,human induced disturbance regimes trigger the destructive behavior of termites. This would provide information that will act as a precautionary savannah habitat monitoring and decision support tool to prevent future infestation of savannah habitats with termites. Also, the review shows that majority of the termite control practices are ineffective, ecologically unsustainable and above all, do not address the root cause of termite infestation and thus merely provide temporary relief to the problem. As such, termite control methods that attempt to enhance proliferation of termite predators need to be studied, developed and emphasized. This review reveals that human induced habitat disturbance depletes termites' predator populations, leading to proliferation of termite populations particularly grass harvesters that intensify their consumption on grass biomass and eventually contribute to denudation of herbaceous vegetation cover in savannah ecosystems.

AB Few examples of mesopredator release, whereby subordinate predators increase in abundance in response to a reduction in dominant predators, have been demonstrated from reptile communities despite the important ecological role of large varanids and snakes. We tested the hypothesis that trophic cascades attributable to mesopredator release of varanids could explain the apparently perverse decline of some small reptiles following removal of exotic mammalian predators in a landscape-scale reserve in arid South Australia. We used counts of Sand Goanna (Varanus gouldii) tracks and diggings as a surrogate activity index in paddock-scale treatments with different assemblages of feral predators and reintroduced mammals. Varanus gouldii activity was five times higher in regions where cats and foxes were removed than where they were present. We hypothesize that the suppression of mammalian predators can have complex effects that extend to reptile communities and should inform conservation management decisions in environments with large reptile predators.

AB Climate change is strong in the Amazon basin. Climate models consistently predict widespread warmer and drier conditions by the end of the 21st century. As a consequence, water stress will increase throughout the region. We here review current understanding of the impact of climate change on forests' distribution patterns, species diversity and ecosystem functioning of lowland rainforests in the Amazon basin. We reviewed 192 studies that provide empirical evidence, historical information and theoretical models. Over millions of years rainforests expansions and contractions have been accompanied by changes in the diversity and productivity of forests. In the future, drought will produce forest contractions along the forest edges and the savanna ecotone, causing an extensive savannization, particularly in the east. In terms of diversity, warming will reduce plant species survival by decreasing their productivity, but extinctions may also occur as a result of vegetation disequilibrium, as many plants, dispersal and pollinator species will fail to track changing climate; mild drought kills understory trees and severe drought may eliminate canopy trees as well. Severe droughts will thus produce directional changes in species composition, although these shifts may vary among forests on different soil types. In terms of ecosystem functioning, droughts will reduce root growth and standing biomass and may shift the Amazonian forest from being CO2 sinks to become CO2 sources. Physiological and ecological responses to warming and the feedback between vegetation and climate are still not completely understood. In particular, experimental assays that allow direct conclusions on the response of Amazonian plants to the predicted climatic conditions are needed. Such studies could make possible more reliable estimates of future climatic and vegetation responses.

AB The relationship between tree height and diameter is fundamental in determining community and ecosystem structure as well as estimates of biomass and carbon storage. Yet our understanding of how tree allometry relates to climate and whole organismal function is limited. We used the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program database to determine height-diameter allometries of 2,976,937 individuals of 293 tree species across the United States. The shape of the allometric relationship was determined by comparing linear and nonlinear functional forms. Mixed-effects models were used to test for allometric differences due to climate and floristic (between angiosperms and gymnosperms) and functional groups (leaf habit and shade tolerance). Tree allometry significantly differed across the United States largely because of climate. Temperature, and to some extent precipitation, in part explained tree allometric variation. The magnitude of allometric variation due to climate, however, had a phylogenetic signal. Specifically, angiosperm allometry was more sensitive to differences in temperature compared to gymnosperms. Most notably, angiosperm height was more negatively influenced by increasing temperature variability, whereas gymnosperm height was negatively influenced by decreasing precipitation and increasing altitude. There was little evidence to suggest that shade tolerance influenced tree allometry except for very shade-intolerant trees which were taller for any given diameter. Tree allometry is plastic rather than fixed and scaling parameters vary around predicted central tendencies. This allometric variation provides insight into life-history strategies, phylogenetic history, and environmental limitations at biogeographical scales.

AB Evergreen broadleaved forests in subtropical China contain a complicated structure of diverse species. The impact of topographic and soil factors on the assembly of woody species in the forest has been poorly understood. We used Ripley's K(t) function to analyze the spatial patterns and associations of dominant species and residual analysis (RDA) to quantify the contribution of topography and soil to species assembly. The 1 ha plot investigated had 4797 stems with a diameter at breast height (dbh) larger than 1 cm that belong to 73 species, 55 genera, and 38 families. All stems of the entire forest and four late successional species exhibited a reversed J shape for dbh distribution, while two early successional species showed a unimodal shape. Aggregation was the major spatial pattern for entire forests and dominant species across vertical layers. Spatial associations between inter- and intra-species were mostly independent. Topographic and soil factors explained 28.1% of species assembly. The forest was close to late succession and showed the characteristics of diverse woody species, high regeneration capacity, and aggregated spatial patterns. Topographic and soil factors affected species assembly, but together they could only explain a small part of total variance.

AB The socioeconomic outcomes after five years of community forest management are examined in the Virola-Jatoba Sustainable Development Project (PDS) in Anapu, Brazilian Amazon. In 2007 families were advised by public agencies to establish community-company partnerships for forest management (FM) in this settlement. Operations in 3,000 ha extracted 50,000 m(3) of timber, generating gross revenues of US$ 2 million for the local association. This paper examines collective action in key stages of land access and FM. The impacts of the FM process on social structures are explored. Since recent regulations have prohibited private companies to control FM in agrarian reform settlements, local administrative efforts need to change. We will thus evaluate prospects for a system of governance under direct coordination of producers' organisations. Management changes are seen as positive if combined with public support for local capacity building, but this is unlikely in the short term. Given limits for agricultural land use, effective FM is critical for these groups in order to consolidate land occupation and properly manage natural resources.

TI Small-scale farmers' needs to end deforestation: insights for REDD plus

AB REDD+ has been perceived in Brazil as a way of complementing an effective command-and-control policy to help small-scale farmers transition out of deforestation. A large array of incentives have been suggested within the REDD+ framework, involving trade-offs between efficiency and equity. However, few studies have so far addressed the adaptation of these incentives to the needs of the farmers. In order to develop this perspective, our work aims at understanding how small-scale farmers perceive deforestation and what would make them engage in a transition towards sustainable alternatives. Interviews were conducted in Sao Felix do Xingu, where The Nature Conservancy has been developing a REDD+ pilot programme. The three discourses identified following the application of Q methodology reveal differing needs to reduce deforestation. If equity is defined as the opportunity for all to engage in a transition, a differentiated REDD+ initiative targeting the farmers' needs may be more equitable than standardized support options.

AB The intensification of agricultural activity can have profound impacts on biodiversity. We evaluated the influence of the landscape's percentage of forest cover and shaded cocoa plantations on the community of zoochorous bromeliads in southern Bahia, Brazil. We selected two contrasting landscapes, one dominated by Atlantic tropical rainforest and the other by traditional cocoa plantations. In each landscape we sampled three forest fragments and three areas of cocoa plantation, where we conducted a survey of epiphytic bromeliads of the genera Aechmea and Hohenbergia in eight plots of 400 m(2) in each area. The number of trees differed between landscapes and habitats, and was higher in forest fragments than in shade cocoa plantations, but the number of phorophytes was similar between landscapes and habitats. Highest richness of Aechmea and Hohenbergia species was found in forest fragments in landscapes where forests are predominant. Contrary to expectations, the richness in the other areas was relatively low, and extremely low in the landscape dominated by cocoa plantations, ranging from zero to four species per fragment. Bromeliad abundance was not different among landscapes and habitats, but the shade cocoa plantations located in predominant agroforest landscape showed the higher number of stands. Moreover, the species found in the cocoa plantations were more drought-tolerant species. These results suggest that the conservation of species of these genera depends on factors such as the conservation status of each forest fragment and the microclimatic alterations in the habitats, and not only on the percentage of forest in the landscape per se.

AB Tourism has grown considerably in the last decades, promoting activities such as recreational SCUBA diving that may affect marine benthic communities. In Puerto Madryn, Patagonia Argentina, sub-aquatic tourism areas (STA) receive about 7,000 divers per year. Diving is concentrated on a few small rocky reefs and 50% of the dives occur in summer. In this work, we evaluated the effect of recreational diving activities on benthic communities and determined whether diving causes a press (long-term) or a pulse (short-term) response. We quantified the percentage cover of benthic organisms and compared benthic assemblage structure and composition between two sites with contrasting usage by divers, 'highly disturbed' and 'moderately disturbed' sites, and two 'control' sites with similar physical characteristics but no diving activity, twice before and after the diving peak in summer. We found differences in benthic assemblage structure (identity and relative abundance of taxa) and composition (identity only) among diving sites and controls. These differences were consistent before and after the peak of diving in summer, suggesting that recreational diving may produce a press impact on overall benthic assemblage structure and composition in these STA. At the moderately disturbed site, however, covers of specific taxa, such as some key habitat-forming or highly abundant species, usually differed from those in controls only immediately after summer, after which they begun to resemble controls, suggesting a pulse impact. Thus, STA in Golfo Nuevo seem to respond differently to disturbances of diving depending on the usage of the sites. This information is necessary to develop sound management strategies in order to preserve local biodiversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   ORGANIZATION
AB The versatile hermit crabs, Diogenes moosai and Diogenes lopochir, are hypothesised to utilise multiple primary sources of energy in the coastal mudflat. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were analysed to determine the primary sources of nutrition (mangrove, benthic microalgae and phytoplankton) and trophic contribution of mudflat hermit crabs to fish predators in Matang mangrove estuary, Peninsular Malaysia. Stable isotope analysis in R showed that benthic microalgae are the major contributor of the total carbon assimilated by diogenid hermit crabs, followed by phytoplankton and mangrove. Interestingly, hermit crabs are one of the few marine organisms that can digest and assimilate lignocellulosic carbon of the mangrove. However, the relative contribution of the primary sources is site dependent and varies along the estuarine gradient with increasing dependency on mangrove-derived carbon by hermit crabs from offshore waters to estuary. The Sciaenidae is the major group of predatory fish of hermit crabs; the implication is that the dense population of hermit crabs with their versatile feeding habits channels energy from three basal sources to support coastal fish production.

AB Premise of research.The most important diversity hot spot of genus Quercus (Fagaceae) in America is situated in southern Mexico. From this area down to the Colombian Andes, oak species diversity decreases considerably, but the pattern of species distribution and turnover has not been analyzed. This study aimed at determining geographical patterns of species turnover, species distribution, and endemism for Neotropical Quercus species.Methodology.Occurrence records for 58 oak species belonging to the Quercus and Lobatae sections were obtained. Patterns of species turnover were determined by comparing species composition among latitudinal/longitudinal units. Areas of endemism were determined using weighted networks. The potential distribution of oak species was determined using ecological niche models. Finally, a principal component analysis was used to identify changes in the oak species' ecological niche across areas.Pivotal results.The species composition analysis indicated that the Tehuantepec Isthmus, the Nicaraguan Depression, and the Panamanian Isthmus represent species turnover points. Nine areas of endemism were recovered, distributed through mountainous ranges from Mexico to Costa Rica. Most of these areas were delimited by the species turnover points detected. Ecological niche modeling indicated that the turnover points represent areas with low climatic suitability for most oak species and represent discontinuities in the distribution of Quercus. Niche comparisons suggest niche differentiation among species distributed in different areas of endemism or on opposite sides of turnover points.Conclusions.The results indicate that the Tehuantepec Isthmus, the Nicaraguan Depression, and the Panamanian Isthmus have acted as important barriers to the dispersal of oak species, influencing species diversity, biogeographic patterns, and niche divergence.

(Proteaceae) is a typical tree species in the temperate rain forests of Chile and Argentina. This tree shows drastic heteroblasty, changing from simple leaves at the seedling stage to pinnate leaves during development. It regenerates mostly in shady understories, but juveniles can be found growing under a wide range of light conditions (5%-50% canopy openness). Thus, considering that light has been proposed as a driver of the heteroblastic strategy, G. avellana is an interesting model to study the potential environmental modulation of its ontogenetically programmed heteroblasty. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of light availability on G. avellana's heteroblastic trajectory. We postulated that G. avellana's ontogenetic changes in leaf complexity (i.e., heteroblasty) increase under high light availability.Methodology.Saplings along most of the light availability gradient were sampled. Plant height was used as a proxy for ontogeny. We measured several leaf traits (leaf area), shape (aspect ratio), pinnation (leaf dissection index), and complexity (fractal dimension index). First, we evaluated the change in each leaf trait with height by means of Pearson's correlation. Then we tested for differences in leaf traits along the ontogeny between two light environments (higher and lower than 10% canopy openness) by the line-fitting standardized major axis method.Pivotal results.We found positive correlations between each leaf trait and plant height (P < 0.001), while only leaf size and complexity showed higher ontogenetic increases under high light.Conclusions.Light environment has a small but significant effect on the heteroblastic trajectory of G. avellana. In particular, saplings inhabiting microsites with high light availability have larger and more complex leaves. While allometry would explain the ontogenetic trajectory of leaf size, the increased complexity could reflect functional advantages for large leaves in tall plants, especially under high light conditions.

AB A central tenet of forest ecology is that succession and regeneration dynamics are driven by an interspecific trade-off between juvenile growth rates in high light and shade tolerance. There is evidence, however, that a single trade-off axis may fail to explain the dynamics of mixed conifer-angiosperm rain forests in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in New Zealand.
   We tested for growth vs. shade tolerance trade-offs by measuring juvenile growth of five podocarps and five broadleaved canopy angiosperms across a wide range of light environments in a New Zealand warm-temperate rain forest. The light compensation point of growth was used as a measure of species light requirements, which we then compared with height growth in 10% light, approximating the environments encountered beneath small treefall gaps.
   Despite considerable overlap between the ranges of both growth rates and compensation points found in the two lineages, major axis tests showed that the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off differed significantly between podocarp and angiosperm species. At a common compensation point, angiosperms were faster growing than podocarps in 10% light. However, juveniles of these angiosperm species were notably scarce in the more open environments associated with forest margins.
   Synthesis.A conifer-angiosperm divergence in the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off may explain long-standing problems of the dynamics of these forests. Although juveniles of most lowland podocarps can tolerate considerable shade, the more vigorous response of broadleaved angiosperms to small canopy openings enables them to out-compete podocarps in old-growth stands. The greater abundance of podocarp juveniles on forest margins cannot be attributed to them out-competing angiosperm species where light is abundant and is likely to reflect superior resistance to frost and/or drought. The drivers of the dynamics of New Zealand's podocarp-broadleaved forests therefore differ appreciably from those ascribed to tropical and north-temperate forests.

AB Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are expressed mainly in natural killer cells and specifically recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules. The repertoire of KIR genes and KIR-HLA pairs is known to play a key role in the susceptibilities to and the outcomes of several diseases, including malaria. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of KIR genes, KIR genotypes and KIR-HLA pair combinations in a population naturally exposed to malaria from Brazilian Amazon. All 16 KIR genes investigated were present in the studied population. Overall, 46 KIR genotypes were defined. The two most common genotypes in the Porto Velho communities, genotypes 1 and 2, were present at similar frequencies as in the Americas. Principal component analysis based on the frequencies of the KIR genes placed the Porto Velho population closer to the Venezuela Mestizos, USA California hispanic and Brazil Parana Mixed in terms of KIR gene frequencies. This analysis highlights the multi-ethnic profile of the Porto Velho population. Most of the individuals were found to have at least one inhibitory KIR-HLA pair. Seventy-five KIR-HLA pair combinations were identified. The KIR-2DL2/3_HLA-C1, KIR3DL1_HLA-Bw4 and KIR2DL1_HLA-C2 pairs were the most common. There was no association between KIR genes, KIR genotypes or KIR-HLA pair combinations and malaria susceptibility in the studied population. This is the first report on the distribution of KIR and known HLA ligands in the Porto Velho population. Taken together, these results should provide baseline information that will be relevant to population evolutionary history, malaria and other diseases studies in populations of the Brazilian Amazon.

AB Agricultural management and the landscape surrounding farms impact biological diversity and ecosystem services, such as predation, in agroecosystems. Diversified coffee agroecosystems harbor biodiversity, and maintain ecosystem services, especially when in complex landscapes, and when diversity of organisms providing services is maintained. But few have examined whether biological diversity, per se, or the local and landscape habitat features are stronger drivers of the services provided. We studied the relationships between local characteristics associated with agricultural management (vegetation complexity and agrochemical use), landscape surroundings of farms, abundance and richness of ants, and predation services provided by ants in a tropical coffee landscape. Specifically, we tested whether: (1) ants remove prey items and prey removal differs in the wet and dry season, (2) ant prey removal differs in farms that vary in vegetation complexity and agrochemical use, (3) ant prey removal differs with changes in ant abundance and species richness, and (4) ant prey removal differs with changes in local and landscape characteristics. We established sites across a range of coffee management systems, at varying distances to forest fragments, and in forest fragments and examined prey removal by ants on the ground, coffee branches, and shade tree trunks in the wet and dry season. Prey removal did not differ with season. Prey removal on the ground increased within increases in ant abundance and richness, and number of hollow coffee twigs. Prey removal on coffee plants decreased with vegetation complexity, but increased with ant abundance and richness, coffee density (a local factor), and rustic coffee within 200 m (a landscape factor). Prey removal on trees declined with vegetation complexity, but increased with abundance and richness of ants. Characteristics of the ant community were consistent predictors of prey removal, whereas local and landscape habitat features were less important, and only three habitat features correlated with prey removal. Our results demonstrate the positive effects of ant diversity for predatory function, and that promoting pest control services within coffee agroecosystems may be best accomplished by manipulating ant abundance and richness, or vegetation factors that correlate with ants.

AB Ecological studies are usually based on species abundance data per sample. As a consequence, the research can be time-consuming and require a significant amount of financial resources to overcome uncertainties in taxonomic identifications and estimations of relative abundances. We assessed the use of genus-level data as a surrogate for species-level data in studies attempting to describe the beta-diversity patterns of several aquatic communities. Furthermore, we investigated whether presence-absence data is sufficient to describe ecological patterns and whether the spatial variation of rare species can also be described by genus-level data. We used data from five biological aquatic groups sampled over periods of up to 2 years in different sites of the Upper Parana River floodplain. We found strong evidence that beta-diversity patterns in species-level data can be successfully described using genus-level and presence-absence data in all biological groups, although efficacy of using genus-level data as a surrogate for species-level may depend on the species: genus ratio. Moreover, communities with both taxonomic resolutions had similar responses to environmental variation. Our results indicate ecological studies in floodplains with different biological groups can benefit from strategy based on genus-level or presence-absence data to reduce cost and time.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis suggests that density- and/or distance-dependent juvenile mortality driven by host-specific natural enemies can explain high species diversity in tropical forests. However, such density and distance effects may not occur simultaneously and may not be driven by the same mechanism. Also, reports of attempts to identify and quantify the differences between these processes in tropical forests are scarce. In a primary subtropical forest in China, we (1) experimentally examined the relative influence of the distance to parent trees vs. conspecific seedling density on mortality patterns in Engelhardia fenzelii, (2) tested the role of soil-borne pathogens in driving density- or distance-dependent processes that cause seedling mortality, and (3) inspected the susceptibilities of different tree species to soil biota of E. fenzelii and the effects of soil biota from different tree species on E. fenzelii. The results from these field experiments showed that distance- rather than density-dependent processes driven by soil pathogens strongly affect the seedling survival of this species in its first year. We also observed increased survival of a fungicide treatment for E. fenzelii seedlings in the parent soil but not for the seedlings of the other three species in the E. fenzelii parent soil, or for E. fenzelii seedlings in the parent soil of three other species. This study illustrates how the distance-dependent pattern of seedling recruitment for this species is driven by soil pathogens, a mechanism that likely restricts the dominance of this abundant species.

AB Although the general interaction between native and exotic plants and specialist insect herbivores has received considerable attention in ecological studies, plant responses to herbivory by generalist insects, as well as feeding preferences of generalist insects, are still poorly understood. Experimental studies comparing leaf damage of native and exotic plants to generalist insects have provided inconsistent results due to irregularities in methodology such as using only one type of experiment or using non-standard measurements. Our study addresses these issues by examining leaf damage caused by generalist Melanoplus grasshoppers in morphologically and physiologically similar native (Andropogon gerardii and Bouteloua curtipendula) and exotic grasses (Miscanthus sinensis and Bothriochloa ischaemum) in Ohio and Maryland. In a 2-year study, we explored whether exotic grasses sustain less damage than native grasses, and consequently, whether generalist grasshoppers may potentially pose biotic resistance to exotic grasses. Using a combination of choice and no-choice feeding experiments with intact plants and with clipped leaves under different (field and greenhouse) conditions, we found that overall both herbivory and grasshopper performance (body length) were greater on the exotic grasses compared to native grasses. Our results suggest that exotic grasses which do not share a coevolutionary history with native generalist Melanoplus grasshoppers might have lower physical and chemical defenses than native plants. Consequently, Melanoplus grasshoppers may provide biotic resistance to these exotic grasses should these plants invade natural areas at the study regions. These results have important applications for predicting the interaction between exotic plants and generalist herbivores in the introduced range, which is critical for understanding factors facilitating plant invasions.

AB The establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), particularly of no-take areas, is often viewed as a conflict between conservation and fishing. Partially protected areas (PPAs) that restrict some extractive uses are often regarded as a balance between biodiversity conservation and socio-economic viability. Few attempts have been made to generalize the ecological effects of PPAs. We synthesized the results of empirical studies that compared PPAs to (i) no-take reserves (NTRs) and (ii) to open access (Open) areas, to assess the potential benefits of different levels of protection for fish populations. Response to protection was examined in relation to MPA parameters and the exploitation status of fish. Our syntheses suggest that while PPAs significantly enhance density and biomass of fish relative to Open areas, NTRs yielded significantly higher biomass of fish within their boundaries relative to PPAs. The positive response to protection was primarily driven by target species. There was a large degree of variability in the magnitude of response to protection, although the size of the PPA explained some of this variability. The protection regime within the PPA provided useful insights into the effectiveness of partial MPAs. We conclude that MPAs with partial protection confer advantages, such as enhanced density and biomass of fish, compared to areas with no restrictions, although the strongest responses occurred for areas with total exclusion. Thus, MPAs with a combination of protection levels are a valuable spatial management tool particularly in areas where exclusion of all activities is not a socio-economically and politically viable option.

ID CONSERVATION; FUTURE
AB This article investigates how land users perceive laws restricting deforestation and forest degradation, notably Brazil's National Forest Code, and how legal meaning emerges as place specific to influence their legal compliance. Interviews were held with land users in Acre state, a municipality with high rates of deforestation located in the forest frontier of the Brazilian Amazon. Critical legal geography was applied as a theoretical framework to investigate the ways in which legal meaning emerges in and through that social context. This research finds that non-compliance is associated with pervasive conditions of social stress combined with lived experiences of contradictory legal processes, including shifting legal discourses and inconsistent local law enforcement. In such social contexts, local legal meaning associates forest conservation laws with socio-economic and legal inequality and the reinforcement of structures of social exclusion.

AB Kloss gibbons (Hylobates klossii) are endemic to the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia and have been subject to human predation for more than 2000 years in the absence of any other significant predators. We investigate the behavior of Kloss gibbons that may be attributed to avoiding human predation. We observed Kloss gibbons in the Peleonan forest in the north of Siberut Island, the northernmost of the Mentawai island chain, over 18 months in 2007 and 2008, and collected data on their singing behavior, the number of individuals present during different conditions and their responses to humans. We examine behaviors that may reduce the risk of predation by humans during singing (the most conspicuous gibbon behavior), daily non-singing activities and encounters with humans. The individual risk of being stalked by hunters is reduced by singing in same-sex choruses and the risk of successful capture by hunters during singing is reduced by singing less often during daylight hours and by leaving the location of male pre-dawn singing before full light (reducing the visual signal to hunters). Groups in the Peleonan also fission during non-singing daily activity and rarely engage in play or grooming, enhancing the crypticity of their monochromatic black pelage in the canopy. We also observed a coordinated response to the presence of humans, wherein one adult individual acted as a decoy by approaching and distracting human observers, while other group members fled silently in multiple directions. Decoy behavior occurred on 31% of 96 encounters with unhabituated Kloss gibbons that detected our presence. Decoy individuals may put themselves at risk to increase the survival of related immatures (and adult females with infants) who have a greater risk of predation. We argue that, in combination, these behaviors are an evolved response to a long history of predation by humans. Am. J. Primatol. 77:296-308, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The process of landscape fragmentation outside park borders occurs through the actions of people living near the boundaries. In the Kibale National Park landscape in western Uganda, human-landscape relationships are typified by small-scale subsistence agriculture, in which households rely on resources provided in forests and wetlands, whose use is in turn shaped by perceptions of resource availability. To understand and manage for fragmentation of resource pools, modeling and identifying the proximate drivers, and thus enacted resource extraction and utilization is of fundamental importance. We combine landscape analysis at the household scale, using remotely sensed data, with household surveys, to understand the potential human drivers of local scale landscape change. We found strong evidence for a local household zone (LHZ) effect on fragmentation patterns with geographical and socioecological heterogeneities in LHZ impact. Differences were influenced by wealth, and in some cases, tribal identity. The perception of crop raiders primarily baboons and small monkeys, but also elephants and other animals may have largely shaped human-environment interactions, and were associated with fragmentation. Ninety-two percent of the best fit models included the attitude that the park should stay, but associated it with increased fragmentation, suggesting that the uncharacteristic non-hostile attitude about Kibale does not directly translate into conservation-friendly local human-environment interactions. This study provides insight into park neighbor interactions and the influence of the LHZ on protected-area landscapes, and it points to important points in the system for collaborative opportunities to engage communities and conservation managers.

AB The use of Local Environmental Knowledge has been considered as an important strategy for adaptive management in the face of Global Environmental Change. However, the unprecedented rates at which global change occurs may pose a challenge to the adaptive capacity of local knowledge systems. In this paper, we use the concept of the shifting baseline syndrome to examine the limits in the adaptive capacity of the local knowledge of an indigenous society facing rapid ecosystem change. We conducted semi-structured interviews regarding perceptions of change in wildlife populations and in intergenerational transmission of knowledge amongst the Tsimane', a group of hunter-gatherers of Bolivian Amazonia (n = 300 adults in 13 villages). We found that the natural baseline against which the Tsimane' measure ecosystem changes might be shifting with every generation as a result of (a) age-related differences in the perception of change and (b) a decrease in the intergenerational sharing of environmental knowledge. Such findings suggest that local knowledge systems might not change at a rate quick enough to adapt to conditions of rapid ecosystem change, hence potentially compromising the adaptive success of the entire social-ecological system. With the current pace of Global Environmental Change, widening the gap between the temporal rates of on-going ecosystem change and the timescale needed for local knowledge systems to adjust to change, efforts to tackle the shifting baseline syndrome are urgent and critical for those who aim to use Local Environmental Knowledge as a tool for adaptive management.

AB Epiphytic orchids are very diverse in montane forests, but fragmentation modifies this diversity. Twenty fragments were quantified to evaluate the effects of fragmentation on the alpha and beta diversities of epiphytic orchids in a montane forest located in southern Mexico. The following factors were evaluated: area, core area, shape, edge density, Euclidean nearest-neighbourdistance fragment and contrast index. In each fragment, two transects of 2 x 50 m were drawn, and the trees with a diameter at breast height >= 20 cm were recorded. In each tree, the orchid species present were identified and quantified. Twenty-three species of epiphytic orchid in 234 phorophytes corresponding to 20 species were recorded. The epiphytic orchid richness per tree and species turnover was different between the phorophytes. The edge density and the contrast index had significant effects on the alpha diversity, while the isolation of the fragments significantly affected the beta diversity. The edge density positively affected the alpha diversity of the epiphytic orchids, likely through microclimatic changes caused by fragmentation. Drought-tolerant species were common on the edges of the fragments, and shade-tolerant species established on the core area of the fragments. This pattern most likely depends on the ecological range of the taxa, which is crucial to their development and persistence in fragmented habitats.

AB Light is a limiting factor in plant establishment and growth in the understory of forests. In this paper, we assessed acclimation capacity of Siparuna guianensis, an early secondary successional species. We used seedlings and saplings in three regeneration areas with different irradiance regimes to determine the traits that confer photoplasticity. We examined whether these traits differ at different developmental stages. Anatomical characteristics, photochemical efficiency, photosynthetic capacity, and growth were analyzed. Multivariate component analysis revealed the formation of six clusters: three for seedlings (one for each regeneration area) and three for saplings (following the same pattern of seedlings, considering the area). Increased irradiance favored photosynthetic performance, independently of the developmental stage. The same trend was observed for most data on chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence and the ratios of net photosynthetic rate/intercellular CO2 concentration (P (N)/C-i) and P (N)/PPFD. No parameter indicated photoinhibition stress. The CO2- and light-response curve data indicated that seedlings were already acclimated to tolerate variation in irradiance. Anatomical adaptations, such as thickness of leaf blade and of adaxial cuticle, were observed in individuals growing in areas with higher irradiation. Thinning of spongy parenchyma and higher investment into a plant height were observed in seedlings, possibly due to the vertical stratification of CO2 and light in the understory; because light is a more limiting resource than CO2 in the lower stratum of the forest. Photoplasticity in S. guianensis is associated with a set of morphological, anatomical, photochemical, and biochemical traits, whereas biochemical performance is best acclimated to variation in irradiance. These traits differed in seedlings and saplings but they were modulated mainly by irradiance in both developmental stages.

AB Seed dispersal constrains the environmental heterogeneity to which a plant species is exposed through its life. Behavior of seed dispersers and seed predators could be influenced by food availability and vegetation cover. Consequently, recruitment probabilities are heterogeneous in space and time, and "regeneration windows" may appear. Aristotelia chilensis is the most abundant fleshy-fruited shrub in the temperate forest of southern South America (TFSA). TFSA exhibits an environmental patchiness that could influence fruit abundance and animal behavior. Our objective was to determine the regeneration windows of A. chilensis, and to detect how forest structure and animal behavior could affect the spatial distribution of this species. We characterized forest structure in two plots that included mature forest, young forest, and open areas. We assessed the spatio-temporal distribution of A. chilensis fruits and studied fruit removal by animals. Also, we experimentally evaluated germination and post-dispersal seed predation. We developed a conceptual model to relate A. chilensis recruitment with forest successional stages. The fruiting individuals of this shrub were mostly located in fire-opened areas or forest gaps, and the seed rain generated by the migratory bird Elaenia albiceps was denser in these areas. In contrast, seed predation by rodents was higher in closed, young forest areas. A. chilensis recruitment follows a nucleation dynamic around fruiting females. Concerning forest succession, A. chilensis recruitment was higher near re-sprouting females in open areas, and lowest in young forests, where fruiting process was hindered by light constraints. When forests mature, new nucleation processes start around females surviving in gaps. We conclude that areas opened by disturbances provide a regeneration window for A. chilensis shrubs.

DE Bird community; Coffee Plantation; Characterization
ID COFFEE CERTIFICATION; CONSERVATION
AB Agricultural activities simplify the environment of vast areas, replacing the natural diversity of a small number of cultivable. Due to high production, the natural vegetation from Brazil suffers from these crops. Minas Gerais is the state leader in coffee production in Brazil and the Southern of Minas Gerais state more structured for this cultivation. Even though the birds community of south of Minas Gerais well studied, researches involving coffee landscapes and birds are almost nonexistent. The objective of the study is describe the richness and composition of the avifauna of coffee plantations in southern Minas Gerais and compare this diversity among different natural physiognomies (native forest) and anthropogenic (coffee plantations and disturbed areas). Richness, composition and similarity between the bird community of different physiognomies were analyzed. Transects were made within each area to record the species through direct observation, identification of vocalization and capture with mist-nets. Samples were taken from August, 17 to 21, 2010 (dry season) and March, 24 to 28, 2011 (rainy season), totaling 120 hours. In total, 189 bird species distributed into 47 families were recorded. These numbers are representative and we suggest new studies on coffee landscapes, because the association of well- preserved forests and coffee crops are able to maintain a high richness and composition of the avifauna.

AB As ecosystem engineers, ants can mediate soil processes and functions by producing biogenic structures. In their mounds, ants not only directly produce CO2 by respiration, but may also indirectly impact soil greenhouse gas emissions by affecting substrate availability and soil physicochemical characteristics. Recent studies focused on overall gas production from ant mounds. However, little is known about mound material respiration and N2O emissions in ant mounds in wetlands. We measured CO2 and N2O emissions from mound soils of three different ant species (Lasius niger Linnaeus, Lasius flavus Fabricius, and Formica candida Smith) and natural marsh soils in a laboratory incubation experiment. On the whole, average soil CO2 and N2O emission rates from ant mounds were significantly higher than from the natural marsh soils. Over the 64 days incubation, the cumulative soil CO2 and N2O production from ant mounds was, respectively, 1.5-3.0 and 1.9-50.2 times higher than from the natural soils. Soil gas emissions from ant mounds were significantly influenced by the specific ant species, with soil CO2 and N2O emissions from L. niger mounds being higher than those from F. candida or L. flavus mound soils. Cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions from ant mound soils were positively correlated with soil clay, total carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen and NH4+ content. Our laboratory results indicated that mound soil is an important source of CO2 and N2O emission from ant mounds in marshes, making mounds potential "hot spots" for CO2 and N2O emissions. Ants may increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil gas emissions by changing mound soil physicochemical properties, especially carbon and nutrition content, and soil texture. Contributions from ant mound materials should be considered when describing soil C and N cycles and their driving factors in wetland ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical canopies are known for their high abundance and diversity of ants. However, the factors which enable coexistence of so many species in trees, and in particular, the role of foragers in determining local diversity, are not well understood. We censused nesting and foraging arboreal ant communities in two 0.32 ha plots of primary and secondary lowland rainforest in New Guinea and explored their species diversity and composition. Null models were used to test if the records of species foraging (but not nesting) in a tree were dependent on the spatial distribution of nests in surrounding trees. In total, 102 ant species from 389 trees occurred in the primary plot compared with only 50 species from 295 trees in the secondary forest plot. However, there was only a small difference in mean ant richness per tree between primary and secondary forest (3.8 and 3.3 sp. respectively) and considerably lower richness per tree was found only when nests were considered (1.5 sp. in both forests). About half of foraging individuals collected in a tree belonged to species which were not nesting in that tree. Null models showed that the ants foraging but not nesting in a tree are more likely to nest in nearby trees than would be expected at random. The effects of both forest stage and tree size traits were similar regardless of whether only foragers, only nests, or both datasets combined were considered. However, relative abundance distributions of species differed between foraging and nesting communities. The primary forest plot was dominated by native ant species, whereas invasive species were common in secondary forest. This study demonstrates the high contribution of foragers to arboreal ant diversity, indicating an important role of connectivity between trees, and also highlights the importance of primary vegetation for the conservation of native ant communities.

AB Three regions along the Brazilian coast characterized by the occurrence of contrasting natural phenomena, such as upwellings and continental input, were surveyed to determine the composition and structure of the assemblage of swimming crabs. Twelve monthly collections were undertaken (July 2010 to June 2011) in Macae, Rio de Janeiro (MAC); Ubatuba, Sao Paulo (UBA); and Sao Francisco do Sul, Santa Catarina (SFS). The lowest values of the phi sediment grain size measure, bottom temperature and the highest values of organic matter and salinity were measured in MAC. In all, 10,686 individuals were collected, belonging to six species of Portunoidea: Arenaeus cribrarius, Callinectes danae, Callinectes ornatus, Callinectes sapidus, Achelous spinicarpus and Achelous spinimanus. A Multiple Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) test indicated that the species composition differed significantly among the sampling sites, showing substantial heterogeneity in the composition and abundance of species among regions. The results suggest that C. danae was more abundant in waters with lower salinity and lower organic matter content. In contrast, A. spinimanus is positively correlated with these factors, showing a greater abundance under the opposite conditions. Callinectes ornatus appeared not to show strong selectivity for particular habitat characteristics. We conclude from these findings that areas affected by different phenomena produce changes in the composition and abundance of the assemblage of Portunoidea. Although the strength of eutrophication differs between UBA and MAC, the substantial continental inflow affecting SFS favors the development of species that complete their life cycle in the estuary.

AB We were interested in how forest type and complexity of vegetation influence the diversity of canopy spiders in the rainforest of Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. We sampled spiders by fogging tree canopies in four replicate sites of five different forest types once in the middle of the rainy season, forest types were tropical seasonal rainforest; monsoon forest; mountain rainforest; Aporusa yunnanensis forest; and rubber plantation. From a total of 20 sites and 1000 m(2) projected area we collected 4999 adult spiders of 472 species. Vegetational structure (number of plant forms, such as herbs, shrubs, trees, epiphytes and lianas), tree coverage, shrub coverage, grass coverage, tree height and elevation characterize the environmental conditions in different types of forest. Species richness and mean abundance differed significantly between rubber plantations and natural habitats. Rubber plantations harbored only 42.6-50% of the spider species in the natural forests, and 63.8% of the species in the A. yunnanensis forests. Spider guild composition also differed among forest types. Sheet-line weavers dominated the spider assemblages in natural forests with complex vegetational structure, such as tropical seasonal rainforests and monsoon forests. In contrast, cursorial hunters dominated forests with a more simple structure, such as rubber plantations and A. yunnanensis forest. These results show that intensive management practices in rubber plantations decrease the complexity of the vegetation and, so, strongly influence the diversity and composition of canopy spider assemblages. A lower intensity of management and the restoration of native vegetation may help balance the opposing needs of economic development and biodiversity conservation in this region.

AB Background: Niche theory predicts that human disturbance should influence the assembly of communities, favouring functionally homogeneous communities dominated by few but widespread generalists. The decline and loss of specialists leaves communities with species that are functionally more similar. Evenness of species occupancy declines, such that species become either widespread of rare. These patterns have often been observed, but it is unclear if they are a general result of human disturbance or specific to communities that are rich in species, in complex, spatially heterogeneous environments where the problem has often been investigated. We therefore tested whether human disturbance impacts dominance/evenness of species occupancy in communities, specialism/generalism of species, and functional biotic homogenization in the spatially relatively homogeneous, species poor boreal forest region of Alberta, Canada. We investigated 371 boreal vascular plant communities varying 0 - 100% in proportion of human land use.
   Results: Rank species occupancy curves revealed high species dominance regardless of disturbance: within any disturbance class a few species occupied nearly every site and most species were found in a low proportion of sites. However, species were more widespread and displayed more even occupancy in intermediately disturbed communities than among communities of either low or high disturbance. We defined specialists and generalists based on turnover in co-occupants and thereby assessed impacts of human disturbance on specialization of species and community homogenization. Generalists were not disproportionately found at higher disturbance sites, and did not occupy more sites. Communities with greater human disturbance were not more functionally homogeneous; they did not harbor communities with more generalists.
   Conclusions: We unexpectedly did not observe strong linkages between species specialism/generalism and disturbance, nor between community homogenization and disturbance. These results contrast previous findings in more species rich, complex or spatially heterogeneous systems and ecological models. We suggest that broad occupancy-based intercommunity patterns are insensitive to human land use extent in boreal vascular plants, perhaps because of ubiquity of generalists, low species richness, and history of natural disturbance. The poor sensitivity of these metrics to disturbance presents challenges for monitoring and managing impacts to biodiversity in this region.

TI The stoichiometry of carbon and nutrients in peat formation
SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
LA English

ID NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; EVERGLADES; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE
AB Northern peatlands have stored large amounts (similar to 500 Pg) of carbon (C) since the last glaciation. Combined with peat C are nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K), each of which plays an important role in plant production, litter decomposition, and the biogeochemical functioning of peatlands. Yet little attention has been given to the amounts of these nutrients stored in northern peatlands and their stoichiometry with C. Here we use data on nutrient concentrations in over 400 peat profiles in Ontario, Canada, representing bogs, fens, and swamps and their vegetation. We show that the C:N ratio is high (>40:1) in vegetation and litter but declines through the peat profiles to reach ratios between 22:1 and 29:1 in peat below 50 cm. In contrast, the C:P ratio rises from vegetation and litter (500:1 to 1300:1) to 1500:1 to 2000:1 in the lower part of the peat profile. Ratios of C to Ca, Mg, and K vary with peatland type. Most of these stoichiometric changes occur in the early stages of organic matter decomposition, where the litter structure remains intact. We estimate that similar to 18 Pg of N has been stored in northern peatlands since deglaciation, reflecting high N accumulation rates (similar to 0.8 gm(-2) yr(-1)), whereas P accumulation is small (similar to 0.3 Pg, similar to 0.016 gm(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that P is quickly recycled in the surface layers.

DE Caspian Forest; road effects; plant species diversity; habitat
   fragmentation; environmentally sound techniques; Iran
ID VEGETATION
AB Forest roads facilitate various activities such as forest management, tending of forest, timber logging, and fire and pest control, but the fact remains that roads can interrupt the natural function of forest ecosystem. They divert water flow and increase the amount of sediment. They can also alter plant species composition. Furthermore, the network structure of roads divides the land to small patches, which ends in habitat fragmentation. In this study, which was carried out in the Hyrcanian Forest in the north of Iran, effects of a forest road on plant species diversity (including trees, saplings and herbs) was investigated on both cut and fill slopes. At 10 points along the road, toward the fill slope and cut slope, ten 100 meter transects perpendicular to the road were established. Within each transect, ten 10x10 in plots were sampled to record the tree and sapling species and ten 2 x 2 m plots to record the herbal species. Results showed that road segment had no significant effects on plant species diversity. Since the studied road is constructed using environmentally sound techniques and criteria, unnecessary cut and fill operations were avoided. The other factor is the width of the road, which is as narrow as possible, so the habitat fragmentation is not so considerable. The traffic on this road is also limited; therefore soil pollution does not affect plant composition. These items together with the ability of the Hyrcanian ecosystem to repair itself can mitigate negative effects of this road.

AB Herbivory can shape the dynamics of plant populations, including effects on survival and reproduction, and is in turn affected by environmental factors that vary in space and time. White-tailed deer are significant herbivores in North America that have been broadly documented to affect plant reproductive success. If variation in the frequency and impact of herbivory by deer correlates with a broad-scale latitudinal gradient, climactic effects may be important for shaping plant-herbivore interactions. Alternatively, a lack of broad-scale gradients would suggest local factors such as plant community composition and deer densities are affecting herbivory. To investigate broad-scale patterns of deer herbivory, we examined the frequency and reproductive consequences of deer browse over three years in 17 populations of Campanulastrum americanum spanning the latitudinal extent of its range. Even though deer are overabundant throughout the range of C. americanum, we found spatiotemporal variation in deer browse frequency (0-0.96, mean 0.46) and its effects on plant reproductive success. The four southernmost populations experienced high levels of herbivory, and were responsible for generating a negative relationship between latitude and herbivory. In general, patterns of variation in the frequency and impact of herbivory across the entire latitudinal gradient pointed to the importance of local rather than broad-scale factors. Within a population, deer consumed larger plants. Across many populations and years, average fitnesses of browsed and uneaten plants were similar, suggesting that plants are tolerant to browse. However, since large plants have greater reproductive success and are more likely to be browsed, tolerance may be influenced by plant size. When plant size was accounted for, most populations did not fully compensate for browsing. There was no relationship between browsing intensity and tolerance, suggesting that browsing may be too variable to consistently select for tolerance, or that increases in deer density are too recent for increased tolerance to evolve.

AB The tropical conservatism hypothesis (TCH) suggests that phylogenetic niche conservatism (the tendency for traits to be maintained during diversification) should be the main driver of latitudinal diversity gradients. For example, the tropical-temperate diversity gradient for woody angiosperms should reflect the tropical, older origin of most clades, the constrained evolution of cold tolerance, and the fact that few clades were able to persist in temperate zones after the beginning of the global cooling in the Eocene. Evidence for this explanation has been discussed primarily from a Northern Hemisphere perspective. Recently, two studies have presented diversity and clade-age relationships in South American forests that are inconsistent with the TCH, with older woody families being more frequent at higher latitudes and higher elevations in the Andes. We argue that a broader framework considering the ancient history of the Southern Hemisphere flora and the recent history of the Andean flora can help explain these discordant patterns. Here, we provide an initial discussion of this new perspective, emphasizing the historical development of a unique and rich palaeoflora of Gondwanan ancestry at mid-to high latitudes of South America and Antarctica. We suggest that the idea of Austral niche conservatism (ANC) of a warm-temperate Antarctic-South American biota should be explored further to improve our understanding of biogeographical patterns in the Southern Hemisphere.

AB Carbon forestry has become a cornerstone of attempted climate change mitigation in developing countries. As such, dozens of projects have been developed to supply carbon offsets to both voluntary and regulated carbon markets. In this paper we shed further light on the effects of such projects on communities and households by studying the implementation of a carbon forestry project in four communities in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. The project pays farmers to carry out a number of tree-planting activities depending on the local agro-ecological systems. We investigate how such activities have been promoted in and adopted by communities and we identify a series of community-based, institutional, resource management and asset-related factors that explain farmers' willingness to participate in the projects. Our analysis highlights a number of shared motivations for joining the project but varied levels of understanding about the project rationale. We also show how community norms, access to land tenure, financial and physical assets differ among participants and non-participants which translates in increasing inequalities in access to income and to other development projects. However, we also demonstrate that project activities, as currently designed, motivate some farmers to participate because of the potential of the project to act as a mechanism to bridge existing social divides through cooperation in the project and therefore financially and politically benefit from participation. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the project contributes to transforming local livelihoods and institutions, unfortunately not always as originally designed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Premise of the study: The ecological consequences of plant competition have frequently been tested, but the evolutionary outcomes of these interactions have gone largely unexplored. The study of species invasions can make an important contribution to this field of research by allowing us to watch ecological and evolutionary processes unfold as a novel species is integrated into a plant community. We explored the ecological and evolutionary impact of an invasive jewelweed, Impatiens glandulifera, on a closely related native congener, I. capensis and asked: (1) Does the presence of the invasive jewelweed alter the fitness of native jewelweed populations? (2) Does the invasive jewelweed affect the vegetative growth of the native congener? and (3) Does the invasive jewelweed alter phenotypic selection on the vegetative traits of the native congener?
   Methods: We used a greenhouse competition experiment, an invasive species removal field experiment, and a survey of natural populations.
   Key results: We show that when the invasive jewelweed is present, phenotypic selection favors native jewelweed individuals investing less in rapid upward growth and more in branching and fruiting potential through the production of nodes.
   Conclusions: This research demonstrates that invasive plants have the potential to greatly alter natural selection on native competitors. Studies investigating altered selection in invaded communities can reveal the potential evolutionary impact of invasive competitors, while deepening our understanding of the more general role of competition in driving plant evolution and permitting species coexistence.

AB To develop silvicultural guidelines for high-value timber species of Central African moist forests, we assessed the performance of the pioneer Milicia excelsa (iroko, Moraceae), and of the non-pioneer light demander Pericopsis elata (assamela, Fabaceae) in logging gaps and in plantations in highly degraded areas in south-eastern Cameroon. The survival and size of each seedling was regularly monitored in the silvicultural experiments. Differences in performance and allometry were tested between species in logging gaps and in plantations. The two species performance in logging gaps was significantly different from plantations and concurred with the expectations of the performance trade-off hypothesis but not with the expectations of species light requirements. The pioneer M.excelsa survived significantly better in logging gaps while the non-pioneer P. elata grew significantly faster in plantations. The high mortality and slow growth of M. excelsa in plantations is surprising for a pioneer species but could be explained by herbivory (attacks from a gall-making psyllid). Identifying high-value native timber species (i) with good performance in plantations such as P. elata is of importance to restore degraded areas; and (ii) with good performance in logging gaps such as M. excelsa is of importance to maintain timber resources and biodiversity in production forests.

TI Tenure Security and Land Appropriation under Changing Environmental
   Governance in Lowland Bolivia and Para
SO FORESTS
LA English
DT Article
ID STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; DEFORESTATION; AMAZON;
   CONSERVATION; ECONOMICS; FORESTS; BRAZIL
AB Appropriation of public lands associated with agricultural frontier expansion is a longstanding occurrence in the Amazon that has resulted in a highly skewed land-tenure structure in spite of recent state efforts to recognize tenure rights of indigenous people and smallholders living in or nearby forests. Growing concerns to reduce environmental impacts from agricultural development have motivated state governments to place greater attention on sustainable land management and forest conservation. This paper assesses the political and institutional conditions shaping tenure security and land appropriation in lowland Bolivia and the State of Para in Brazil, and their links with environmental governance. The two cases show that clarifying and securing tenure rights is considered as the cornerstone for improving environmental governance. Thus, much attention has been given to the recognition of indigenous people and smallholder rights and to legalization of large-scale estates in agricultural frontiers, which have in turn influenced emerging conservation and environmental governance approaches. While policy frameworks share similar goals in the two cases, contrasting implementation approaches have been adopted: more agrarian in lowland Bolivia and more conservationist in the State of Para.

AB Blackberries (Rubus subgenus Eubatus Focke) of the Eastern United States commonly grow along forest edges and in disturbed sites, though the potential for introducing improved cultivars into managed forest systems has been little explored in agroforestry literature. Bare root 'Illini Hardy' blackberry plants were grown under three neutral shade cloth levels (20, 50, and 70 % irradiance relative to full sunlight) and a full sun control in an orchard system over one growing season. The plants were then excavated from the shade plots and the floricanes forced to fruit in a heated greenhouse after receiving a chilling treatment consistent with data published about the cultivar. Potential yield reflected by primocane yield components was only marginally affected by the light treatments, with no significant differences in primocane counts, cane length, or the numbers of nodes. Cane diameter and attributes of primocane architecture were significant, affecting crown geometries and resulting in the highest percent light interception among plants grown at 70 % relative irradiance. Maximum net photosynthesis rates increased at higher irradiance levels with little increase above 70 % full sunlight, although no differences were observed in whole plant biomass or biomass allocation. Flowering and harvest periods were more concentrated from plants receiving 70-100 % relative irradiance during flower initiation. These results suggest that vegetative phases of 'Illini Hardy' blackberry may benefit from partial shading with an optimum light intensity approximating 70 % of full sunlight, but that floral bud differentiation is delayed or incomplete at lower irradiance levels produced by whole canopy or intracane shading.

AB Humans influence tropical rainforest animals directly via exploitation and indirectly via habitat disturbance. Bushmeat hunting and logging occur extensively in tropical forests and have large effects on particular species. But how they alter animal diversity across landscape scales and whether their impacts are correlated across species remain less known. We used spatially widespread measurements of mammal occurrence across Malaysian Borneo and recently developed multispecies hierarchical models to assess the species richness of medium- to large-bodied terrestrial mammals while accounting for imperfect detection of all species. Hunting was associated with 31% lower species richness. Moreover, hunting remained high even where richness was very low, highlighting that hunting pressure persisted even in chronically overhunted areas. Newly logged sites had 11% lower species richness than unlogged sites, but sites logged >10 years previously had richness levels similar to those in old-growth forest. Hunting was a more serious long-term threat than logging for 91% of primate and ungulate species. Hunting and logging impacts across species were not correlated across taxa. Negative impacts of hunting were the greatest for common mammalian species, but commonness versus rarity was not related to species-specific impacts of logging. Direct human impacts appeared highly persistent and lead to defaunation of certain areas. These impacts were particularly severe for species of ecological importance as seed dispersers and herbivores. Indirect impacts were also strong but appeared to attenuate more rapidly than previously thought. The lack of correlation between direct and indirect impacts across species highlights that multifaceted conservation strategies may be needed for mammal conservation in tropical rainforests, Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems. Correlacion y Persistencia de los Impactos de la Caza y la Tala sobre los Mamiferos de los Bosques Tropicales
   Resumen Los humanos influyen directamente sobre los animales de los bosques tropicales por medio de la explotacion e indirectamente por medio de la perturbacion de habitat. La caza de animales silvestres y la tala ocurren de manera extensiva en los bosques tropicales y tienen grandes efectos sobre especies particulares, pero sigue sin saberse como alteran la diversidad animal en las diferentes escalas de terrenos y si sus impactos estan correlacionados entre las especies. Usamos medidas espacialmente esparcidas de la presencia de mamiferos a lo largo del Borneo malayo y modelos jerarquicos de multiples especies desarrollados recientemente para evaluar la riqueza de especies de mamiferos terrestres de tamanos medianos a grandes mientras representamos la deteccion imperfecta de todas las especias. La caza se asocio con el 31% de la riqueza mas baja de especies. Ademas, la caza siguio siendo alta incluso cuando la riqueza fue muy baja, resaltando como la presion de la caza persiste en areas con exceso cronico de caza. Los sitios recien talados tuvieron un 11% de riqueza de especies mas baja que los sitios sin tala, pero los sitios talados previamente durante mas de 10 anos tuvieron niveles de riqueza similares a aquellos en los bosques de crecimiento viejo. La caza fue una mayor amenaza a largo plazo que la tala para 91% de las especies de primates y ungulados. Los impactos de la caza y la tala en las especies no estuvieron correlacionados en los taxones. Los impactos negativos de la caza fueron mayores para las especies de mamiferos mas comunes, pero la frecuencia contra la rareza no estuvo relacionada con los impactos especificos de especie de la tala. Los impactos humanos directos aparecieron persistentemente y resultaron en la perdida de fauna de ciertas areas. Estos impactos fueron particularmente severos para especies de importancia ecologica como los dispersores de semillas y los herbivoros. Los impactos indirectos tambien fueron severos pero parecieron atenuarse mas rapido de lo que se pensaba anteriormente. La falta de correlacion entre los impactos directos e indirectos en las especies resalta que las estrategias de conservacion multifaceticas pueden ser necesarias para la conservacion de mamiferos en los bosques tropicales, los ecosistemas mas biodiversos del planeta.

AB In most arid ecosystems, the vegetation is organized into two-phase mosaics, where high-cover vegetation patches are interspersed in a matrix of low plant cover. We studied the role of the biotic interaction balance (competition/facilitation) between shrubs and grasses as a driver of patch dynamics and maintenance of two-phase vegetation mosaics. Following Watt's seminal model, we conducted two field experiments in which we manipulated different vegetation patches to obtain the different stages along the building and degradation dynamics of high-cover patches. In addition we applied two possible belowground competition treatments (natural and experimentally reduced). We measured plant variables (emergence, survival, height, flower culms) on grass seedlings and transplants. We integrated all plant measurements into a single positive and negative component, to calculate the net balance along three stages of the patch dynamics proposed. The net biotic interaction balance was negative during the early and mature stages of high-cover patches because the average standardized effect from the negative component was below -0.44, while the positive component was not different from zero. However, the net biotic interaction balance was positive during the degraded stages of high-cover patches because the negative average component was -0.37, while the positive component reached 0.58. The negative net effects during early and mature stages of high-cover patches can be explained by the occurrence of wet years, because high rainfalls hide the aboveground facilitation. Our findings point out the importance of complementary mechanisms to the interaction balance in the mosaic maintenance (e.g. trapping of seeds by shrubs) according to the inter-annual rainfall variability.

AB The niche is a fundamental ecological concept that underpins many explanations of patterns of biodiversity. The complexity of niche processes in ecological systems, however, means that it is difficult to capture them accurately in theoretical models of community assembly. In this study, we build upon simple neutral biodiversity models by adding the important ingredient of overlapping niche structure. Our model is spatially implicit and contains a fixed number of equal-sized habitats. Each species in the metacommunity arises through a speciation event; at which time, it is randomly assigned a fundamental niche or set of environments/habitats in which it can persist. Within each habitat, species compete with other species that have different but overlapping fundamental niches. Species abundances then change through ecological drift; each, however, is constrained by its maximum niche breadth and by the presence of other species in its habitats. Using our model, we derive analytical expressions for steady-state species abundance distributions, steady-state distributions of niche breadth across individuals and across species, and dynamic distributions of niche breadth across species. With this framework, we identify the conditions that produce the log-series species abundance distribution familiar from neutral models. We then identify how overlapping niche structure can lead to other species abundance distributions and, in particular, ask whether these new distributions differ significantly from species abundance distributions predicted by non-overlapping niche models. Finally, we extend our analysis to consider additional distributions associated with realized niche breadths. Overall, our results show that models with overlapping niches can exhibit behavior similar to neutral models, with the caveat that species with narrow fundamental niche breadths will be very rare. If narrow-niche species are common, it must be because they are in a non-overlapping niche or have countervailing advantages over broad-niche species. This result highlights the role that niches can play in establishing demographic neutrality.

AB We tested the role of interspecific competition in driving species distribution at multiple spatial scales using two sibling species of Galerida larks (G. cristata and G. theklae) in Morocco (sympatry), Balearic islands (G. theklae only) and Israel (G. cristata only). We first investigated regional-scale determinants by contrasting allopatric versus sympatric patterns in five distinct habitat types. We next focused on a single habitat used by both species, the coastal sand dunes. Dune quadrats were established along the Moroccan coast and completed by a quadrat in the nearest distinct landscape habitat. Poisson regressions were used to model Galerida counts together with ecological predictors as concerns the climate, topography, vegetation structure and soil granulometry. At the local scale, both species preferred grey dunes over white sand dunes, and both were negatively affected by the abundance of the congeneric species in the dune. However, we found that G. theklae tended to replace G. cristata in more arid sand dunes, even if the transition was not strictly clinal. Instead, the transition occurred when the surrounding landscape changed from coastal wetlands to bathas (grasslands with shrubs), highlighting the importance of habitat composition at the landscape scale. The fact that G. cristata used bathas in allopatry, but not in sympatry, suggested that the competitive environment contributed to determine sand dune occupancy. We suggest that landscape-level effects may be pivotal in explaining species distribution not only at the local scale, by affecting the pool of potential immigrants, but also at the regional scale, by contributing to species' range limit

AB The proper balance between costly monitoring and non-compliance have often been studied, however, the costs of monitoring from landowners' perspective have only received little attention. We designed a Choice Experiment where landowners expressed their willingness to accept afforestation contracts with varying attributes, one of them being the likelihood of being monitored. Based on agency and social preference theory, respectively, we formulated a model allowing us to test alternative hypotheses regarding landowners' behaviour. The first hypothesis was that landowners may plan not to comply if optimal, which makes monitoring increasingly unwelcome as the contract sum increases. The second hypothesis was that landowners plan to comply and consider monitoring increasingly fair as the contract sum increases. The hypotheses were tested using a discrete mixture RPL model, where three parameters were estimated for an interaction effect between monitoring probability and contract sum (one fixed to zero and two varied freely). Both free parameters were positive and significant, indicating that landowners tend to find monitoring less of a negative feature, the higher the contract sum - suggesting that a group of landowners show social preferences. A latent class model further corroborated that conclusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that pathogens and arthropod herbivores attacking the same host plant may affect each other. Little is known, however, about their combined impact on plant fitness, which may differ from simple additive expectations. In a 2-year common garden field experiment, we tested whether the pathogen Albugo sp. (white blister rust) and the herbivorous flea beetle Phyllotreta nemorum affected each other's performance on two resistance types (G-type and P-type) of the crucifer Barbarea vulgaris ssp. arcuata, and whether biomass, reproduction and survival of the plants were affected by interactive impacts of the antagonists. Most of the insect-resistant G-plants were severely affected by white rust, which reduced biomass and reproductive potential compared to the controls. However, when also exposed to flea beetles, biomass loss was mitigated in G-plants, even though apparent disease symptoms were not reduced. Most of the insect-susceptible P-plants were resistant to white rust; however, the number of flea beetle mines tended to increase in plants also exposed to Albugo, and biomass at the last harvest was slightly lower in the combined treatment. Thus, interactive impacts of the herbivore and pathogen differed between the two resistance types, with an antagonistic combined impact in G-plants, which lasted surprisingly long, and a slight synergistic impact in P-plants.

AB Lianas are an important component of tropical forests, contributing up to 25 % of the woody stems and 35 % of woody species diversity. Lianas invest less in structural support but more in leaves compared to trees of similar biomass. These physiological and morphological differences suggest that lianas may interact with neighboring plants in ways that are different from similarly sized trees. However, the vast majority of past liana competition studies have failed to identify the unique competitive effects of lianas by controlling for the amount of biomass removed. We assessed liana competition in the forest understory over the course of 3 years by removing liana biomass and an equal amount of tree biomass in 40 plots at 10 sites in a secondary tropical moist forest in central Panama. We found that growth of understory trees and lianas, as well as planted seedlings, was limited due to competitive effects from both lianas and trees, though the competitive impacts varied by species, season, and size of neighbors. The removal of trees resulted in greater survival of planted seedlings compared to the removal of lianas, apparently related to a greater release from competition for light. In contrast, lianas had a species-specific negative effect on drought-tolerant Dipteryx oleifera seedlings during the dry season, potentially due to competition for water. We conclude that, at local scales, lianas and trees have unique and differential effects on understory dynamics, with lianas potentially competing more strongly during the dry season, and trees competing more strongly for light.

AB The tropical tree Cariniana pyriformis that grows in the rainforest of the Colombian Darien Gap has annual rings sensitive to precipitation and to ENSO and dual porosity: diffuse, and semi-ring-porous.
   We conducted a dendrochronological study of the species Cariniana pyriformis (Abarco), which grows in the tropical rainforests of the Colombian Pacific. We used cross sections of 13 trees, from which we measured the widths of the rings of 33 series using standard dendrochronological procedures. We found that this species has distinct annual rings and dual porosity: diffuse and semi-ring-porous. The average correlation between the individual series and the mean chronology (mean intercorrelation) was 0.49 (P = 0.01). The calculated residual chronology is reliable according to several different indices (expressed population signal = 0.92; common signal percentage = 92 %; signal-to-noise ratio = 11.52; mean sensitivity = 0.22). The chronology was insensitive to the annual and monthly mean temperatures. However, the residual chronology was positively correlated with the annual rainfall (r = 0.33, P = 0.046) and the monthly rainfall from May (r = 0.34, P = 0.039) and September (r = 0.32, P = 0.054) as well as the annual (r = 0.34, P = 0.004) SOI (Southern Oscillation Index) and the monthly SOI values during January, March, April, October and November (r between 0.28 and 0.32, P between 0.012 and 0.032). Using the MEI (Multivariate ENSO Index) and ONI (Oceanic El Nio Index) indices, we also found significant correlations, though these were negative trends (r = -0.38, P = 0.0019 and r = -0.35, P = 0.0042, respectively); both indices exhibited better monthly correlations during the first 5 months of the year (r >= -0.33, P <= 0.01).

AB Tidal marshes are narrow wetlands distributed worldwide between the ocean and a variety of inland-habitats. The high diversity of interacting terrestrial habitats may influence terrestrial species composition and abundance in marshes. We investigated if characteristics of small mammal assemblages inhabiting the South-West-Atlantic (SWA) marshes are influenced by marsh characteristics, or if they vary in relation to changes in the inland biogeographic context. Sampling at five-Spartina marshes across the SWA-coast showed that plant cover, richness and height (ANOVA analysis) and small mammal assemblages (PERMANOVA analysis) differed between habitats (marsh or inland) depending on the site. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) showed that abundance of small mammals in marshes is related to vegetation cover and diversity. However, its richness was related to the richness of small mammal at the inland habitats. In fact, species present in each marsh were also recorded in adjacent inland habitats. Species composition differed among similar marshes surrounded by different landscapes, while those in the same landscape did not. Consequently, regional abundance of small mammals in SWA-marshes is consistent with ecological sorting of abundance ranges along environmental gradients (e.g., plant-cover and richness). In contrast, landscape composition and configuration strongly affect marsh small mammal species assemblages, even if the marsh-habitats are quite similar.

AB In forest-grassland mosaics, patches can result from two processes: forest expansion over grassy ecosystems and forest fragmentation. We tested the hypothesis that patches produced by these processes differed in structure and spatial context in a forest-grassland mosaic in the southern Brazilian highlands. We compared a present-day land cover map with a past vegetation map to identify natural forest patches and forest fragments. Patches were described according to structure (size, core area and shape metrics) and spatial context (distance from roads and urban areas, edge contrast). Principal component analyses were used to examine gradients of patch types, and differences were tested by analysis of variance with randomization test. We found 878 natural patches and 214 fragments. Natural forest patches, riparian forest patches and forest fragments differed in structure and spatial context. In comparison to natural forest patches, fragments tend to be larger, with larger core areas, and more irregular and complex in shape. Fragments are situated in a different spatial context, tending to be closer to roads and urban areas and to present higher edge contrast. Riparian natural forest patches are similar to natural forest patches, except for shape. The smaller area and regular shape of natural patches probably result from the mechanisms involved in nucleus formation in the grassland matrix and from current grassland management. Natural patches are less exposed to some anthropogenic stresses, since most of them remain in a native grassland matrix context. Our results show that inferring process from pattern is not trivial, because different processes - forest expansion and forest fragmentation - may lead to either distinct or similar patterns of patch shape and spatial context. Studying patch structure and spatial context may then provide further insight into understanding changes in vegetation pattern at landscape scale, and in disentangling the effects of concurrent processes.

AB Intercropping is a practical way to increase plant diversity in agroecosystems and provide alternative food and habitat to arthropods, including generalist predators. In tropical agriculture, ants are important predators and have complex and often strong effects on pests. With the goal of optimizing control of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, we studied maize (Zea mays), cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium), and bottle gou rd (Lagenaria siceraria) as intercrops in a plantain field in Cameroon. We analyzed the effects of intercropping on ant abundance (by taxon) and on the damage caused by C. sordidus larvae to plantain corms. We also analyzed the relationship between ant abundance and C. sordidus damage. When added singly, the three intercropped plants significantly affected the abundance of each of the seven ant taxa but the sign of the effect depended on the intercropped plant species and on the ant taxon. Intercropping had clear effects on ant abundance, which was negatively correlated with C. sordidus damage for the Myrmicinae and positively correlated for the Formicinae and Ponerinae. Intercropping in plantain agroecosystems has the potential to alter ant community structure which contributes to C. sordidus control, but the effect of intercropped plant species remain unclear and further investigations are needed.

AB Background and Aims Empirical studies and allometric partitioning (AP) theory indicate that plant aboveground biomass (M-A) scales, on average, one-to-one (isometrically) with below-ground biomass (M-R) at the level of individual trees and at the level of entire forest communities. However, the ability of the AP theory to predict the biomass allocation patterns of understorey plants has not been established because most previous empirical tests have focused on canopy tree species or very large shrubs.
   Methods In order to test the AP theory further, 1586 understorey sub-tropical forest plants from 30 sites in southeast China were harvested and examined. The numerical values of the scaling exponents and normalization constants (i.e. slopes and y-intercepts, respectively) of log-log linear M-A vs. M-R relationships were determined for all individual plants, for each site, across the entire data set, and for data sorted into a total of 19 sub-sets of forest types and successional stages. Similar comparisons of M-A/M-R were also made.
   Key Results The data revealed that the mean M-A/M-R of understorey plants was 2.44 and 1.57 across all 1586 plants and for all communities, respectively, and M-A scaled nearly isometrically with respect to M-R, with scaling exponents of 1.01 for all individual plants and 0.99 for all communities. The scaling exponents did not differ significantly among different forest types or successional stages, but the normalization constants did, and were positively correlated with M-A/M-R and negatively correlated with scaling exponents across all 1586 plants.
   Conclusions The results support the AP theory's prediction that M-A scales nearly one-to-one with M-R (i.e. M-A proportional to M-R (approximate to 1.0)) and that plant biomass partitioning for individual plants and at the community level share a strikingly similar pattern, at least for the understorey plants examined in this study. Furthermore, variation in environmental conditions appears to affect the numerical values of normalization constants, but not the scaling exponents of the M-A vs. M-R relationship. This feature of the results suggests that plant size is the primary driver of the M-A vs. M-R biomass allocation pattern for understorey plants in sub-tropical forests.

AB The potential impacts of payments for environmental services (PES) and protected areas (PAs) on environmental outcomes and local livelihoods in developing countries are contentious and have been widely debated. The available evidence is sparse, with few rigorous evaluations of the environmental and social impacts of PAs and particularly of PES. We measured the impacts on forests and human well-being of three different PES programs instituted within two PAs in northern Cambodia, using a panel of intervention villages and matched controls. Both PES and PAs delivered additional environmental outcomes relative to the counterfactual: reducing deforestation rates significantly relative to controls. PAs increased security of access to land and forest resources for local households, benefiting forest resource users but restricting households' ability to expand and diversify their agriculture. The impacts of PES on household well-being were related to the magnitude of the payments provided. The two higher paying market-linked PES programs had significant positive impacts, whereas a lower paying program that targeted biodiversity protection had no detectable effect on livelihoods, despite its positive environmental outcomes. Households that signed up for the higher paying PES programs, however, typically needed more capital assets; hence, they were less poor and more food secure than other villagers. Therefore, whereas the impacts of PAs on household well-being were limited overall and varied between livelihood strategies, the PES programs had significant positive impacts on livelihoods for those that could afford to participate. Our results are consistent with theories that PES, when designed appropriately, can be a powerful new tool for delivering conservation goals whilst benefiting local people.
   El Impacto de los Pagos por Servicios Ambientales y areas Protegidas sobre la Subsistencia Local y la Conservacion del Bosque en el Norte de Camboya Los impactos potenciales de los pagos por servicios ambientales (PSA) y areas protegidas (APs) sobre los resultados ambientales y las subsistencias locales en los paises en desarrollo son polemicos y se han debatido ampliamente. La evidencia disponible es escasa; ha habido pocas evaluaciones rigurosas de los impactos ambientales y sociales de las APs y particularmente los PSA. Medimos el impacto sobre los bosques y el bienestar humano en tres diferentes programas de PSA que se llevan a cabo dentro de dos APs en el norte de Camboya usando un panel de aldeas de intervencion y controles emparejados. Tanto los PSA como las APs brindaron resultados ambientales adicionales en relacion a los contrafacticos, esto quiere decir que redujeron las tasas de deforestacion significativamente en relacion a los controles. Las areas protegidas incrementaron el acceso seguro a los recursos del suelo y el bosque para las viviendas locales, beneficiando a los usuarios de los recursos del bosque pero restringiendo la habilidad de las viviendas para expandirse y diversificar su agricultura. Los impactos de los pagos por servicios ambientales sobre el bienestar de las viviendas estuvieron relacionados con la magnitud de los pagos proporcionados. Los dos programas de PSA de mayor paga y con conexion al mercado tuvieron impactos positivos significativos, mientras que un programa de menor paga con el objetivo de proteger a la biodiversidad no tuvo un efecto detectable sobre las viviendas, a pesar de sus resultados ambientales positivos. Las viviendas que se inscribieron a los programas de PSA con mayor paga, sin embargo, necesitaban tipicamente mas bienes capitales, por lo que eran menos pobres y tenian mayor seguridad alimentaria que otros aldeanos. Por esto, mientras los impactos de las APs sobre el bienestar de las viviendas fueron limitados en general y variaron dependiendo de las estrategias de subsistencia, los programas de PSA tuvieron impactos positivos significativos sobre las viviendas para aquellos que podian costear participar. Nuestros resultados son congruentes con las teorias de que los PSA, cuando se designan apropiadamente, pueden ser una herramienta poderosa y novedosa para obtener objetivos de conservacion mientras se beneficia a la gente local.

AB The relative roles of historical processes, environmental filtering, and ecological interactions in the organization of species assemblages vary depending on the spatial scale. We evaluated the phylogenetic and morphological relationships between species and individuals (i.e., inter- and intraspecific variability) of Neotropical nonvolant small mammals coexisting in grassland-forest ecotones, in landscapes and in regions, that is, three different scales. We used a phylogenetic tree to infer evolutionary relationships, and morphological traits as indicators of performance and niche similarities between species and individuals. Subsequently, we applied phylogenetic and morphologic indexes of diversity and distance between species to evaluate small mammal assemblage structures on the three scales. The results indicated a repulsion pattern near forest edges, showing that phylogenetically similar species coexisted less often than expected by chance. The strategies for niche differentiation might explain the phylogenetic repulsion observed at the edge. Phylogenetic and morphological clustering in the grassland and at the forest interior indicated the coexistence of closely related and ecologically similar species and individuals. Coexistence patterns were similar whether species-trait values or individual values were used. At the landscape and regional scales, assemblages showed a predominant pattern of phylogenetic and morphological clustering. Environmental filters influenced the coexistence patterns at three scales, showing the importance of phylogenetically conserved ecological tolerances in enabling taxa co-occurrence. Evidence of phylogenetic repulsion in one region indicated that other processes beyond environmental filtering are important for community assembly at broad scales. Finally, ecological interactions and environmental filtering seemed important at the local scale, while environmental filtering and historical colonization seemed important for community assembly at broader scales.

AB Forests around the world are increasingly fragmented, and edge effects on forest microclimates have the potential to affect ecosystem functions such as carbon and nutrient cycling. Edges tend to be drier and warmer due to the effects of insolation, wind, and evapotranspiration and these gradients can penetrate hundreds of metres into the forest. Litter decomposition is a key component of the carbon cycle, which is largely controlled by saprotrophic fungi that respond to variation in temperature and moisture. However, the impact of forest fragmentation on litter decay is poorly understood. Here, we investigate edge effects on the decay of wood in a temperate forest using an experimental approach, whereby mass loss in wood blocks placed along 100m transects from the forest edge to core was monitored over 2years. Decomposition rate increased with distance from the edge, and was correlated with increasing humidity and moisture content of the decaying wood, such that the decay constant at 100m was nearly twice that at the edge. Mean air temperature decreased slightly with distance from the edge. The variation in decay constant due to edge effects was larger than that expected from any reasonable estimates of climatic variation, based on a published regional model. We modelled the influence of edge effects on the decay constant at the landscape scale using functions for forest area within different distances from edge across the UK. We found that taking edge effects into account would decrease the decay rate by nearly one quarter, compared with estimates that assumed no edge effect.

AB Plant-soil negative feedback (NF) is recognized as an important factor affecting plant communities. The objectives of this work were to assess the effects of litter phytotoxicity and autotoxicity on root proliferation, and to test the hypothesis that DNA is a driver of litter autotoxicity and plant-soil NF. The inhibitory effect of decomposed litter was studied in different bioassays. Litter biochemical changes were evaluated with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. DNA accumulation in litter and soil was measured and DNA toxicity was assessed in laboratory experiments. Undecomposed litter caused nonspecific inhibition of root growth, while autotoxicity was produced by aged litter. The addition of activated carbon (AC) removed phytotoxicity, but was ineffective against autotoxicity. Phytotoxicity was related to known labile allelopathic compounds. Restricted C-13 NMR signals related to nucleic acids were the only ones negatively correlated with root growth on conspecific substrates. DNA accumulation was observed in both litter decomposition and soil history experiments. Extracted total DNA showed evident species-specific toxicity. Results indicate a general occurrence of litter autotoxicity related to the exposure to fragmented self-DNA. The evidence also suggests the involvement of accumulated extracellular DNA in plant-soil NF. Further studies are needed to further investigate this unexpected function of extracellular DNA at the ecosystem level and related cellular and molecular mechanisms.

AB In the field, leaves may face very different light intensities within the tree canopy. Leaves usually respond with light-induced morphological and photosynthetic changes, in a phenomenon known as phenotypic plasticity. Canopy light distribution, leaf anatomy, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and pigment composition were investigated in an olive (Olea europaea, cvs. Arbequina and Arbosana) orchard planted with a high-density system (1,250 trees ha(-1)). Sampling was made from three canopy zones: a lower canopy (< 1 m), a central one (1-2 m), and an upper one (> 2 m). Light interception decreased significantly in the lower canopy when compared to the central and top ones. Leaf angle increased and photosynthetic rates and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) decreased significantly and progressively from the upper canopy to the central and the lower canopies. The largest leaf areas were found in the lower canopy, especially in the cultivar Arbequina. The palisade and spongy parenchyma were reduced in thickness in the lower canopy when compared to the upper one, in the former due to a decrease in the number of cell layers from three to two (clearly distinguishable in the light and fluorescence microscopy images). In both cultivars, the concentration of violaxanthin-cycle pigments and beta-carotene was higher in the upper than in the lower canopy. Furthermore, the de-epoxidized forms zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin increased significantly in those leaves from the upper canopy, in parallel to the NPQ increases. In conclusion, olive leaves react with morphological and photosynthetic changes to within-crown light gradients. These results strengthen the idea of olive trees as "modular organisms" that adjust the modules morphology and physiology in response to light intensity.

AB Grazing exclusion practices can be promising restoration techniques where ecosystem degradation follows from rapidly increasing grazing pressure, as widely observed in northern Chinese grasslands. However, the mechanisms of plant-soil interactions responsible for nutrient cycling restoration remain unclear.
   We examined the functional response of the two most dominant grass species with contrasting nutrient economies to a grazing exclusion chronosequence varying greatly in soil moisture and extractable N and P.
   The relative biomass of the nutrient acquisitive species Leymus chinensis increased while that of the nutrient conservative Stipa grandis decreased across the chronosequence. Leymus chinensis displayed increasing leaf nutrient concentration and decreasing nutrient resorption with time since grazing exclusion for both N and P. In contrast, S. grandis showed decreasing leaf N and P concentrations and largely stable nutrient resorption.
   These differences in plasticity, with respect to nutrient stoichiometry and resorption, suggest contrasting abilities of these two dominant species to compete for soil resources and/or differences in their affinity to the changing forms of soil available N and P likely occurring along the restoration gradient. Ecosystem trajectory of change after grazing exclusion appears therefore largely dependent on the nutrient use strategies of co-occurring dominant grassland species.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition is predicted to impact on the structure and functioning of Mediterranean ecosystems. In this study, we measured plant species composition, production and root phosphatase activity in a field experiment in which N (0, 10, 20 and 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) was added since October 2007 to a semiarid shrubland in central Spain. The characteristically dominant annual forb element responded negatively to N after similar to 2.5 and similar to 3.5 years. In contrast, the nitrophilous element (mainly crucifers) increased with N after similar to 2.5 and similar to 5.5 years, a response controlled by between-year variations in rainfall and the heterogeneous distribution of P availability. We also described a hierarchy of factors driving the structure and composition of the plant community: soil fertility was the most important driver, whereas calcareousness/acidity of soils and shrub cover played a secondary role; finally, N deposition contributed to explain a smaller fraction of the total variance, and its effects were predominantly negative, which was attributed to ammonium toxicity. Root phosphatase activity of three species was not responsive to N after similar to 2.5 years but there was a negative relationship with soil P in two of them. We conclude that increased N deposition in semiarid Mediterranean ecosystems of Europe can contribute to cause a shift in plant communities associated with an increase in the nitrophilous element and with a decline in abundance of various forb species adapted to the local conditions.

AB We propose a new approach for identification of areas of endemism, the Geographical Interpolation of Endemism (GIE), based on kernel spatial interpolation. This method differs from others in being independent of grid cells. This new approach is based on estimating the overlap between the distribution of species through a kernel interpolation of centroids of species distribution and areas of influence defined from the distance between the centroid and the farthest point of occurrence of each species. We used this method to delimit areas of endemism of spiders from Brazil. To assess the effectiveness of GIE, we analyzed the same data using Parsimony Analysis of Endemism and NDM and compared the areas identified through each method. The analyses using GIE identified 101 areas of endemism of spiders in Brazil GIE demonstrated to be effective in identifying areas of endemism in multiple scales, with fuzzy edges and supported by more synendemic species than in the other methods. The areas of endemism identified with GIE were generally congruent with those identified for other taxonomic groups, suggesting that common processes can be responsible for the origin and maintenance of these biogeographic units.

AB Secondary forests cover large areas and are strong carbon sinks in tropical regions. They are important for ecosystem functioning, biodiversity conservation, watershed protection, and recovery of soil fertility. In this study, we used the Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record (CDR) product from 16 Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat-5 images (1984-2010) to continuously track the secondary succession (SS) of a forest following land abandonment in 1980. Changes in canopy structure and floristic composition were analysed using data from four field inventories (1995, 2002, 2007, and 2012). To characterize variations in brightness, greenness, spectral reflectance, and shadows with the natural regeneration of vegetation, we applied tasselled cap transformations, principal component analysis (PCA), and linear spectral mixture models to the TM datasets. Shade fractions were plotted over time and correlated with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Because image texture may reflect the variability of the successional process, eight co-occurrence-based filter metrics were calculated for selected TM bands and plotted as a function of time since abandonment. The successional forest was compared to a nearby primary reference forest (PF) and had differences in the spectral and textural means evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed increases of 35% and 10.4% over time in basal area and tree height, respectively. Species richness within the assemblage of sampling units increased from 14 to 71 between 1995 and 2012, and this trend was also confirmed using an individual-based rarefaction analysis. Species richness in 2012 was still lower than that observed in the PF site, which presented greater amounts of aboveground biomass (336.4 + 17.0 ton ha(-1) for PF versus 98.5 + 21.4 ton ha(-1) for SS in 2012). Brightness and greenness tasselled cap differences between the SS and PF rapidly decreased from 1984 (SS at the age of 4 years) to 1991 (age of 11 years). Brightness also decreased from 1997 to 2003, as indicated by PC1 scores and surface reflectance of the TM bands 4 (near infrared) and 5 (shortwave infrared). Spectral mixture shade fraction increased from young to old successional stages with strata composition and canopy structure development, whereas NDVI and EVI decreased over time. Because EVI was strongly dependent on near infrared reflectance (r = + 0.96), it was also much more strongly correlated with the shade fraction (r = -0.93) than NDVI. Except for the image texture mean that decreased from young to old successional stages in TM bands 4 and 5, no clear trend was observed in the remaining texturemetrics over the time period of vegetation regeneration. Overall, due to structural-floristic and spectral/textural differences with the PF, the SS site was still distinguishable using Landsat data 30 years after land abandonment. Most of the spectral metric means between PF and SS were significantly different over time at 0.01 significance level, as indicated by ANOVA.

AB Virua National Park is located on the Guyana Shield, an area known for its high levels of biodiversity and endemism. Furthermore, the Brazilian portion of the Guyana Shield is very poorly known, so that floristic studies are needed to know the local distribution of the species. The aim of this study is to survey the species of Orchidaceae from Virua National Park, Roraima State, Brazil. Orchidaceae are represented in the study area by 67 species and 45 genera. Epidendrum L. (9 spp.) and Catasetum Rich. ex Kunth (5 spp.) are the most diverse genera. These species comprise about 25% of the species and about 50% of the genera cited for the state of Roraima, northern Brazil, and include 19 new species records for the state. The dense forest ("terra-firme" and flooded forests) is more diverse (56 spp.) than the "campinarana" vegetation (13 spp.), and both share only a single species. Descriptions, illustrations, ecological comments, geographical distribution and an identification key are provided.

AB Ectotherms use specialized behavior to balance amelioration of environmental temperature stress against the need to forage. The intertidal snail Nucella ostrina risks aerial exposure at low tide to feed on the barnacle Balanus glandula. We hypothesized that N. ostrina foraging behavior would be constrained by duration and timing of low tide exposure. We added snails to intertidal blocks on San Juan Island, Washington, USA, and forced them to choose between barnacles placed on the western or eastern face of each block, or to shelter and forgo foraging. Snail behavior and barnacle mortality were monitored daily for 8 wk during summer 2011. N. ostrina foraging peaked every 2 wk, when temperature was minimized by tidal cycling. Low tide timing determined which substrate orientation was coolest and coincided with the proportion of snails foraging on one substrate face or the other: snails foraged on the western faces on days with morning low tides and on eastern faces on days with afternoon low tides. Barnacle consumption rates mirrored this spatiotemporal foraging pattern. Our conceptual model predicted mobile organism presence and location: snails foraged during the days of the tidal cycle least likely to be hot and selected the coolest available surface when foraging. These results suggest that N. ostrina alters foraging behavior to minimize risk of exposure to high temperatures or other emersion stresses. Consequently, predation on barnacles varies over space and time. This spatiotemporal behavior may buffer warming air temperatures and should be considered in models of coastal population and community dynamics.

AB Background: The Atlantic Forest biome is a top hotspot for conservation priorities, but the variations in fern species composition and the factors driving these are still poorly known. The vegetation gradient found in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, constitutes an interesting environmental model for examining such patterns.
   Aims: We analysed the variation in fern species composition across a vegetation gradient in the southern Atlantic Forest and the variables that might influence it.
   Methods: We applied cluster analysis (TWINSPAN and WPGMA), ordination (DCA), regression (OLS and GWR) and variance partitioning to species occurrence, environmental and spatial data in 40 sample units (50x50km(2)), using metadata.
   Results: Bioclimatic variables, mainly those related to humidity (water being an essential medium for fern reproduction), and geographic distance were related to variation in fern species composition. Dispersal constraints, probably related to neutral processes, could be evoked to explain the significance of the geographic distance. Overall, a great deal of uncertainty remained with regard to the determinants of floristic composition.
   Conclusions: Our study emphasises, for the first time in the Atlantic Forest, a significant role of environmental determinism and dispersal constraints on the variation of fern species composition.

AB Three new species of hyporheic Parastenocarididae from Turkey and Thailand are described in this paper, based on their morphological features. Kinnecaris xanthi sp. nov. and Kinnecaris draconis sp. nov. were collected in Anatolic Turkey, respectively from one and two rivers; Kinnecaris iulianae sp. nov. was collected from several streams on Pha-Ngan Island (Thailand). The two new species from Turkey both lack the typical pitted integument and their P5 fused with the intercoxal sclerite in both sexes; they share a similar shape of the caudal rami in both sexes and of P4 in male. They differ in the ornamentation of the genital double-somite and the armature of A1 in females; in the ornamentation of the anal operculum; in the shape of P2 endopod of both sexes, and P3 endopod of females; in the ornamentation of the first exopodal segment of P3 in males, and in the armature of P4 endopod in females. Kinnecaris iulianae sp. nov. shares with the other species from the Oriental and Australian Region the presence of a pitted cuticle, the size and shape of caudal rami and the shape and ornamentation of P3 in the males, and is characterized by the ventral ornamentation of the genital double-somite and urosomites of the females, and by the lack of ornamentation at the insertion of the P4 endopod of both sexes. The descriptions of these three new Kinnecaris widen the distribution of the genus which, so far, was considered Gondwanian. In this paper, we also re-examine the diagnostic characters of the genus and their presence and/or variability in the known species of Kinnecaris, discuss the taxonomic position of Kinnecaris lyncaea and emend the genus diagnosis.

AB Monitoring tropical forest cover is central to biodiversity preservation, terrestrial carbon stocks, essential ecosystem and climate functions, and ultimately, sustainable economic development. The Amazon forest is the Earth's largest rainforest, and despite intensive studies on current deforestation rates, relatively little is known as to how these compare to historic (pre 1985) deforestation rates. We quantified land cover change between 1975 and 2014 in the so-called Arc of Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon, covering the southern stretch of the Amazon forest and part of the Cerrado biome. We applied a consistent method that made use of data from Landsat sensors: Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI). We acquired suitable images from the US Geological Survey (USGS) for five epochs: 1975, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2014. We then performed land cover analysis for each epoch using a systematic sample of 156 sites, each one covering 10 km x 10 km, located at the confluence point of integer degree latitudes and longitudes. An object-based classification of the images was performed with five land cover classes: tree cover, tree cover mosaic, other wooded land, other land cover, and water. The automatic classification results were corrected by visual interpretation, and, when available, by comparison with higher resolution imagery. Our results show a decrease of forest cover of 24.2% in the last 40 years in the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation, with an average yearly net forest cover change rate of -0.71% for the 39 years considered.

AB Research was conducted during 2010-2013 at the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kayamkulam, Kerala state, India, to analyse the effect of coconut shade on light use efficiency and quality of flowers of Heliconia stricta, when grown as intercrop under various nutrient management practices in sandy loam soils. Leaf characteristics, including area, leaf area index, specific leaf area, leaf area duration, chlorophyll content and wax content, were measured to determine the light use efficiency of the plants. To assess flower quality, visual appeal, pigment content, and wax content were measured. Light use efficiency and flower quality were positively influenced in plants grown under the coconut canopy compared with open conditions. In both open conditions and under coconut shade, the leaf and inflorescence parameters were superior in plants supplied with vermicompost and neem cake (200 and 100 g per plant, respectively) and 13:5:13 NPK fertilizer, vermicompost, and neem cake (2.5, 100, and 50 g per plant, respectively) at quarterly intervals beginning from three months after planting. Even with similar nutritional management the flower quality was higher for inflorescences produced in plants grown under coconut canopy revealing enhanced light use efficiency and flower quality of H. stricta in coconut based cropping system.

AB Edge effects caused by forest fragmentation may impact the growing environment of both seedlings and maternal trees. Early regeneration stages are of special concern but how maternal origin, edge effects, light environment, and distance from reproductive conspecific trees, as expected from the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, may affect seedling performance, has rarely been studied simultaneously. The goal of this study was to experimentally assess the relative importance of the aforementioned factors for seedling performance of an animal-dispersed, pioneer tree species Ficus tonduzii (Moraceae) in premontane wet forest fragments in Costa Rica. Seedlings from known maternal origins were grown in a screen house before being transplanted at two distances from focal trees in forest fragments. Both maternal trees (home) and non-maternal reproductive conspecific (away) were used as focal trees. In the screen house, seedling size and inherent growth differed by maternal origin. In the forest, distance from the nearest forest edge was the primary factor affecting survivorship and growth of transplants. Additionally, inconsistent maternal effects were observed. While seedlings from a particular maternal origin showed reduced growth in the screen house, those same seedlings showed enhanced growth once they were transplanted in the forest. In contrast, light environment or distance from the reproductive conspecific tree did not predict seedling performance. Home disadvantage was observed for one tree, which underlined the significance of seed dispersal. The results from this case study emphasize the importance of considering both edge effects and stage-specific maternal effects for successful species regeneration and restoration practices in fragmented landscapes.

AB Seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs), a varied and extensive ecosystem type in the tropics, are characteristically adapted to seasonal water stress in zones of low rainfall. Land-use change, resource extraction, alien invasives, changes to the atmosphere, and changing fire and climatic regimes may have serious implications for the continued persistence of SDTFs. This paper assesses the extent to which SDTFs may be resilient in the face of these threats, considering their dynamics, community-level characteristics, and functional traits of constituent species. There is evidence that some SDTF biodiversity- and structure-related properties are resistant to low-to moderate-intensity disturbances and have the potential to recover after severe, even chronic, disturbances, at timescales in the order of decades. Although global SDTFs are, on average, not necessarily more resilient than moist tropical forests (MTFs), they may be more resilient to particular disturbances such as fires and drought. SDTFs are vulnerable to regime shifts and there is considerable uncertainty about their future under a changing climate and its interactions with other anthropogenic effects.

AB Against a backdrop of growing concerns over REDD+ implications for tenure of forest-dependent communities, very few scientific studies have attempted to assess the linkages between the two. This paper offers empirical evidences for impacts of REDD+ intervention based on a case study of Thailand, where de jure state property and de facto tenure apparently co-exist. In contrast to the existing literature proposing positive tenure impacts, the findings suggest that REDD+ would not be sufficient to incentivize the government to embark on tenure reforms or any improvement of customary tenure and challenge REDD+ about its incentives for countries to accelerate tenure reforms. The findings also reveal that risks associated with tenure insecurity discouraged REDD+ investment leading to the withdrawal of the fund altogether. The findings enrich the on-going debates on the tenure impacts, tenure reform and competing agendas and provide insights to support the development of future national strategies and frameworks. The paper moreover proposes measures to create enabling conditions for REDD+.

ID FOREST-AGRICULTURE FRONTIERS; CONSERVATION; CULTIVATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Afro-Brazilian communities (quilombos) hold rights to a collective territory where they live and that supports their livelihoods. Historically, Afro-Brazilian smallholders have been subjected to contradictory programs and policies that either restrain traditional practices such as shifting cultivation or aim at empowering these communities. This is the first attempt to adopt the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) theoretical framework to study the historical transformation of the institutional structure in Afro-Brazilian territories of the Ribeira Valley, Silo Paulo, Brazil. Our results reveal a history of long-term, continuous relationships between locals and external groups, sometimes combative and at other times cooperative, reflecting tensions and contradictions. As a result, quilombo communities have gradually emerged as leaders in an institutional arrangement that is moving toward co-governance or partnerships. We believe that if these communities achieve full economic and political autonomy, they might be able to self-govern their territories and reconcile the dual goals of local development and environmental conservation.

AB In the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, where no more primary forests exist, the value of secondary forests for biodiversity conservation is becoming more and more important. We studied the spiders in a relatively well-preserved region of the Mata Atlantica, where the matrix of the landscape is still forest. We addressed the contribution of different spatial levels including forest stages to total diversity and analyzed the patterns by additive partitioning of beta diversity on genus and morphospecies level and for different sampling methods. Beta diversity was strongly based on turnover, not on gain/loss. All spatial levels (sample, stage, area, locality) contributed more to beta diversity than expected, without stronger influence of stage. Patterns were consistent for both identification levels and all methods. We conclude that in this landscape the protection of large areas encompassing all forest stages, without special attention to old-growth, is the best way to conserve the regional species richness.

AB Fish is a very important part of the human diet in Amazonia. Near the growing cities, fish populations and individual size have decreased over the past decades. Alternatives to traditional and industrial fishing arise, including fish farming. Strategies to minimize the impact of fish farms on the environment are needed to have a regular and healthy fish supply. This is to avoid a reduction of biodiversity, a depletion of natural resources, and/or the induction of significant changes in the structure and functioning of adjacent ecosystems. Very little research has been performed on management of effluents as to maintain the quality of water resources. The present study aimed at testing the efficiency of the Amazonian aquatic macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes as a biofilter for the treatment of effluents from fish farming. In three filtering treatments (50%, 75% and 100% plant cover) and a control (0%), physical and chemical properties of the water were measured and analyzed in a nursery with fish after passing the biofilter system, with a hydraulic retention time of 24 hours. The analyzed variables showed no significant differences (p> 0.05) among the treatments with 50-100% cover, indicating that 50% cover would be enough for a good efficiency of the biofilter. All parameters were reduced after passage of the biofilter under the presence of E. crassipes: 73.7% for electrical conductivity, 15% for pH, 84.5% for turbidity, 86.8% for nitrite, 69% for total phosphorus, and 77.8% for orthophosphate. The concentrations of total nitrogen, nitrate and ammonium ions were not significantly changed (p> 0.05). We conclude that E. crassipes is effective in improving the quality of effluents from fish farming, with less efficiency for nitrogen compounds. Our treatment system can be adopted by small and medium-sized farmers, aiming at a sustainable employment of the activity.

   DEFAUNATION; COMMUNITY
AB The accumulation of seeds in the soil (the seedbank) can set the template for the early regeneration of habitats following disturbance. Seed dispersal is an important factor determining the pattern of seed rain, which affects the interactions those seeds experience. For this reason, seed dispersal should play an important role in structuring forest seedbanks, yet we know little about how that happens. Using the functional extirpation of frugivorous vertebrates from the island of Guam, together with two nearby islands (Saipan and Rota) that each support relatively intact disperser assemblages, we aimed to identify the role of vertebrate dispersers in structuring forest seedbanks. We sampled the seedbank on Guam where dispersers are absent, and compared this with the seedbank on Saipan and Rota where they are present. Almost twice as many species found in the seedbank on Guam, when compared with Saipan and Rota, had a conspecific adult within 2 m. This indicates a strong role of vertebrate dispersal in determining the identity of seeds in the seedbank. In addition, on Guam, a greater proportion of samples contained no seeds and overall species richness was lower than on Saipan. Differences in seed abundance and richness between Guam and Rota were less clear, as seedbanks on Rota also contained fewer species than Saipan, possibly due to increased post-dispersal seed predation. Our findings suggest that vertebrate seed dispersers can have a strong influence on the species composition of seedbanks. Regardless of post-dispersal processes, without dispersal, seedbanks no longer serve to increase the species pool of recruits during regeneration.

AB Tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) is a current issue. It would appear that TMCF had an extended tradition in ecological research, but it is only during the last 20 years that it has been intensively studied. The last 10 years have seen an impressive development in ecological knowledge and the emergence of several research lines. The objective of this paper is to present a review of the TMCF ecological research published in 1995-2014 to have a retrospective, a current view and a glimpse of future studies in Mexico and, particularly, in the state of Veracruz. Biodiversity and disturbance have been the most addressed issues in TMCF. In the last decade, following disturbance and habitat loss of the TMCF, more applied topics such as ecological restoration and ecosystem services have been consolidated. Forthcoming topics will be relating forest resilience with forest processes, components and climate change effects.

AB The Leguminosae family is one of the most representative families in the seasonal semidecidual lowland forest, and many of their species have economical and ecological importance, including for the recovery of degraded areas. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the biology of native species for forest restoration. Tree growth dynamics features, such as increment rates, life expectancy and tree responses to environmental variations can be assessed through tree-ring studies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the growth features of Copaifera langsdorffii, Dalbergia nigra, Pterocarpus rohrii, Schizolobium parahyba and Senna multijuga trees in a known age experimental plantation. The study site was located in Espirito Santo State, southeastern Brazil. Stem discs were obtained for anatomical characterization of tree-rings. Wood samples were sectioned and processed following the usual plant anatomy techniques. For macroscopic analysis, samples were polished and analyzed under a stereoscopic microscope. All species showed distinct growth rings with annual periodicity formation. Growth rates, tree size measurements and growth trajectories were established for each species. These features varied even among trees of the same age and species growing under homogeneous conditions. It is noteworthy that growth variation was not related to the species' ecological group. These data are important to characterize growth behavior of native species in order to subsidize species selection for recovery of degraded areas and economical purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB The amount and pattern of individual phenotypic responses to seasonal changes in environmental conditions were determined in clones of Iris variegata growing in differing light habitats. For the purpose of the study, 97 clonal plants of the rhizomatous herb I. variegata that experienced different light conditions in their two native habitats were selected: one along the top and slope of sand dunes and one in woodland understories. Two fully expanded leaves that had developed during spring, summer and fall in two consecutive years were sampled from each of these clones. Six leaf traits affecting the photosynthetic rate of a plant -morphological (specific leaf area), anatomical (stomatal density) and physiological (total chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio, carotenoid concentration, chlorophyll a/carotenoid ratio) exhibited significant plastic responses in the two different light habitats. To test whether these traits differ between exposed and shaded habitats as well as during different vegetation periods, we used the repeated model analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results of the repeated ANOVA revealed statistically significant effects of year, habitat and period of vegetation season. Patterns of changes during growing seasons were year-specific for almost all analyzed traits.

AB Estimation of the amount of dead grass fuel is essential for the assessment of risk of grassland fires. This paper develops a method to estimate the amount of dead grass fuel based on spectral reflectance. Samples of soil and dead grass were collected in the Songliao Plain, China. The spectral reflectance of these samples at different densities and at various wavelengths (350-2500nm) was measured in the laboratory. A new spectral index for dead grass was designed based on the equivalent bands of a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite image. In the short-wave infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, an absorption feature associated with cellulose and lignin was observed at similar to 2100nm in the spectra of dead grass. This absorption feature was not present in the spectra of soil. This observation provides a basis for discriminating between dead grass and soil. The dead grass fuel index created using bands 6 and 7 of MODIS correlated significantly with the field measurements of the mass of dead grass fuel (R-2=0.84). Hence, the dead grass fuel index can be used to produce an estimate of the amount of dead grass fuel, via the regression function identified above. Such methods of estimating the amount of dead grass fuel can contribute to studies of grassland fire hazard.

AB Leaf traits can limit or promote flammability, but how these traits vary and influence forest flammability in humid tropical forests is unknown. Species within the south-eastern transitional forests of the Brazilian Amazon are experiencing fire, particularly surface fires, with greater frequency and severity than historically recorded. In this study, the leaf traits and consequent burning characteristics of the 17 most abundant species in a transitional forest in Mato Grosso, Brazil were analysed through controlled combustion experiments and leaf trait measurements. Mean maximum flame height (range 52-108cm), flaming duration (range 21-71s) and mass loss (range 82-97%), which relate to a fuel's combustibility and consumability, varied substantially across species. Measured leaf traits, mainly surface area and volume, accounted for 78% of this variability. The most flammable species were those with thin, lightweight and loosely packed leaves, which produced rapid, intense fires that consumed larger fuel amounts. The least flammable species had thick, large and densely packed leaves. In diverse tropical forests, analysing the relationship between species-specific leaf traits and flammability will yield insights into fire behaviour and future forest composition in a frontier zone where exposure to anthropogenic fire is high.

AB To find out the main research streams of PES and probe their features, firstly this paper applied HistCite (TM), used "PES" (TS = "payments for environmental services", "compensation for the service of eco-system", "environmental services payments", "eco-compensation", "ecological compensation", "ecology compensation", or "environmental compensation) as keyword in title, abstract, or keywords, and collected publications on "PES" in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WOS) from 1962 to 2013 (4th, April). Then, using the "Graph Maker" tool tried different citation network conditions in GCS and LCS. Results show that, the scene of top 50 in LCS is the ideal citation network of highly cited papers. Three distinct research streams can be identified. (1) In the early stage, researchers studied plant-herbivore interactions and related compensation, which focus on the tolerance of plants to herbivore and its compensation. (2) Species biodiversity protection is always one of the hot topics for ecologists, compensation payments for species biodiversity and its spatio-temporal allocation is one main research stream. (3) The biggest research stream mainly focused on the interaction between PES and ecological-social-economy development.

AB In Central African tropical forests, the western lowland gorilla deposits most of the seeds it disperses in well-lit nesting sites that can favour seedling growth. The faecal matrix surrounding the seeds can act as a fertiliser and further enhance seedling development. This fertilisation effect had never been tested. Our research therefore aimed to determine whether seed deposition by gorillas (i) in faecal matter and (ii) in nest sites is advantageous for seedling development (growth rate and foliation rate) and survival (% of surviving seedlings). To assess the effect of the faecal matrix, seeds of Santiria trimera (Burseraceae), Chrysophyllum lacourtianum (Sapotaceae) and Plagiostyles africana (Euphorbiaceae) collected from gorilla faeces were sown in a nursery with and without a faecal matrix. Seedlings of Santiria trimera and Dactyodes normandii (Burseraceae) were established in nest sites and in closed canopy terra firme forest sites to assess the impact of seed deposition on seedling development and survival. The faecal matrix was observed to positively influence seedling development in the species studied, but showed no effect on survival. Regarding seed deposition sites, the development rates observed were two to ten times higher in the nest sites than in closed-canopy forest. This enhanced seedling development was positively correlated with canopy openness. In situ studies of seed germination, seedling growth and survival are needed to characterise the fate of gorilla-dispersed seeds more precisely. However, our results offer evidence that gorillas provide important directed dispersal services by depositing seeds most frequently in open canopy sites.

AB Several reviews of dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) behavior and ecology, as well as numerous research reports, have either implicitely or explicitely indicated that predation on dung scarabs is rare or absent and thus of minimal or no importance to the biology of the group. This review presents 610 records of predation on dung beetles by 409 species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians from around the world. The involvement of invertebrates as predators on dung scarabs is also documented. It is concluded that this data establishes predation as a potentially major factor in the evolution and current behavior and ecology of dung beetles. The data presented also represents a considerable underestimation of predation on the group.

AB New approaches to human-environment interactions are beginning to move beyond a narrow focus on individuals and simple (patch-level) predatory or competitive interactions. These approaches link nonequilibrium theory from community and landscape ecology with theories of individual decision making from behavioral ecology to explore new ways of approaching complex issues of diachronic change in behavior, subsistence, and social institutions. I provide an overview of two such approaches, one to understand long-term hunting sustainability among mixed forager-horticulturalists in the wet tropics and the other to understand how foragers act as ecosystem engineers in a dry perennial grassland in Australia. I conclude by describing the implications of new approaches that incorporate anthropogenic "intermediate" disturbance (an emergent property of human-environment interaction) as a force shaping environments through time and space, and in so doing patterning the sustainability of subsistence, ways of sharing, ownership norms, and even structures of gendered production.

AB Fires are used as a tool in the deforestation process. Yet, the relationship between fire and deforestation may vary temporally and spatially depending on the type of deforestation and climatic conditions. This study evaluates spatiotemporal dynamics of deforestation and fire represented by burned area over the 2002-2012 period in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. As a first step, we compared newly available Landsat-based maps of gross forest cover loss from the Global Forest Change (GFC) project with maps of deforestation extent from the Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project (PRODES) produced by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). As a second step, we rescaled the Landsat-based data to the 500m resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area data (MCD64A1) and stratified this using MODIS land cover data to study the role of burned area in forest cover loss and deforestation. We found that while GFC forest cover loss and PRODES deforestation generally agreed on spatial and temporal dynamics, there were several key differences between the data sets. Both showed a decrease in the extent of forest cover loss or deforestation after 2004, but the drop was larger and more continuous in PRODES than in GFC. The observed decrease in forest cover loss or deforestation rates over our study period was mainly due to lower clearing rates in the evergreen broadleaf forests in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rondonia. GFC indicated anomalously high forest cover loss in the years 2007 and 2010, which was not reported by PRODES. The burned area data indicated that this was predominantly related to increased burned area occurring outside of the tropical forest area during these dry years, mainly in Para. This indicated that fire and forest loss dynamics in woodlands or secondary forests may be equally important as deforestation in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In addition to the decrease in forest cover loss rates, we also found that post-deforestation fire use declined; burned area within 5 years after forest cover loss decreased from 54 to 39% during our study period.

AB Topographic or forest structural variables have been called indirect environmental variables in forest ecology studies. We tested the hypothesis that relative elevation and tallest tree height in the sampling unit, two of these indirect environmental variables, play a role in fine scale community organization in an Atlantic forest in Southeastern Brazil. One hundred 10 m x 10m sampling units were used to sample the tree community in a 6.5 ha stand. We modeled space through Moran's eigenvectors maps and selected spatial eigenfuctions through an individual species based approach to reach an effective control of type I error. Redundancy analysis and variation partitioning were applied to correlate community composition and environmental variables while maintaining space constant. A significant global p-value for the Redundancy analysis was found. The pure environmental fraction of variation in community composition was also significant, increasing from 1% (adjusted R-2) for the simple environmental data to 3.3% for the polynomial (third degree) environmental data. The pure and spatially structured environmental fractions summed up 4% and 6% for the simple and polynomial environmental data, respectively. The influence of the environmental variables varied between species functional groups: non-pioneer species were predominantly affected by relative elevation while pioneers were almost strictly associated with tallest tree height. Our findings amplify the importance of niche assembly processes in fine scale community organization because of the choice of a grain size (10 m x 10 m) and an extent (6.5 ha) smaller than those considered elsewhere, along with rigorous control of type I error rate.

AB Hunting is responsible for the decline of more than half of all mammal species from Brazil; however, very few studies relating to hunting exist for the Eastern region of the Amazon. Medium and large-sized mammals are valued for their protein and are thus more affected by hunting activity. Four published studies on hunting in the region (in Para, Mato Grosso, Amapa and Maranhao, respectively) were quantitatively analyzed and used to determine the biomass and extraction rates of species and groups of species, considering the characteristics of each group, as well as the differences and similarities in composition in each type of game in the locality. These four published studies, two were in communities indigenous (Para and Maranhao) and others two in rural communities (Mato Grosso and Amapa) A total of 32 species from eight orders and 17 families were hunted, totaling 32,726,990 kilograms of game meat with a positive correlation between biomass, the number of animals slaughtered and the number of species. Ungulates were the most hunted group, from which the most biomass was obtained. Concerning food preferences, frugivorous represented the highest number of species hunted and also the highest biomass, and a positive correlation existed between the extraction rate and ungulate biomass. There was no significant difference between the diversity of mammals of different indigenous and rural localities; however, from a multidimensional analysis of the localities, A'Ukre (Para) and Alto Turiacu (Maranhao) were more similar to each other, and were more distant from the other groups. Knowledge concerning which species and groups and how many animals are hunted in each locality is necessary to direct conservation management plans and increase their efficiency within localities.

AB We present a synthesis of the first 10 years of Long Term Ecological Research project in Amazonian Forest. We elucidate the natural dynamics of forest ecosystem processes and associated biota, and its changes caused by distinct pressures of selective timber extraction and forest fragmentation. We found that, for both plants and animals, densities of individuals and distribution of species assemblages are spatially heterogeneous at the mesoscale, even in relatively undisturbed forests, and that associations with topo-edaphic variables allow prediction of a considerable part of this variation. For biological groups whose dynamics were studied in the short-term, levels of change in species composition and densities were relatively high, and these changes were generally in tune with spatial environmental variation. The impact of selective logging on assemblages and ecosystem processes was normally moderate, and around 19 years were needed for recovering forest biomass and tree size distribution. Continued studies are needed to determine the time required for recuperation of timber stocks and pre-logging floristic composition. Selective logging appears to be compatible with the biodiversity conservation, but reduction and better planning of road access may be more important than planned logging intensities. Habitat-loss' impact on organisms and ecosystem processes is large and long-lasting, since it induces the loss of many taxonomic groups and species, higher tree mortality and accelerated forest dynamics. There was a negative synergy between the impacts of habitat loss and climatic changes, and a better understanding of these processes can only be obtained through long-term research.

AB The vast majority of terrestrial plants form some type of mycorrhizal association. In this chapter, attention is focused on the most common and widespread types: arbuscular mycorrhizas and ectomycorrhizas. The former are well known to play key roles in plant uptake of soluble inorganic phosphorus (Pi), via the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) uptake pathway. This pathway involves cell types and Pi transporters that are different from those utilised by the direct, epidermal, plant uptake pathway, and recent studies have indicated considerable interplay between the two pathways. Although less attention has been paid to the roles of ectomycorrhizas in P uptake, it is increasingly clear that this symbiosis is involved not only in soluble Pi uptake but also in the solubilisation of insoluble Pi and the mobilisation of organic P via phosphatases. Hence, these mycorrhizas likely play significant roles in nutrient turnover in forest ecosystems. For both mycorrhizal types there is considerable variation in outcomes in terms of P uptake and plant growth, depending on the identity of plant and fungal symbionts. It is emphasised that experiments with single plants and fungi in pots are unlikely to be good predictors of outcomes in the field, due to such factors as complex plant-fungal assemblages, interplant competition and plant densities.

AB We present the pollen investigation of honeys from Tetragonisca angustula (Apidae, Meliponini) in the Lower Amazon region, Para State, Brazil. The analyses focused on the spectra and pollen concentrations recorded in the honey. We conducted monthly collections between September 2010 and January 2012 in the municipalities of Belterra and Santarem. The pollen spectra in the honey from the Belterra and Santarem regions demonstrated 58 and 45 pollen types, respectively. Fabaceae was the most commonly represented plant family in the honey samples from both areas. The main pollen associations observed in the honey include as follows: Borreria verticillata, Byrsonima, Eriope, Microtea and Warszewiczia coccinea in Belterra and Byrsonima, Cecropia, Clidemia hirta, Myrcia, Solanum paniculatum, Tapirira guianensis and W. coccinea in Santarem. In both municipalities, the mean values of the pollen diversity (Shannon-Weaver, H) and equitability (Pielou, J) indices were 1.6 and 0.6, respectively. Most of the honey from Belterra contained between 20,000 and 100,000 pollen grains/10g of honey (Group II). In Santarem, most of the samples contained between 100,000 and 500,000grains/10 g of honey (Group III). T. angustula demonstrated polyletic foraging behaviours during the study. The ecological indices point towards uniformity in the use of the available resources in the local flora. The concentration of pollen in the honey samples indicates that these honeys meet the normal, internationally recognised standards.

AB Aim of study: to study the effects of gap size, gap age and bamboo Fargesia denudata on natural regeneration of Abies faxoniana, both of which are the ubiquitous dominants in our research area.
   Area of study: subalpine coniferous forests in Wanglang Natural Reserve in Southwestern China.
   Material and Methods: 10 transect belts were randomly established, and a total of 97 gaps were recorded and used.
   Main results: (1) the number of bamboos with coverage of <17% significantly increased with increases of gap size and age, but the latter had little influence on the numbers of F. denudata with coverage of >17%. (2) F. denudata strongly inhibited A. faxoniana seedlings and saplings in small, young and old gaps, where the amount of A. faxoniana recruitment was relatively abundant, than in other types of gap. (3) The numbers of A. faxoniana seedlings in A-gaps, significantly decreased with the increases in gap size. However, in gaps where F. denudate was also present, A. faxoniana seedlings and saplings were insensitive to gap size or age.
   Research highlights: thick F. denudata would not be influenced by gap size or age. Because of the low occurrences of A. faxoniana seedlings and saplings, the negative effect of gap size, gap age and F. denudata on A. faxoniana recruitment was unclear

AB Unprecedented rates of deforestation on tropical islands are threatening high numbers of endemic species, and empirical evidence is needed to better understand the implications of changes in land-use on biodiversity and to guide conservation actions. We assessed the effects of changes in land-use on the lowland avifauna of the tropical island of Makira in the Solomon Islands. We examined species richness and community assemblages, with a particular focus on endemism and functional traits, to provide further insight into the conservation value of the dominant types of land-use on Makira (i.e. intact forest, secondary forest, food gardens, mixed Cocoa plantations, and monoculture Cocoa plantations). We found species richness was similar across habitats, but endemic-species richness decreased as intensity of land-use increased. There were significant differences in the occurrence of functional groups between habitats. Fifteen of the 42 species observed showed significant variation in abundance across habitats. Of those species that varied, 12 were endemic to Makira or to Melanesia, with seven of these endemics being absent from the monoculture Cocoa plantations. As tropical islands have less functional redundancy than continental land masses, protecting the remaining forest and improving habitat connectivity will be even more critical for conserving their endemic species and maintaining ecosystem functioning.

AB Deforestation is a widely recognized problem in the Brazilian Amazon. Small farmers play a key role in this process in that they earn their livelihood by ranching and farming. Many studies have addressed the link between deforestation and livelihood strategies adopted by small farmers. Most have focused on advanced monitoring systems, simulation models, and GIS approaches to analyze the interaction of both dimensions, i.e., livelihoods and forest cover change. Although the current toolbox of methods has proved successful in increasing our understanding of these interactions, the models and approaches employed do not consider small farmers' perspectives. On the assumption that local small farmers are agents of land-cover change, understanding how they perceive their own situation is essential to elucidate their actions. Our objective is to explore future changes in livelihood security and environmental sustainability as envisaged by local small farmers in the Brazilian Amazon. Previous livelihood cluster analysis of small farmers located in southeast Para was integrated with fuzzy cognitive mapping to determine present perceptions and to explore future changes, using global scenarios downscaled to the local situation. Overall, system description differs only on details; all results indicate a strong trade-off between livelihood security and environmental sustainability in all livelihood systems, as identified by the small farmers. However, fundamentally different outcomes are obtained from the future analysis, depending on the livelihood strategy cluster. Achieving win-win outcomes does not necessarily imply a positive scenario, especially if small farmers are dependent on income transfers from the government to provide their livelihood.

AB Rapid climate change poses complex challenges for conservation, especially in tropical developing countries where biodiversity is high while financial and technical resources are limited. The complexity is heightened by uncertainty in predicted effects, both for ecological systems and human communities that depend heavily on natural resource extraction and use. Effective conservation plans and measures must be inexpensive, fast-acting, and able to increase the resilience of both the ecosystem and the social-ecological system. We present conservation practitioners with a framework that strategically integrates climate change planning into connectivity measures for tropical mountain ecosystems in Costa Rica. We propose a strategy for doubling the amount of habitat currently protected in riparian corridors using measures that are relatively low cost and fast-acting, and will employ and expand human capital. We argue that habitat connectivity must be enhanced along latitudinal gradients, but also within the same elevational bands, via a lattice-work corridor system. This is needed to facilitate range shifts for mobile species and evolutionary adaptation for less mobile species. We think that conservation measures within the elevational bands must include conservation-friendly land uses that improve current and future human livelihoods under dynamic conditions. Key components include community involvement, habitat priority-setting, forest landscape restoration, and environmental services payments. Our approach is fundamentally adaptive in that the conservation measures employed are informed by on-the-ground successes and failures and modified accordingly, but are relatively low risk and fast-acting. Our proposal, if implemented, would satisfy tenets of climate-smart conservation, improve the resilience of human and ecological communities, and be a model for other locations facing similar challenges.

AB The southwestern area of the Amazon rainforest has undergone rapid transformation through the substitution of forest for pasture cover. In order to identify differences in water and sediment loss through runoff in areas of forest and in areas where the forest has been transformed into pasture, four parcels of 10 m(2) were installed, two in each type of cover on two slopes of the Judia drainage basin in the state of Acre, Brazil. The data was collected during the rainy season between 10/2010 and 03/2011. At each plot daily precipitation, vegetation, infiltration capacity, porosity and penetration resistance in the soil were measured. In the pasture cover of both slopes the total precipitation reached 1.172 and 1.145 L/m(2) with water losses of 162.94 and 134.73 L/m(2) and sediment loss of 32.032 and 25.972 g/m(2), respectively. In the forested plots of the slopes, the total rainfall was 936 and 935 L/m(2), with water losses of 84.01 and 82.13 L/m(2) and sediment loss of 72.372 and 86.090 g/m(2), respectively. Test of variance (T-Student) identified significant differences in water loss in the pasture plot compared to that of the forest cover (p = 0.000) on Slope 1. However, sediment loss (p = 0.168) presented higher values for the parcels covered by forest. On Slope 2 there were no significant differences in the values of water loss for the parcels of each type of vegetation cover (p = 0.289). The difference in the value of sediment loss of the forest parcel on Slope 2 (p = 0.0911), at 10% significance level, was significant in comparison to that of grass cover. The higher values of sediment loss through runoff in parcels covered by forest, seems to be associated with a more intense soil disturbance caused by mesofauna coupled with the intensity of precipitation caused by the accumulation of rainwater on the leaves. Alternatively, higher levels of compaction may have favored greater water loss in pasture areas.

AB The analysis of soil phosphorus (P) in fractions of different plant availability is a common approach to characterize the P status of forest soils. However, quantification of organic and inorganic P fractions in different extracts is labor intensive and therefore rarely applied for large sample numbers. Therefore, we examined whether different P fractions can be predicted using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
   We used the Hedley sequential extraction method (modified by Tiessen and Moir, 2008) with increasingly strong extractants to determine P in fractions of different plant availability and measured near-infrared (NIR) spectra for soil samples from sites of the German forest soil inventory and from a nature reserve in southeastern China.
   The R-2 of NIRS calibrations to predict P in individual Hedley fractions ranged between 0.08 and 0.85. When these fractions were combined into labile, moderately labile and stable P pools, R-2 of calibration models was between 0.38 and 0.88 (all significant). Model prediction quality was higher for organic than for inorganic P fractions and increased with the homogeneity of soil properties in soil sample sets. Useable models were obtained for samples originating from one soil type in subtropical China, whereas prediction models for sample sets from a range of soil types in Germany were only moderately useable or not useable.
   Our results indicate that prediction of Hedley P fractions with NIRS can be a promising approach to replace conventional analysis, if models are developed for sets of soil samples with similar physical and chemical properties, e.g., from the same soil type or study site.

AB Standard line-transect census techniques were deployed to generate a checklist and quantify the abundance of medium and large-bodied vertebrate species in forest areas of eastern Amazonia with and without a history of reduced-impact logging (RIL). Three areas were allocated a total of 1,196.9 km of line-transect census effort. Sampling was conducted from April to June 2012 and from April to August 2013, and detected 29 forest vertebrate species considered in this study belonging to 15 orders, 20 families and 28 genera. Additionally, eight species were recorded outside census walks through direct and indirect observations. Of this total, six species are considered vulnerable according to IUCN (Ateles paniscus, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Priodontes maximus, Tapirus terrestris, Tayassu peccary, Chelonoidis denticulata). Observed species richness ranged from 21 to 24 species in logged and unlogged areas, and encounter rates along transects were highly variable between treatments. However, the relative abundance of species per transect did not differ between transects in logged and unlogged forests. Of the species detected during censuses, only three showed different relative abundance between the two treatments (Saguinus midas, Tinamus spp. and Dasyprocta leporina). Our results show that the effect of RIL forest management was a relatively unimportant determinant of population abundance for most medium and large vertebrates over the time period of the survey.

AB Heterogenous agroecosystems have the capacity to maintain high insect diversity despite alterations due to human activities. The distribution of carabid beetles and ants within a variety of habitat mosaics was monitored at two climatically distinct locations. Both insect Families were monitored to compare community similarities between habitats, within and between the two sampling locations. Species occurrences were significantly different between the two locations (p<0.05), with distinct patterns of distribution, resulting in high dissimilarity between locations and habitats sampled. While the lowveld had highest populations and diversity of both ants and carabid beetles in unmanaged habitats, the middleveld had high carabid beetle diversity in managed habitat and populations in unmanaged habitat, while ant populations and diversity were highest in an unmanaged habitat. Although the two locations had no carabid beetle species in common, they had a few ant species in common. Due to their abundance, diversity and relation to management, both insect Families have the potential to be used as indicators in the locations assessed..

AB Studies demonstrated that the occurrence of fires may cause phenological behaviours that diverge from commonly described patterns. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the vulnerability of woody species to fire can be indicated by leaf deciduousness. The activity index and the intensity index of different phenophases were compared between burned and unburned individuals of woody species with different levels of leaf deciduousness (deciduous, semideciduous and evergreen). For the deciduous species, the vegetative phenophases were similar between burned and unburned individuals. For the semideciduous species, burned individuals showed higher intensity and activity of the vegetative phenophases. For the evergreen species, the stimulus for production of new leaves and retardation of expanded and senescent leaves was recorded in burned individuals. In terms of reproductive phenology, in burned individuals, lower intensity and activity of unripe and ripe fruits were recorded for deciduous and semideciduous species, whereas the stimulus for flowering and fruiting was recorded for evergreen species. The periodicity of the phenophases can be modulated by the occurrence of fire even after an interval of two years. The effect of the fire was gradually more pronounced from deciduous to evergreen species, indicating the higher vulnerability of evergreen woody species to this type of disturbance.

AB To understand how temperate coexisting tree species respond to water deficit, the seedlings of two coexisting species, Phellodendron amurense Rupr. And Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr., were transplanted into plastic flowerpots. Three water deficit treatments were used, W1 (60-90% field moisture capacity), W2 (40-60% field moisture capacity), and naturally occurring precipitation (CK), with the aim of investigating the effects of water deficit on the growth of seedlings and competition between them. The result showed that the relative height and diameter of the P. amurense seedlings decreased in the control groups (CP, single P amurense seedling; CF, single F. mandshurica seedling) but increased in the mixed groups (one P. amurense seedling and one F mandshurica seedling together) with the water deficit. The water deficit affected the plants by altering the growth of the seedlings and competition between the two species. It was shown that there were greater negative effects on P. amurense due to the manufactured water deficit than on F. mandshurica.

AB To test the hypothesis that the physiognomy, structure and dynamics of woody species are influenced by the spatial gradient edge-interior, data were collected from these parameters in 2004, 2007 and 2010 in an Atlantic forest fragment. Species were sampled for the Canopy (DS), with circumference > 15 cm to 1.3 m soil and understory (SB) in circumference between ground level> 3 cm and CAP <15 cm on edge-gradient formed within 35 years. In 2004, we assessed three positions in the fragment: edge, intermediate and inner (> 150 m from the forest boundary), and analyzed 1,000 m(2) per site, divided into plots of 10 m(2), to measure individuals of higher class. In each plot a sub-plot of 5 m(2) for sampling understory was installed. Branches were collected from three adult individuals from the species to obtain the density of the wood. The number of individuals (NI), basal area (BA), mortality (TM), recruitment rate (TR), periodic annual diameter increment (IPA), loss rate (P) and gain rate (G) Area and basal turnover rates in number of individuals (TN) and basal area (TA) class tree component in the three locations showed no significant edge effect. At the edge, the understory had lower values of NI and AB and higher TM than in the forest interior. Differences between the strata occur regardless of edge sealing, since young plants present in most individuals in the sample class SB, which are more sensitive than adult trees to changes caused by the creation of the edge. Rates of loss and gain of AB and AB turnover in NI and in SB presented higher values than on the DS, which points to a stratum with larger changes. In DS there were no differences in species richness among environments differs from that observed in SB. The floristic composition of the DS in environments closer to the forest limit was quite distinct from that of the interior, indicating that there has been no recovery of floristic composition. All environments SB had low similarity. The edges of the DS and SB had a higher concentration of individuals in class intervals smaller density values timber. The DS has already recovered biomass, although the edge and intermediate environments have not recovered species composition late. The SB still suffers the edge effect. Possibly, the highest concentration of individuals is in class with lower density wood result on edge.

AB An expression of plants response to light availability is their shade tolerance which refers to the capacity of a given plant to tolerate low light levels. Survival in a shaded environment can determine phenotypic consequences at morphological and/or physiological levels and such changes may be crucial to survive in heterogeneous and variable conditions. However, the potential plastic response of a given plant trait may be large but the observed plasticity may be lowered by resource limitations or environmental stress factors. In this context, the aim of this research was to analyze morphological, anatomical and physiological leaf traits variations of Sesleria nitida Ten, growing in different light conditions. In particular, plants growing in open (PO) and shade (PU) conditions were analyzed. The results show a 35% higher specific leaf area (SLA) in PU than in PO due to a 94% larger leaf area (LA). The higher height and width of the central and the major lateral vascular bundle in PO than in PU contribute to a higher net photosynthesis (P-N) in sun than in shade conditions. Moreover, the 33% higher ratio between respiration (R-D) and PN (R-D/P-N) in PU than in PO highlights the greater proportion of the carbon consumed by R-D in the shade population requiring a greater metabolic effort for growth and maintenance. S. nitida in the shaded environment might be favored by the soil pH being a neutro-basophilous species and the larger soil water content (SWC) and mineral content contributing to maintain a positive carbon balance in this limiting condition. The plasticity analysis for open vs. the understory plants (mean plasticity index = 0.32) highlights the leaf trait variations useful to maintain a positive carbon balance where light availability is the main limiting factor. Knowledge of the capacity of S. nitida to first colonize and then modify its phenotype in response to the shade condition can contribute to a better understanding of its ecology

AB In a climax community where all species are sharing relatively similar and stable habitat, there are differences in leaftraits between deciduous trees and shrubs and dominant species and companion species, especially in leaf lifespan (LLs). What are the differences of relationships among leaf traits between deciduous trees and shrubs? What are the mechanisms of this phenomenon? Here, we presented a one-year observation and recorded the LLs followed a modified method in a Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata forest in the north slope of the Qinling Mountains, China. We found that (i) Different species in the same stand performed quite differently in their LLs (P <0.005). Average LLs of shrubs was slightly longer (P = 0.05) than that of deciduous trees. (ii) LLs showed a significant negative correlation with specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) (P <0.05) in deciduous trees, however, a significant positive correlation with LNC and leaf carbon content (LCC) (P <0.05) was detected in shrubs. (iii) The comparison of the traits between dominant and companion species in arbor layer and shrub layer showed that there was no significant difference in LLs, LCC and LNC, except SLA in arbor layer. Our study indicated that the amount of light, at the community scale, might be a main factor determining the LLs of wood plants in deciduous forest. The difference between trees and shrubs in relationships among leaf traits suggests that deciduous trees and shrubs may take different strategies to adapt to the environment. SLA is likely to be a marker trait to distinguish dominant and companion species in arbor layer of deciduous broad leaved forest.

AB After discussion of many years about the nature of plants community, within the science dealing with vegetation the consensus is reached on pragmatic basis. Most researchers consider plants community as conditionally uniform contour marked out of the multi-dimensional continuum of any type of vegetation. Plants community is a generic notion, within the framework of which types with different models of organization are established. With any type of plants community organization model, the main factor of species association remains to be the ecotope which plays the role of an abiotic matrix. The main traits of a plants community are species composition, its structure, species interrelations, and functional parameters. The main types of species interrelations within a plants community appear to be competition and non-competitive formation of environment. The important role in organization of plant communities belongs to heterotrophic organisms such as phytophages, nitrogen-fixing procaryotes, mycorrhizal fungi, pathogens, and others.

AB The upper montane forests in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil have an unusual and discontinuous geographic distribution at the top of the Atlantic coastal mountain ranges. To describe the floristic composition and structure of the Atlantic Forest near its upper altitudinal limit in southeastern Brazil, 30 plots with 10 x 10 m were installed in three forest sites between 2,200 and 2,300 m.a.s.l. at Serra Fina. The floristic composition and phytosociological structure of this forest were compared with other montane and upper montane forests. In total, 704 individuals were included, belonging to 24 species, 15 families, and 19 genera. Myrsinaceae, Myrtaceae, Symplocaceae, and Cunoniaceae were the most important families, and Myrsine gardneriana, Myrceugenia alpigena, Weinmannia humilis, and Symplocos corymboclados were the most important species. The three forest sites revealed differences in the abundance of species, density, canopy height, and number of stems per individual. The upper montane forests showed structural similarities, such as lower richness, diversity, and effective number of species, and they tended to have higher total densities and total dominance per hectare to montane forests. The most important species in these upper montane forests belong to Austral-Antartic genera or neotropical and pantropical genera that are typical of montane areas. The high number of species shared by these forests suggests past connections between the vegetation in southern Brazilian high-altitude areas.

AB We studied the pollination biology of Canna paniculata (Cannaceae), a plant species common in the Atlantic Rainforest of southeastern Brazil. The species presents specialized ornithophilous flowers, which in our study area are solely pollinated by the hermit hummingbird Phaethornis eurynome. Although C. paniculata is capable of bearing fruit after self-pollination, it requires pollinators for reproduction. We discuss the importance of hermit hummingbirds for the reproduction of specialized ornithophilous plants such as C. paniculata, including their asymmetric dependence on hermit hummingbirds -core pollinators in Neotropical forest ecosystems.

AB The interrelationships between smallholder agriculture, forest cover, and biodiversity loss have received insufficient research and analytic attention, though they stand at the center of the ongoing biodiversity crisis in tropical landscapes. Despite important advances in conservation science, knowledge generation remains fragmentary, and the formal institutions concerned with agriculture, forestry, social change, and climate change continue to work to a large extent in isolation, especially in developing countries. Drawing on our research program in the montane Eastern Himalaya of India, for example, two questions are explored: What types of landscapes can provide livelihood security for growing populations while maintaining healthy ecosystems? What kinds of knowledge, institutions, and policies will help us move toward land-use patterns that support livelihoods and protect biodiversity, given a regional economy based on small-scale agriculture? Here, we advocate for a greater integration of knowledge types (scientific, traditional, and participatory) and institutions (formal and informal, government and community) to foster better planning in order to reconcile several functions at the landscape level, including smallholder agriculture, the production of ecosystem goods and services, and the protection of biodiversity.

AB I highlight new and emerging threats to tropical forests, the world's most biologically diverse ecosystems. The drivers of tropical forest destruction and key perils to biodiversity have changed over the past decade and will continue to evolve in the future. Industrial drivers of forest conversion, such as logging, large-scale soy and cattle farming, oil-palm plantations, and oil and gas development, have escalated in importance, buoyed by rapid globalization, economic growth, and rising standards of living in developing nations. Biofuels are likely to grow rapidly as a driver of future forest destruction. Climate change is similarly emerging as a potentially serious driver of change in the tropics, and many species, including certain amphibians, primates, and plants, are being harmed by emerging pathogens.. In general, old-growth forests are vanishing rapidly and being replaced by fragmented, secondary, and selectively logged forests, particularly in impoverished tropical countries. Road expansion continues apace and is increasingly imperiling the world's last tropical frontiers. Human population growth, especially in developing nations, remains an important underlying threat to forests. These various environmental dangers often operate in concert, magnifying their impacts and posing an even greater threat to tropical forests and their biodiversity.

AB We evaluated the roles of gibberellins (GAs) and cytokinins (CKs) in regulation of morphological traits such as biomass allocation and leaf mass per area (LMA). Seedlings of Polygonum cuspidatum Siebold & Zucc. were grown under various light and N availabilities. We exogenously sprayed solutions of gibberellin (GA(3)), benzyl adenine (BA), uniconazole (an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis) or their mixtures on the aboveground parts, and changes in morphological and physiological traits and relative growth rate (RGR) were analysed. Endogenous levels of GAs and CKs in the control plants were also quantified. The morphological traits were changed markedly by the spraying. Biomass allocation to leaves was increased by GA(3) and BA, whereas it decreased by uniconazole. GA(3) decreased LMA, whereas uniconazole increased it. We found close relationships among morphological and physiological traits such as photosynthetic rate and net assimilation rate, and RGR under all growth conditions. Seedlings with high levels of endogenous GAs or CKs and low levels of endogenous GAs or CKs showed morphologies similar to those sprayed with GA(3) or BA, and those sprayed with uniconazole, respectively. Thus we concluded these phytohormones are involved in the regulation of biomass allocation responding to either light or N availability.

AB Processes allowing coexistence of trees and grasses in tropical savannas have long intrigued ecologists. Early theories focused on climatic controls, but a conceptual model has emerged suggesting that savanna trees are subject to a fire-mediated recruitment bottleneck, with frequent fires preventing recruitment of saplings into the tree layer and maintaining biomass well below its climate-determined upper bound. We propose that this conceptual model has been overemphasised in northern Australia, where tree abundance is more strongly controlled by water availability. The dominant trees, eucalypts, have a remarkable capacity to grow through the 'fire trap' to reach fire-resistant sizes. This fire tolerance makes eucalypts relatively unresponsive to management-imposed reductions in fire frequency and intensity. Other trees in these savannas are typically more fire sensitive and respond positively to such management. There are suggestions that savanna fire management could lead to increases in woody biomass, but we contend that if tree biomass is strongly limited by water availability, then potential increases in tree biomass are relatively limited, at least in relation to the dominant eucalypt component. There is potential to increase the biomass of the more fire-sensitive non-eucalypts, but the upper bound of non-eucalypt tree biomass in these eucalypt-dominated systems remains poorly understood.

AB The post-fire response of vegetation reflects not only a single fire event but is the result of cumulative effects of previous fires in the landscape. For effective ecological fire management there is a need to better understand the relationship between different fire regimes and vegetation structure. The study investigated how different fire regimes affect stand structure and composition in subtropical eucalypt woodlands of central Queensland. We found that fire history category (i.e. specific combinations of time since fire, fire frequency and season of last burn) strongly influenced richness and abundance of species categorised as mid-storey trees and those individuals currently in the mid-level strata. Time since fire and fire frequency appeared to have the strongest influence. A longer time since fire (> 4 years since last burn), combined with infrequent fires (< 2 fires in 12 year period) appeared to promote a dense mid-storey with the opposite conditions (< 4 years since last burn; > 2 fires in 12 year period) promoting more-open woodlands. Consideration of these combined fire regime attributes will allow fire managers to plan for a particular range of fire-mediated patches to maintain the desired diversity of vegetation structures.

AB Both habitat fragmentation and predator abundance are known to affect habitat use. The current study analyzed the use of ponds by leaf-litter anurans in relation to distance to the forest edge and presence of aquatic predators in a forest fragment in Eastern Amazon. We selected three trails perpendicular to the forest edge, and in each trail we positioned nine plastic basins on the forest floor at different distances from the forest edge. From November 2011 to July 2012, each basin was surveyed monthly for presence of evidence of anuran breeding activity and aquatic predators. We recorded 112 instances of use of basins by four anuran species. While we did not observe any influence of distance to the forest edge on use of basins by Rhinella gr. margaritifera and Ameerega trivittata, there was differential use of basins by both species in relation to the presence of aquatic predators. In both cases, species used basins more often when aquatic predators were absent, suggesting that these species adopt strategies that reduce effects of predation and ensures the survival of some tadpoles, either by carrying tadpoles to ponds without predators or producing larger clutches.

AB Different combinations and intensities of physical (e.g. thermal) and biological (e.g. competition or predation) stress operate on organisms in different locations. Variation in these stresses can occur over small to medium spatial scales (cm to 10s of metres) in heterogeneous environments such as rocky shores, due to differences in sun and wave exposure, shore topography and/or recruitment. In this study we demonstrate how simple measurements can be taken that represent physical and biological stresses (stress profiles) in a given location. Using a bootstrapped principal component analysis, we identified significantly different stress profiles at four sites separated by only 10s to 100s of metres on the Shek O peninsula in Hong Kong. We then measured response to thermal stress, as determined by detachment temperature, in the limpet Cellana grata (which is known to be a sensitive indicator species to thermal stress) from each location. Significant differences in stress profile between locations were also seen in thermal stress tolerance of limpets from those locations. At locations where the major stresses are likely to be more physical or less biological in nature (e.g. southerly facing aspect or lower density of grazers), the mean detachment temperature was higher, whereas detachment temperature was lower at sites with more biological or less physical stress. This method is, therefore, able to determine biologically meaningful differences in stress profiles over small to medium spatial scales, and demonstrates that localised adaptation (i.e. post planktonic settlement) or acclimation of species may occur in response to these different stress profiles. The technique can be adapted to different environments and smaller or larger spatial scales as long as the stress experienced by the study species is relevant to these scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the factors that drive variation in species distribution is a central theme of ecological research. Although several studies focused on alpine vegetation, few efforts have been made to identify the environmental factors that are responsible for the variations in species composition and richness of alpine shrublands using numerical methods. In the present study, we investigated vegetation and associated environmental variables from 45 sample plots in the middle Qilian Mountains of the northwestern China to classify different community types and to elucidate the species-environment relationships. We also estimated the relative contributions of topography and site conditions to spatial distribution patterns of the shrub communities using the variation partitioning. The results showed that four shrub community types were identified and striking differences in floristic composition were found among them. Species composition greatly depended on elevation, slope, shrub cover, soil pH and organic carbon. The important determinants of species richness were soil bulk density and slope. No significant differences in species richness were detected among the community types. Topography and site conditions had almost equal effects on compositional variation. Nonetheless, a large amount of the variation in species composition remained unexplained.

AB The effects of logging and recovery process on avian richness and diversity was compared in recently logged and thirty year post-harvested hill dipterocarp tropical rainforest, using mist-netting method. A total of 803 bird individuals representing 86 bird species and 29 families (i.e. 37.90% from recently logged forest and 62.10% from thirty year post-harvested forest) were captured from October 2010 to September, 2012. Twenty one bird species were commonly captured from both types of forests, 37 bird species were caught only in thirty year post-harvested forest and 28 bird species were caught only from recently logged forest. Arachnothera longirostra - Little Spiderhunter, Malacopteron magnum Rufous-crowned Babbler, Alophoixus phaeocephalus - Yellow-bellied Bulbul and Meiglyptes tukki Buff-necked Woodpecker were the most abundant four bird species in the thirty year post-harvested forest. On the contrary, seven bird species i.e., Trichastoma rostratum - White-chested Babbler, Lacedo pulchella Banded Kingfisher, Picus miniaceus Banded Woodpecker, Enicurus ruficapillus Chestnut-naped Forktail, Anthreptes simplex Plain Sunbird, Muscicapella hodgsoni Pygmy Blue Flycatcher and Otus rufescens Reddish Scope Owl were considered as the rarest (i.e. each represented only 0.12%). Likewise, A. longirostra, Pycnonotus eiythropthalmos Spectacled Bulbul, P. simplex Cream-vented Bulbul and Merops viridis Blue-throated Bee-eater were the most dominant and Copsychus malaharicus White-rumped Shama Eutylaimus javanicus Banded Broadbill Ixos malaccensis Streaked Bulbul and Harpactes Diard's Trogon (each 0.12%) were the rarest bird species in recently logged forest. CAP analysis indicated that avian species in thirty year post-haniested forest were more diverse and evenly distributed than recently logged forest. However, recently logged forest was rich in bird species than thirty year poStharvested forest. The results revealed that logging and retrieval process affect bird species richness and diversity. However, bird species may respond differently from habitat to habitat i.e., forest logging causes disturbance of some avian species while recovery process may replace the loss of vegetation and harbour a wide array of avian species richness and diversity.

ID SPECIES-DIVERSITY
AB A community composition island biogeography model was developed to explain and predict two community patterns (beta diversity and endemism) with the consideration of speciation, extinction and dispersal processes. Results showed that rate of speciation is positively and linearly associated with beta diversity and endemism, that is, increasing species rates typically could increase the percentage of both endemism and beta diversity. The influences of immigration and extinction rates on beta diversity and endemism are nonlinear, but with numerical simulation, I could observe that increasing extinction rates would lead to decreasing percentage of endemism and beta diversity. The role of immigration rate is very similar to that of speciation rate, having a positive relationship with beta diversity and endemism. Finally, I found that beta diversity is closely related to the percentage of endemism. The slope of this positive relationship is determined jointly by different combinations of speciation, extinction and immigration rates.

AB The most vulnerable stage in the life of plants is the seedling. The transition from wild to agricultural land that plants experienced during and after domestication implied a noticeable change in the seedlings environment. Building on current knowledge of seedling ecology, and on previous studies of cassava, we hypothesise that cultivation should have promoted epigeal germination of seedlings, and more exposed and photosynthetic cotyledons. To test this hypothesis, we phenotyped seedling morpho-functional traits in a set of domesticated and wild progenitor accessions of 20 Eudicot herbaceous crop species. Qualitative traits like epi- versus hypogeal germination, leafy versus storage type of cotyledons, or crypto- versus phanerocotyledonar germination, remained conserved during the domestication of all 20 species. Lengths of hypocotyls and epicotyls, of cotyledon petioles, and indices of cotyledon exposure to the aboveground environment changed during evolution under cultivation. However, those changes occurred in diverse directions, depending on the crop species. No common seedling phenotypic convergence in response to domestication was thus detected among the group of species studied here. Also, none of the 20 crops evolved in accordance with our initial hypothesis. Our results reject the idea that strong selective filters exerted unconsciously by artificial selection should have resulted in generalised channelling of seedling morphology towards more productive and more herbivore risky phenotypes. This result opens up unexplored opportunities for directional breeding of seedling traits.

AB Worldwide, there is growing reliance in forest politics on public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a means for forest-environmental protection. In Sweden, such partnership characterizes the approach in nature conservation agreements (NCAs) in the forest policy from 1993 and onwards. NCAs are negotiated between the County Administrative Board/the Forest Agency and a landowner, where the landowner agrees to, with some compensation, provide a public service in terms of protecting biodiversity. However, assessments of the implementation of NCAs show rather inefficient implementation of set goals in general, even if there are great regional variations. This paper explores factors affecting the establishment of PPPs in two neighboring counties distinguished by high and low level of goal achievement of NCAs respectively. The analysis focuses on the process among the landowners and responsible authorities, their incentives for collaboration, and the potential for developing shared motives. The results suggest that in particular the discretionary power of authorities influences not only the willingness to participate, but also the institutional ability to develop sustainable relationships which largely explains why landowners in some counties are keener to engage in NCAs.

AB Chronosequences, commonly used to assess succession, have been questioned because of their failure to project successional trajectories. Here, we develop a simple analytical approach combining both chronosequence and dynamic data to test the power of age of abandonment and site factors to explain and predict succession. The approach proceeds by first fitting statistical models relating age to attribute values (the chronosequence model) and their observed changes (the dynamic model) to test explanatory power. Predictive power is then tested by bootstrapping the chronosequence model to derive confidence intervals for expected changes and comparing them with the dynamic model. Finally, residuals from both models are tested against site factors. The procedure was applied to six attributes (basal area, plant density, mean plant height, species richness, evenness, and composition) of the woody community (plants >1cm dbh within 0.1-ha plots) in nine abandoned cattle pastures (0-12yr) and three old growth tropical dry forests monitored over 6yr. Age explained 60-97 percent of the variance in community attributes and only 32-57 percent in observed changes. It significantly overestimated basal area and mean height, while species richness and composition were highly predicted. Besides age, management history also explained successional dynamics. Our results suggest age is not necessarily a reliable predictor of short-term successional dynamics, and explanatory power is not indicative of predictive power. Because of this low reliability, caution is needed when applying chronosequences to evaluate ecosystem services' recovery. The analytical approach developed here contributes to a better exploration of those possible limitations.
   Resumen El uso de la cronosecuencia como herramienta para conocer la sucesion ha sido cuestionado debido a la incapacidad de esta para predecir las trayectorias sucesionales. En este estudio se presenta una aproximacion analitica sencilla que combina la informacion de cronosecuencia con informacion dinamica obtenida de mediciones repetidas en el tiempo, para poner a prueba la capacidad de la edad de abandono y de los factores de sitio para explicar y predecir la sucesion. El primer paso consiste en el ajuste de modelos estadisticos que relacionan la edad de abandono con atributos del ecosistema (modelo de cronosecuencia) o con los cambios observados en dichos atributos a traves del tiempo (modelo de la dinamica), lo que permite poner a prueba la capacidad explicativa de la edad de abandono. Aplicando un muestreo con remplazamiento a los datos del modelo de cronosecuencia (bootstrapping) se derivan los intervalos de confianza para los cambios esperados a partir del mismo. La capacidad predictiva del modelo de cronosecuencia se somete a prueba mediante la comparacion de dichos intervalos con el modelo dinamico. Finalmente, el efecto de los factores de sitio se pone a prueba relacionando estos ultimos con los residuales de ambos modelos. Este procedimiento se aplico al analisis de seis atributos (area basal, densidad, altura promedio, riqueza de especies, equitatividad y composicion) de la comunidad de plantas lenosas (plantas >1cm de diametro a la altura del pecho al interior de parcelas de 0.1-ha) en nueve potreros abandonados (0-12 anos de abandono) y tres bosques maduros ubicados en una tropical estacionalmente seca y que fueron monitoreados durante 6 anos. La edad explico 60-97 por ciento de la varianza en los atributos de la comunidad, pero solo 32-57 por ciento para los cambios observados. La edad sobreestimo de manera significativa los cambios en area basal y altura promedio, mientras que los cambios en riqueza y composicion de especies fueron adecuadamente predichos. La historia de manejo tambien explico los cambios observados en los atributos. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la edad no es necesariamente un predictor confiable de los cambios sucesionales en periodos cortos de tiempo y que la capacidad explicativa de los modelos no indica su poder predictivo. Debido a esta baja confiabilidad, la aplicacion de los modelos de cronosecuencia en la prediccion de la recuperacion de los servicios ecosistemicos a traves de la sucesion debe hacerse con cautela. La aproximacion analitica desarrollada en el presente estudio contribuye a la exploracion de dichas limitantes de las cronosecuencias.

AB Niche diversification is prominent among the mechanisms proposed to explain tropical rain forest tree diversity, with many studies focusing on trade-offs among shade tolerance and growth. Less obvious is the impact of occasional, ephemeral and often minor disturbances on tree seedling survival. We propose that differential tolerances to soil waterlogging can contribute to the distribution of tree seedling communities along microtopographical gradients. We test this hypothesis experimentally by evaluating survival and performance of planted seedlings across microtopographical gradients in a periodically inundated tropical rain forest environment. Survival and relative growth rates were assessed for six Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) species in Sepilok Forest Reserve (Sabah, Malaysia) over a 2-yr period, during which seedlings were subjected to two brief flooding events. The species were selected on the basis of soil habitat affinities, with two species being primarily associated with low-lying alluvial flats subject to inundation, two being associated with non-flooded mudstone hills, and two species occurring in both habitats. Seedling performance was related to microtopographic elevation within and among plots and to soil moisture among plots. The faster growing species, Shorea argentifolia, Shorea leprosula and Shorea parvifolia, tended to be more vulnerable to high soil moisture in terms of mortality than the three species with lower growth rates. Within plots, soil moisture was inversely correlated with microelevation, and seedlings located at higher microelevations had an increased probability of survival. Microtopographical differences in seedling position could therefore contribute to species assembly processes through differential mortality, particularly in areas subject to minor and ephemeral flooding events.
   Abstrak Kepelbagaian nic adalah di antara cadangan mekanisme yang menonjol untuk menerangkan kepelbagaian pokok tropika hutan hujan di mana kebanyakan kajian memberi tumpuan kepada keseimbangan di antara toleransi keadaan teduh dan pertumbuhan. Bagaimanapun, kesan gangguan yang mempengaruhi kemandirian anak pokok yang berlaku secara sekali-sekala, tidak kekal dan berkeamatan rendah masih kurang jelas. Kami mencadangkan bahawa perbezaan toleransi akibat kelimpahan air atas tanah semasa banjir boleh menyumbang kepada pengagihan komuniti anak pokok di sepanjang cerun mickrotopografi mukabumi. Kami menguji hipotesis ini dengan menilai kemandirian dan prestasi tumbesaran anak benih yang ditanam di sepanjang cerun mickrotopografi mukabumi di persekitaran hutan hujan tropika yang kadangkala tanahnya dilimpah oleh air banjir. Kemandirian dan kadar pertumbuhan relatif anak-anak pokok dinilai untuk enam spesies Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) di Hutan Simpan Sepilok (Sabah, Malaysia) dalam tempoh dua tahun, di mana anak pokok tersebut terdedah kepada dua peristiwa banjir yang singkat. Spesies dipilih mengikut persamaan habitat tanah, di mana dua spesies dijumpai berasosiasi di tanah rendah aluvium yang kadang kala dilanda banjir, dan dua spesies lagi dijumpai di bukit batu lumpur yang tidak dibanjiri. Manakala dua spesies dijumpai di kedua-dua habitat. Prestasi tumbesaran anak pokok di dalam dan di antara plot dipengaruhi oleh ketinggian mukabumi, manakala pengaruh kelembapan tanah hanya didapati di antara plot. Dari segi kematian anak pokok, kelembapan tanah yang tinggi lebih memberi impak kepada spesies yang mempunyai kadar tumbesaran yang tinggi seperti Shorea argentifolia, Shorea leprosula dan Shorea parvifolia berbanding dengan daripada tiga spesies yang mempunyai kadar tumbesaran yang lebih rendah. Dalam plot, kelembapan tanah menunjukkan kaitan kadar songsang dengan ketinggian mikrotopografi mukabumi, dan anak pokok yang terletak di tanah lebih tinggi mempunyai kebarangkalian peningkatan daya hidup yang tinggi. Oleh yang demikian, perbezaan mikrotopografi dalam kedudukan anak pokok boleh mempengaruhi proses pengkelompokan spesies melalui ciri-ciri kematian yang berbeza, terutamanya di kawasan terdedah kepada peristiwa banjir kecil dan tidak kekal.

AB Ants have been shown as particularly affected by land disturbance through deforestation and conversion of forest to agriculture. The effect of land use change on ant diversity in the Congo Basin is not well known. We conducted intensive sampling along a gradient of increasing vegetation disturbance to test the effect of habitat disturbance on ant diversity and Functional Groups composition. Sampling was conducted in 30 plots (5 study sites x 3 habitat x 2 plots/habitat), replicated six times in 1year. In each plot, ants were monitored with pitfall traps, quadrats and baits. We recorded 237 ant morphospecies grouped in 10 subfamilies and 43 genera. Myrmicaria opaciventris was the most abundant species followed by Anoplolepis tenella. Forest had greater ant diversity compared with fallows and mixed-crop fields. Functional groups were dominated by Opportunists, followed by Omnivorous Arboreal Dominants and Generalized Mymicinae. Their composition was not affected by the disturbance, but occurrence of Specialist Predators decreased with increasing disturbance. Occurrence of Generalized Myrmicinae, Opportunists and Subordinate Camponotini increased with disturbance. These results indicate that forest conversion into mixed-crop fields reduce ant diversity. It can also increase abundance of species with generalized diet that predominates where stress and disturbance limits other ants.

AB In this assessment we summarise advances in our knowledge of how UV-B radiation (280-315 nm), together with other climate change factors, influence terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. We identify key uncertainties and knowledge gaps that limit our ability to fully evaluate the interactive effects of ozone depletion and climate change on these systems. We also evaluate the biological consequences of the way in which stratospheric ozone depletion has contributed to climate change in the Southern Hemisphere. Since the last assessment, several new findings or insights have emerged or been strengthened. These include: (1) the increasing recognition that UV-B radiation has specific regulatory roles in plant growth and development that in turn can have beneficial consequences for plant productivity via effects on plant hardiness, enhanced plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens, and improved quality of agricultural products with subsequent implications for food security; (2) UV-B radiation together with UV-A (315-400 nm) and visible (400-700 nm) radiation are significant drivers of decomposition of plant litter in globally important arid and semi-arid ecosystems, such as grasslands and deserts. This occurs through the process of photodegradation, which has implications for nutrient cycling and carbon storage, although considerable uncertainty exists in quantifying its regional and global biogeochemical significance; (3) UV radiation can contribute to climate change via its stimulation of volatile organic compounds from plants, plant litter and soils, although the magnitude, rates and spatial patterns of these emissions remain highly uncertain at present. UV-induced release of carbon from plant litter and soils may also contribute to global warming; and (4) depletion of ozone in the Southern Hemisphere modifies climate directly via effects on seasonal weather patterns (precipitation and wind) and these in turn have been linked to changes in the growth of plants across the Southern Hemisphere. Such research has broadened our understanding of the linkages that exist between the effects of ozone depletion, UV-B radiation and climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Climate change modulates the effects of solar UV radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, particularly for carbon cycling, resulting in UV-mediated positive or negative feedbacks on climate. Possible positive feedbacks discussed in this assessment include: (i) enhanced UV-induced mineralisation of above ground litter due to aridification; (ii) enhanced UV-induced mineralisation of photoreactive dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems due to changes in continental runoff and ice melting; (iii) reduced efficiency of the biological pump due to UV-induced bleaching of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in stratified aquatic ecosystems, where CDOM protects phytoplankton from the damaging solar UV-B radiation. Mineralisation of organic matter results in the production and release of CO2, whereas the biological pump is the main biological process for CO2 removal by aquatic ecosystems. This paper also assesses the interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on the biogeochemical cycling of aerosols and trace gases other than CO2, as well as of chemical and biological contaminants. Interacting effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycles are particularly pronounced at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces.

AB Spatial patterns in community structure are known to exist at a range of spatial scales. By understanding the relative importance of spatial and environmental variation in shaping community structure, it is possible to gain insight into the complexity of the underlying mechanisms driving community assembly. Here, we investigated how fungal community assembly is impacted by species sorting across a strong environmental filter in the same geographic space. Using a spatially explicit sampling design, root and soil associated fungal communities were sampled from eight study sites over a 500 km transect along the south-east coast of Australia. The relative importance of spatial and environmental factors in shaping fungal beta diversity was determined across a range of scales, along with the importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping fungal beta diversity changes for each community type. Fungal community composition patterns were found to be generally similar in both root and soil associated communities, across the scales included in the sampling design (40 m-500 km). However, the mechanisms responsible for driving community assembly differed in the root and soil associated communities. Niche-based processes were found to be influential in shaping soil fungal community assembly, while the patterns in root-associated community structure were consistent with neutral assembly. This may be due to factors such as niche breadth, environmental heterogeneity, dispersal, and immigration differing in importance among the two environments. Our results indicate that both niche and neutral processes can be active in fungal community assembly and provide insight into the conditions under which each class of processes dominate.

AB We studied some aspects of the population biology of A. maculiventris, in areas of tropical rainforest in the natural region of Choco. The males and females brown coloration with a small mole on the back of the head, the proportions and gender in the captured individuals showed significant statistical differences (X-2: 4,81, gl: 1, p: 0,028). The degree of sexual dimorphism (GDS) and sexual dimorphism index was 1.08, mm and 8.5 mm respectively. Females differ significantly from males in all the parts of the body measures. 30 Individuals have spread, which was determined to their reproductive status and failed to register a size minimum of maturity (LHA) in females is 30.7 mm, with a maximum of 39.9 mm and an average of 36.5 mm. In the male the minimum maturity sexual 30.4 mm, and a maximum of 36.7 mm, with an average of 33.8 mm; which indicates that females were more large than males. Assessed habitat use, showing significant statistical differences between the used substrate (X-2=16,89, gl: 3, p: 0,001); and for vertical positions, showed the same behavior (X-2=3,77, gl: 3, p: 0,207). For analyzing dietary species spread 30 stomach, of which 15 belonged to males and 15 females, will register a total 46 gastrointestinal dams that compose its diet showing the orders Coleoptera and Hymenoptera (Formicidae) as the of greater relative importance in the diet.

AB The extent of land use for oil palm plantations has grown considerably in the tropics due to climate, appropriate soil conditions for cultivation and its profitability. However, oil palm plantations may endanger biodiversity through reduction and fragmentation of forest areas. Herein we analyzed the effects on anuran species richness, composition and total abundance in oil palm plantations and surrounding forests in eastern Amazon. We installed seven plots in oil palm plantations and seven plots in surrounding forests, which we surveyed for the presence of anurans through active visual and acoustic surveys during periods of high and low rainfall levels. Anuran assemblages found in forests and oil palm plantations differed in species richness and composition, with a loss of 54% of species in oil palm plantations. No difference was observed in total abundance of anurans between both environments. While conversion of forests to oil palm plantations may result in less negative impacts on anuran diversity than other types of monocultures, such loss is nevertheless high, making the maintenance of relatively greater forested areas around oil palm plantations necessary in order to conserve anuran diversity.

AB Recent studies have generated an explosion of phylogenetic and biogeographic data and have provided new tools to investigate the processes driving large-scale gradients in species diversity. Fossils and phylogenetic studies of plants and animals demonstrate that tropical regions are the source for almost all groups of organisms, and these groups are composed of a mixture of ancient and recently derived lineages. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the large extent of tropical environments during the past 10-50 million years, together with greater climatic stability, has promoted speciation and reduced extinction rates. Energy availability appears to only indirectly contribute to global patterns of species diversity, especially considering how sonic marine diversity gradients can be completely deeoupled from temperature and productivity gradients. Instead, climate stability and time integrated area together determine the baselines of both terrestrial and marine global diversity patterns. Biotic interactions likely augment diversification and coexistence in the tropics.

AB Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are increasingly using big-data approaches to tackle questions at large spatial, taxonomic, and temporal scales. However, despite recent efforts to gather two centuries of biodiversity inventories into comprehensive databases, many crucial research questions remain unanswered. Here, we update the concept of knowledge shortfalls and review the tradeoffs between generality and uncertainty. We present seven key shortfalls of current biodiversity data. Four previously proposed shortfalls pinpoint knowledge gaps for species taxonomy (Linnean), distribution (Wallacean), abundance (Prestonian), and evolutionary patterns (Darwinian). We also redefine the Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the abiotic tolerances of species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited knowledge of species traits (Raunkiaeran) and biotic interactions (Eltonian). We conclude with a general framework for the combined impacts and consequences of shortfalls of large-scale biodiversity knowledge for evolutionary and ecological research and consider ways of overcoming the seven shortfalls and dealing with the uncertainty they generate.

AB Euglossine bees were sampled in three different phytophysiognomies [Rainforest (RF), Mixed Forest (MF) and Seasonal Semi-Deciduous Forest (SF)] of Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF). In this study, euglossine males attracted to eight synthetic scent baits were captured with an entomological net. Results revealed different euglossine bee assemblages associated with three AF ecosystems surveyed. A higher richness (14 spp.) of euglossines was found in the RF, followed by SF (seven spp.) and MF (three spp.) forests. Surprisingly, despite the short distance between MF and SF and that both forest remnants were located in the same studied region and under the same climatic conditions, the species richness detected was lower in MF than in SF. The present study contribute to greater knowledge of euglossine assemblages in remnants of Atlantic Forest areas composed of MF, SF and RF, helping to further understand how the structure of these bee assemblages can vary significantly at the local and/or regional level. In addition, our findings also represent a contribution to the understanding to the orchid bee biogeography.

AB The Yucatan Peninsula contains some of the largest tracts of tropical forest in Mexico. These forests host six species of ungulates, including the largest and last survivor of the Neotropical megafauna, the Central American Tapir; one of the rarest ungulate species in Mexico, the White-lipped Peccary; and one endemic species of deer, the Gray Brocket. The Yucatan Peninsula is also home to another peccary species, two more deer species, five felid species, including the jaguar and the puma, and three species of primates. Most of these species face serious conservation threats, as their habitat is increasingly fragmented and because they are among the preferred targets of subsistence hunters. Some of these species require large areas of habitat in good conservation status to fulfill their basic needs for survival. Several research projects undertaken in the past years, and some currently being carried out, have addressed a lack of basic ecological information in this region. Among the ungulates, ecological research has focused on tapir, white-lipped peccary and the three deer species. For felids, scientific attention has been focused on the two largest species, the jaguar and puma; and all three primate species have received scientific attention recently, although more studies have focused on the black howler monkey. This chapter is an attempt to summarize what is currently known about these, the largest mammal species of the Yucatan Peninsula, and to point out gaps in the existing information. Such information is absolutely necessary to design conservation and management plans for these highly interesting and endangered species.

AB Lianas contribute substantially to the total species richness of tropical forests, accounting for up to a quarter of the woody plant diversity. However, liana diversity is intrinsically linked with forest condition and consequently is altered by human-induced forest modifications. Multiple environmental drivers including forest fragmentation, logging and climate change are impacting tropical forests; the extent and intensity of their effects will likely define future global liana diversity.

AB Soil respiration (R-s) and its biophysical controls were measured over a fixed sand dune in a desertshrub ecosystem in northwest China in 2012 to explore the mechanisms controlling the spatial heterogeneity in R-s and to understand the plant effects on the spatial variation in R-s in different phenophases. The measurements were carried out on four slope orientations (i. e., windward, leeward, north-and south-facing) and three height positions on each slope (i. e., lower, upper, and top) across the phenophases of the dominant shrub species (Artemisia ordosica). Coefficient of variation (i. e., standard deviation/mean) of R-s across the 11 microsites over our measurement period was 23.5 %. Soil respiration was highest on the leeward slope, and lowest on the windward slope. Over the measurement period, plant-related factors, rather than microhydrometeorological factors, affected the microtopographic variation in R-s. During the flower-bearing phase, root biomass affected R-s most, explaining 72% of the total variation. During the leaf coloration-defoliation phase, soil nitrogen content affected R-s the most, explaining 56% of the total variation. Our findings highlight that spatial pattern in R-s was dependent on plant distribution over a desert sand dune, and plant-related factors largely regulated topographic variation in R-s, and such regulations varied with plant phenology.

AB The processes that allow the coexistence of trees and grasses in tropical savannas have long intrigued ecologists. Early theories had a strong focus on climatic controls, but over the last two decades a conceptual model has emerged suggesting that savanna trees are subject to a fire-mediated recruitment bottleneck. Under this model, frequent savanna fires prevent recruitment of saplings into the tree layer, and this bottleneck maintains tree biomass below a climate-determined carrying capacity. We propose that the relevance of this conceptual model, which is based largely on African savanna research, has been substantially overemphasised in the northern Australian context. In this region, the overall abundance of trees in savannas is very strongly controlled by water availability, not fire. There is considerable evidence that the dominant trees of Australian savannas - eucalypts - are one of the most fire-tolerant tree lineages on Earth, and have a remarkable capacity to grow rapidly through the 'fire trap' and reach fire-resistant sizes. The extreme fire tolerance of savanna eucalypts makes them relatively unresponsive to reductions in fire frequency and intensity. In contrast, other groups of trees in Australian savannas typically have a much lower capacity to escape the fire trap, and therefore respond positively in abundance to reductions in fire frequency and intensity. From an applied perspective, there have been suggestions that managers could sequester substantial quantities of carbon (thereby offsetting anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions) by reducing the frequency and intensity of savanna fires and, hence, increasing tree biomass. We contend that if tree biomass in Australian savannas is strongly limited by water availability, then the potential for fire management to increase tree biomass is relatively limited, at least in relation to the dominant eucalypt component. There may be potential to increase the abundance of the more fire-sensitive non-eucalypt tree component, but the biomass carrying capacity of non-eucalypts in this eucalypt-dominated system remains poorly understood, including whether there is a trade-off between eucalypt and non-eucalypt biomass.

AB Directed dispersal is defined as enhanced dispersal of seeds into suitable microhabitats, resulting in higher recruitment than if seeds were dispersed randomly. While this constitutes one of the main explanations for the adaptive value of frugivore-mediated seed dispersal, the generality of this advantage has received little study, particularly when multiple dispersers are involved. We used probability recruitment models of a long-lived rainforest tree in Madagascar to compare recruitment success under dispersal by multiple frugivores, no dispersal, and random dispersal. Models were parameterized using a three-year recruitment experiment and observational data of dispersal events by three frugivorous lemur species that commonly disperse its seeds. Frugivore-mediated seed dispersal was nonrandom with respect to canopy cover and increased modeled per-seed sapling recruitment fourfold compared to no dispersal. Seeds dispersed by one frugivore, Eulemur rubriventer, had higher modeled recruitment probability than seeds dispersed randomly. However, as a group, our models suggest that seeds dispersed by lemurs would have lower recruitment than if dispersal were random. Results demonstrate the importance of evaluating the contribution of multiple frugivores to plant recruitment for understanding plant population dynamics and the ecological and evolutionary significance of seed dispersal.

AB Indigenous and rural communities have developed strategies aimed at supporting their livelihoods and protecting biodiversity. Motivational factors underlying these local conservation strategies, however, are still a largely neglected topic. We aimed to enrich the conceptualization of community-based conservation by exploring trigger events and motivations that induce local people to be engaged in practical institutional arrangements for successful natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. By examining the history and development of three community conservation initiatives in Brazil, Mexico, and Bolivia, we have illustrated and discussed two main ways of understanding community-based conservation from the interaction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. First, incentive-based conservation policies can stimulate people's economic interests and mobilize individual and collective behavior toward the formalization of conservation-oriented actions. Second, environmental justice concerns, such as international and national movements for the recognition of indigenous peoples' rights, can support local people's sense of autonomy and result in increased control over their territory and resources, as well as a renewed conservation commitment. The results are useful from a policy perspective because they provide insight into the governance of conservation development by bridging the gap between communities' culturally based motivations for conservation, which are still embedded in customary institutions, and broader political and socioeconomic contexts.

AB Hainan, the largest tropical island in China, belongs to the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. The Changhua watershed is a center of endemism for plants and birds and the cradle of Hainan's main rivers. However, this area has experienced recent and ongoing deforestation and habitat fragmentation. To quantify habitat loss and fragmentation of natural forests, as well as the land-cover changes in the Changhua watershed, we analyzed Landsat images obtained in 1988, 1995, and 2005. Land-cover dynamics analysis showed that natural forests increased in area (97,909 to 104,023 ha) from 1988 to 1995 but decreased rapidly to 76,306 ha over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily throughout the study period while pulp plantations rapidly expanded after 1995. Similar patterns of land cover change were observed in protected areas, indicating a lack of enforcement. Natural forests conversion to rubber and pulp plantations has a general negative effect on biodiversity, primarily through habitat fragmentation. The fragmentation analysis showed that natural forests area was reduced and patch number increased, while patch size and connectivity decreased. These land-cover changes threatened local biodiversity, especially island endemic species. Both natural forests losses and fragmentation should be stopped by strict enforcement to prevent further damage. Preserving the remaining natural forests and enforcing the status of protected areas should be a management priority to maximize the watershed's biodiversity conservation value.

DT Article
DE biological indicators; mining; Cerrado
AB This work aimed to evaluate the ant species occurring in an area degraded by diamond mining, defining the bioindicators of this degradation. The present study was conducted bimonthly in the municipality of Poxoreu, Mato Grosso state, between June 2010 and April 2011. Four environments were sampled: A1 - area degraded by mining, A2 - area of Cerrado vegetation with recent anthropic activities, A3 - area of Cerrado disturbed approximately 30 years ago, and A4 - area of preserved Cerrado. In each environment, 11 pitfall traps, equidistant 15 meters, were installed to collect ants for 24 hours. The individuals were taken to the Laboratory of Forest Protection/FENF/UFMT and screened for later identification. The bioindicator species were indicated by faunal analysis. The ant species Camponotus (Myrmaphaenus) sp.1 and Forelius brasiliensis can be considered bioindicators of environmental degradation in the areas of diamond mining and human disturbance, while the species Camponotus atriceps, Pachycondyla crassinoda and Paraponera clavata can be considered bioindicators in the preserved Cerrado area.

AB The structure of forest canopies correlates with stand maturity and biomass, and develops consistently over time. Remote-sensing technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have become prominent tools for measuring structural characteristics of forests.
   We walked a portable canopy LiDAR (PCL), an up-facing rangefinder that detects vegetation through the canopy at two kilohertz, along multiple transects at ten different forest stands in the area of Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK. The stands had different species composition, were situated at forest edges and in forest core, were in fragments of different sizes and had different land-use histories. With these data we tested structural differences in vegetation across these stand types.
   Although none of the stands have been managed in the last 70 years, they have not converged structurally. Vertical canopy structure differed between stands that regrew naturally from open field and those with a history of coppice management. Forest stands that have developed following major fellings or through spread on to former grazing land showed some structural similarities to classic natural succession from large disturbances. Stands that were actively managed as coppice over preceding centuries, showed a similar structural pattern to mature forest, but without the tall overstorey that can develop into old growth communities.
   This structural divergence indicates two distinct pathways for secondary forests: with implications for the future biomass, stand structure, and species composition. The legacy of management practices can determine canopy structure decades after the forest is removed from active management, but can also be difficult to discern with remote sensing data. We recommend that "ground-truthing" remote sensing data go beyond traditional checks of height and topography, as the history and composition of secondary forests can have an important influence on the pace and compositional structure of recovery from management.

AB 1. We hypothesized that tropical plant species with different mycorrhizal associations reduce competition for soil phosphorus (P) by specializing to exploit different soil organic P compounds. We assayed the activity of root/mycorrhizal phosphatase enzymes of four tree species with contrasting root symbiotic relationships - arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) (angiosperm and conifer), ectomycorrhizal (EM) and non-mycorrhizal - collected from one of three soil sites within a montane tropical forest. We also measured growth and foliar P of these seedlings in an experiment with P provided exclusively as inorganic orthophosphate, a simple phosphomonoester (glucose phosphate), a phosphodiester (RNA), phytate (the sodium salt of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) or a no-P control. The EM tree species expressed twice the phosphomonoesterase activity as the AM tree species, but had similar phosphodiesterase activity. The non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae tree had markedly greater activity of both enzymes than the mycorrhizal tree species, with root clusters expressing greater phosphomonoesterase activity than fine roots. Both the mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal tree species contained significantly greater foliar P than in no-P controls when limited to inorganic phosphate, glucose phosphate and RNA. The EM species did not perform better than the AM tree species when limited to organic P in any form. In contrast, the non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae tree was the only species capable of exploiting phytate, with nearly three times the leaf area and more than twice the foliar P of the no-P control. Our results suggest that AM and EM tree species exploit similar forms of P, despite differences in phosphomonoesterase activity. In contrast, the mycorrhizal tree species and non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae appear to differ in their ability to exploit phytate. We conclude that resource partitioning of soil P plays a coarse but potentially ecologically important role in fostering the coexistence of tree species in tropical montane forests.

AB In order to reveal the mechanism of succession in subtropical forest along a light gradient, we investigated photosynthetic physiological responses to three light environments in five tree species including a pioneer species Pinus massoniana Lamb., two mid-successional species Schima superba Gardn. et Champ. and Castanopsis fissa (Champ. ex Benth.) Rehd. et Wils., and two late-successional species Cryptocarya concinna Hance. and Acmena acuminatissima (BI.) Merr et Perry) that were selected from Dinghu Mountain subtropical forest, South China. Results showed that, among the three kinds of species in all light conditions (100%, 30% and 12% of full sunlight), the pioneer species had the highest photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), light saturation point (LSP), carboxylation efficiency (CE) and maximum utilisation rate of triose phosphate (TPU) that characterised a strong photosynthetic capacity and high carbon dioxide uptake efficiency. However, a higher light compensation point (LCP) and dark respiration (R-d) as well as lower apparent quantum yield (AQY) indicated that the pioneer specie cannot adapt to low light conditions. Mid-successional species had photosynthetic characteristics in between pioneer and late-successional species, but had the greatest effective quantum yield of PSII (phi(PSII)) and light use efficiency (LUE, expressed in terms of photosynthesis). In contrast to pioneer and mid-successional species, late-successional species had lower photosynthetic capacity and carbon uptake efficiency, but higher shade tolerance and high-light heat dissipation capacity, as characterised by higher levels of total xanthophyll cycle pigments (VAZ) and de-epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle (DEPs). These results indicate that photosynthetic capacity decreases along the successional axis and that late-successional species have more responsive heat dissipation capability to compensate for their inferior photosynthetic capacity.

AB Biodiversity declines in Southeast Asia have led to predictions that many vertebrate species will become extinct within 50 years. Examples of quantified deterioration in species status remain scarce, however. The Southeast Asian geographical range of the Endangered Green peafowl is still contracting due to hunting pressure and habitat disturbance. In Vietnam, the main population lies in the southcentral region with a relatively high density reported in 1998. The aim of this study was to assess the species' current status in Yok Don and Cat Tien National Parks, which are thought to contain the most important Vietnamese populations. We used line and point transects to investigate the density and analyze habitat selection and effects of human activity. The Yok Don population has decreased sharply during the past 15 years, while in Cat Tien, the estimated density was higher. Animals were most numerous close to water sources and lowest where cattle numbers were highest and ground vegetation cover absent. Here we document a significant negative population change in a previously widespread vertebrate species. Although comparisons of population data over long periods are rare, we demonstrate that taking advantage of opportunities to resurvey species can quantify population declines. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Decapods play a crucial role within the reef ecosystem and the development of scuba diving as a survey tool has allowed researchers the opportunity to study the decapod-reef relationship more comprehensively. The present study describes the differences in decapod assemblages in intertidal and subtidal zones at a tropical coastal reef system in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean and reports the importance of scuba diving as a survey technique. A total of 71 decapods were recorded during the research; 42 in the intertidal zone mainly formed by small endobenthic species and 39 in the subtidal zone primarily large species only 10 were found to frequent both sample zones. The study extends the range of Brachycarpus holthuisi Fausto Filho 1966 in Brazil; and also demonstrates how scuba diving can be used to complement traditional methodologies and vice versa. The research shows the advantages of using scuba diving when studying trade endangered decapods, as the methodology allows access to cryptic habitats such as reef caves and underwater cavities which were inaccessible when using traditional techniques. In conclusion scuba diving represents a revolutionary non-destructive survey tool allowing the researcher to directly access a specific decapod assemblage in fragile reef environments and in protected marine areas.

AB This study provides an approximation of the potential impact of fuelwood harvesting in one of the most threatened tropical biodiversity conservation hotspots, the northern portion of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We test the relationship between fuelwood consumption and per capita income for 270 households distributed over 7 rural settlements. In general 76% of the households use fuelwood regularly and consume on average 686 kg/person/year of tree biomass, poorer people, however, consume 961 kg/person/year. Harvesting is concentrated to a few early successional species. Yet, annual rural population demand from 210 municipalities may reach 303,793 tons, equivalent to 1.2 to 2.1 thousand hectares of tropical forest. Fuelwood harvesting cannot be ignored as a major and chronic source of forest degradation in highly fragmented and densely populated landscapes and conciliating biodiversity conservation with poverty amelioration is an urgent task.

AB Economic instruments such as Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are increasingly promoted to protect ecosystems (and their associated ecosystem services) that are threatened by processes of local and global change. Biophysical stressors external to a PES site, such as forest fires, pollution, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, may undermine ecosystem stability and sustained ecosystem service provision, yet their threats and impacts are difficult to account for within PES scheme design. We present a typology of external biophysical stressors, characterizing them in terms of stressor origin, spatial domain and temporal scale. We further analyse how external stressors can potentially impinge on key PES parameters, as they (1) threaten ecosystem service provision, additionality and permanence, (2) add challenges to the identification of PES providers and beneficiaries, and (3) add complexity and costs to PES mechanism design. Effective PES implementation under external stressors requires greater emphasis on the evaluation and mitigation of external stressors, and further instruments that can accommodate associated risks and uncertainties. A greater understanding of external stressors will increase our capacity to design multi-scale instruments to conserve important ecosystems in times of environmental change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Infectious diseases caused by pathogens are now recognized as one of the most important threats to primate conservation. The fact that howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.) are widely distributed from Southern Mexico to Northern Argentina, inhabit a diverse array of habitats, and are considered "pioneers," particularly adapted to exploit marginal habitats, provides an opportunity to explore general trends of parasitism and evaluate the dynamics of infectious diseases in this genus. We take a meta-analysis approach to examine the effect of ecological and environmental variables on parasitic infection using data from 7 howler monkey species at more than 35 sites throughout their distribution. We found that different factors including precipitation, latitude, altitude, and human proximity may influence parasite infection depending on the parasite type. We also found that parasites infecting howler monkeys followed a right-skewed distribution, suggesting that only a few individuals harbor infections. This result highlights the importance of collecting large sample sizes when developing these kinds of studies. We suggest that future studies should focus on obtaining fine-grained measurements of ecological and microclimate changes to provide better insights into the proximate factors that promote parasitism.

AB Establishing large-scale plantations of teak could reduce the pressure on natural forests and sequester atmospheric carbon into durable wood. Understanding the growth dynamics of this species in plantations, outside its natural distribution area, is crucial for forest management. Stem discs of teak were collected in Ivory Coast at two sites, a non-managed plantation (Gagnoa) and a managed plantation (Seguie). All stem discs were processed using the standard dendrochronological methods in order to unravel the relationships between growth and climate. Results showed that growth is slower in Gagnoa compared to the Seguie plantation that is being thinned regularly. In Gagnoa, trees responded positively to April rainfall, i.e., during the early stage of tree-ring formation, and negatively to September-October rainfall, i.e., during the short dry period. In Sgu, trees responded positively to July rainfall, i.e., during latewood formation, under decreasing rainfall. At both sites, tree growth was influenced by sea-surface temperature anomalies during the summer in the Gulf of Guinea. Teak growth in Sauie could be additionally linked to El Nino events, specifically during three major episodes (1976-77, 1982-83 and 1997-98).

AB The physiological performance of a mid-intertidal limpet Cellana toreuma was determined to study the physiological adaptation of intertidal animals to rapid changes and extreme temperatures during emersion. The relationship between the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT) and in situ operative body temperature was studied to predict the possible impact of climate change on the species. The temperature coefficient (Q(10)) of emersed animals was higher than that of submersed animals and the ratio of aerial: aquatic heart rate rose with increasing temperature. The ABTs of submersed and emersed animals were 30.2 and 34.2 degrees C, respectively. The heart rate and levels of molecular biomarkers (hsps, ampk, ampk and sirt1 mRNA) were determined in 48 h simulated semi-diurnal tides. There were no obvious changes of heart rate and gene expression during the transition between emersion and submersion at room temperature, although expressions of hsp70 and hsp90 were induced significantly after thermal stress. These results indicate that C. toreuma can effectively utilize atmospheric oxygen, and the higher Q(10) and ABT of emersed animals are adaptations to the rapid change and extreme thermal stress during emersion. However, the in situ operative body temperature frequently exceeds the aerial ABT of C. toreuma, indicating the occurrence of large-scale mortality of C. toreuma in summer, and this species should be sensitive to increasing temperature in the scenario of climate change.

SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE

DE Payment of ecosystem service (PES); Water resource management; Kyrgyz
   republic; Poverty
AB The major focus of payment of ecosystem services (PES) approach is that those who provide environmental services should be compensated for doing so and that those who receive the services should pay for their provision. This work tried to explore the potential of payment of ecosystem services under water related ecosystem service in the Krygyz Republic in central Asia to reduce poverty. Also it focussed on the kind of payment method which can be used for implementing PES. A very important aspect is to explore the policy research interface to make it a powerful tool. The site identified based on the pilot project by CAREC can be used as the building block to design further PES scheme in Krygyz Republic. The first and important finding in the report is that PES can become a helping hand to reduce poverty from Kyrgyz Republic with a mode of generating an extra income for poor but we cannot say it is very effective and completely capable of eradication of poverty from the country. The key findings are most dependent on the factors like interest among stakeholders for new tools to address water resource management, a very strong local organization which can do the mediation in implementing the site projects, broker the agreement between sellers and buyers and monitoring the project in further stage and various tensions between downstream and upstream water users. The local governing body needs to set up an institution established to bring together ecosystem service buyers and sellers (KAESBS - Krygyz association of ES buyer and seller). The important step is to design the mechanism so as not to exclude poor land users by keeping transaction costs as low as possible, and being creative in responses and strong local organizations such as community groups or NGOs participation plays a great role in designing and negotiation process.

AB The Chiang Rai province of Thailand has experienced rapid deforestation and consequent land use change in recent years. This research carried out in Chiang Rai province simulated future land uses under three management scenarios and assessed their effect on biodiversity. The Dyna-CLUE model was used to simulate land uses of 2029 according to the management scenarios, and their effect on biodiversity was analyzed by the GLOBIO3 model. About 4% of total area of the province was deforested within 2002-2009 and has a possibility to lose more, that is, 7% by 2029. If this rate of deforestation continues, then biodiversity will be affected as shown by reduced 'mean species abundance' of 0.45 at present to 0.38 by 2029, whereby highly threatened area can be increased up to 15% of the total land area. Hence, protecting locations with higher biodiversity value can be efficient in conserving biodiversity.

TI Application of a Neutral Community Model To Assess Structuring of the
   Human Lung Microbiome
SO MBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID BACTERIAL; ECOLOGY; HEALTH; NICHE; DNA
AB DNA from phylogenetically diverse microbes is routinely recovered from healthy human lungs and used to define the lung microbiome. The proportion of this DNA originating from microbes adapted to the lungs, as opposed to microbes dispersing to the lungs from other body sites and the atmosphere, is not known. We use a neutral model of community ecology to distinguish members of the lung microbiome whose presence is consistent with dispersal from other body sites and those that deviate from the model, suggesting a competitive advantage to these microbes in the lungs. We find that the composition of the healthy lung microbiome is consistent with predictions of the neutral model, reflecting the overriding role of dispersal of microbes from the oral cavity in shaping the microbial community in healthy lungs. In contrast, the microbiome of diseased lungs was readily distinguished as being under active selection. We also assessed the viability of microbes from lung samples by cultivation with a variety of media and incubation conditions. Bacteria recovered by cultivation from healthy lungs represented species that comprised 61% of the 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences derived from bronchoalveolar lavage samples.
   IMPORTANCE Neutral distribution of microbes is a distinguishing feature of the microbiome in healthy lungs, wherein constant dispersal of bacteria from the oral cavity overrides differential growth of bacteria. No bacterial species consistently deviated from the model predictions in healthy lungs, although representatives of many of the dispersed species were readily cultivated. In contrast, bacterial populations in diseased lungs were identified as being under active selection. Quantification of the relative importance of selection and neutral processes such as dispersal in shaping the healthy lung microbiome is a first step toward understanding its impacts on host health.

AB The system of mining and restoration developed and used at the Rio Tinto Alcan Gove bauxite mine between 1973 and 2005 is described. By 2009, this system had been used to restore successfully more than 3000 ha of mined lands to ecosystems dominated by local native open-forest species. The major features of post-restoration development in these restored ecosystems are described, largely based on chronosequences of study sites extending to similar to 30 years. Over this period the plant community developed from a grassland to a shrubland to a closed forest and finally to an open forest. By 26 years, it possessed a similar three-tiered structure to the local native open forests (including the same dominant eucalypt species), together with diverse understory and herbaceous strata colonised by more than 170 species beyond the similar to 39 species sown. The few reported studies of the animal community have indicated rapid colonisation of the restored sites and ongoing community development within three key environmental indicator groups: ants, termites and birds.
   Due to fire exclusion, substantial litter layers have developed at the longer-restored sites and because of their magnitudes they may constitute a risk to the developing keystone canopy eucalypt species when eventually burned. Rapid soil development occurred contemporaneously, with substantial changes in physical properties and large increases in near-surface soil organic matter concentrations, from c. 10 g kg(-1) C at planting to values greater than those present in the adjacent native forests. A wide diversity of nutritionally important ecto and arbuscular mycorrhizas were reported and appear to change with ongoing plant community development. Continuing development of these novel ecosystems seems assured but their future trajectory is likely to depend partly on management decisions relating to the institution of a firing regime concilient with a landscape subject to regular firing.

AB Hermit crabs are important components of Arctic benthic systems, yet baseline data on their densities and distribution patterns in this rapidly changing region are still scarce. Here we compile results of numerous research expeditions to Svalbard, the Barents Sea and northern Norway that were carried out from 1979 to 2011 by the Institute of Oceanology, Polish Academy of Sciences. The diversity of hermit crabs at the northern edge of their occurrence is very low; in Svalbard waters only one species (Pagurus pubescens) was detected. Another species (P. bernhardus), found in northern mainland Norway, north of the Arctic Circle, is likely to extend its distribution northward as the climate warms. Where the two species co-occur, competition between them probably accounts for the smaller sizes and poorer quality shells used by P. pubescens. The composition of the mollusc shells inhabited by these crabs differs between northern Norway and Svalbard, reflecting local mollusc species pools. Hermit crab densities were significantly higher than previously reported (max. mean 10 ind. m(-2)), suggesting their increasing level of dominance in benthic communities in the studied areas. The first to report the distribution of hermit crabs among habitats, this study showed that most individuals occurred at shallow depths (5-150 m), away from glacier termini and on hard bedrock rather than on soft substrata.

AB Land cover change (LCC) models are used in many studies of human impacts on the environment, but knowing how well these models predict observed changes in the landscape is a challenge. We used nearly three decades of LCC maps to run several LCC simulations to: (1) determine which parameters associated with drivers of LCC (e.g. roads) get selected for which transition (forest to deforested, regeneration to deforested or deforested to regeneration); (2) investigate how the parameter values vary through time with respect to the different activities (e.g. farming); and (3) quantify the influence of choosing a particular time period for model calibration and validation on the performance of LCC models. We found that deforestation of primary forests tends to occur along roads (included in 95 % of models) and outside protected areas (included in all models), reflecting farming establishment. Regeneration tends to occur far from roads (included in 78 % of the models) and inside protected areas (included in 38 % of the models), reflecting the processes of land abandonment. Our temporal analysis of model parameters revealed a degree of variation through time (e.g. effectiveness of protected areas rose by 73 %, p < 0.001), but for the majority of parameters there was no significant trend. The degree to which model predictions agreed with observed change was heavily dependent on the year used for calibration (p < 0.001). The next generation of LCC models may need to embed trends in parameter values to allow the processes determining LCC to change through time and exert their influence on model predictions.

AB The emergence of human-induced edges in forested landscapes has caused major threat for the existence of habitat specialists. Woodland key habitat (WKH) concept has been created in the Baltic and Fennoscandian forests to preserve small forest parcels with a high biodiversity value in the production forests. In this study we investigated the occurrence of epiphytic lichen indicator species in black alder WKHs in Southern Latvia. In total 30 black alder WKHs with age of 84 to 129 years were chosen for analysis including stands adjacent to young, middle-aged and mature stands. Sample plots were placed at three distances from the forest edge. Our results indicate significant differences in number of species per sample plots adjacent to stands of different age. Lichen indicator species were considerably more common in habitats adjacent to mature forest stands and further (40-50 m) from the edge. From four lichen indicator species found in this study, sample plots adjacent to young stands hosted only two species. We argue that the indicator species response to human-induced edges is species specific and some of them are resistant to microclimatic changes near the edges.

AB Gap formation and its effects on regeneration have been reported as being important in forest development, but seldom studies concentrated on the gap closure process by lateral extension growth of canopy trees surrounding gaps. We monitored the closure process of 12 artificial gaps for 7 years with three size classes: small (from 68 m(2) to 125 m(2)), middle (from 174 m(2) to 321 m(2)), and large (from 514 m(2) to 621 m(2)); and investigated the regeneration twice in a temperate secondary forest, Northeast China. The closure process can be described through quadratic functions, which showed the closure rates slowed down with gap ages. Large gaps had a higher closure rate (39 m(2) a(-1)) than middle gaps (25 m(2) a(-1)) and small gaps (11 m(2) a(-1)). According to the quadratic equations, the lateral growth could last 11, 13 and 16 years for small, middle and large gaps with a remaining size of 12, 69 and 223 m(2), respectively. As expected, regeneration exhibited the highest seedling density and volume in large gaps. There was no significant difference in regeneration density between middle gaps, small gaps and forest understory in the final investigation; but the volume of regenerated woody species increased significantly from small gaps to large gaps compared with forest understory. These results may provide references on the choice of appropriate gap sizes to promote the regeneration in temperate secondary forests.

AB Nests of the yellow meadow ant (Lasius flavus) occur at high densities in grasslands worldwide. Although many studies have shown that L. flavus nests influence soil nutrient contents, little is known about their effect on soil nutrient cycling rates. The aim of this study was to examine the role of nest-mounds inhabited by L flavus as potential 'hot spots' for soil nutrient cycling. Six pairs of nest-mounds and control soils were selected at a grassland site at the plateau of the Alter Gleisberg (Thuringia, Central Germany). L flavus significantly modified the soil environment within the nest. In comparison to the control soils, nest-mounds were characterized by slightly higher soil temperatures during the summer months. In addition, we found that nests were related to decreased potential C mineralization rates and increased potential net N mineralization rates. Nest-mound soil exhibited lower amounts of SOC, hotwater extractable DOC and DN, and higher concentrations of leachable DOC and DN. Moreover, ants promoted the enrichment of base cations in the nest. Differences in the soil environment between nests and control soils were possibly a result of the burrowing activity of ants, soil mixing, accumulation of aphid honeydew, and decreased plant-derived nutrient inputs into the nest-mound soil. In conclusion, L.flavus nest-mounds had a significant but element dependent effect on the soil nutrient cycling and may represent cold spots for C cycling and hot spots for N cycling. Thus, L. flavus nests increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties and create unique micro-sites within grassland ecosystems. (C) 2014, Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Foliar elemental concentrations are predictors of life-history variation and contribute to spatial patterns in biogeochemical cycling. We examined the contributions of habitat association, local soil environment, and elemental interactions to variation in foliar elemental concentrations in tropical trees using methods that account for phylogeny. We sampled top-soils and leaves of 58 tropical trees in heath forest (HF) on nutrient-poor sand and mixed dipterocarp forest (MDF) on nutrient-rich clay soils. A phylogenetic generalized least squares method was used to determine how foliar nutrient and aluminium (Al) concentrations varied in response to habitat distribution, soil chemistry and other elemental concentrations. Foliar nitrogen (N) and Al concentrations were greater for specialists of MDF than for specialists of HF, while foliar calcium (Ca) concentrations showed the opposite trend. Foliar magnesium (Mg) concentrations were lower for generalists than for MDF specialists. Foliar element concentrations were correlated with fine-scale variation in soil chemistry in phylogenetically controlled analyses across species, but there was limited within-species plasticity in foliar elemental concentrations. Among Al accumulators, foliar Al concentration was positively associated with foliar Ca and Mg concentrations, and negatively associated with foliar phosphorus (P) concentrations. The Al-accumulation trait and relationships between foliar elemental and Al concentrations may contribute to species habitat partitioning and ecosystem-level differences in biogeochemical cycles.

AB Flower resources can affect the guilds, frequency, and behaviour of visitors. This study compared the pollinator guilds and nectar energy of Heliconia psittacorurn L. f. (Heliconiaceae) during the peak and at the end of the flowering period in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest, northeastern Brazil. Nectar production and the availability of calories were highest in the early morning, coinciding with the highest activities of flower visitors. Calorie availability affects pollinator guilds. During the peak of the flowering, we recorded the hummingbirds Amazila leucogaster Gmelin (territorialist) and Phaethornis ruber Linnaeus (trapliner), the butterfly Talides sp. (Hesperiidae), and the bee Exaerete smaragdina Guerin-Meneville. During the final flowering period, Talides sp. and the hummingbirds P ruber and P pretei Lesson & DeLattre were recorded. Heliconia psittacorum is an important resource in the area, and the flower-pollinator syndrome could not predict some of the observed pollinators.

   POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS; MODEL
AB Coexistence of apparently similar species remains an enduring paradox in ecology. Spatial structure has been predicted to enable coexistence even when population-level models predict competitive exclusion if it causes each species to limit its own population more than that of its competitor. Nevertheless, existing hypotheses conflict with regard to whether clustering favours or precludes coexistence. The spatial segregation hypothesis predicts that in clustered populations the frequency of intra-specific interactions will be increased, causing each species to be self-limiting. Alternatively, individuals of the same species might compete over greater distances, known as heteromyopia, breaking down clusters and opening space for a second species to invade. In this study we create an individual-based model in homogeneous two-dimensional space for two putative sessile species differing only in their demographic rates and the range and strength of their competitive interactions. We fully characterise the parameter space within which coexistence occurs beyond population-level predictions, thereby revealing a region of coexistence generated by a previously-unrecognised process which we term the triadic mechanism. Here coexistence occurs due to the ability of a second generation of offspring of the rarer species to escape competition from their ancestors. We diagnose the conditions under which each of three spatial coexistence mechanisms operates and their characteristic spatial signatures. Deriving insights from a novel metric - ecological pressure - we demonstrate that coexistence is not solely determined by features of the numerically-dominant species. This results in a common framework for predicting, given any pair of species and knowledge of the relevant parameters, whether they will coexist, the mechanism by which they will do so, and the resultant spatial pattern of the community. Spatial coexistence arises from complementary combinations of traits in each species rather than solely through self-limitation.

AB Evaluation of conservation policies for agricultural genetic resources (AgGR) requires information on the use and non-use values of plant varieties and animal breeds, as well as on the preferences for in situ and ex situ conservation. We conducted a choice experiment to estimate citizens' willingness to pay (WTP) for AgGR conservation programmes in Finland, and used a latent class model to identify heterogeneity in preferences among respondent groups. The findings indicate that citizens have a high interest in the conservation of native breeds and varieties, but also reveal the presence of preference heterogeneity. Five respondent groups could be identified based on latent class modeling: one implying lexicographic preferences, two with reasoned choices, one indicating uncertain support and one with a preference for the current status of conservation. The results emphasize the importance of in situ conservation of native cattle breeds and plant varieties in developing conservation policies.

AB Reversing anthropogenic impacts on habitat structure is frequently successful through restoration, but the mechanisms linking habitat change, community reassembly and recovery of ecosystem functioning remain unknown. We test for the influence of edge effects and matrix habitat restoration on the reassembly of dung beetle communities and consequent recovery of dung removal rates across tropical forest edges. Using path modelling, we disentangle the relative importance of community-weighted trait means and functional trait dispersion from total biomass effects on rates of dung removal. Community trait composition and biomass of dung beetle communities responded divergently to edge effects and matrix habitat restoration, yielding opposing effects on dung removal. However, functional dispersion-used in this study as a measure of niche complementarity-did not explain a significant amount of variation in dung removal rates across habitat edges. Instead, we demonstrate that the path to functional recovery of these altered ecosystems depends on the trait-mean composition of reassembling communities, over and above purely biomass-dependent processes that would be expected under neutral theory. These results suggest that any ability to manage functional recovery of ecosystems during habitat restoration will demand knowledge of species' roles in ecosystem processes.

Although protected areas are considered to play a central role in conservation of plant genetic resources, the effectiveness of protected areas for maintaining medicinal plant populations subject to intense harvesting pressure remain largely unknown. We conducted genetic and demographic studies of Nothapodytes nimmoniana Graham, one of the extensively harvested medicinal plant species in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India to assess the effectiveness of protected areas in long-term maintenance of economically important plant species.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The analysis of adults and seedlings of N. nimmoniana in four protected and four non-protected areas using 7 nuclear microsatellite loci revealed that populations that are distributed within protected areas are subject to lower levels of harvesting and maintain higher genetic diversity (H-e=0.816, H-o=0.607, A=18.857) than populations in adjoining non-protected areas (H-e=0.781, H-o=0.511, A=15.571). Furthermore, seedlings in protected areas had significantly higher observed heterozygosity (H-o=0.630) and private alleles as compared to seedlings in adjoining non-protected areas (H-o=0.426). Most populations revealed signatures of recent genetic bottleneck. The prediction of long-term maintenance of genetic diversity using BOTTLESIM indicated that current population sizes of the species are not sufficient to maintain 90% of present genetic diversity for next 100 years.
   Conclusions/Significance: Overall, these results highlight the need for establishing more protected areas encompassing a large number of adult plants in the Western Ghats to conserve genetic diversity of economically and medicinally important plant species.

AB Numerous protected areas (PAs) have been created in Africa to safeguard wildlife and other natural resources. However, significant threats from anthropogenic activities and decline of wildlife populations persist, while conservation efforts in most PAs are still minimal. We assessed the impact level of the most common threats to wildlife within PAs in tropical Africa and the relationship of conservation activities with threat impact level. We collated data on 98 PAs with tropical forest cover from 15 countries across West, Central and East Africa. For this, we assembled information about local threats as well as conservation activities from published and unpublished literature, and questionnaires sent to long-term field workers. We constructed general linear models to test the significance of specific conservation activities in relation to the threat impact level. Subsistence and commercial hunting were identified as the most common direct threats to wildlife and found to be most prevalent in West and Central Africa. Agriculture and logging represented the most common indirect threats, and were most prevalent in West Africa. We found that the long-term presence of conservation activities (such as law enforcement, research and tourism) was associated with lower threat impact levels. Our results highlight deficiencies in the management effectiveness of several PAs across tropical Africa, and conclude that PA management should invest more into conservation activities with long-term duration.

AB Plant genetic and ontogenetic variation can significantly impact dependent fungal and arthropod communities. However, little is known of the relative importance of these extended genetic and ontogenetic effects within a species. Using a common garden trial, we compared the dependent arthropod and fungal community on 222 progeny from two highly differentiated populations of the endangered heteroblastic tree species, Eucalyptus morrisbyi. We assessed arthropod and fungal communities on both juvenile and adult foliage. The community variation was related to previous levels of marsupial browsing, as well as the variation in the physicochemical properties of leaves using near-infrared spectroscopy. We found highly significant differences in community composition, abundance and diversity parameters between eucalypt source populations in the common garden, and these were comparable to differences between the distinctive juvenile and adult foliage. The physicochemical properties assessed accounted for a significant percentage of the community variation but did not explain fully the community differences between populations and foliage types. Similarly, while differences in population susceptibility to a major marsupial herbivore may result in diffuse genetic effects on the dependent community, this still did not account for the large genetic-based differences in dependent communities between populations. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining the populations of this rare species as separate management units, as not only are the populations highly genetically structured, this variation may alter the trajectory of biotic colonization of conservation plantings.

AB Understanding linkages between human well-being and ecological stewardship at the land-water nexus is needed in order to develop effective, equitable, and resilient institutions to govern watershed resources. In this paper, we argue that payments for ecosystem services (PES) plays a useful role for achieving integrated and adaptive water resource management, but only if attention is drawn to: (a) nested governance arrangements which reflect horizontal coordination across space according to the economic characteristics of watershed goods and services as well as hierarchical legitimacy between higher and lower levels of governance; (b) 'payments' that are socially negotiated rather than designed according to oversimplified efficiency claims for watershed services and (c) 'payments' that are well placed to overcome the individual, social and physical constraints associated with watershed goods and services so that capabilities or the freedom to do and be can be enhanced. This paper illustrates the impossibility of effectuating sheer market-based trades for regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services due to their inherent non-rival characteristics. Furthermore, a heuristic approach to characterising watershed goods and services clearly demarcates the extent to which PES can serve as an implementation tool for integrated and adaptive water resources management.

AB Rodent-borne hantaviruses are a group of zoonotic agents that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. The transmission of hantaviruses among rodent hosts may be higher with the increase of reservoir host abundance in a given area (density-dependent transmission) and with the decrease of small mammal diversity (dilution effect phenomenon). These population and community parameters may be modified by habitat fragmentation; however, studies that focus on fragmentation and its effect on hantavirus infection risk are scarce. To further understanding of this issue, we assessed some population and community responses of rodents that may increase the risk for hantavirus transmission among wildlife hosts in the Americas. We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the responses of small mammals to fragmentation of native habitats, relative to patch size. Our analyses included five countries and 14 case studies for abundance of reservoir hosts (8 species) and 15 case studies for species richness. We found that a reduction of patch area due to habitat fragmentation is associated with increased reservoir host abundances and decreased small mammal richness, which is mainly due to the loss of non-host small mammals. According to these results, habitat fragmentation in the Americas should be considered as an epidemiological risk factor for hantavirus transmission to humans. These findings are important to assess potential risk of infection when fragmentation of native habitats occurs.

Wood core samples were prepared for anatomical analysis, digitized and growth ring widths were measured using image analysis software. Growth rings were large and well defined in the juvenile phase, reflecting the fast-growing character of the species. Three types of false growth rings were identified. Types I and II occurred in the earlywood and type IV in the latewood zone. The occurrence of false growth rings was higher in juvenile wood than in mature wood. The relationship between growth ring width of teak trees and climate was explored using data of monthly temperature and rainfall. It was found that high temperatures during the rainy season had a significant negative effect on tree growth. On the other hand, a rainfall event during the dry months could affect the growth positively. The correlations found between growth rings and climate factors help understand and predict the local climate influence on teak tree growth for this area in Brazil.

AB Although the Atlantic forest is the best-studied Brazilian phytogeographic domain, few coastal municipalities of the state of Sao Paulo can count on published and critically revised bird species list, which are important initial steps to organize conservation inniciatives. Here we present historical records from Bertioga, a northern coastline municipality of the state of Sao Paulo, as well as recent records obtained in surveys during the past years within the municipality. Surveying methods, carried out between 2008-2011, included point counts, 10-species lists, transect counts and mist nets. This compendium resulted in 330 documented species, 90 of which still await documentation. Of these 420 bird species, 85 (20.4%) are Atlantic forest endemic species and as many as eight, six and 23 are threatened at the global, national and state levels, respectively. Seventeen species are reported from Bertioga for the first time. Some records based exclusively on sightings must be carefully considered, whereas the species richness reflects the diversity of the habitats we visited, which varied from lowland and montane forests, to slopes and fluvial and tidal-influenced environments. We highlight that every habitat of the region should be continuously inventoried and that the absence of legal protection of lowland forests (which are not considered under the elevational threshold of the Serra do Mar State Park) must be reevaluated, as they harbor a greater number of endemic and threatened species than do other elevational bands.

AB Today, native vegetation in the Valdivian Coastal Range (VCR) is restricted to areas where small-scale land use dominates resulting in a vegetation mosaic. This study (1) provides a description of the vegetation types (VT) within the vegetation mosaic, (2) identifies land use drivers that lead to either degradation or recovery processes and, (3) attempts to provide an explanation for the vegetation mosaic with a conceptual model. In two regions of the VCR we sampled 102 plots for composition of vegetation and indicators of livestock browsing, timber cutting and coppice forestry. We classified the vegetation using a flexible beta method and Bray-Curtis distance. Diagnostic species were identified by an extended indicator species analysis. The clustering results were visualized in NMDS and recursive partitioning was used to explain variations in the VTs as a function of the land use variables. Differentiating effects were tested using PERMANOVA and a conceptual model for the vegetation dynamics was developed from the results. Four VTs such as (1) extensively grazed non-native grasslands (EGN); (2), closed and semi-closed grazed Ugni and Berberis shrublands; (3) severely impacted evergreen forests; and (4) sparsely disturbed evergreen forests were recognized. The browsing indicators were important for differentiating the VTs. The EGN grasslands were differentiated by having more than 0.075 dung piles/m(2). Areas with fewer dung piles but direct browsing effects had the greatest impact on vegetation. Forests were preserved when the mean browsing index was equal to or lower than 0.5. The cutting frequency was significant in determining overall floristic composition. We showed that shrublands and evergreen forests within the vegetation mosaic and the result of small-scale farming led to high native forest species richness. This makes the vegetation mosaic especially valuable in a landscape dominated by exotic tree monocultures.

AB The influence of white-water flooding and treefall gap formation on terra firme forest regeneration was investigated in Yasuni National Park of western Ecuador. I set up seed traps, collected seed rain and soil samples, and set out seeds and seedlings in unflooded terra firme forest (dry) and its gaps, and in nearby white-water floodplain varzea forest (wet) and its gaps. I found that (1) total number of dispersed seeds was greatest in the dry gaps with more seeds and greater richness in the gaps than the forest for both forest types, (2) the greatest number of seedlings germinated from wet gap soils with the least from the dry forest with gaps having more seedlings compared to their respective forests, (3) on average 30% of seeds remained after two weeks in the field and species seed losses were significantly different in all but one of the four sites, (4) more large seeds than small seeds were lost to pathogens and those losses were greater in the forests than the gaps, (5) as seed mass increased seedlings survival rates also increased but growth rates declined, and (6) more seedlings survived in gaps compared to closed forests where they grew faster with a larger leaf area ratio. Past sampling has shown that species composition differed between forest types, and present results show that the greatest seed and seedlings losses and the slowest growth rates were in intact terra firme forest, there were medium losses and medium growth rates in terra firme gaps and in the intact varzea forest, and the smallest losses and fastest growth rates were found in varzea gaps.

AB We determine the effects of various management restrictions on adoption rates of marine Payments for Environmental Services (PES) schemes. Choice experiments are used in order to determine how fisher participation rates change under different marine PES programme designs. Various designs, with differing restriction rates, show different rates of adoption. However, fishers show a high utility loss associated with any move away from the current management situation, irrespective of restriction levels. This indicates that PES scheme costs may be high and creating an enabling environment could be important to reducing perceived losses, as could investment into conditional in-kind compensation mechanisms. The paper also shows choice experiments to be a useful tool in marine PFS design. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the behavioral decisions behind animal movement and space use patterns is a key challenge for behavioral ecology. Tools to quantify these patterns from movement and animal-habitat interactions are vital for transforming ecology into a predictive science. This is particularly important in environments undergoing rapid anthropogenic changes, such as the Amazon rainforest, where animals face novel landscapes. Insectivorous bird flocks are key elements of avian biodiversity in the Amazonian ecosystem. Therefore, disentangling and quantifying the drivers behind their movement and space use patterns is of great importance for Amazonian conservation. We use a step selection function (SSF) approach to uncover environmental drivers behind movement choices. This is used to construct a mechanistic model, from which we derive predicted utilization distributions (home ranges) of flocks. We show that movement decisions are significantly influenced by canopy height and topography, but depletion and renewal of resources do not appear to affect movement significantly. We quantify the magnitude of these effects and demonstrate that they are helpful for understanding various heterogeneous aspects of space use. We compare our results to recent analytic derivations of space use, demonstrating that the analytic approximation is only accurate when assuming that there is no persistence in the animals' movement. Our model can be translated into other environments or hypothetical scenarios, such as those given by proposed future anthropogenic actions, to make predictions of spatial patterns in bird flocks. Furthermore, our approach is quite general, so could potentially be used to understand the drivers of movement and spatial patterns for a wide variety of animal communities.

AB Forecasting the response of species and communities to environmental change is a priority for multiple disciplines in the natural sciences. In looking toward the future, much can be learned from examining faunal response under past episodes of environmental change. Typically, retrospective approaches are limited to one spatial and temporal scale. Here, we illustrate how integrating across spatiotemporal scales can provide powerful insights into faunal response, and can inform conservation and management. To do this we compare paleontological and neontological studies on the small mammal fauna of the Great Basin. Small mammal species and their assemblages have long been recognized as indicators of ecological change and ecosystem health. We use fossil data from two long-term owl roosts to reconstruct patterns of richness and the apportioning of abundance among functional groups across multiple episodes of warming during the Holocene (last 10,000 years). We then use these findings as a climate-only baseline against which to compare changes in richness and abundance in 2 independent mountain ranges over the past century. While the past century has been marked by climate warming, the modern day Great Basin landscape also has been subject to intense human land-use practices and the introduction of nonnative plant species. Our contrast highlights that for Great Basin small mammals, modern-day land-use practices are modifying climate-based expectations.

AB We have estimated forest changes and deforestation trends on the island of Unguja (Zanzibar) over the last three decades based on satellite images, forest cover change trajectory and post-forest land cover analysis. The results show that deforestation has intensified and forest cover change rate has changed from 0.03% to -0.46% between 1975-1996 and 1996-2009. On average 0.88 km(2) of forests were lost annually, which makes altogether 29.9 km(2) during the 34 year study period. Using three distinctive land use regimes prevailing on the island, we are able to show that in reality the changes and their causes were unique in each region. The community forest land use regime was dominated by shifting cultivation related cyclical changes combined with growing deforestation rates. The deforestation rates were also high in agroforest land use regime, but here forest clearings were associated with urban sprawl. Opposite to these two regimes, the cover increased in government forest areas, due to large tree planting schemes. However, forest clearings increased significantly since 1996 in government areas and currently all regimes are facing decreasing forest cover. Population growth, in-migration, urbanization, tourism and increasing demand of agricultural and forestry products were the main underlying causes behind the deforestation. Although, the long-term developments of the forest cover are dictated by these relatively uncontrollable underlying causes, we suggest few actions to restrain deforestation and its effects. These actions include establishment of protected area network with forest corridors, heeding trees in urban and agricultural land use planning, replanting cleared governmental plantations and extending plantations outside the Island.

AB Ecological communities are organized in complex ecological networks. Trait-based analyses of the structure of these networks in highly diversified species assemblages are crucial for improving our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes causing specialization in mutualistic networks. In this study, we assessed the importance of morphological traits for structuring plant-hummingbird networks in Neotropical forests by using a novel combination of quantitative analytical approaches. We recorded the visitation of hummingbirds to plant species over an entire year at three different elevations in Costa Rica and constructed quantitative networks based on interaction frequencies. Three morphological traits were measured in hummingbirds (bill length, bill curvature, and body mass) and plants (corolla length, curvature, and volume). We tested the effects of avian morphological traits and abundance on ecological specialization of hummingbird species. All three morphological traits of hummingbirds were positively associated with ecological specialization, especially bill curvature. We tested whether interaction strength in the networks was associated with the degree of trait matching between corresponding pairs of morphological traits in plant and hummingbird species and explore whether this was related to resource handling times by hummingbird species. We found strong and significant associations between interaction strength and the degree of trait matching. Moreover, the degree of trait matching, particularly between bill and corolla length, was associated with the handling time of nectar resources by hummingbirds. Our findings show that bill morphology structures tropical plant-hummingbird networks and patterns of interactions are closely associated with morphological matches between plant and bird species and the efficiency of hummingbirds' resource use. These results are consistent with the findings of seminal studies in plant-hummingbird systems from the neotropics. We conclude that trait-based analyses of quantitative networks contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of the causes of specialization in ecological networks and could be valuable for studying processes of complementary trait evolution in highly diversified species assemblages.

AB In central Africa, most of the timber species require high light at the seedling stage for survival and growth. Forest managers face a regeneration shortage of these light-demanding timber species. To achieve long-term sustainability, there is a need for enrichment methods combining low cost and high species performance. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of Pericopsis elata seedlings in enriched logging gaps in Cameroon. Over five years; the survival and size of each seedling was monitored in 27 logging gaps that were either left without maintenance or cleared. Gaps were relatively small with an average total area of 155 m(2). We found that planted seedlings of P. elata performed well in logging gaps. Even without any maintenance 61% of the planted seedlings survived after five years with an average annual diameter increment of 0.28 cm. P. elata appeared to be a good candidate species for enrichment in logging gaps. We demonstrated that the seedlings of P. elata tolerated a wide range of soil conditions but that their performance was strongly influenced by light availability (gap clearance), suggesting potentially improved performance of P. elata in high light environments such as in plantation or larger gaps.

AB The Santa Maria Amajac paleolake is located in the central portion of Hidalgo, Mexico. Twenty-seven fossil taxa of aquatic and terrestrial plants, gastropods, ostracods, amphibians, and mammals identified previously in the area of the paleolake were selected and their distribution in America during the Late Pliocene-Pleistocene was analyzed using the panbiogeographic method. As a result of the overlap of 27 individual tracks, 5 generalized tracks were obtained: I) Western North American, II) Central North American, III) Eastern North American, IV) Mesoamerican, and V) South American. The generalized tracks are consistent with previous proposals for extant gymnosperms, amphibians, sauropsids, birds, mammals, aquatic plants, insects, beetles, and nematodes, suggesting that distribution patterns have prevailed since the late Pliocene (Blancan). Four biogeographic nodes were identified, 2 situated in North America, in California and Colorado, the third located in the Santa Maria Amajac area in central Mexico, and the fourth located in Central America.

AB Translocation experiments, in which researchers displace animals and then monitor their movements to return home, are commonly used as tools to assess functional connectivity of fragmented landscapes. Such experiments are purported to have important advantages of being time efficient and of standardizing motivation to move across individuals. Yet, we lack tests of whether movement behavior of translocated birds reflects natural behavior of unmanipulated birds. We compared the routine movement behavior of a tropical hummingbird, the Green Hermit (Phaethornis guy), to that of experimentally translocated individuals. We tested for differences in site selection patterns during movement at two spatial scales (point and path levels). We also compared movement rates between treatments. Behaviors documented during translocation experiments reflected those observed during routine movements. At the point level, both translocated and non-translocated birds showed similar levels of preference for mature tropical forest. At the path level, step selection functions showed both translocated and non-translocated hummingbirds avoiding movement across non-forested matrix and selecting streams as movement corridors. Movement rates were generally higher during translocation experiments. However, the negative influence of forest cover on movement rates was proportionately similar in translocation and routine movement treatments. We report the first evidence showing that movement behavior of birds during translocation experiments is similar to their natural movement behavior. Therefore, translocation experiments may be reliable tools to address effects of landscape structure on animal movement. We observed consistent selection of landscape elements between translocated and non-translocated birds, indicating that both routine and translocation movement studies lead to similar conclusions regarding the effect of landscape structure and forest composition on functional connectivity. Our observation that hummingbirds avoid non-forest matrix and select riparian corridors also provides a potential mechanism for pollen limitation in fragmented tropical forest.

AB Predation has almost certainly driven morphological, behavioral, and cognitive changes in primates throughout their evolution. However, the extent to which predation has affected the coexistence of primates within ecosystems has rarely been examined. Recent evidence of "top-down" and indirect effects of top predators on ecological systems suggests that the effect of predation as a structuring mechanism for primate communities should be reconsidered. I review direct and indirect effects of predation on communities and suggest how these may have shaped aspects of primate communities, particularly species richness. I also include preliminary analyses of mammalian prey communities across biogeographic regions to investigate the possible effects of shared predation on primate communities. Keystone predation in which a shared predator feeding on competing consumers facilitates the coexistence of multiple consumer species could theoretically affect the species richness of primate communities. Results from my preliminary analyses show that sites with fewer preferred alternative mammalian prey species had communities with more primate species in Africa and the Neotropics, but not in Asia or Madagascar, where preferred alternative prey did not differ between sites and where primate species made up larger percentages of prey communities. These results suggest that predation pressure on the mammal communities in Africa and the Neotropics may indirectly affect competitive relationships, potentially reducing competitive exclusion. Further research that includes details of prey abundance, rates of predation in specific communities, and human effects on predators and prey in each region is needed to understand better the impact of predators on primate communities.

AB Black flies (Simuliidae) are considered to be pests in rural and in some urban areas in the south of Brazil due to the bites of females. Little information exists on the factors that contribute to Simuliidae distribution in these areas. We sampled 39 streams in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in September 2004 to address ecological aspects. Of the 18 species collected, those that occurred in more than 50% of the streams were: Simulium subnigrum Lutz 1910, Simulium pertinax Kollar 1882, Simulium subpallidum Lutz 1910 and Simulium incrustatum Lutz 1910. Species richness was not influenced by any of the environmental or geographical variables considered, and there was no pattern of species co-occurrence, corroborating the hypothesis of a stochastic distribution of the Simuliidae assemblage. When analyzed individually, only three of seven species with occurrence frequency >30% were related to any of the variables measured. The probabilities of occurrence of Simulium jujuyense Paterson & Shannon 1927 and S. pertinax were higher in streams with high values of water pH and electrical conductivity, whereas the opposite was observed for S. incrustatum. Therefore, due to stochastic distribution, the population studies of Simuliidae are more suitable for predicting the occurrence of species in rural areas than are studies of assemblages.

AB Ants represent a widespread and functionally diverse taxonomic group that are both sensitive to land management and serve as important regulators of key soil processes. Building upon this idea, we sought to understand the impacts of agricultural management on ant communities in the Orinoco River Basin of eastern Colombia and to identify species that could be used as indicators of soil-based ecosystem services. Ants were collected and identified from the soil and litter layer within 75 fields (nine TSBF subsamples along a transect in each field) divided among five common agricultural land uses in the region: 1) annual crops (maize, soy and rice), 2) rubber plantations, 3) oil palm plantations, 4) improved pastures (based on Brachiaria spp.), and 5) semi-natural savannas. As expected, land management was found to greatly influence ant communities. Improved pastures showed the highest species richness (6.9 species per transect) and semi-natural savanna the greatest abundance of ants (145 individuals per transect). Within each of these fields a suite of soil and agroecosystem characteristics were measured and combined into synthetic indicators of five soil-based ecosystem services: 1) nutrient provision, 2) water storage and regulation, 3) maintenance of soil structure, 4) climate regulation services and 5) soil biodiversity and biological activity. Ant species were then associated with these synthetic indicators using the IndVal method to identify indicator species for each of the five consolidated ecosystem services measured. In total, 14 indicator species were identified and found to be significantly associated with either the high or low provision of each of the five services. The development of such bioindicators offers a rapid and relatively inexpensive tool to facilitate land management and policy decisions in this biologically diverse and rapidly changing region of Colombia.

AB Biodiversity conservation has been criticized for undermining or ignoring social well-being. Currently efforts to mutually promote social justice, rural development, and biodiversity conservation, which have been contentious and yielded mixed results, continue to spread despite a general dearth of effective management strategies. We contend that social and economic concerns should be integral to conservation planning and propose that the scale of these phenomena is also critical. To evaluate the merit of this proposal, we adopted and expanded a conservation management strategy framework developed by Joel Heinen and examined how population density, economic disparity, and ethnic heterogeneity vary spatially surrounding 2 contrasting protected areas in East Africa: Kibale National Park in Uganda and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania. Analyses of demographic, wealth, and ethnicity data from regional censuses and household surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010 indicated that choice of scale (landscape or community) changed the management strategies recommended by the model. Therefore, several small peoplepark management strategies varying around a given protected area may be more appropriate than a single large people-park strategy applied across an entire protected area. Correspondingly, scale adjusted Heinen recommendations offered new strategies for effective conservation management within these human landscapes not incorporated in current in situ management plans. Uso de Varias Politicas Pequenas o una unica Politica Mayor como Estrategias para Manejar las Interacciones Gente - Parque
   Resumen La conservacion de la biodiversidad ha sido criticada por socavar o ignorar el bienestar social. Hoy en dia los esfuerzos para promover mutuamente a la justicia social, el desarrollo rural y la conservacion de la biodiversidad, esfuerzos que han sido polemicos y que han arrojado resultados mixtos, se siguen esparciendo a pesar de una escasez general de estrategias de manejo efectivas. Sostenemos que las preocupaciones sociales y economicas deberian ser integrales para la planeacion de la conservacion y proponemos que la escala de estos fenomenos tambien es critica. Para evaluar el merito de esta propuesta, adoptamos y expandimos el marco de trabajo de una estrategia de manejo de conservacion desarrollado por Joel Heinen y examinamos como la densidad poblacional, la desigualdad economica y la heterogeneidad etnica varian espacialmente alrededor de 2 areas protegidas contrastantes en el este de africa: el Parque Nacional Kibale en Uganda y el Parque Nacional Tarangire en Tanzania. Los analisis de riqueza demografica y datos de etnicidad de censos regionales y encuestas en hogares llevados a cabo en 2009 y 2010 indicaron que la opcion de escala (terreno o comunidad) cambiaba las estrategias de manejo recomendadas por el modelo. A partir de esto, varias estrategias pequenas de manejo gente-parque que varian con respecto a un area protegida dada pueden ser mas apropiadas que una estrategia unica mayor aplicada en toda un area protegida. Por consecuencia, las recomendaciones de Heinen ajustadas a la escala ofrecieron nuevas estrategias para un manejo de la conservacion efectiva dentro de estos terrenos humanos no incorporados en planes de manejo in-situ actuales.

AB Landscape connectivity is a key aspect for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem viability. Nowadays, the competition between economic development and nature conservation is intense. In most territories natural vegetation is being replaced by exotic tree plantations, which have a better performance in terms of timber productivity but often, a lower ecological value. We evaluated potential natural forest connectivity improvement in the Cantabria region (Northern Spain) through two main actions: protection of environmentally valuable forest areas, and reforestation with indigenous species of those patches of exotic plantation trees with a particularly important role for the connectivity of the forest network. We established a variety of scenarios to calculate least cost paths, considering the presence or absence of plantation forestry and highways to examine connectivity. Then, we applied two habitat availability indices (integral index of connectivity and probability of connectivity) attending to different dispersal distances. Our analyses show a great potential for improving connectivity using plantation forests in the natural forest network, and a dramatic impact of the highway in the north-south connectivity of the study area. Based on these results, we identified those patches of plantation forest and natural forest that are more important for the maintenance of overall landscape connectivity, and propose their protection or conversion through reforestation. The final proposed network constitutes a larger and better connected natural forested landscape than the existing one. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB AimMacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography proposes that the rate at which species colonize an island depends on the island's isolation (distance effect), whereas the local extinction rate depends on its area (area effect). Alternative hypotheses recognize that area can affect the colonization rate (target effect) and that isolation can affect the extinction rate (rescue effect) and, moreover, that these relationships may dominate. We quantify these relationships and associated turnover rates and incidence using long-term counts of breeding bird communities on islands in an inundated lake.
   LocationThousand Island Lake, China.
   MethodsWe assessed the occupancy and behaviour of breeding birds on 37 islands from 2007 to 2012. We estimated the effects of area, isolation and other biogeographical parameters on the frequencies of colonization and extinction events using multivariate logistic regression. We then extended these results to derived properties such as species turnover rates and incidence.
   ResultsExtinction rates decreased and colonization rates increased on larger islands. Isolation had no significant effect on colonization or extinction rates. Islands had high species turnover overall, and turnover rates followed the same pattern as extinction rates with different areas and isolations. Pool turnover, which controls for the number of species in the pool, was higher on large islands. Species richness also increased with area. Our study of bird communities supported area and target effects, but not distance and rescue effects.
   Main conclusionsIsland area was a better predictor of colonization and extinction than isolation, probably because of the relatively small scale (c. 580km(2)) and homogeneous vegetation structure of our research system, and the strong dispersal ability of birds. We conclude that the differences between our observations and theoretical predictions, or results from other studies that measured colonization and extinction directly, are consistent with the particular biogeography of these islands.

AB Understanding community dynamics during early life stages of trees is critical for the prediction of future species composition. In Mediterranean forests drought is a major constraint for regeneration, but likely not the only factor determining the observed spatial patterns. We carried out a sowing experiment aimed at identifying main filters during seed-seedling transition. Specifically, we studied seed fate (predation, fungi infection, emergence) and subsequent seedling performance (mortality during the first summer and overall recruitment after 2 years) of four co-occurring Mediterranean tree species (Quercus ilex, Quercus faginea, Juniperus thurifera, Pinus nigra). We related these processes to the dominant species composition, microhabitat heterogeneity, herb cover and seed mass. The identity of the dominant species in the forest canopy was more important for recruitment than the forest canopy being dominated by conspecific vs. heterospecific species. The patterns we found suggest that biotic interactions such as facilitation (lower mortality under the canopies) and herb competition (during emergence of J. thurifera) are relevant during recruitment. Moreover, our results pointed to ontogenetic conflicts regarding the seed mass of Q. faginea and to density-dependent seed mortality for Q. ilex, rarely described in Mediterranean ecosystems. We propose that our study species experience population growth in forests dominated by heterospecifics where the recruitment success depends on habitat heterogeneity and on moderated biotic and abiotic stresses created by each species. Our results reveal patterns and mechanisms involved in recruitment constraints that add complexity to the well-known drought-related processes in Mediterranean ecosystems.

AB Tropical forest tree communities exhibit heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, with important implications for animals relying on these resources. However, different organisms may perceive heterogeneity in the floristic community in very different ways. Here, we characterize the overall extent of heterogeneity in the floristic community at Ngogo, in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Also, using information from studies on the diet of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) inhabiting Ngogo, we quantify the extent to which the habitat is likely perceived as heterogeneous by this species. The forest as a whole is slightly more diverse than comparable sites in the Congo Basin, but this diversity is driven by a relatively high proportion of rare species represented by few individuals. From the perspective of chimpanzees, the forest is, unsurprisingly, even more heterogeneous. Species that provide fruit for chimpanzees during times of low overall fruit abundance and that display interindividual synchrony in fruiting were the most common chimpanzee resource in our sample, whereas species that provide fruit during times of low overall fruit abundance and that display asynchronous fruiting were the least common. We discuss the implications of the differences in density and distribution of various classes of resources for chimpanzee habitat use and foraging efficiency.

AB Frugivorous primates are important seed dispersers and their absence from forest patches is predicted to be detrimental to tropical forest regeneration and recruitment. With the reduction of primate populations globally, ecologically resilient primate species, characterized by dietary flexibility and the ability to thrive in a variety of habitats, assume new importance as seed dispersers. The most widely distributed non-human primate, the rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta has been intensively studied but little is known about its role in maintaining ecosystem structure and functions. Due to their frugivorous diet, large group sizes, large home ranges and tolerance to disturbance, rhesus macaques may be effective seed dispersers. We studied seed dispersal by rhesus macaques at the Buxa Tiger Reserve, India, through a combination of behavioural observations and germination experiments. Rhesus macaques dispersed 84% of the 49 species they fed on either through spitting or defecation. Nearly 96% of the handled seeds were undamaged and 61% of the species for which germination tests were performed had enhanced germination. Almost 50% of the monitored seeds among those deposited in situ germinated and 22% established seedlings, suggesting that rhesus macaques are important seed dispersers in tropical forests. Due to their widespread distribution and large populations, rhesus macaques are perceived as common and are categorized as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, effectively excluding them from any conservation plans. Based on the results of our study, we argue that rhesus macaques fulfill critical ecological functions in their habitat and that this parameter must be taken into consideration when they are reviewed for conservation priorities.

AB Rural households in agricultural economies are vulnerable to several environmental risks such as fires, floods, and droughts that may affect their productivity in whole or in part. These hazards are especially relevant in developing countries where farmers have few or no access to traditional risk-transfer techniques, such as insurance and finance, and where low governmental investments in rural infrastructure, risk assessment techniques, or early warning systems makes the aftermath of such hazards more expensive and results in slower recovery for those who are affected. In this paper, we use historical satellite data (Terra) of burned areas in South America to fit a semiparametric spatial model, based on kernel smoothing and on a nonlinear relationship between average time between events and damage, to assess the environmental hazard affecting the land's productivity. The results were twofold: first, we were able to develop a spatial assessment of fire hazard, and second, we were able to evaluate how much a farmer may lose in terms of productivity per hectare due to the environmental hazard. The methodology may be easily adapted to other world regions; to different environmental hazards such as floods, windbreak, windthrow, or related land-use changes; or to integrate various environmental hazards simultaneously, as long as they can be monitored via remote sensing (e.g., satellite imagery, aerial photographs, etc).

AB Plant traits responsible for shade tolerance are controversial. An important feature of shade-tolerant trees is the ability to maintain a positive whole-plant carbon balance [i.e. positive relative growth rate (RGR(plant))] in low-light environments, but a positive RGR(plant) does not always ensure continuous growth. To grow successfully in shaded environments, a plant must increase its leaf biomass with time. However, because RGR(plant) is determined by whole-plant biomass change, RGR(plant) can be positive without any increment of leaf mass. Therefore, we developed a new index focussing on the leaf carbon balance to evaluate growth potential in shaded understoreys. We applied this to cool-temperate forest trees, such as Abies firma (evergreen conifer), Fagus crenata and F.japonica (deciduous broad-leaved trees), and compared their shade tolerance. We termed the new index RGR(leaf)' expressed using net assimilation rate (NAR(leaf)), leaf lifespan (LL), leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf partitioning rate (LP), as [(NAR(leaf)xLP)/LMA - (1/LL)]. RGR(leaf) >0 shows a positive leaf carbon balance, leading to continuous growth. RGR(leaf) allows a quantitative analysis of traits affecting the leaf carbon balance. We planted seedlings of each species in different light environments (open site, deciduous canopy site and evergreen canopy site) and measured their traits. RGR(leaf) and RGR(plant) were strongly correlated, but RGR(plant) was positive even when RGR(leaf) was negative (i.e. no potential of continuous growth). The negative RGR(leaf) values appeared correspond to low survival rates. We found that in the deciduous canopy site, A.firma showed higher RGR(leaf), RGR(plant) and survival rates compared with F.japonica and F.crenata. Analyses of RGR(leaf) and its traits explained that A.firma's relatively high NAR(leaf) and long LL are effective in maintaining a positive leaf carbon balance. Especially in deep shade (i.e. very low NAR(leaf)), a prolonged LL is essential for maintaining a positive leaf carbon balance. These results suggest that in cool-temperate forests, evergreen plants can be more shade-tolerant than deciduous ones.

AB The chemical composition of soil phosphorus can vary markedly during pedogenesis, which has implications for phosphorus availability to plant and microbial communities during long-term ecosystem development. We used NaOH-EDTA extraction and solution P-31 NMR spectroscopy to examine changes in soil phosphorus composition along the Haast chronosequence, a 6,500 year sequence of coastal dunes under lowland temperate rain forest on the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Soils along the chronosequence contained a variety of inorganic (orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and long-chain polyphosphate) and organic (phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters, and phosphonates) phosphorus compounds, although long-chain polyphosphates were detected only in the organic horizon and phosphonates were detected only in mineral soil. The concentrations of most compounds increased initially during the first few hundred years of pedogenesis and then declined as soils aged. However, concentrations of phospholipids, DNA, and long-chain polyphosphate all increased markedly in the organic horizon of older sites. The four inositol hexakisphosphate stereoisomers (myo, scyllo, neo, and D-chiro) accounted for a considerable proportion of the phosphomonoesters in mineral soil along the sequence (36-52 % of the organic phosphorus), but were not detected in quantifiable concentrations in the youngest mineral soil and all but one organic horizon. Concentrations of the two most abundant isomers (myo- and scyllo) declined along the chronosequence, but the scyllo isomer increased markedly as a proportion of the soil organic phosphorus as soils aged. Amorphous aluminum and iron oxides (i.e., extractable in acid-ammonium oxalate) increased continually throughout the chronosequence, indicating that the decline in inositol hexakisphosphate is due to low phosphorus availability rather than a decline in stabilization potential. Overall, these results provide further evidence that the chemical composition of organic and inorganic phosphorus pools vary markedly during pedogenesis, which has important implications for our understanding of biologically-available organic phosphorus during ecosystem development.

AB The long-lived pioneer species Pericopsis elata is one of the rare tropical timbers on the list of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species, supporting the need for accurate and reliable growth data. In one planted and one natural forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, respectively four and 37 Pericopsis stem disks were collected. The tree-ring series of planted trees were used to confirm annual tree-ring formation. For the natural forest, a tree-ring chronology with 24 stem disks ranged from 1852 up to 2008. This chronology was compared with time-series of local precipitation, resulting in a significant correlation with the second half of the rainy season (September-November). This seasonal precipitation was related with sea surface temperatures of the West Indian Ocean. Higher precipitation during El Nino years corresponded with higher tree-ring indices but differences were not significant. In addition, pointer years were rare and did not have a consistent link with extreme climatic conditions. The existence of annual tree rings encourages further tree-ring analyses of P. elata and other flagship timber species in order to further document climate-growth responses and to provide the long-term framework that is needed for sustainable management planning.

AB <list list-type="1" id="fec12279-list-0001"> Although plants can reduce the impacts of herbivory in multiple ways, these defensive traits are often studied in isolation and an understanding of the resulting strategies is incomplete. In the study reported here, empirical evidence was simultaneously evaluated for the three main sets of traits available to plants: (i) resistance through constitutive leaf traits, (ii) tolerance to defoliation and (iii) escape in space, for three caesalpiniaceous tree species Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata and T.korupensis, which co-dominate groves within the lowland primary rain forest of Korup National Park (Cameroon). Mesh cages were placed around individual wild seedlings to exclude insect herbivores at 41 paired canopy gap and understorey locations. After following seedling growth and survival for c.2years, caged and control treatments were removed, leaves harvested to determine nutrient and phenolic concentrations, leaf mass per area estimated, and seedling performance in gaps followed for a further c.2years to quantify tolerance to the leaf harvesting. The more nutrient-rich leaves of the weakly shade-tolerant M.bisulcata were damaged much more in gaps than the two strongly shade-tolerant Tetraberlinia species, which had higher leaf mass per area and concentrations of total phenols. Conversely, the faster-growing M.bisulcata was better able to tolerate defoliation in terms of height growth (reflushing capacity), but not at maintaining overall leaf numbers, than the other two species. Across gaps, insect-mediated Janzen-Connell effects were most pronounced for M.bisulcata, less so for T.korupensis, and not detectable for T.bifoliolata. The three species differed distinctly in their secondary metabolic profiles. Taken together, the results suggested a conceptual framework linking the three sets of traits, one in which the three co-dominant species adopt different strategies towards herbivore pressure depending on their different responses to light availability. This study is one of the first in a natural forest ecosystem to examine resistance to, tolerance of, and escape from herbivory among a group of co-occurring tropical tree species. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi

AB Theory predicts that species performing similar roles for ecological processes or functions can compensate for the loss of others and that this functional redundancy may promote resilience. However, there is no clear evidence for this mechanism, because functional redundancy has been observed to be low in many ecosystems. Using a severe flood event, this study tests whether functional redundancy exists in floodplain ground beetle communities, how it is controlled and how it connects to post-flood resilience. Ground beetles were sampled in floodplain grassland of the Elbe River, Germany. Functional redundancy was estimated as the proportion of species in a community having neutral effects on functional diversity. Null models were used to determine whether functional redundancy is higher or lower than expected and mixed effects modelling was applied to estimate the relationships between functional redundancy, flood disturbance and sampling season. It was found that highly redundant ground beetle communities experienced fewer losses in functional diversity caused by an extreme flood than less redundant communities. Functional redundancy was lowest immediately after the flood, but quickly increased with time since flooding. It was significantly higher in spring than in autumn seasons and significantly higher in habitats exposed to frequent flooding. Null models confirmed that these patterns were to a high degree non-random. The results indicate that functional redundancy plays an important role for stabilizing ground beetles under regular, predictable flooding. However, given sizeable differences in functional diversity before and after the extreme flood, this effect may be lower than expected during extreme events. Other regulating forces, such as stochastic colonization processes and habitat templets, play more important roles directly after extreme disturbances. I therefore assume that a temporal hierarchy of mechanisms, including FR, controls the functional diversity of ground beetles in riparian habitats.

AB Increased nitrogen (N) depositions expected in the future endanger the diversity and stability of ecosystems primarily limited by N, but also often co-limited by other nutrients like phosphorus (P). In this context a nutrient manipulation experiment (NUMEX) was set up in a tropical montane rainforest in southern Ecuador, an area identified as biodiversity hotspot. We examined impacts of elevated N and P availability on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a group of obligate biotrophic plant symbionts with an important role in soil nutrient cycles. We tested the hypothesis that increased nutrient availability will reduce AMF abundance, reduce species richness and shift the AMF community toward lineages previously shown to be favored by fertilized conditions. NUMEX was designed as a full factorial randomized block design. Soil cores were taken after 2years of nutrient additions in plots located at 2000m above sea level. Roots were extracted and intraradical AMF abundance determined microscopically; the AMF community was analyzed by 454-pyrosequencing targeting the large subunit rDNA. We identified 74 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a large proportion of Diversisporales. N additions provoked a significant decrease in intraradical abundance, whereas AMF richness was reduced significantly by N and P additions, with the strongest effect in the combined treatment (39% fewer OTUs), mainly influencing rare species. We identified a differential effect on phylogenetic groups, with Diversisporales richness mainly reduced by N additions in contrast to Glomerales highly significantly affected solely by P. Regarding AMF community structure, we observed a compositional shift when analyzing presence/absence data following P additions. In conclusion, N and P additions in this ecosystem affect AMF abundance, but especially AMF species richness; these changes might influence plant community composition and productivity and by that various ecosystem processes.

AB We analyzed the influence of natural and anthropogenic habitat disturbance on the structure of invertebrate communities living on two species of Heliconia herbs. We compared the invertebrate community structure associated to both species growing in natural forest gaps, on road edges for H. latispatha, and in riparian vegetation for H. collinsiana. We assessed the topological structure of individual-based Heliconia-invertebrate networks. Species richness was greater in H. collinsiana inhabiting riparian vegetation but no differences were found in the diversity of invertebrates for any Heliconia species and habitat. Invertebrate abundance was greater in gaps for H. latispatha and in riparian vegetation for H. collinsiana showing a species turnover in human disturbed habitats. The invertebrate community was not randomly assembled but highly nested, revealing a structured pattern for all habitat conditions. Heliconia-invertebrate network properties appear to be maintained in human disturbed habitats, despite differences in species richness, abundance and composition and host number and quality. Our study contributes to the understanding of the structure of ecological interactions in contrasting habitats. Because they provide food and habitat for the associated fauna and several microhabitats for colonization, heliconias could be used as habitat elements for invertebrate conservation in human impacted landscapes.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated that dispersal limitation, which refers to the limited ability of individuals to reach distant geographic areas, is an important influence on the species that are found in primate assemblages. In this study, we investigate the relative influences of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering in 131 African primate assemblages in 9 biogeographic regions throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we evaluate the dispersal-ecological specialization hypothesis, which posits that there are trade-offs between dispersal ability and ecological specialization that are influenced by climatic variation along latitudinal gradients. The hypothesis predicts that species in assemblages near the equator, where climatic conditions are more stable, will exhibit stronger dispersal limitation and greater ecological specialization than species within assemblages located further from the equator, where climate is more variable. In contrast, assemblages located at higher latitudes are expected to be influenced more strongly by environmental filtering than dispersal limitation. We used hierarchical cluster analysis to identify regions, conducted partial Mantel tests to evaluate the contributions of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering in each region, and evaluated predictors of those contributions with linear regression. In all regions, dispersal limitation was a stronger predictor of community similarity than was environmental filtering, yet the strength of dispersal limitation varied. Dispersal limitation was greatest at low latitudes and declined with increasing absolute latitude. Thus, primate assemblages exhibited a significant latitudinal gradient in dispersal limitation, but not in environmental filtering. These results support aspects of the dispersal-ecological specialization hypothesis and call for future mechanistic studies to address this broad-scale pattern.

AB Many factors contribute to the structure of primate communities, including historical processes, interspecific competition, and climate. Here, we quantify the phylogenetic structure of individual primate communities to evaluate these factors relative to a null model. Then, we examine the effects of species richness and local climate on variation in community phylogenetic structure. We analyze 71 haplorhine and 29 strepsirrhine communities in Africa and quantify their net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon (NTI) indices. Significantly low, i.e., phylogenetically even, NRI and NTI values are indicative of interspecific competition in the past, resulting in closely related species not being found in the same community. In contrast, significantly high, i.e., phylogenetically clustered, NRI and NTI values suggest that closely related species have similar ecological requirements, resulting in closely related species occupying the same community. In a second set of analyses, we used simultaneous autoregressive models to examine if species richness, rainfall, and temperature predict variation in community phylogenetic structure. Most individual communities exhibited phylogenetically random species assemblages. However, significantly structured haplorhine communities were even whereas strepsirrhine communities were clustered. Species richness significantly predicted variation in haplorhine phylogenetic structure, whereas abiotic factors significantly predicted variation in strepsirrhine phylogenetic structure. We suggest that past interspecific competition and habitat filtering have affected a relatively small proportion of African primate communities, but that past interspecific competition has more strongly influenced haplorhine communities whereas environmental conditions have more strongly influenced strepsirrhine communities. Our study illustrates the utility of phylogenetic metrics and spatially explicit models for understanding primate communities.

AB The gradual increase in reforested areas worldwide, as a strategy for mitigating native forest loss, has stressed the need of assessing their real value as habitat for native species. Forest plantations, particularly those based on native species, could be valuable for conservation purposes, especially in heavily fragmented and disturbed ecosystems. We evaluated the value of a monoculture of a native tree species, the Andean alder (Alnus acuminata), for the conservation of avifauna in the Central Andes region, which is considered a bird species diversity hotspot but also suffers from high anthropogenic disturbance levels. Our results suggest that alder plantations are valuable for conservation from three points of view: (1) they have similar or greater bird species richness and abundance than secondary native forests; (2) low community similarities are found between this type of forest compared to secondary forest stands (with 27 species exclusive to alder plantations); and (3) three near threatened species (Odontophorus hyperythrus, Eriocnemis derbyi, and Cyanolyca viridicyanus). Further, 27 out of the 85 species found at the alder plantations were of least concern but showing decreasing population trends. While forest plantations do not replace native forests, they offer habitat for many bird species, some of them being of conservation concern (i.e., included in an IUCN threat category) or with decreasing populations. Hence establishing native species plantations among native forest remnants - especially in heavily fragmented landscapes - could have a positive effect in the conservation of threatened avifauna.

AB The idea that variable fire regimes (pyrodiversity) may increase habitat heterogeneity and, consequently, increase biodiversity at the landscape level is a relatively old one. However, this idea has been recently challenged by studies showing that the biota of fire-prone ecosystems is so resilient to fire that variation in fire regime has little ecological consequences. We evaluated how communities of ants - a dominant faunal group - differ with variation in the frequency and seasonal timing of fire in Brazilian Cerrado (savanna), a global biodiversity hotspot. We compared the number and composition of ant species foraging on the ground and in trees among experimental treatments with three fire frequencies (unburned for 37years and burned every 2 or 4years for the past 16years) and three seasonal timings (early, mid and late dry season) of fire with a biennial frequency. There were no significant differences in ant species richness in trees, and there were no significant differences in the richness of ground-dwelling ants among plots burned at different times of the dry season. However, unburned plots had fewer ground-dwelling ant species than those burned at 2 or 4year intervals. We detected marked differences in species composition across regimes varying in both the frequency and the timing of fire, which were related to fire-induced changes in vegetation structure. Over 40% of the overall ant species richness recorded in our study site was attributed to differences in species composition among fire treatments.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that Cerrado ant diversity at the landscape scale is promoted by a diversity of fire regimes, and therefore supports the validity of the pyrodiversity-biodiversity hypothesis for the Cerrado biome. Our findings suggest that the current policy of fire suppression in Cerrado protected areas has a negative effect on overall biodiversity and therefore should be reconsidered.

AB Species living on rocky shores are subject to periodic tidal emersions and can experience intense thermal stress during daytime low tides. Tetraclita japonica and Megabalanus volcano are common intertidal barnacles in Hong Kong, with T. japonica occupying the high to mid-intertidal zone where its lower limits overlap with the upper limits of M. volcano, which is found in the lower intertidal to subtidal zone. In this study, daily profiles of body temperature and hemolymph osmolality on the shore, and responses to thermal challenge under laboratory conditions were compared between the two species to investigate their behavioral and physiological responses to heat and desiccation stress. On-shore measurements of body temperature revealed contrasting thermal profiles, with T. japonica from the upper shore experiencing greater thermal stress than T. japonica and M. volcano from the lower shore. Aerial exposure of the barnacles was associated with an increase in hemolymph osmolality. M. volcano, however, showed a greater increase in hemolymph osmolality than T. japonica at similar shore levels. When the two species were exposed to rock temperatures of 40 degrees C for 5 h, more individuals (94%) of T. japonica entered a coma state, and at an earlier time than M. volcano (36%). All T. japonica individuals resumed activity when re-immersed in water, whereas in contrast, all M. volcano that went into a coma state did not recover and died within 24 h. Quiescence and reversible coma during the early stages of acute heat stress, as observed in T. japonica, could therefore be adaptive responses to cope with thermal stress in the upper rocky shore.

AB Treefall gap, canopy opening caused by the death of one or more trees, is the dominant form of disturbance in many forest systems worldwide. Gaps play an important role in forest ecology helping to preserve bio- and pedo-diversity, influencing nutrient cycles, and maintaining the complex structure of the late-successional forests. Over the last 30 years, numerous reviews have been written describing gap dynamics. Here we synthesize current understanding on gap dynamics relating to tree regeneration with particular emphasis on gap characteristics considered critical to develop ecologically sustainable forest management systems and to conserve native biodiversity. Specifically, we addressed the question: how do gaps influence forest structure? From the literature reviewed, the size of gaps induces important changes in factors such as light intensity, soil humidity and soil biological properties that influence tree species regeneration and differ in gaps of different sizes. Shade-tolerant species can colonize small gaps; shade-intolerant species need large gaps for successful regeneration. Additionally, gap dynamics differ between temperate, boreal; and tropical forests, showing the importance of climate differences in driving forest regeneration. This review summarizes information of use to forest managers who design cutting regimes that mimic natural disturbances and who must consider forest structure, forest climate, and the role of natural disturbance in their designs.

AB The Brazilian Amazon is under threat from more frequent and intense forest fires, with a few studies showing negative consequences for forest integrity and the biodiversity. However, the impacts of this disturbance on tropical forests remain mostly unknown. We investigate the impacts of forest fires on community parameters and biomass of dung beetles, a cost-effective indicator of disturbance and overall biodiversity, in the northern Brazilian Amazon. Our results indicate that burned forests harbor a modified dung beetle community, with altered abundance, community composition, and structure. Burned forest samples had lower total biomass and were dominated by small-bodied dung beetles. Large-bodied tunneler species were negatively impacted, responding to changes in environmental characteristics such as soil compaction. Lower biomass and higher predominance of smaller species in burned forest is likely to impact dung beetle-mediated ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling and seed dispersal. Our results support that forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon pose a serious threat to local biodiversity and habitat integrity.

AB Coastal defence structures are proliferating to counter rising and stormier seas. With increasing concern about the ecological value of built environments, efforts are being made to create novel habitat to increase biodiversity. Rock pools are infrequent on artificial structures. We compared biodiversity patterns between rock pools and emergent rock and assessed the role of pool depth and substratum incline in determining patterns of biodiversity. Rock pools were more taxon rich than emergent substrata. Patterns varied with depth and incline with algal groups being more positively associated with shallow than deeper habitats. Substratum incline had little influence on colonising epibiota, with the exception of canopy algae in deeper habitats where vertical surfaces supported greater taxon richness than horizontal surfaces. The creation of artificial rock pools in built environments will have a positive effect on biodiversity. Building pools of varying depths and inclines and shore heights will provide a range of habitats, increase environmental heterogeneity, therefore creating more possible ecological niches, promoting local biodiversity.

AB Man-made forest edges affect tree community composition and structure, but there is little information on the effects of natural edges. To detect tree community changes related to natural edges, we investigated a terrestrial forest island, bordered by grassland and mangrove landscapes, on the Brazilian Amazon coast. Forest structure and tree species composition were examined in 10-m-wide and 100-m-long plots from the forest edge to the interior in relation to both landscapes (8 grassland and 4 mangrove plots). Elevation and soil quality did not reveal strong spatial variability; tidal inundation established a boundary for forest expansion without influencing the forest interior. The tree community consisted of 82 species. No distinct changes in vegetation structure and composition with distance from the border were detected. Ordination procedures gave weak indications for shifts in community composition with distance from the edge and in respect to edge type. Single species occurred more frequently either close to or more distant from the grassland-forest interface. No such tendencies were detected at the mangrove-terrestrial forest interface, probably because the lack of structural differences between terrestrial forest and mangrove canopies did not permit the establishment of edge-related microclimatic gradients. Due to the isolation of the forest island and the harsh coastal environment, the tree community was dominated by generalist species which are well adapted to the conditions at the grassland-forest edge. Furthermore, the patchy distribution of frequent species and the high number of rare species made it difficult to detect spatial patterns related to the forest edge.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze the biodiversity and structure of Cloud Mountain Forest (CMF) located in the Trans Volcanic System in Michoacan (TVSM), Mexico, which is threatened by current land use changes. We sampled a variable number of 50 x 2 m transects depending on the total area in each of 11 CMF fragments. We found a total of 2 083 individuals representing 57 tree and shrub species. Results obtained with species abundance, Shannon Index, Similitude (Jaccard with 45% and Sorensen with 31%, as maxim values for both), normalized diameter, vertical structure and cover showed an important heterogeneity in the fragments but with floristic elements from CMF. Fifty percent of reported species had normalized diameters between 2.5-9.49 cm, and 13% had normalized diameters < 38 cm. Estimated Basal area ranged from 7.59 (fragment 3) to 114.4 m(2) ha(-1) (fragment 6). Styrax argenteus, Pinus pseudostrobus and Ternstroemia lineata were dominant in terms of the relative importance value in all CMF fragments sampled. We observed that CMF in the TVSM is confined to ravines, and that area of fragments reported by Inegi was overestimated. Comparisons between the occurrence of species in the CMF analyzed and in nearby and regional sites with the same ecosystem, showed a low similitude, with a higher dissimilitude the distance to the CMF we studied was larger.

AB Despite the overall trend of worldwide deforestation over recent decades, reforestation has also been found and is expected in developing countries undergoing fast urbanization and agriculture abandonment. The consequences of reforestation on landscape patterns are seldom addressed in the literature, despite their importance in evaluating biodiversity and ecosystem functions. By analyzing long-term land cover changes in Puerto Rico, a rapidly reforested (6 to 42% during 1940-2000) and urbanized tropical island, we detected significantly different patterns of fragmentation and underlying mechanisms among forests, urban areas, and wetlands. Forest fragmentation is often associated with deforestation. However, we also found significant fragmentation during reforestation. Urban sprawl and suburb development have a dominant impact on forest fragmentation. Reforestation mostly occurs along forest edges, while significant deforestation occurs in forest interiors. The deforestation process has a much stronger impact on forest fragmentation than the reforestation process due to their different spatial configurations. In contrast, despite the strong interference of coastal urbanization, wetland aggregation has occurred due to the effective implementation of laws/ regulations for wetland protection. The peak forest fragmentation shifted toward rural areas, indicating progressively more fragmentation in forest interiors. This shift is synchronous with the accelerated urban sprawl as indicated by the accelerated shift of the peak fragmentation index of urban cover toward rural areas, i.e., 1.37% yr(-1) in 1977-1991 versus 2.17% yr(-1) in 1991-2000. Based on the expected global urbanization and the regional forest transition from deforested to reforested, the fragmented forests and aggregated wetlands in this study highlight possible forest fragmentation processes during reforestation in an assessment of biodiversity and functions and suggest effective laws/regulations in land planning to reduce future fragmentation.

AB Amazonian rainforests sustain some of the richest tree communities on Earth, but their ecological and evolutionary responses to human threats remain poorly known. We used one of the largest experimental datasets currently available on tree dynamics in fragmented tropical forests and a recent phylogeny of angiosperms to test whether tree communities have lost phylogenetic diversity since their isolation about two decades previously. Our findings revealed an overall trend toward phylogenetic impoverishment across the experimentally fragmented landscape, irrespective of whether tree communities were in 1-ha, 10-ha, or 100-ha forest fragments, near forest edges, or in continuous forest. The magnitude of the phylogenetic diversity loss was low (< 2% relative to before-fragmentation values) but widespread throughout the study landscape, occurring in 32 of 40 1-ha plots. Consistent with this loss in phylogenetic diversity, we observed a significant decrease of 50% in phylogenetic dispersion since forest isolation, irrespective of plot location. Analyses based on tree genera that have significantly increased (28 genera) or declined (31 genera) in abundance and basal area in the landscape revealed that increasing genera are more phylogenetically related than decreasing ones. Also, the loss of phylogenetic diversity was greater in tree communities where increasing genera proliferated and decreasing genera reduced their importance values, suggesting that this taxonomic replacement is partially underlying the phylogenetic impoverishment at the landscape scale. This finding has clear implications for the current debate about the role human-modified landscapes play in sustaining biodiversity persistence and key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage. Although the generalization of our findings to other fragmented tropical forests is uncertain, it could negatively affect ecosystem productivity and stability and have broader impacts on coevolved organisms.

AB Tropical forests are being rapidly altered by logging, and cleared for agriculture. Understanding the effects of these land use changes on soil fungi, which play vital roles in the soil ecosystem functioning and services, is a major conservation frontier. Using 454-pyrosequencing of the ITS1 region of extracted soil DNA, we compared communities of soil fungi between unlogged, once-logged, and twice-logged rainforest, and areas cleared for oil palm, in Sabah, Malaysia. Overall fungal community composition differed significantly between forest and oil palm plantation. The OTU richness and Chao 1 were higher in forest, compared to oil palm plantation. As a proportion of total reads, Basidiomycota were more abundant in forest soil, compared to oil palm plantation soil. The turnover of fungal OTUs across space, true beta-diversity, was also higher in forest than oil palm plantation. Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal abundance was significantly different between land uses, with highest relative abundance (out of total fungal reads) observed in unlogged forest soil, lower abundance in logged forest, and lowest in oil palm. In their entirety, these results indicate a pervasive effect of conversion to oil palm on fungal community structure. Such wholesale changes in fungal communities might impact the long-term sustainability of oil palm agriculture. Logging also has more subtle long term effects, on relative abundance of EcM fungi, which might affect tree recruitment and nutrient cycling. However, in general the logged forest retains most of the diversity and community composition of unlogged forest.

TI Temporal Changes in Randomness of Bird Communities across Central Europe

ID LAND-USE INTENSIFICATION; FOREST FRAGMENTATION; HABITAT; DIVERSITY;
   QUALITY
AB Many studies have examined whether communities are structured by random or deterministic processes, and both are likely to play a role, but relatively few studies have attempted to quantify the degree of randomness in species composition. We quantified, for the first time, the degree of randomness in forest bird communities based on an analysis of spatial autocorrelation in three regions of Germany. The compositional dissimilarity between pairs of forest patches was regressed against the distance between them. We then calculated the y-intercept of the curve, i.e. the 'nugget', which represents the compositional dissimilarity at zero spatial distance. We therefore assume, following similar work on plant communities, that this represents the degree of randomness in species composition. We then analysed how the degree of randomness in community composition varied over time and with forest management intensity, which we expected to reduce the importance of random processes by increasing the strength of environmental drivers. We found that a high portion of the bird community composition could be explained by chance (overall mean of 0.63), implying that most of the variation in local bird community composition is driven by stochastic processes. Forest management intensity did not consistently affect the mean degree of randomness in community composition, perhaps because the bird communities were relatively insensitive to management intensity. We found a high temporal variation in the degree of randomness, which may indicate temporal variation in assembly processes and in the importance of key environmental drivers. We conclude that the degree of randomness in community composition should be considered in bird community studies, and the high values we find may indicate that bird community composition is relatively hard to predict at the regional scale.

AB The discovery of morphologically very similar but genetically distinct species complicates a proper understanding of the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Cryptic species have been frequently observed to co-occur and are thus expected to be ecological equivalent. The marine nematode Halomonhystera disjuncta contains five cryptic species (GD1-5) that co-occur in the Westerschelde estuary. In this study, we investigated the effect of three abiotic factors (salinity, temperature and sulphide) on life-history traits of three cryptic H. disjuncta species (GD1-3). Our results show that temperature had the most profound influence on all life-cycle parameters compared to a smaller effect of salinity. Life-history traits of closely related cryptic species were differentially affected by temperature, salinity and presence of sulphides which shows that cryptic H. disjuncta species are not ecologically equivalent. Our results further revealed that GD1 had the highest tolerance to a combination of sulphides, high salinities and low temperatures. The close phylogenetic position of GD1 to Halomonhystera hermesi, the dominant species in sulphidic sediments of the Hakon Mosby mud volcano (Barent Sea, 1280 m depth), indicates that both species share a recent common ancestor. Differential life-history responses to environmental changes among cryptic species may have crucial consequences for our perception on ecosystem functioning and coexistence of cryptic species.

AB Larval stages represent a bottleneck influencing the persistence of marine populations with complex life cycles. Concholepas concholepas is a gastropod species that sustains the most important small-scale artisanal fisheries of the Chile-Peru Humboldt Coastal current system. In this study, newly-laid egg capsules of C. concholepas collected from 3 localities along the Chilean coast were used to evaluate the potential consequences of projected near-future ocean acidification (OA) on larval development and early post-hatching larval traits. We compared hatching time, hatching success and early survivorship of encapsulated larvae reared under contrasting average levels of pCO(2): 382 (present-day), ca. 715 and ca. 1028 mu atm CO2 (levels expected in near-future scenarios of OA). Moreover, we compared morphological larval traits such as protoconch size, thickness and statolith size at hatching. Some of the developmental traits were negatively affected by pCO(2) levels, source locality, female identity, or the interaction between those factors. Meanwhile, the effect of pCO(2) levels on morphological larval traits showed significant interactions depending on differences among egg capsules and females. Our results suggest that OA may decouple hatching time from oceanographic processes associated with larval transport and reduce larval survivorship during the dispersive phase, with a potential impact on the species' population dynamics. However, the results also show geographic variability and developmental plasticity in the investigated traits. This variation may lead to an increased acclimatization ability, facilitate the persistence of natural populations and mitigate the negative effects that OA might have on landings and revenues derived from the fishery of this species.

AB Spatial distribution pattern of biological related species present unique opportunities and challenges to explain species coexistence. In this study, we explored the spatial distributions and associations among congeneric species at both the species and genus levels to explain their coexistence through examining the similarities and differences at these two levels. We first used DNA and cluster analysis to confirmed the relative relationship of eight species within a 20 ha subtropical forest in southern China. We compared Diameter at breast height ( DBH) classes, aggregation intensities and spatial patterns, associations, and distributions of four closely related species pairs to reveal similarities and differences at the species and genus levels. These comparisons provided insight into the mechanisms of coexistence of these congeners. O- ring statistics were used to measure spatial patterns of species. Omega(0-10), the mean conspecific density within 10 m of a tree, was used as a measure of the intensity of aggregation of a species, and g- function was used to analyze spatial associations. Our results suggested that spatial aggregations were common, but the differences between spatial patterns were reduced at the genus level. Aggregation intensity clearly reduced at the genus level. Negative association frequencies decreased at the genus level, such that independent association was commonplace among all four genera. Relationships between more closely related species appeared to be more competitive at both the species and genus levels. The importance of competition on interactions is most likely influenced by similarity in lifestyle, and the habitat diversity within the species' distribution areas. Relatives with different lifestyles likely produce different distribution patterns through different interaction process. In order to fully understand the mechanisms generating spatial distributions of coexisting siblings, further research is required to determine the spatial patterns and associations at other classification levels.

AB We analysed spectral and textural attributes from the Advanced Land Imager (ALI)/EO-1 for land-cover mapping and inspected their correlation with biophysical parameters of primary and secondary forests from Eastern Amazon. An artificial neural network (ANN) technique selected the most relevant spectral/textural attributes, which were combined for classification of the ALI scene. From the ANN land-cover map, areas classified as primary forest (PF), initial (SS1), intermediate (SS2) and advanced (SS3) stages of secondary succession were studied. Biophysical parameters were determined from field inventory of 40 sample plots. Results showed an overall classification accuracy of 79% using reflectance and 89% using the combined data set. The combined data set included the reflectance of ALI bands 3-9 and the texture metrics mean (bands 3-4; 6-8) and dissimilarity (band 8). The reflectance of the near-infrared/shortwave infrared bands and their texture mean decreased from SS1 to SS3/PF. The gradient between primary and secondary forests controlled the correlations of reflectance with biophysical parameters. While the aboveground biomass, basal area, leaf area index, tree height and canopy cover increased from SS1 to SS3/PF, the reflectance decreased with the development of canopy structure and the resultant canopy shadows. The mean was the only texture metric correlated with biophysical parameters.

AB Seed predation has major effects on the reproductive success of individuals, spatial patterns of populations, genetic variability, interspecific interactions and ultimately in the diversity of tree communities. At a Brazilian savanna, I evaluated the proportional crop loss of Eriotheca gracilipes due the Blue-Fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva) during a fruiting period. Also, I analyzed the relationship between proportional crop loss to Amazons and both fruit crop size and the distance from the nearest damaged conspecific. Trees produced from 1 to 109 fruits, so that Amazons foraged more often on trees bearing larger fruit crop size, while seldom visited less productive trees. Moreover, the relationship between fruit crop sizes and the number of depredated fruits was significant. However, when only damaged trees were assessed, I found a negative and significant relation between fruit crop size and proportional crop loss to Blue-Fronted Amazons. Taking into account this as a measure more directly related to the probability of seed survival, a negative density dependent effect emerged. Also, Amazons similarly damaged the fruit crops of either close or distant neighboring damaged trees. Hence, in spite of Blue-Fronted Amazons searched for E. gracilipes bearing large fruit crops, they were swamped due to the presence of more fruits than they could eat. Moderate seed predation by Blue-Fronted Amazons either at trees with large fruit crops or in areas where fruiting trees were aggregated implies in an enhanced probability of E. gracilipes seed survival and consequent regeneration success.

AB Natural regeneration was studied at 7-year-old native species regeneration sites on abandoned lands in central mountain areas of Hainan Island, off China's southern coast. Using linear sampling, 7 belt transects (each 5 m in width, with a cumulative length of 2000 m) were established and then subdivided into 400 plots (5 m x 5 m). Plant regeneration was surveyed on each plot. For each woody species, the life stage, mature height, dispersal mode, and successional status were assessed. The regenerating woody community at the sites was found to be species-rich, with 40 species identified. However, the community was dominated by a subset of secondary forest pioneer species, such as Liquidambar formosana, Aporosa chinensis, and Lannea grandis, whereas a number of prominent primary forest species, such as Castanopsis hainanensis and Machilus chinensis, were almost completely absent. Clustering analysis divided the 40 species into different functional groups: those with a primarily economic function, a primarily ecological function, or both. A schematic illustration of the distribution of the 40 vegetation species over a larger area was created to show the functions and dominant status of species in the plots. This diagram can provide a clear reference for practical planning of forest rehabilitation. The results indicate that self- restoration has been successful in promoting native forest development to a certain extent, but that there is a need for management interventions in restoring vegetation species diversity and functional complexity, especially where natural successional processes are hampered by artificial or natural disturbances.

AB Human land use legacies have significant and long-lasting ecological impacts across landscapes. Investigating ancient (>400 years) legacy effects can be problematic due to the difficulty in detecting specific, historic land uses, especially those hidden beneath dense canopies. Caracol, the largest (similar to 200 km(2)) Maya archaeological site in Belize, was abandoned ca. A.D. 900, leaving behind myriad structures, causeways, and an extensive network of agricultural terraces that persist beneath the architecturally complex tropical forest canopy. Airborne LiDAR enables the detection of these below-canopy archaeological features while simultaneously providing a detailed record of the aboveground 3-dimensional canopy organization, which is indicative of a forest's ecological function. Here, this remote sensing technology is used to determine the effects of ancient land use legacies on contemporary forest structure. Canopy morphology was assessed by extracting LiDAR point clouds (0.25 ha plots) from LiDAR-identified terraced (n = 150) and non-terraced (n = 150) areas on low (0 degrees-10 degrees), medium (10 degrees-20 degrees), and high (>20 degrees) slopes. We calculated the average canopy height, canopy openness, and vertical diversity from the LiDAR returns, with topographic features (i.e., slope, elevation, and aspect) as covariates. Using a PerMANOVA procedure, we determined that forests growing on agricultural terraces exhibited significantly different canopy structure from those growing on non-terraced land. Terraces appear to mediate the effect of slope, resulting in less structural variation between slope and non-sloped land and yielding taller, more closed, more vertically diverse forests. These human land uses abandoned >1000 years ago continue to impact contemporary tropical rainforests having implications related to arboreal habitat and carbon storage.

AB The lack of knowledge about germination of Brazilian Savanna species has been pointed out as an important constrain to their propagation and, as a consequence, to ecological restoration. The aim of this study was to assess the germination of fifteen herb, shrub and tree Savanna species under different light conditions. We carried out a nursery experiment, sowing the seeds under full sunlight and 75% shade. The experimental design comprised five replicates per species and 10 pots per replicate, in a total of 1500 seeds. We monitored germination daily during nine months. Twelve out of the fifteen species germinated, being three exclusively under 75% shade and four exclusively under full sun. The overall germination was low; six species showed no more than 10% of germination and only two species germinated more than 50%. Three species differed significantly between treatments: Cyrtocymura scorpioides and Fimbristylis autumnalis, which are frequent in open grassland savannas and showed higher germination under full sun, and Styrax pohlii, which is more common in wooded savannas and had higher germination under shade. The natural occurrence of those species in such environments might help to explain our results. Some species remained viable for a long time in the soil, and still germinated five months after sowing. Our results agree with other studies showing that light may differently affect germination of savanna species. The low germination rates and the variability in the time to germinate are important challenges to be overcome by science and technology for the propagation of the Cerrado species, either through the production of seedlings or direct sowing. Information on species response to different abiotic factors are essential to increase the chances of success of such techniques, and to increase the number of species to be used in restoration projects.

AB Tree species richness changes along elevation gradients in response to underlying environmental conditions. Our hypothesis was that richness is associated with climatic variables and decreases with elevation. The objective was to identify trends in species, genus and family richness, diversity and vegetation structure in relation to climate variables along an elevation gradient with successive types of forest in Veracruz, Mexico. Trees were identified and measured in 0.1 ha at 15 sites located from 140 to 4000 m a.s.l. Generalized linear models were used to fit richness, diversity, basal area and density as a function of elevation; the best model was selected using Akaike's Information Criterion. Multivariate analyses were used to explore climatic variables associated to composition of groups of sites along the gradient. Along the entire elevation gradient, species, genus and family richness decreased unimodally, and diversity decreased monotonically. Richness was positively correlated with temperature but not with precipitation. Basal area increased monotonically and highest basal area was associated with high humidity and certain tree species (Quercus and Abies). Ordinations indicated three groups of sites: lower elevation dry forest associated with temperature seasonality, mid-elevation cloud forest associated with precipitation-related variables, and coniferous forest at the top of the gradient associated with elevation. Our study shows that different plant communities are associated with certain climatic conditions and harbour different tree species, genera and families. The results support the hypothesis that species richness is associated with climate, and decreases with elevation.

AB Many ant species construct subterranean nests. The presence of their nests may explain soil respiration hot spots, an important factor in the high CO2 efflux from tropical forests. However, no studies have directly measured CO2 efflux from ant nests. We established 61 experimental plots containing 13 subterranean ant species to evaluate the CO2 efflux from subterranean ant nests in a tropical seasonal forest, Thailand. We examined differences in nest CO2 efflux among ant species. We determined the effects of environmental factors on nest CO2 efflux and calculated an index of nest structure. The mean CO2 efflux from nests was significantly higher than those from the surrounding soil in the wet and dry seasons. The CO2 efflux was species-specific, showing significant differences among the 13 ant species. The soil moisture content significantly affected nest CO2 efflux, but there was no clear relationship between nest CO2 efflux and nest soil temperature. The diameter of the nest entrance hole affected CO2 efflux. However, there was no significant difference in CO2 efflux rates between single-hole and multiple-hole nests. Our results suggest that in a tropical forest ecosystem the increase in CO2 efflux from subterranean ant nests is caused by species-specific activity of ants, the nest soil environment, and nest structure.

AB Allometric biomass allocation theory predicts that leaf biomass (M-L) scaled isometrically with stem (M-S) and root (M-R) biomass, and thus above-ground biomass (leaf and stem) (M-A) and root (M-R) scaled nearly isometrically with below-ground biomass (root) for tree seedlings across a wide diversity of taxa. Furthermore, prior studies also imply that scaling constant should vary with species. However, litter is known about whether such invariant isometric scaling exponents hold for intraspecific biomass allocation, and how variation in scaling constants influences the interspecific scaling relationship between above- and below-ground biomass. Biomass data of seedlings from five evergreen species were examined to test scaling relationships among biomass components across and within species. Model Type II regression was used to compare the numerical values of scaling exponents and constants among leaf, stem, root, and above- to below-ground biomass. The results indicated that M-L and M-S scaled in an isometric or a nearly isometric manner with M-R, as well as M-A to M-R for five woody species. Significant variation was observed in the Y-intercepts of the biomass scaling curves, resulting in the divergence for intraspecific scaling and interspecific scaling relationships for M-L versus M-S and M-L versus M-R, but not for M-S versus M-R and M-A versus M-R. We conclude, therefore, that a nearly isometric scaling relationship of M-A versus M-R holds true within each of the studied woody species and across them irrespective the negative scaling relationship between leaf and stem.

AB Marine worms in the genus Osedax, have specialized 'root' tissues used to bore into the bones of decomposing vertebrate skeletons and obtain nutrition. We investigated the borings of nine Osedax species, using micro computed tomography to quantitatively describe the morphology of the borings and provide three-dimensional reconstructions of the space occupied by Osedax root tissues inside the bone. Each Osedax species displayed a consistent boring morphology in any given bone, but these differed between bones. In bones where multiple species coexisted there was limited evidence for spatial niche partitioning by Osedax root tissues inside the bones investigated here. The new morphological data may be applied to Osedax traces in fossil bones, showing that borings can be used to indicate minimum species richness in these bones.

AB A community of frugivorous weevils was studied by quantitative rearing of 57 weevil species represented by 10 485 individuals from 326 woody plant species in lowland rain forest in Papua New Guinea. Only fruits from 35% of plant species were attacked by weevils. On average, weevils were reared from only 1 in 33 fruits and 1 kg of fruit was attacked by 2.51 individuals. Weevil host specificity was relatively high: 42% of weevil species fed on a single plant genus, 19% on a single plant family and only 16% were reared from more than one family. However, monophagous specialists represented only 23% of all reared individuals. The average 1 kg of fruits was infested by 1.84 individuals of generalist weevils (feeding on allogeneric or allofamilial host species), 0.52 individual of specialists (feeding on a single or several congeneric species), and 0.15 individual of unknown host specificity. Large-seeded fruits with thin mesocarp tended to host specialist species whereas those with thick, fleshy mesocarp were often infested with both specialists and generalists. Weevils tended to avoid small-seeded, fleshy fruits. The low incidence of seed damage (3% of seeds) suggests that weevils are unlikely to play a major role in regulating plant populations via density-dependent mortality processes outlined by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

AB The mechanisms that maintain palm species diversity in tropical rain forests are still debated. Spatial variation in forest structure produces small-scale environmental heterogeneity, which in turn can affect plant survival and reproductive performance. An understanding of how palms respond to variation in forest heterogeneity may help to explain the diversity and structure of their assemblages. We used multivariate ordination statistics and multiple linear models to analyse how palm assemblages are affected by forest structure and landscape features in central Amazonia. In 72 (250 x 4 m) forest plots distributed over an area of 64 km(2), we recorded all seedling and adult palms, and measured topographic and soil variables, and components of forest structure and tree abundance. We found 16 976 adults and 18 935 seedlings of 46 palm species and five varieties including two morphological forms making a total of 50 botanical entities. Results show that landscape features (altitude, slope, proportions of soil sand and clay) and various components of forest structure (such as degree of forest openness, abundance of forest trees, logs and snags, and leaf litter mass), influence spatial variation in richness, abundance and species composition of palms, creating ecological gradients in palm community composition. Despite the statistically significant effects of environmental variables, most species occurred throughout the full range of the ecological gradients we studied, indicating that there is either relatively weak niche specialization in the palms, or that the competition between the species is mediated by diffuse demographic processes that cannot be evaluated only through studies of species distributions.

AB We investigate the effect of patch size on liana diversity and distribution in 19 patches of montane evergreen forest in the Nilgiri hills, Western Ghats, southern India. Additionally, we examined how liana species richness and community assemblage in both edge (within 10 m of the forest edge) and interior regions of forest patches respond to patch size, in order to infer the impact of forest expansion or reduction on the liana communities. A total of 1276 woody liana individuals of 15 species were identified, belonging to 10 genera and nine families. Total species richness of lianas was significantly positively related to forest-patch area, both when analysed for the entire patch, in addition to both core and edge regions when examined separately. Species richness of larger lianas also showed a significant positive relationship with increasing forest patch area. Community assemblage varied with respect to forest edge, with shade-dependent species only occurring in interior patch regions, shade-averse species in edge regions, and shade-tolerant species occurring throughout. Disturbance also played a role in determining the response of liana diversity to patch size, with heavily disturbed patches showing no relationship between patch size and diversity, whereas positive relationships exist in low to moderately disturbed patches. The most significant result is the change in liana community composition between small and larger fragments. Many species present in smaller patches are also present in edge zones of larger fragments. This suggests that lianas are important structural components of montane forest ecosystems, and their compositional patterns are possibly driven by succession. Moreover, this study reveals the importance of edge effect and patch size in influencing liana species richness and compositional patterns.

AB Here we describe a small mammal community in nonfragmented Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. A total of 146 individuals were live captured on the ground and in trees (total effort: 5600 trap-nights). Twelve species were identified by morphology, and identification of seven species was confirmed by DNA barcoding. Most species were terrestrial, with Euryoryzomys russatus being the most frequently captured, while the rodent Juliomys pictipes was semiarboreal and the marsupial Marmosa paraguayana was arboreal. With the capture of Trinomys iheringi, we extend the species distribution to the south. Species favored in disturbed environments as Oligoryzomys spp. and Akodon spp. were uncommon, and this small mammal community is typical of a well-conserved forest.

AB Phosphorus (P) often limits plant growth in subtropical forests. Many studies have focused on plant P responses to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and increasing nitrogen (N) deposition; however, the response of soil P availability to these anthropogenic changes remains unclear. We used open-top chambers to study the changes in soil P fractions in model subtropical forests after 5 years of exposure to elevated CO2 and N addition. Soils studied here were highly weathered and P-deficient. Elevated CO2 increased plant available P in soils as well as P input from litter. The increase in soil P availability was related to the decreased recalcitrant P under elevated CO2. Soil P availability was not reduced by N addition due to the replenishment of P during litter decomposition. N addition led to a small increase in the most readily desorbed inorganic P. N addition with elevated CO2 depleted recalcitrant P. Our results suggest that elevated CO2 and N addition could maintain or even increase soil P availability.

AB In view of the rapid rate of expansion of agriculture in tropical regions, attention has focused on the potential for privately-managed rainforest patches within agricultural land to contribute to biodiversity conservation. However, these sites generally differ in their history of forest disturbance and management compared with other forest fragments, and more information is required on the biodiversity value of these privately-managed sites, particularly in oil-palm dominated landscapes of SE Asia. Here we address this issue, using tropical leaf-litter ants in rainforest fragments surrounded by mature oil palm plantations in Sabah, Borneo as a model system. We compare the species richness and composition of ant assemblages in privately-managed forest fragments ('high conservation value' fragments; HCVs) with those in publically-managed fragments of forest (virgin jungle reserves; VJRs) and control sites in extensive tracts of primary forest. In this way, we test the hypothesis that privately-managed and publically-managed forest fragments differ in their species richness and composition as a result of differences in history and management and hence in habitat quality. In support of this hypothesis, we found that HCVs had much poorer habitat quality than VJRs, including lower sizes and densities of trees, less canopy cover, fewer dipterocarp trees and shallower leaf litter. Consequently, HCVs supported only half the species richness of ants in VJRs, which in turn supported 70 % of the species richness of control sites, with vegetation structure and composition explaining 77 % of the variation among forest fragments in ant species richness. HCVs were also much smaller than VJRs but there was only a weak relationship between fragment size and habitat quality, and species richness was not related to fragment size. VJRs supported 78 % of the 156 species found in extensive tracts of forest whereas HCVs supported only 22 %, which was only slightly higher than the proportion previously recorded in oil palm (19 %). These data support previous findings that publically-managed VJR fragments can make an important contribution to biodiversity conservation within agricultural landscapes. However, we suggest that for these HCVs to be effective as reservoirs of biodiversity, management is required to restore vegetation structure and habitat quality, for instance through enrichment planting with native tree species.

   CONCESSION
AB Avoiding the conversion of tropical production forests to non-forest land uses is a forestry and conservation priority, and is contingent on successful regeneration of commercially important species. The underlying ecological processes that facilitate regeneration, however, are poorly understood. Perhaps as a result, timber yields after regeneration can be lower than expected. Hunting is widespread in timber concessions, and may threaten regeneration by disrupting the various processes facilitated by wildlife. Vertebrate seed dispersers are often heavily hunted, resulting in reduced seed movement for many species and a shift in community composition to favor those plants dispersed by small animals and abiotic means. Timber species with large seeds and fleshy fruit are at particular risk for dispersal and recruitment failure. Hunting also alters granivore communities, resulting in increased predation on species favored by insects and small rodents, and changing the spatial template of seed predation, with detrimental effects on many timber species. Large vertebrate herbivores decline with hunting pressure, resulting in the modification of plant competitive interactions. This is disadvantageous to several traits that are common among timber trees, including relatively slow growth and high wood density. A lack of appreciation for and management of these interactions could threaten forest biodiversity, limit future timber production, and increase the likelihood of forest conversion for other land uses. In this review, I highlight the plant-animal interactions that could influence timber regeneration in tropical forests, as well as how these processes might be expected to change under hunting pressure. The review concludes with recommendations for management and future research priorities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat-specialists have narrower niches, but achieve higher or similar peak performance (e.g. occurrence probability, psi) than habitat-generalists along resource gradients that may be selected from the stand- to landscape-levels. Understanding the relationship between niche width and psi of forest owls will facilitate the development of appropriate management recommendations for their conservation. We assessed psi of the threatened habitat-specialist rufous-legged owls (Strix rufipes) and habitat-generalist austral pygmy-owls (Glaucidium nana) across three spatial scales, and tested whether they differed in resource utilization and peak psi in temperate forests of southern Chile. We conducted 1145 broadcast surveys at 101 sites and used multi-season occupancy models, accounting for imperfect detection, to estimate psi. For S. rufipes, psi ranged between 0.05 and 1 across sites, and was positively associated with the variability (standard deviation, SD) in diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees and bamboo understory density. For G. nana, psi ranged between 0.67 and 0.98, and was positively associated with forest-patch shape index (irregularity and edge effects) and forest cover at 180 ha, although the parameter estimates were imprecise. Relative to G. nana, S. rufipes had lower total resource utilization due to lower psi over gradients of all covariates, but achieved similar peak psi for resources related with stand-level forest complexity and forest stability at the landscape scale. Occurrence of habitat-specialist owls will be promoted if multi-aged stands with a variety of tree sizes (SD of DBH = 19.9 +/- 9 cm), including large old-growth trees, with relatively high bamboo cover (34.2 +/- 26.6%), are retained. Landscapes with forest cover >63.5% would also favor occurrence by habitat-specialist owls. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AimsPlants, fungal endophytes (FEs) and the changing environment interact with each other forming an interlaced network. This study evaluates nonadditive and interactive effects of the FE Acremonium strictum and drought treatment on Atractylodes lancea plantlets.
   Methods and ResultsBy applying FEs (meristem cultures of At.lancea, fungal inoculation of Ac.strictum and plantlet acclimatization) and drought treatment (regular watering, mild drought, severe drought), a research system of At.lancea ramets under different treatments was established. During 12days of drought treatment, the plantlets' physiological responses and basic growth traits were measured and analysed. Although drought and FE presence affected plantlet traits to differing degrees, the interactive effects of the two were more pronounced. In particular under mild drought treatment, the FE conferred drought tolerance to plantlets by enhancing leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity; decreasing the degree of plasmalemma oxidation; and increasing the host's abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. When exposed to regular watering or severe drought, these effects were not significant.
   ConclusionsPlant traits plasticity was conferred by dual effects of drought stress and FEs, and these factors are interactive. Although FEs can help plants cope with drought stress, the beneficial effects are strictly constrained by drought degree.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyDuring finite environmental stress, FEs can benefit plants, and for this reason, they may alleviate the effects of climate change on plants. However, because the benefits of FEs are highly context dependent, the role of FEs in a changing background should be re-assessed.

AB QuestionsWhat are the temporal and spatial variations of groundwater depth along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas? Are patterns of tree density and species diversity along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas controlled by water table depth? Do soil and groundwater nutrient concentrations differ along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas?
   LocationFire-protected savannas of central Brazil.
   MethodsOver 16mo, we monitored temporal and spatial variations in groundwater levels using automated submersible pressure transducers installed in ten wells located along two topographic gradients (five wells per gradient) of 950m and 1703m in length, representing elevations of 47 and 37m a.s.l., respectively. We located the wells according to changes in vegetation physiognomies from woody savannas at high elevations, to open shrubby grasslands at low elevations. Along each topographic gradient we determined soil and groundwater nutrient concentrations as well as richness, density, basal diameter and height of trees within two plots of 14x14m (392m(2)) adjacent to each well.
   ResultsAlong the two gradients, groundwater levels exhibited larger fluctuations at lower than at higher elevations where the water table was deeper. Richness, density and diversity of trees decreased significantly at lower elevations where soils were waterlogged during the wet season. Soil pH and soil concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and manganese decreased significantly as elevation increased along the topographic gradients, but soil nutrient concentrations of phosphorus, aluminium and iron did not change with elevation. Groundwater samples contained only trace amounts of nutrients and were poorly correlated with elevation along the topographic gradients.
   ConclusionsIn Neotropical savannas, the minimum distance between the soil surface and water table depth (reached during the wet season) and the relatively large fluctuations in groundwater limit tree density and diversity at low elevations as savanna trees cannot cope with extended waterlogging during the wet season and with low soil water availability during the dry season. Thus, variations of tree density and diversity along topographic gradients are more related to spatial and temporal variations in water table depth than to soil and groundwater nutrient variations in Neotropical savannas.

AB Sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are responsible for the transmission of protozoan parasites that cause leishmaniases. They are found predominantly in forests, but some species exploit environments that have been subject to deforestation and subsequent human colonization. Studies conducted in Brazil over the past 30 years show that some species are adapting to pen-urban and urban settings. We evaluated sand fly diversity and abundance in the rural settlement of Rio Pardo, Presidente Figueiredo Municipality, Amazonas State, Brazil. Settlement households were divided into four categories. These categories were determined by the human population density and the degree of deforestation in the immediate area. We used CDC light traps to sample the area surrounding 24 households (6 households in each category). Samples were taken on six occasions during September-November 2009 and June-August 2010. A total of 3074 sand fly specimens were collected, including 1163 females and 1911 males. These were classified into 13 genera and 52 species. The greatest abundance of sand flies and the greatest richness of species were observed in areas where human population density was highest. Our results show that changes in the human occupancy and vegetation management in rural settlements may affect the population dynamics and distribution of sand fly species, thereby affecting the local transmission of cutaneous leishmaniases.

AB The effectiveness of reduced-impact logging practices on the maintenance of biodiversity in Borneo has been recognized for some organisms (e.g., mammals). We investigated the effects of reduced-impact logging and conventional selective logging practices on biodiversity by using soil fauna as indicators of disturbance. The study sites were the production forests of the Deramakot Forest Reserve and the Tangkulap Forest Reserve in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo (5 degrees 14-30' N, 117 degrees 11-36' E). We compared macro- and mesofauna in a pristine forest with no logging, a reduced-impact logged forest in Deramakot Forest Reserve, and a conventionally logged forest in Tangkulap Forest Reserve.
   The mean density of soil macrofauna (excluding ants) did not differ significantly among the three forest categories (nested ANOVA, p > 0.05). This tendency was also seen in the density and species richness of Oribatida and Collembola, which showed little difference among forest categories. Nonmetrical multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination diagrams revealed a different community composition in conventionally logged forest sites compared with the other sites. The scores for the NMS first or second axis of soil fauna were correlated with one or more of the values for density, diversity, and species composition of trees. A RELATE test showed the congruence between trees and the Collembola and Oribatida community composition between sites. The results implied that the soil fauna community composition was related to tree communities. In conclusion, the impacts of logging on decomposers in the soil animal communities have been mitigated by the introduction of reduced-impact logging in Deramakot Forest Reserve through the protection of tree vegetation. It is important to consider monitoring the influence of selective logging on soil fauna with regard to the dynamics of the species (or group) composition because total density and species (or group) richness of soil fauna displayed only a marginal response to the different logging practices.

AB Response of growth and secondary metabolites to light intensity are useful measurements to determine suitable silviculture treatments for the cultivation of medicinal plants. Here, we analyzed the growth, flavonols (total flavonol, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) content, flavonols yield per plant, and expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes in 2-year Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) seedlings at four different light intensities (100, 76, 40, and 25 % of full sunlight) in a greenhouse setting. Across all light intensities, the 76 % sunlight treatment produced the highest growth of total biomass, root, stem, and leaf, indicating negative effects of either fulllight or heavy shading on Ginkgo seedling development. Both flavonols (total flavonol, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) content and expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes [PAL (Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), CHS (Chalcone synthase), F3H (Flavanone 3-hydroxylase), and FLS (Flavonol synthase)] in leaves were highest under 100 % sunlight, suggesting that full sunlight promotes the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes and increases flavonoid biosynthesis. The highest and lowest flavonol contents were found in leaves and stems, respectively. The 76 % sunlight treatment produced the highest flavonols yield while the 100 % sunlight produced the highest flavonoids content in leaves, indicating that flavonol production per unit land area depends not only flavonol content but also biomass. Overall, in order to achieve the highest flavonols yield per area in Ginkgo leaf-harvesting plantations, it is important to manipulate light conditions of field.

AB Understanding how communities respond to environmental gradients is critical to predict responses of species to changing habitat conditions such as in regenerating secondary habitats after human land use. In this study, ground-living ants were sampled with pitfall traps in 27 plots in a heterogeneous and diverse subtropical forest to test if and how a broad set of environmental variables including elevation, successional age, and tree species richness influence ant diversity and community composition. In total, 13,441 ant individuals belonging to 71 species were found. Ant abundance was unrelated to all environmental variables. Rarefied ant species richness was negatively related to elevation, and Shannon diversity decreased with shrub cover. There was considerable variation in ant species amongst plots, associated with elevation, successional age, and variables related to succession such as shrub cover. It is shown that younger secondary forests may support a species-rich and diverse community of ants in subtropical forests even though the species composition between younger and older forests is markedly different. These findings confirm the conservation value of secondary subtropical forests, which is critical because subtropical forests have been heavily exploited by human activities globally. However, the findings also confirm that old-growth forest should have priority in conservation as it supports a distinct ant community. Our study identifies a set of ant species which are associated with successional age and may thus potentially assist local conservation planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB While much is known about abiotic and vegetative edge effects in tropical forests, considerably less is known about the impact of forest edges on large mammals. In this study, we examine edge effects in a primate community to determine: 1) the distance from the edge over which edge effects in primate density are detectable, 2) whether individual species exhibit edge effects in their density, and 3) whether biological characteristics can be used to predict primate presence in edge habitats. Given their importance to many primate species, we also examine the influence of the number of large trees. We found edge penetration distances of 150 m for the five species that experienced edge effects, suggesting that primates respond to edge-related changes in the plant community that are known to be strongest over the first 150 m. Four species had higher edge densities: Alouatta macconnelli (folivore-frugivore), Chiropotes chiropotes (frugivorous seed predator), Saguinus midas (frugivore-faunivore), and Sapajus apella apella (frugivore-faunivore); one species' density was lower: Ateles paniscus (frugivore); and the final species, Pithecia chrysocephala (frugivorous seed predator), did not show an edge-related pattern. The lone significant relationship between the biological characteristics examined (body weight, diet, group size, and home range size) and primate presence in edge habitats was a negative relationship with the amount of fruit consumed. Though we did not examine primate responses to edges that border a denuded matrix, we have shown that edges influence primate distribution even following decades of secondary forest regeneration at habitat edges.

AB Land use changes in the Amazon region strongly impact soil macroinvertebrate communities, which are recognized as major drivers of soil functions (Lavelle et aL, 2006). To explore these relations, we tested the hypotheses that (i) soil macrofauna communities respond to landscape changes and (ii) soil macrofauna and ecosystem services are linked. We conducted a survey of macrofauna communities and indicators of ecosystem services at 270 sites in southern Colombia (department of Caqueta) and northern Brazil (state of Para), two areas of the Amazon where family agriculture dominates. Sites represented a variety of land use types: forests, fallows, annual or perennial crops, and pastures. At each site we assessed soil macroinvertebrate density (18 taxonomic units) and the following ecosystem service indicators: soil and aboveground biomass carbon stock; water infiltration rate; aeration, drainage and water storage capacities based on pore-size distribution; soil chemical fertility; and soil aggregation. Significant covariation was observed between macrofauna communities and landscape metric data (co-inertia analysis: RV = 0.30, p < 0.01, Monte Carlo test) and between macrofauna communities and ecosystem service indicators (co-inertia analysis: RV= 0.35, p<0.01, Monte Carlo test). Points located in pastures within 100 m of forest had greater macrofauna density and diversity than those located in pastures with no forest within 100 m (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was significantly correlated with macroporosity (r(2) = 0.42, p<0.01), as was the density of specific taxonomic groups: Chilopoda (r(2) =0.43, p <0.01), Isoptera (r(2) =0.30, p<0.01), Diplopoda (r(2) =0.31, p <0.01), and Formicidae (r(2) = 0.13, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was also significantly correlated with available soil water (r(2) =0.38, p<0.01) as well as other soil-service indicators (but with r(2)<0.10). Results demonstrate that landscape dynamics and composition affect soil macrofauna communities, and that soil macrofauna density is significantly correlated with soil services in deforested Amazonia, indicating that soil macrofauna have an engineering and/or indicator function.

AB Arguably the majority of species on Earth utilise tropical rainforest canopies, and much progress has been made in describing arboreal assemblages, especially for arthropods. The most commonly described patterns for tropical rainforest insect communities are host specificity, spatial specialisation (predominantly vertical stratification), and temporal changes in abundance (seasonality and circadian rhythms). Here I review the recurrent results with respect to each of these patterns and discuss the evolutionary selective forces that have generated them in an attempt to unite these patterns in a holistic evolutionary framework. I propose that species can be quantified along a generalist-specialist scale not only with respect to host specificity, but also other spatial and temporal distribution patterns, where specialisation is a function of the extent of activity across space and time for particular species. When all of these distribution patterns are viewed through the paradigm of specialisation, hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the evolution of host specificity can also be applied to explain the generation and maintenance of other spatial and temporal distribution patterns. The main driver for most spatial and temporal distribution patterns is resource availability. Generally, the distribution of insects follows that of the resources they exploit, which are spatially stratified and vary temporally in availability. Physiological adaptations are primarily important for host specificity, where nutritional and chemical variation among host plants in particular, but also certain prey species and fungi, influence host range. Physiological tolerances of abiotic conditions are also important for explaining the spatial and temporal distributions of some insect species, especially in drier forest environments where desiccation is an ever-present threat. However, it is likely that for most species in moist tropical rainforests, abiotic conditions are valuable indicators of resource availability, rather than physiologically limiting factors. Overall, each distribution pattern is influenced by the same evolutionary forces, but at differing intensities. Consequently, each pattern is linked and not mutually exclusive of the other distribution patterns. Most studies have examined each of these patterns in isolation. Future work should focus on examining the evolutionary drivers of these patterns in concert. Only then can the relative strength of resource availability and distribution, host defensive phenotypes, and biotic and abiotic interactions on insect distribution patterns be determined.

AB Hunting pressure, fragmentation and deforestation have caused global declines in animal abundance, and the consequences for plant communities are poorly understood. Many large-seeded plants, for instance, depend on large and endangered vertebrates for seed dispersal. In some Semi-deciduous Atlantic Forests, endangered tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) are major dispersers of pindo palms (Syagrus romanzoffiana). Here, we compare recruitment patterns of pindo palms between protected and disturbed (defaunated) Atlantic Forest areas in Argentina and evaluate the potential consequences of the lack of the main disperser for pindo palm regeneration. We analyzed the number and spatial pattern of pindo adults, offspring, and tapir dung piles within ten plots established in an area spanning tapir latrines inside Iguazu National Park and in a fragmented forest area outside the park where tapir is locally extinct. In both areas, we evaluated recruitment levels beneath 24 adult palms in circular plots centered on adult stems. We found lower pindo palm recruitment outside the park where offspring tended to be aggregated around adult palms. In contrast, in Iguazu National Park offspring were spatially associated with tapir dung-piles, in which most offspring were registered. Recruitment under adults was higher outside the park suggesting a lower rate of seed removal in disturbed areas. Our results show that tapir dispersal promotes higher recruitment levels of pindo offspring and shapes their spatial pattern, breaking the spatial association with adult (presumably maternal) palms. These results are useful for predicting the impact of local tapir extinction on this palm.
   Resumen La presion de caza, la fragmentacion y la deforestacion han causado una declinacion en la abundancia de animales con consecuencias desconocidas para las comunidades vegetales. Muchas plantas de semillas grandes dependen de vertebrados amenazados para su dispersion. En el Bosque Atlantico semi-deciduo, los tapires (Tapirus terrestris) son los principales dispersores de la palmera pindo (Syagrus romanzoffiana). Comparamos los patrones de reclutamiento del pindo entre areas protegidas y perturbadas (defaunadas) del Bosque Atlantico en Argentina y evaluamos las consecuencias de la falta de su principal dispersor. Analizamos el numero y patron espacial de palmeras adultas, renovales y heces de tapir en diez parcelas establecidas en un area con letrinas de tapir dentro del Parque Nacional Iguazu y en un area de bosque fragmentado fuera del parque donde el tapir esta localmente extinto. Tambien evaluamos niveles de reclutamiento debajo de 24 palmeras adultas en parcelas circulares centradas en sus troncos. Encontramos un menor reclutamiento de pindo fuera del Parque, donde los renovales se agregaban alrededor de los adultos. Dentro del parque, los renovales estaban espacialmente asociados a heces de tapir, donde se registraron la mayoria. El reclutamiento debajo de palmeras adultas fue mayor fuera del Parque sugiriendo una menor tasa de remocion de semillas en areas perturbadas. Nuestros resultados muestran que la dispersion por tapir promueve un mayor reclutamiento de renovales de pindo y moldea su patron espacial, rompiendo la asociacion espacial con los adultos. Estos resultados son utiles para predecir el impacto de la extincion local del tapir sobre esta palmera.

AB In closed-canopy tropical forest understory, light availability is a significant determinant of habitat diversity because canopy structure is highly variable in most tropical forests. Consequently, variation in canopy cover affects the composition and distribution of plant species via creating variable light environments. Nevertheless, little is known about how variation in canopy openness structures patterns of plant-animal interactions. Because of the great diversity and dominance of ants in tropical environments, we used ant-plant interactions as a focal network to evaluate how variation in canopy cover influences patterns of plant-insect interactions in the Brazilian Amazon rain forest. We observed that small increases in canopy openness are associated with increased diversity of ant-plant interactions in our study area, and this change is independent of plant or ant species richness. Additionally, we found smaller niche overlap for both ants and plants associated with greater canopy openness. We hypothesize that enhanced light availability increases the breadth of ant foraging sources because variation in light availability gives rise to plant resources of different quality and amounts. Moreover, greater light availability promotes vegetative growth in plants, creating ant foraging bridges' between plants. In sum, our results highlight the importance of environmental heterogeneity as a determinant of ant-plant interaction diversity in tropical environments.
   Resumo No interior do sub-bosque de densas florestas tropicais, a disponibilidade de luz e um fator que determina a diversidade de habitats, principalmente porque a estrutura do dossel e altamente variavel na maioria das florestas tropicais. Consequentemente, a variacAo na cobertura do dossel afeta a composicAo e distribuicAo das especies de plantas, criando ambientes com diferentes niveis de luz. No entanto, pouco e o conhecimento de como a variacAo na abertura do dossel estrutura os padroes de interacoes planta-animal. Devido a grande diversidade e dominancia de formigas nos ambientes tropicais, nos usamos como modelo de estudo as interacoes formiga-planta em uma floresta tropical na Amazonia brasileira. Nos observamos que pequenas mudancas na abertura do dossel esta associada com o aumento da diversidade das interacoes formiga-planta na nossa area de estudo, e essa mudanca e independente da riqueza de formigas ou de plantas. Adicionalmente, nos encontramos baixa sobreposicAo de nicho tanto para formigas quanto de plantas em ambientes com maior abertura do dossel. Nos hipotetizamos que a disponibilidade de luz aumenta a possibilidade de forrageamento das formigas, uma vez que, a variacAo na disponibilidade de luz fornece diferentes quantidades e qualidades de recurso disponivel nas plantas. Alem disso, a maior disponibilidade de luz promove o crescimento vegetativo das plantas, criando pontes entre as plantas para o forrageamento das formigas. Em resumo, nossos resultados destacam a importancia da heterogeneidade ambiental como um fator que determina a diversidade das interacoes formiga-planta em ambientes tropicais.

AB Complex networks of species interactions might be determined by species traits but also by simple chance meetings governed by species abundances. Although the idea that species traits structure mutualistic networks is appealing, most studies have found abundance to be a major structuring mechanism underlying interaction frequencies. With a well-resolved plant-hummingbird interaction network from the Neotropical savanna in Brazil, we asked whether species morphology, phenology, nectar availability and habitat occupancy and/or abundance best predicted the frequency of interactions. For this, we constructed interaction probability matrices and compared them to the observed plant-hummingbird matrix through a likelihood approach. Furthermore, a recently proposed modularity algorithm for weighted bipartite networks was employed to evaluate whether these factors also scale-up to the formation of modules in the network. Interaction frequencies were best predicted by species morphology, phenology and habitat occupancy, while species abundances and nectar availability performed poorly. The plant-hummingbird network was modular, and modules were associated to morphological specialization and habitat occupancy. Our findings highlight the importance of traits as determinants of interaction frequencies and network structure, corroborating the results of a previous study on a plant-hummingbird network from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, we propose that traits matter more in tropical plant-hummingbird networks than in less specialized systems. To test the generality of this hypothesis, future research could employ geographic or taxonomic cross-system comparisons contrasting networks with known differences in level of specialization.
   Resumo Redes complexas de interacoes entre especies podem ser determinadas pelos atributos das especies, mas tambem meramente pelos encontros aleatorios governados pelas suas abundancias. Embora a ideia de que os atributos das especies estruturam as redes mutualisticas seja atraente, a maioria dos estudos tem observado a abundancia como principal fator determinante da frequencia das interacoes. Nesse estudo, investigamos uma rede de interacAo entre plantas e beija-flores no Cerrado do Brasil, para compreender se morfologia, fenologia, disponibilidade de nectar, ocupacAo de habitat e/ou abundancia das especies sAo capazes de predizer a frequencia das interacoes na comunidade. Para isso, nos construimos matrizes de probabilidades de interacoes e as comparamos com a matriz de interacAo observada, utilizando analise de verossimilhanca e selecAo de modelos. Alem disso, um algoritmo recentemente proposto para calcular a modularidade em redes bipartidas quantitativas foi utilizado para avaliar se (e como) esses fatores contribuem para a formacAode modulosna rede. A frequencia de interacoes na rede foi melhor predita pela morfologia, fenologia e ocupacAo de habitat, enquanto a abundancia e disponibilidade de nectar tiveram pior desempenho. As interacoes entre plantas e beija-flores se organizaram em modulos, que foram associados com especializacAo morfologica e ocupacAo de habitat. Nossos resultados mostram a importancia dos atributos das especies na determinacAo da frequencia de interacoes e estrutura da rede, corroborando os resultados de um estudo previo com uma rede de plantas e beija-flor na Mata Atlantica. Assim, nos propomos que os atributos das especies tem papel estruturador mais importante em redes de interacoes entre plantas e beija-flores tropicais do que em sistemas menos especializados. Para testar a generalidade desta hipotese, sugerimos que estudos futuros empreguem comparacoesgeograficas ou taxonomicasentre diferentes sistemas, contrastando redes de interacoes com diferentes niveis de especializacAo.

AB Treefall gaps are the "engines of regeneration'' in tropical forests and are loci of high tree recruitment, growth, and carbon accumulation. Gaps, however, are also sites of intense competition between lianas and trees, whereby lianas can dramatically reduce tree carbon uptake and accumulation. Because lianas have relatively low biomass, they may displace far more biomass than they contribute, a hypothesis that has never been tested with the appropriate experiments. We tested this hypothesis with an 8-yr liana removal experiment in central Panama. After 8 years, mean tree biomass accumulation was 180% greater in lianafree treefall gaps compared to control gaps. Lianas themselves contributed only 24% of the tree biomass accumulation they displaced. Scaling to the forest level revealed that lianas in gaps reduced net forest woody biomass accumulation by 8.9% to nearly 18%. Consequently, lianas reduce whole-forest carbon uptake despite their relatively low biomass. This is the first study to demonstrate experimentally that plant-plant competition can result in ecosystemwide losses in forest carbon, and it has critical implications for recently observed increases in liana density and biomass on tropical forest carbon dynamics.

AB The importance of positive interactions between species within natural ecosystems and species associated with traditional agriculture is well recognized. However, modern agriculture generally depends on monocultures, where positive interactions between cultivated species (ie in which the presence of one species facilitates the survival, growth, or reproduction of other species) are largely ignored. Here, we review recent studies focused on the positive interactions between cultivated species, consider how three traditional agricultural systems (legume-cereal intercropping, rice-fish co-culture, and agroforestry) have benefited from such interactions, and examine how these benefits are affected by climate, planting patterns, and field management. Finally, we propose a framework to illustrate how these interactions may improve modern agriculture through: the selection of species-species partnerships; the development of specialized field machinery (in each case); field structure and configuration; field management; and farmer and societal acceptance.

AB AimImproving our understanding of the drivers of forest fragmentation is fundamental to mitigating the consequences of anthropogenic fragmentation for biodiversity. Moreover, the impacts of fragmentation on biodiversity depend on the spatial scale at which fragmentation occurs. Therefore, understanding how the effect of land use on fragmentation patterns varies across scales is critical to ensure that fragmentation is managed at scales relevant to the ecology of target species or to land management. Here, we quantified the influence of land use on patterns of forest fragmentation at different scales using Queensland, Australia, as a case study.
   LocationNorth-eastern Australia.
   MethodsWe combined fractal analysis with piecewise linear regression to measure patterns of forest fragmentation across a range of scales in 5309 landscapes of c. 50km(2), with different proportions of land used for cropping and grazing. A significant change in fragmentation patterns occurred at approximately 1km(2). We used beta regression to quantify the impact of land use on the degree of fragmentation at scales finer and coarser than 1km(2).
   ResultsThe use of land for grazing tended to create more fragmented forest patterns than use of land for cropping. This difference was more pronounced at coarser than finer scales.
   Main conclusionsOur finding suggests that the choice of land use where conservation actions, such as revegetation and retention of forest patches, are to be prioritized depends on the scale at which we measure fragmentation. This information contributes to reducing the risk of mismatches between the scale at which fragmentation is managed and the scale at which fragmentation is measured, which is often dictated by the scale of species movements or the scale of land management. Our finding also improves our capacity to discern between fragmentation patterns that are typical of land-sharing and land-sparing conservation strategies, as spatial scale varies, thus aiding the implementation of land sparing and land sharing at scales relevant to biodiversity conservation and land management.

AB Despite recent success in reducing forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-A-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible.

AB Leaf-cutting ants modify the properties of the soil adjacent to their nests. Here, we examined whether such an ant-altered environment impacts the belowground fungal communities. Fungal diversity and community structure of soil from the fungus garden chambers of Atta sexdens rubropilosa and Atta bisphaerica, two widespread leaf-cutting ants in Brazil, were determined and compared with non-nest soils. Culture-dependent methods revealed similar species richness but different community compositions between both types of soils. Penicillium janthinellum and Trichoderma spirale were the prevalent isolates in fungus chamber soils and non-nest soils, respectively. In contrast to cultivation methods, analyses of clone libraries based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region indicated that richness of operational taxonomic units significantly differed between soils of the fungus chamber and non-nest soils. FastUnifrac analyses based on ITS sequences further revealed a clear distinction in the community structure between both types of soils. Plectania milleri and an uncultured Clavariaceae fungus were prevalent in fungus chamber soils and non-nest soils, respectively. FastUnifrac analyses also revealed that fungal community structures of soil from the garden chambers markedly differed among ant species. Our findings suggest that leaf-cutting ants affect fungal communities in the soil from the fungus chamber in comparison to non-nest soils.

AB We investigated the effects of host tree on epiphyte diversity, controlling for microclimate. We measured the light profiles of the lower trunks of 20 individuals, each from three host groups (tree ferns, dicots, palms) occupying the understorey in a tropical montane forest in Panama. The per cent cover and species richness of vascular and non-vascular epiphytes were surveyed on the lower trunks of each understorey host. Light varied considerably between trees (5-21% total transmitted light) but mean light level did not vary between types of host. Light was not significant as a covariate with host in any model. Tree ferns had higher covers than dicots and palms of filmy ferns (15%, 0.02% and 0.2%), other ferns (7%, 0% and 0.5%) and other vascular epiphytes (16%, 3% and 3.4%), and greater species richness of vascular epiphytes (filmy ferns: 3, 0.4 and 0.5; other ferns: 2, 0.2 and 0; other vascular: 7, 2 and 2). Dicots had a higher cover of liverworts (53%) than palms (18%) and tree ferns (27%). Palms and tree ferns were the compositional extremes. We conclude that the differences in species composition and cover between the three host groups relate better to physical differences between hosts than differences in light climate.

AB QuestionRecent research in boreal forest suggests that an open matrix' model may be more appropriate than the traditional model of spatially discrete gap dynamics for describing forest disturbance and regeneration, but what is the evidence from temperate broad-leaved deciduous forests concerning the prevalence of these alternative models?
   LocationSemi-natural temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest in southern England.
   MethodsMulti-temporal LiDAR data were used to monitor the changes in tree canopy height and canopy gaps over a 10-yr period for a 130-ha area of forest. Gap dynamics were characterized by quantifying gap creation, expansion, contraction and closure. By identifying the types and rates of canopy height transitions, areas of gap contraction and closure were attributed to the processes of lateral crown growth or vertical regeneration.
   ResultsAcross the study site there was a zonation in canopy and gap properties and their dynamics. Many areas of the forest had the characteristics of open wood-pasture dominated by large, complex gaps being maintained under a regime of chronic disturbance. In these areas, several characteristics of the gap dynamics indicated that regeneration was restricted and this may be attributable to spatially-focused overgrazing by large herbivores. In contrast, other areas were characterized by high, closed canopy forest with small, discrete gaps where gap creation and infill were balanced.
   ConclusionsAt the landscape-scale broad-leaved deciduous forests contain a spatial mosaic of zones, which conform to different models of disturbance and regeneration dynamics; discrete gap dynamics and open matrix regimes are juxtaposed. It is now important to elucidate the abiotic factors and biotic interactions that determine the spatio-temporal distribution of the different regimes and to examine whether such a regime mosaic' model is applicable in other forest types.

AB AimTo test the niche breadth hypothesis (NBH), which states that dominant species have broader environmental tolerances than rare species, focusing on oligarchic species distributions (1) along the gradients of edaphic and climatic individual variables, and (2) within the n-dimensional environmental frame defined by all edaphic and climatic variability.
   LocationAmazonian and Andean tropical rain forests along a ca. 3000m elevation gradient, covering an area of 200x200km in northwestern Bolivia.
   MethodsAll woody plants with a DBH 2.5cm were measured in 98 0.1-ha plots. We analysed 18 chemical properties of the soils in each plot. Climatic and topographic variables were obtained from available open-access databases. Three measures were calculated for each of the species found at each forest type: (1) regional-scale dominance based on frequency and local abundance, (2) niche breadth along each of the environmental variables, and (3) total niche size within the whole environment.
   ResultsOligarchic species showed broader niche breadths than the other species that constituted the community assembly in both Amazonian and Andean rain forests. The niche breadth of any species tended to be positively correlated with its degree of dominance. The Amazonian forest showed a stronger oligarchic pattern than the Andean forest, and the Amazonian common species showed larger niches overall. However, this pattern differed for some particular variables: Amazonian oligarchies had narrower niches along the variables related to organic matter and most climatic variables, whereas Andean oligarchies had narrower niches along several micronutrient factors and temperature variables.
   ConclusionsThe results provide strong empirical support for the NBH in tropical rain forests. However, different patterns of dominance were found in the two habitats: oligarchic species ranged from narrow-niched species to very broad generalist species. Broad-niched oligarchic species have also been reported in other regions, suggesting an important role of niche size linking commonness at different scales. Oligarchic species exhibit relatively narrow niches with respect to soil factors if measured along wide gradients, regardless of the forest type studied. In contrast, the opposite pattern was found for many climatic variables, indicating higher sensitivity to climate in Amazonia compared to the Andes. Despite these differences, Amazonia has much larger total niche sizes for its common species than the Andes overall.

AB Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation now constitutes an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is all the more important to identify cases in which economic growth has not sparked excessive forest clearance. We address the recent reduction of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon by conducting a statistical analysis to ascertain if different levels of environmental enforcement between two groups of municipalities had any impact on this reduction. Our analysis shows that these targeted, heightened enforcement efforts avoided as much as 10,653 km(2) of deforestation, which translates into 1.44 x 10(-1) PgC in avoided emissions for the 3 y period. Moreover, most of the carbon loss and land conversion would have occurred at the expense of closed moist forests. Although such results are encouraging, we caution that significant challenges remain for Brazil's continued success in this regard, given recent changes in the forestry code, ongoing massive investments in hydro power generation, reductions of established protected areas, and growing demand for agricultural products.

AB The deforestation of eastern Paraguay is a relatively recent phenomenon, starting as early as the 1940s. Assuming that larger forest fragments retain mechanisms and patterns of biodiversity resembling the original forests, understanding these patterns is valuable for comparative, management, and conservation purposes. In this study, I document diversity patterns in four of the largest reserves of subtropical rainforest in eastern Paraguay as part of a 3-year field study. Forty grids, totaling 31,600 trap nights per reserve, resulted in 19 captured species. Spearman correlations were used to understand effects of distance to edge, and various diversity metrics and multivariate analyses were implemented to compare assemblages between remnants. Trapping revealed an increase in biodiversity toward forest edges. Medium-sized remnants showed the highest diversity (D) and evenness (J). Statistically significant differences were found between and among forest fragments. Given that biodiversity includes both richness and abundances, high biodiversity metrics are not the best indicator for ecosystem "health," as population explosions closer to edges result in greater biodiversity. More edge, more biodiversity. Thus, more emphasis needs to be given to understanding the natural history of native fauna and common assemblage patterns when addressing conservation and management strategies.

AB 1. Species are seldom distributed at random across a community, but instead show spatial structure that is determined by environmental gradients and/or biotic interactions. Analysis of the spatial co-associations of species may therefore reveal information on the processes that helped to shape those patterns. We propose a multivariate approach that uses the spatial co-associations between all pairs of species to find subcommunities of species whose distribution in the study area is positively correlated. Our method, which begins with the patterns of individuals, is particularly well-suited for communities with large numbers of species and gives rare species an equal weight. We propose a method to quantify a maximum number of subcommunities that are significantly more correlated than expected under a null model of species independence. Using data on the distribution of tree and shrub species from a 50ha forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, we show that our method can be used to construct biologically meaningful subcommunities that are linked to the spatial structure of the plant community. As an example, we construct spatial maps from the subcommunities that closely follow habitats based on environmental gradients (such as slope) as well as different biotic conditions (such as canopy gaps). We discuss extensions and adaptations to our method that might be appropriate for other types of spatially referenced data and for other ecological communities. We make suggestions for other ways to interpret the subcommunities using phylogenetic relationships, biological traits and environmental variables as covariates and note that subcommunities that are hard to interpret may suggest groups of species and/or regions of the landscape that merit further attention.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest hosts one of the world's most diverse and threatened tropical forest biota. In many ways, its history of degradation describes the fate experienced by tropical forests around the world. After five centuries of human expansion, most Atlantic Forest landscapes are archipelagos of small forest fragments surrounded by open-habitat matrices. This natural laboratory' has contributed to a better understanding of the evolutionary history and ecology of tropical forests and to determining the extent to which this irreplaceable biota is susceptible to major human disturbances. We share some of the major findings with respect to the responses of tropical forests to human disturbances across multiple biological levels and spatial scales and discuss some of the conservation initiatives adopted in the past decade. First, we provide a short description of the Atlantic Forest biota and its historical degradation. Secondly, we offer conceptual models describing major shifts experienced by tree assemblages at local scales and discuss landscape ecological processes that can help to maintain this biota at larger scales. We also examine potential plant responses to climate change. Finally, we propose a research agenda to improve the conservation value of human-modified landscapes and safeguard the biological heritage of tropical forests.

AB In tropical and temperate trees, wood chemical traits are hypothesized to covary with species' life-history strategy along a wood economics spectrum' (WES), but evidence supporting these expected patterns remains scarce. Due to its role in nutrient storage, we hypothesize that wood nitrogen (N) concentration will covary along the WES, being higher in slow-growing species with high wood density (WD), and lower in fast-growing species with low WD. In order to test this hypothesis we quantified wood N concentrations in 59 Panamanian hardwood species, and used this dataset to examine ecological correlates and phylogenetic patterns of wood N. Wood N varied >14-fold among species between 0.04 and 0.59%; closely related species were more similar in wood N than expected by chance. Wood N was positively correlated with WD, and negatively correlated with log-transformed relative growth rates, although these relationships were relatively weak. We found evidence for co-evolution between wood N and both WD and log-transformed mortality rates. Our study provides evidence that wood N covaries with tree life-history parameters, and that these patterns consistently co-evolve in tropical hardwoods. These results provide some support for the hypothesized WES, and suggest that wood is an increasingly important N pool through tropical forest succession.

AB Predicting the future distribution of plants requires a mechanistic understanding of how plants cope with their new environmental conditions under a changed climate. We examined the effects of elevated carbon concentration ([CO2]) and elevated T-soil on the physiological responses to light of a shade-tolerant woody species, mountain maple (Acer spicatum L.). Seedlings were exposed to ambient and elevated [CO2] (392 mu mol mol(-1) vs. 784 mu mol mol(-1)), current and elevated soil temperatures (T-soil 17 vs. 22 degrees C) at high and low (100% vs. 30%) light conditions for one growing season. It was found that elevated T-soil stimulated net photosynthesis (A) by 18% in the low-light treatment but tended to reduce A in the high-light treatment. Elevated [CO2] increased A by 100% under the elevated T-soil and by 48% at the current T-soil. The effect of elevated T-soil also varied with [CO2]: it increased A by 13% under the elevated [CO2] but reduced A by 17% under the ambient [CO2]. We observed a significant increase in the instantaneous water-use efficiency of photosynthesis (IWUE) in response to the high-light treatment under the elevated [CO2] but not under the ambient [CO2]. Our data indicate that the elevated [CO2] markedly increased nitrogen (N) allocation to the photochemical apparatus of A in seedlings grown under the high-light condition. These results suggest that the predicted increases in atmospheric [CO2] will likely, enhance the growth of mountain maple in canopy gaps in the forest, while the predicted elevated T-soil will negate the benefit of high-light conditions.

ID ATLANTIC FOREST; BIRD DIETS; COMPETITION
AB The Fuscous Flycatcher (Cnemotriccus fuscatus) is a medium-sized Tyrannidae widespread in South America. Despite its large distribution, there have been very few studies on its diet, especially in different habitats. This study presents data on diet variation in three habitats in the Pantanal wetlands in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The specimens were captured through a mist-netting programme between February 2000 and May 2010, in the Retiro Novo Farm, in the Pocone municipality. Birds were captured in three vegetation types: Landizal, Cambarazal and Cordilheira. Tartar emetic was used to obtain the regurgitation samples identified at order level. We captured 61 individuals ( 21, 26 and 14 in the above described habitats, respectively). Diet of C. fuscatus differed between the three habitats. Ants and beetles were the most relevant prey items either in numerical frequency (NF) or in frequency of occurrence ( OF), in terms of the overall diet (NF = 27.34% and 37.89%; OF = 36.06% and 75.4%, respectively). However, in Cordilheira, seeds and beetles dominated the NF (21.8% and 38.1%, respectively) and OF (28.5% and 85.7%, respectively). Cnemotriccus fuscatus was found to have an omnivorous diet, although in Cambarazal, individuals preyed exclusively on arthropods. The present study provides an important contribution to the knowledge of the diet of a poorly studied Neotropical bird.

AB The understanding of the spatial structure and dynamics of populations can guide conservation decisions, but studies of this type focused on small (< 7-kg) carnivores are rare. We compared survival, reproduction, and dispersal of radiocollared Geoffroy's cats (Leopardus geoffroyi) in a protected area and adjacent cattle ranches in Argentina to assess the effects of livestock management and its associated disturbances (i.e., hunting by humans) on the demography of this fend. Thirteen cats in the park and 13 in the ranches were radiotracked for up to 556 days in 2007-2008. We evaluated the Geoffloy's cat population trajectory at the landscape level using a stage-structured, stochastic matrix model based on our estimated vital rates. The study occurred during a prolonged drought, likely affecting estimated vital rates. Survival in the ranches was 52% lower than in the park; mortalities were due to intraguild predation in the park and were human-related in the ranches. Dispersal from the ranches was 32% lower than from the park and dispersal distances were up to 128 km. The number of cubs per litter was similar between areas. Assuming persistence of drought conditions and estimated vital rates, the simulated metapopulation rapidly collapsed and cat survival on ranches was the vital rate to which the model was most sensitive. Because projected climatic scenarios predict increased drought frequency for the region, we explored management options that would enhance chances of persistence, simulating 2 "adaptation" strategies: hunting restrictions on ranches and expanding protected areas. More than doubling of cat survival on ranches or a 9-fold increase in protected area extension would be required, involving major investments, to avoid the extinction of this cat metapopulation if droughts become prevalent. Our analysis may be helpful to improve our predictive capacity to identify new threats and facilitate adaptation strategies for Geoffroy's cat or other similar carnivores.

AB Understanding the ecological mechanisms driving beta diversity is a major goal of community ecology. Metacommunity theory brings new ways of thinking about the structure of local communities, including processes occurring at different spatial scales. In addition to new theories, new methods have been developed which allow the partitioning of individual and shared contributions of environmental and spatial effects, as well as identification of species and sites that have importance in the generation of beta diversity along ecological gradients. We analyzed the spatial distribution of dung beetle communities in areas of Atlantic Forest in a mainland-island scenario in southern Brazil, with the objective of identifying the mechanisms driving composition, abundance and biomass at three spatial scales (mainland-island, areas and sites). We sampled 20 sites across four large areas, two on the mainland and two on the island. The distribution of our sampling sites was hierarchical and areas are isolated. We used standardized protocols to assess environmental heterogeneity and sample dung beetles. We used spatial eigenfunctions analysis to generate the spatial patterns of sampling points. Environmental heterogeneity showed strong variation among sites and a mild increase with increasing spatial scale. The analysis of diversity partitioning showed an increase in beta diversity with increasing spatial scale. Variation partitioning based on environmental and spatial variables suggests that environmental heterogeneity is the most important driver of beta diversity at the local scale. The spatial effects were significant only at larger spatial scales. Our study presents a case where environmental heterogeneity seems to be the main factor structuring communities at smaller scales, while spatial effects are more important at larger scales. The increase in beta diversity that occurs at larger scales seems to be the result of limitation in species dispersal ability due to habitat fragmentation and the presence of geographical barriers.

TI Patch Size and Isolation Predict Plant Species Density in a Naturally

AB Studies of the effects of patch size and isolation on plant species density have yielded contrasting results. However, much of the available evidence comes from relatively recent anthropogenic forest fragments which have not reached equilibrium between extinction and immigration. This is a critical issue because the theory clearly states that only when equilibrium has been reached can the number of species be accurately predicted by habitat size and isolation. Therefore, species density could be better predicted by patch size and isolation in an ecosystem that has been fragmented for a very long time. We tested whether patch area, isolation and other spatial variables explain variation among forest patches in plant species density in an ecosystem where the forest has been naturally fragmented for long periods of time on a geological scale. Our main predictions were that plant species density will be positively correlated with patch size, and negatively correlated with isolation (distance to the nearest patch, connectivity, and distance to the continuous forest). We surveyed the vascular flora (except lianas and epiphytes) of 19 forest patches using five belt transects (50x4 m each) per patch (area sampled per patch = 0.1 ha). As predicted, plant species density was positively associated (logarithmically) with patch size and negatively associated (linearly) with patch isolation (distance to the nearest patch). Other spatial variables such as patch elevation and perimeter, did not explain among-patch variability in plant species density. The power of patch area and isolation as predictors of plant species density was moderate (together they explain 43% of the variation), however, a larger sample size may improve the explanatory power of these variables. Patch size and isolation may be suitable predictors of long-term plant species density in terrestrial ecosystems that are naturally and anthropogenically fragmented.

AB The potential positive effects of herbivores on plants have been the subject of debates for decades. While traditionally, herbivory was considered to have a negative impact on plants, some studies also reported possible mutualism between plants and herbivores. Plant defences, and in particular tolerance and resistance, seem to play an important role in shaping plant-herbivore interactions. The aim of this study is to show how a direct plant compensation mechanism translates into apparent compensation, i.e. the long-term biomass response to herbivory, in simple plant-herbivore models. A special emphasis is then put on how it interacts with resistance mechanisms. A qualitative study of the proposed models shows that they can exhibit different plant-herbivore patterns, including neutral, antagonistic (negative apparent compensation) and mutualistic (positive apparent compensation) interactions. Moreover, it is shown that density dependence plays a crucial role since, for a given system, the realized plant-herbivore pattern critically depends on the initial plant and herbivore levels. Our study shows the importance of direct compensation for the presence of plant-herbivore mutualism, a finding which we show, has significant implications both in ecosystems ecology and in agricultural pest management.

TI Rocky Intertidal Zonation Pattern in Antofagasta, Chile: Invasive
   Species and Shellfish Gathering
SO PLOS ONE

   CONVERGENCE; RECRUITMENT; STOLONIFERA
AB Background: Biological invasions affecting rocky intertidal zonation patterns, yield information on species interactions. In the Bay of Antofagasta, northern Chile, the non-indigenous tunicate Pyura praeputialis, originally from Australia, has invaded (in the past century or so) and monopolized a major portion of the mid-intertidal rocky shore, displacing upshore the native mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. In Antofagasta the tunicate is subjected to intensive exploitation. Monitoring protocols show that in the past 10 years Antofagasta's tunicate population has experienced a drastic decline, affecting the intertidal zonation pattern.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A 12.5 km of coastline, on the southern eastern shore of the Bay of Antofagasta, was studied. Eight sites were systematically (1993-1994) or sporadically (2003-2014) monitored for the seaward-shoreward expansion or reduction of the tunicate Pyura praeputialis, and native mussel and barnacle bands. A notable reduction in the mid-intertidal band of P. praeputialis and a seaward expansion of the mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, and barnacle bands was observed. We suggest that the major cause for the decline in the tunicate is due to its intensive exploitation by rocky shore Pyura-gathers. The rate of extraction of tunicates by professional Pyura-gathers ranged between 256-740 tunicates hour(-1). Between 2009-2014 the density of professional Pyura-gather ranged between 0.5-4.5 km(-1) per low tide. Hence, 10 professional Pyura-gathers working 1 h for 10 low tides per month, during 6 months, will remove between 307-888 m(2) of tunicates. A drastic decline in tunicate recruitment was observed and several P. praeputialis ecosystems services have been lost.
   Conclusion and Significance: In Antofagasta, the continuous and intensive intertidal gathering of the invasive tunicate Pyura praeputialis, has caused a drastic reduction of its population modifying the zonation pattern. Thereby, native mussel Perumytilus purpuratus has regained its ecological center in the intertidal zone. We recorded a Pyura recruitment failure and loss of ecosystem services.

AB Phosphorus (P) is essential for plant growth and productivity. It is one of the most limiting macronutrients in soil because it is mainly present as unavailable, bound P whereas plants can only use unbound, inorganic phosphate (Pi), which is found in very low concentrations in soil solution. Some ectomycorrhizal fungi are able to release organic compounds (organic anions or phosphatases) to mobilize unavailable P. Recent studies suggest that bacteria play a major role in the mineralization of nutrients such as P through trophic relationships as they can produce specific phosphatases such as phytases to degrade phytate, the main form of soil organic P. Bacteria are also more effective than other microorganisms or plants at immobilizing free Pi. Therefore, bacterial grazing by grazers, such as nematodes, could release Pi locked in bacterial biomass. Free Pi may be taken up by ectomycorrhizal fungus by specific phosphate transporters and transferred to the plant by mechanisms that have not yet been identified. This mini-review aims to follow the phosphate pathway to understand the ecological and molecular mechanisms responsible for transfer of phosphate from the soil to the plant, to improve plant P nutrition.

AB Knowledge of tree age-size relationships is essential towards evaluating the sustainability of harvest regulations that include minimum diameter cutting limits and fixed-length cutting cycles. Although many tropical trees form annual growth rings and can be aged from discs or cores, destructive sampling is not always an option for valuable or threatened species. We used an individual-based population model developed for big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla, Meliaceae) in southeast Amazonia, Brazil to simulate stem age-size relationships and examine forest management implications of mortality and diameter increment growth. Growth trajectories of 10,000 simulated mahogany trees were consistent with growth trajectories reconstructed from 32 mahogany discs with annual rings. Trajectories were highly variable and strongly autocorrelated; diameter was a poor predictor of tree age even when accounting for up to 10 years of previous growth history. Commercial-sized trees (60 cm diameter) ranged in age from 33 to 180 years (74 yr median). Only 12.5% of seedlings survived to this size, but survival and time to reach commercial size depended strongly on early growth history (first 10 years of life). A tree grown at the 75th percentile growth rate throughout its lifetime requires 70 years to attain commercial size, but Brazilian forest management regulations imply a rotation length of 60 years. These results demonstrate that individual-based models parameterized with typical census data can incorporate individual variation and growth autocorrelation and realistically simulate tree growth and mortality. In the absence of tree ring data, such models can be used to evaluate the consequences of long-term growth and mortality for sustainable management. In the case of mahogany, our results suggest that non-detrimental harvests cannot be achieved without lengthening cutting cycles, increasing commercial tree retention rates, and regularly applying silvicultural treatments designed to increase stem diameter growth rates. Forest managers can have the greatest effect on the rate of commercial recruitment in the first 10 years after a harvest by implementing treatments ensuring that adequate numbers of new stems establish and recruit to dominant positions in recovering canopy gaps. Regrettably, sustainable mahogany management systems developed based on understanding of the species' ecology will not be as simple as current harvest regulations in Brazil imply.

AB Recent mountain pine beetle infestation in the Rocky Mountains of North America has killed an unprecedented acreage of pine forest, creating an opportunity to observe an active re-equilibration in response to widespread land cover perturbation. This work investigates metal mobility in beetle-impacted forests using parallel rainwater and acid leaches to estimate solid-liquid partitioning coefficients and a complete sequential extraction procedure to determine how metals are fractionated in soils under trees experiencing different phases of mortality. Geochemical model simulations analyzed in consideration with experimental data provide additional insight into the mechanisms controlling metal complexation. Metal and base-cation mobility consistently increased in soils under beetle-attacked trees relative to soil under healthy trees. Mobility increases were more pronounced on south facing slopes and more strongly correlated to pH under attacked trees than under healthy trees. Similarly, soil moisture was significantly higher under dead trees, related to the loss of transpiration and interception. Zinc and cadmium content increased in soils under dead trees relative to living trees. Cadmium increases occurred predominantly in the exchangeable fraction, indicating increased mobilization potential. Relative increases of zinc were greatest in the organic fraction, the only fraction where increases in copper were observed. Model results reveal that increased organic complexation, not changes in pH or base cation concentrations, can explain the observed differences in metal partitioning for zinc, nickel, cadmium, and copper. Predicted concentrations would be unlikely to impair human health or plant growth at these sites; however, higher exchangeable metals under beetle-killed trees relative to healthy trees suggest a possible decline in riverine ecosystem health and water quality in areas already approaching criteria limits and drinking water standards. Impairment of water quality in important headwater streams from the increased potential for metal mobilization and storage will continue to change as beetle-killed trees decompose and forests begin to recover.

AB Understanding how tropical trees coordinate fast growth with water consumption and carbon investment is of high relevance because climate warming may expose tropical forests to increasing stress. Thus, foresters require more information of native tree species envisaged for reforestation. This study examines the relationship between productivity and possibly growth-determining functional traits of xylem anatomy, hydraulic conductivity, foliar morphology and nutrient status in eight tree species in semi-dry Costa Rica; we further assessed the indicative value of wood density for growth rate and hydraulic efficiency. We tested the hypotheses that (i) wood density is related to both growth rate and hydraulic efficiency contrary to findings from moist tropical forests, and (ii) productivity is closely related to branch xylem properties as well as empirically determined hydraulic conductivity in these drought-adapted species. Growth rate was positively related to tree size, foliar nitrogen content, vessel diameter, specific conductivity and leaf water potential, and negatively to vessel density, wood density and delta C-13, indicating that fast-growing tree species with light wood possessed a more efficient hydraulic system but closed their stomata relatively early to prevent xylem dysfunction. We conclude, that in tropical semi-dry climates, productivity is closely associated not only with foliar nitrogen but also with wood anatomical and hydraulic properties. Wood density proved to be a reliable indicator for growth-related, wood anatomical and hydraulic traits in these drought-adapted species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Strong differences have been observed between the assemblages on artificial reefs and on natural hard-bottom habitats worldwide, but little is known about the mechanisms that cause contrasting biodiversity patterns. We examined the influence of spatial attributes in relation to both biogenic and topographic microhabitats, in the distribution and composition of intertidal species on both artificial and natural reefs. We found higher small-scale spatial heterogeneity on the natural reef compared with the study breakwater. Species richness and diversity were associated with a higher availability of crevices, rock pools and mussels in natural habitats. Spatial distribution of certain grazers corresponded well with the spatial structure of microhabitats. In contrast, the lack of microhabitats on the breakwater resulted in the absence of several grazers reflected in lower species richness. Biogenic and topographic microhabitats can have interactive effects providing niche opportunities for multiple species, explaining differences in species diversity between artificial versus natural reefs.

AB Rodent outbreaks have been recorded in the north-eastern hill region of India since time immemorial. This study was carried out in Arunachal Pradesh where rodent outbreaks are associated with Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, Dendrocalamus strictus, Bambusa tulda, Bambusa balcoa and Schizostachyum arunachalensis. Four species of rodents are reported in the flowering area of which Rattus rattus is predominant and causes greatest damage to many crops. The greatest damage recorded in rice ranged from 12.9% to 15.4% in the bamboo flowering year, whereas it was 5.3% to 5.8% in the non-flowering year. Higher levels of damage were also observed in maize, pineapple, cabbage, French bean, potato, tomato and tapioca in bamboo flowering affected area than in other areas. Live burrows count, trap index and percent damage revealed that in bamboo flowering areas, the rodent population was significantly increased. The comparison of nutrient content of bamboo seeds and other food materials suggested that higher carbohydrate content of the bamboo seeds triggered the active behaviour of rodents. Damage was caused only to those crops which are a very good source of carbohydrate. The cumulative effects of rainfall, flowering season, hunting of predatory animals or birds and geographical barriers might be responsible for the outbreak of rodents. The study also explains why every flowering season does not result in a rodent outbreak of the same severity.

AB A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), Dentiscutata heterogama and Rhizophagus manihotis on the growth and nutrition of Juglans venezuelensis Manning. This species is currently considered a threatened tree species and the successful restoration of its populations depends on an increased understanding of the ecological and physiological aspects of its response to inoculation with AMF. In general, shoot and total dry weight, and leaf area were significantly higher in seedlings inoculated with AMF than in non-inoculated ones. Differences in height and leaf number between the inoculated and non-inoculated treatments become apparent after 30 days of plant growth. Inoculated plants had a greater leaf area as the result of the higher allocation of resources to leaf biomass (leaf mass ratio, LMR). The fraction allocated to the roots (RMR) was not significantly different between treatments. Differences between vital stain (SDH) and non-vital trypan blue stain (TB) showed that the D. heterogama colonization was almost entirely active compared to the R. manihotis colonization. The relative responsiveness (RR) of J. venezuelensis to inoculation with D. heterogama and R. manihotis was 21.8 and 25.4 % respectively, but colonization values were never greater than 45 %, despite low P content in the soils used. The growth and physiological responses of J. venezuelensis to inoculation with two AMF species indicate that these microorganisms should be employed when propagating this threatened species for its subsequence reintroduction into its natural habitat.

AB Intraspecific trait variation is hypothesized to influence the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. However, few studies have explicitly considered how intraspecific trait variation among ontogenetic stages influences community assembly across environmental gradients. Because the relative importance of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms can differ among ontogenetic stages within and across environments, ontogenetic trait variation may have an important influence on patterns of functional diversity and inferred assembly mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that variation in functional diversity across a topo-edaphic gradient differs among ontogenetic stages and that these patterns reflect a shift in the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms. In a temperate forest in the Missouri Ozarks, USA, we compared functional diversity of leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) of 34 woody plant species at two ontogenetic stages (adults and saplings) to test predictions about how the relative importance of abiotic and biotic filtering changes among adult and sapling communities. Local communities of adults had lower mean SLA and lower functional dispersion of SLA than expected by chance, particularly at the resource-limited end of the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for abiotic filtering among co-occurring adults. In contrast, local communities of saplings often had higher functional dispersion of leaf size and SLA than expected by chance regardless of their location along the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for biotic filtering among co-occurring saplings. Moreover, the overall strength of trait-environment relationships varied between saplings and adults for both leaf traits, generally resulting in stronger environmental shifts in mean trait values and trait dispersion for adults relative to saplings. Our results illustrate how community assembly mechanisms may shift in their relative importance during ontogeny, leading to variable patterns of functional diversity across environmental gradients. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of integrating ontogeny, an important axis of intraspecific trait variability, into approaches that use plant functional traits to understand community assembly and species coexistence.

AB This study investigated the seasonal cambial activity in Dipterocrpus costulatus trees with different range of stem diameter at breast height (dbh). Samples from main stem of D. costulatus with dbh < 15 cm and > 25 cm growing in natural lowland dipterocarp rainforest of west Peninsular Malaysia were collected for this purpose. Collections of cambial samples were carried out in 2-month intervals from August 2010 till June 2011. Cambial activity was determined by counting the numbers of cambial and expansion zone cell layers towards the outer sapwood. A greater number of cell layers indicated greater cambial activity. Results showed that the cambium of trees with dbh < 15 cm were influenced by the amount of rainfall. However, cambium of trees with dbh > 25 cm showed relatively less sensitivity to rainfall. Dipterocrpus costulatus showed active and inactive phases during the observation period. Thus, this study has proven that this species did not grow continually at the same rate in natural forests. Instead it showed periods of alternate active and inactive growth.

AB Forestry as a large industry has significant impacts on the quality of forest landscapes in boreal forests. In Finland, the rapid growth of nature-based tourism has expanded tourism and outdoor recreation activities from protected areas into commercial forests, especially in northern Finland. This has created demands to modify current forest management regimes, in particular regeneration practices. As the landscape and recreational benefits of forests mainly represent direct and indirect use values, there may be a case for a direct contractual mechanism of payments between the users (e.g. tourism entrepreneurs) and providers (forest owners). This paper presents the key results of a choice experiment study analyzing domestic and foreign tourists' demand for and willingness to pay for enhanced forest amenities, in particular landscape values and biodiversity, in private forests in the Ruka-Kuusamo tourism area in northeastern Finland. The results support the idea that tourists are willing to pay for selected improvements in the quality of outdoor recreation environments through adjustments in forest management in the case study area. Both foreign and domestic tourists were willing to pay for improvements in forest landscape, in terms of less frequent clear-cutting and site preparation areas along the routes, as well as for increased biodiversity. Foreign tourists' willingness to pay was significantly higher than domestic tourists'. Neither group would pay for extended outdoor recreation routes or increased carbon sequestration, even though reductions in these services would mean a welfare loss. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The change in the tropical forests could be clearly linked to the expansion of the human population and economies. An understanding of the anthropogenic forcing plays an important role in analyzing the impacts of climate change and the fate of tropical forests in the present and future scenario. In the present study, we analyze the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors in forest dynamics in Katerniaghat wildlife sanctuary situated along. the Indo-Nepal border in Uttar Pradesh state, India. The study site is under tremendous pressure due to anthropogenic factors from surrounding areas since last three decades. The vegetation cover of the sanctuary primarily comprised of Shorea robusta forests, Tectona grandis plantation, and mixed deciduous forest; while the land cover comprised of agriculture, barren land, and water bodies. The classification accuracy was 83.5%, 91.5%, and 95.2% with MSS, IKONOS, and Quickbird datasets, respectively. Shorea robusta forests showed an increase of 16 km(2); while Tectona grandis increased by 63.01 km(2) during 1975-2010. The spatial heterogeneity in these tropical vegetation classes surrounded by the human dominated agricultural lands could not be addressed using Landsat MSS data due to coarse spatial resolution; whereas the IKONOS and Quickbird satellite datasets proved to advantageous, thus being able to precisely address the variations within the vegetation classes as well as in the land cover classes and along the edge areas. Massive deforestation during 1970s along the adjoining international boundary with Nepal has led to destruction of the wildlife corridor and has exposed the wildlife sanctuary to interference like grazing and poaching. Higher rates of forest dynamics during the 25-year period indicate the vulnerability of the ecosystem to the natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the proximity of the sanctuary.

AB For niche differences to maintain coexistence of sympatric species, each species must grow and/or survive better than each of the others in at least one set of conditions (i.e., performance trade-offs). However, the extent of niche differentiation in tropical forests remains highly debated. We present the first test of performance trade-offs for wild seedlings in a tropical forest. We measured seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and survival of four common native woody species across 18 light, substrate, and topography microhabitats over 2.5 years within Hawaiian montane wet forest, an ideal location due to its low species diversity and strong species habitat associations. All six species pairs exhibited significant performance trade-offs across microhabitats and for RGR versus survival within microhabitats. We also found some evidence of performance equivalence, with species pairs having similar performance in 26% of comparisons across microhabitats. Across species, survival under low light was generally positively associated with RGR under high light. When averaged over all species, topography (slope, aspect, and elevation) explained most of the variation in RGR attributable to microhabitat variables (51-53%) followed by substrate type (35-37%) and light (11-12%). However, the relative effects of microhabitat differed among species and RGR metric (i.e., RGR for height, biomass, or leaf area). These findings indicate that performance trade-offs among species during regeneration are common in low-diversity tropical forest, although other mechanisms may better explain the coexistence of species with small performance differences.

AB 1. Conversion of natural and agricultural areas to conifer plantations is an important element of global change. Despite their widespread distribution and global importance, it is still unclear whether conifer plantations hinder or enhance movement by biota.
   2. Population connectivity is difficult to quantify without detailed studies such as those using capture-mark-recapture methods. A novel solution is to quantify the synchrony in abundance between populations over time. Using this approach, more connected populations are expected to display synchrony, whereas disconnected populations are expected to fluctuate asynchronously. Here, we compared the relative effects of spatial proximity and matrix type on the population synchrony of a suite of forest-dependent birds in a long-term, fully controlled, and replicated landscape-scale experiment in south-eastern Australia.
   3. Our experiment consisted of comparing bird populations inhabiting remnant eucalypt patches surrounded by Radiata pine Pinus radiata plantations (50 patches) with bird populations inhabiting remnant eucalypt patches where the surrounding landscapes are grazing fields (55 patches). Our data set encompassed 10 years and included 52 bird species characterized by different life history traits. After controlling for the effects of rainfall and patch characteristics on population dynamics, we found that spatial proximity, not matrix type, was the main driver of population synchrony for 16 species. The effect of the pine plantation matrix was negative (it reduced synchrony). However, the magnitude of its effect was particularly low (being significant only in four species).
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that pine plantations do not increase connectivity. In fact, they have little effect, with the exception of a few species, for which they may constitute a barrier. The implications of our findings for landscape management are that the conversion of agricultural areas to plantation forestry does not promote substantial movement of individuals (to the extent that would synchronize populations). Therefore, plantation expansion should not be promoted on the belief that it increases connectivity relative to an agricultural matrix.

AB 1. According to the pyrodiversity paradigm, a wide range of fire regimes is required to maintain biodiversity in fire-prone landscapes. However, the requisite level of pyrodiversity has seldom been tested and may actually be very low.
   2. Here, we examine the sensitivity of tropical savanna ants to variation in fire regimes using results from a long-term fire experiment near Darwin, Australia. Six experimental fire regimes, with varying fire frequency and seasonality, have been applied to 18 one-ha plots in three replicated blocks since 2004, with ants sampled prior to experimental burning and then annually after up to 2009. Our primary focus is on the extent to which different patterns of ant richness and composition are associated with each of the six treatment regimes, or whether there is such high overlap that differences only become apparent when experimental treatments are grouped to provide strongly contrasting fire regimes.
   3. When treating each of the six fire treatments separately, we were unable to detect a significant influence of fire on any ant community response variable. We were only able to detect significant ant responses when we grouped the experimental treatments into two contrasting fire frequency classes, low (burnt at most once over the 5 years) vs. high (burnt every 1 or 2 years). Even then, these responses were only evident after 3 years of fire treatment.
   4. Our findings demonstrate that ant communities have very high resilience in relation to fire, with differences evident only between strongly contrasting regimes. Such resilience appears to be characteristic of savanna ants throughout the world.
   5. Synthesis and applications. A large range of finely tuned fire regimes is unlikely to promote regional ant diversity. Rather, only very limited pyrodiversity (a combination of frequently and infrequently burnt areas) would appear to be sufficient for maintaining diversity at a landscape scale. It is important that fire management for biodiversity conservation focuses on the demonstrated requirements of target species, rather than be based on an assumption that 'pyrodiversity begets biodiversity'.

AB Aims
   Environmental heterogeneity is a primary mechanism explaining species coexistence and extant patterns of diversity. Despite strong theoretical support and ample observational evidence, few experimental studies in plant communities have been able to demonstrate a causal link between environmental heterogeneity and plant diversity. This lack of experimental evidence suggests that either fine-scale heterogeneity has weak effects on plant diversity or previous experiments have been unable to effectively manipulate heterogeneity. Here, we utilize a unique soil manipulation to test whether fine-scale soil heterogeneity will increase plant richness through species sorting among experimental patch types.
   Methods
   This experiment was conducted in the tallgrass prairie region of south-central Kansas, USA. We utilized the inherent variation found in the vertical soil profile, which varied in both biotic and abiotic characteristics, and redistributed these strata into either homogeneous or heterogeneous spatial arrangements in 2.4 x 2.4 m plots. After the soil manipulation, 34 native prairie species were sown into all plots. We conducted annual censuses at peak biomass to quantify species composition and plant density by species within the experimental communities.
   Important Findings
   After 2 years, species richness was significantly higher in heterogeneous relative to homogeneous plots and this pattern was independent of total plant density. In the heterogeneous plots, 13 species had higher establishment in a specific patch type representing one of the three soil strata. Conversely, no species had greater establishment in the mixed stratum, which comprised the homogeneous plots, relative to the heterogeneous strata. These species sorting patterns suggest that fine-scale heterogeneity creates opportunities for plant establishment due to niche differences, which translates into increased plant diversity at the plot scale. Species richness was more strongly related to plant density among patches comprising homogenous plots-where fine-scale heterogeneity was minimized, but weak in heterogeneous plots. This pattern is consistent with the idea that richness-density relationships dominate when neutral processes are important but are weak when niche processes operate. Unlike many previous attempts, our results provide clear, experimental evidence that fine-scale soil heterogeneity increases species richness through species sorting during community assembly.

AB AimLong-term ecological research sites have become essential tools in the study of tropical forest dynamics, but the potential impacts of researcher activity on the permanent plots being studied is often ignored. Here we ask whether seemingly benign repeated surveys themselves significantly affect stand dynamics and plant species diversity when implementing long-term monitoring of permanent plots.
   LocationOld-growth semi-deciduous tropical forest of M'Baiki, Central African Republic.
   MethodsWe compared demographic parameters of trees (DBH9.55cm) and plant community diversity and composition across three zones of three permanent plots: along trails crossing a plot, in areas adjacent to trails and in the forest interior. We assessed differences in radial growth, mortality, recruitment and species diversity using ANOVA. We examined the dynamics of tree death over time using Cox proportional hazards regression models. We analysed plant species composition using permutational multivariate ANOVA and indicator species analyses.
   ResultsTree mortality, recruitment and radial growth did not differ among the three zones. Species richness and evenness did not differ among the three zones investigated, but species composition did, with significantly different indicator species between trails and forest interiors. In trails, communities were characterized by light-demanding small trees and lianas and shade-tolerant herbs of trampled soils, whilst forest interiors exhibited more shade-tolerant tree species.
   ConclusionsEven in observational studies conducted in the wild, visitors may unintentionally but artificially influence the natural patterns and processes under investigation, an influence whose intensity may depend upon study design, habitat type and natural disturbance regimes. Permanent plots may not be a benign influence on the study system, as is generally assumed, and responses to repeated visitation may place fundamental limits on the questions that can be addressed, especially when species composition is assessed under low levels of natural disturbances or high density of trails.

AB QuestionIn fragmented forests, edge effects lead to changes in the distribution of plant species. In particular, tropical forest edges are increasingly dominated by lianas. Will this increase in lianas lead to changes in their interactions with other plant morphological groups? If so, will this alter the local distributions and abundance of other species?
   LocationPlots located at increasing distances from the nearest forest edge and in remnant fragments of rain forest in the Atherton Tablelands, far northeast Queensland, Australia.
   MethodsWe mapped the distribution of trees, lianas and epiphytic ferns to better understand the role of forest disturbance in shaping their competitive and facilitative interactions. We then used specific spatial point-process analyses to examine the effects of the spatial distribution of trees on the presence and abundance of lianas and epiphytic ferns.
   ResultsTree aggregation near forest edges was lower than that in the interior. The higher abundance of lianas near edges was associated with increased spatial segregation between lianas and epiphytic ferns. This segregation suggests there is competition between these two functional groups, and that lianas, being much more abundant, probably outcompete epiphytic ferns.
   ConclusionsThe ability of lianas to thrive in disturbed tropical rain forests appears to reduce the abundance of epiphytic ferns, probably via direct competition for space. Epiphytic ferns provide unique microclimates and harbour much biodiversity, and their decline could negatively affect many animals and plants that rely upon them.

ID BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; DIVERSITY
AB We aspired to set conservation priorities in ways that lead to direct conservation actions. Very large-scale strategic mapping leads to familiar conservation priorities exemplified by biodiversity hotspots. In contrast, tactical conservation actions unfold on much smaller geographical extents and they need to reflect the habitat loss and fragmentation that have sharply restricted where species now live. Our aspirations for direct, practical actions were demanding. First, we identified the global, strategic conservation priorities and then downscaled to practical local actions within the selected priorities. In doing this, we recognized the limitations of incomplete information. We started such a process in Colombia and used the results presented here to implement reforestation of degraded land to prevent the isolation of a large area of cloud forest. We used existing range maps of 171 bird species to identify priority conservation areas that would conserve the greatest number of species at risk in Colombia. By at risk species, we mean those that are endemic and have small ranges. The Western Andes had the highest concentrations of such species100 in totalbut the lowest densities of national parks. We then adjusted the priorities for this region by refining these species ranges by selecting only areas of suitable elevation and remaining habitat. The estimated ranges of these species shrank by 18-100% after accounting for habitat and suitable elevation. Setting conservation priorities on the basis of currently available range maps excluded priority areas in the Western Andes and, by extension, likely elsewhere and for other taxa. By incorporating detailed maps of remaining natural habitats, we made practical recommendations for conservation actions. One recommendation was to restore forest connections to a patch of cloud forest about to become isolated from the main Andes.

AB Forest fragmentation dramatically alters species persistence and distribution and affects many ecological interactions among species. Recent studies suggest that mutualisms, such as pollination and seed dispersal, are more sensitive to the negative effects of forest fragmentation than antagonisms, such as predation or herbivory. We applied meta-analytical techniques to evaluate this hypothesis and quantified the relative contributions of different components of the fragmentation process (decreases in fragment size, edge effects, increased isolation, and habitat degradation) to the overall effect. The effects of fragmentation on mutualisms were primarily driven by habitat degradation, edge effects, and fragment isolation, and, as predicted, they were consistently more negative on mutualisms than on antagonisms. For the most studied interaction type, seed dispersal, only certain components of fragmentation had significant (edge effects) or marginally significant (fragment size) effects. Seed size modulated the effect of fragmentation: species with large seeds showed stronger negative impacts of fragmentation via reduced dispersal rates. Our results reveal that different components of the habitat fragmentation process have varying impacts on key mutualisms. We also conclude that antagonistic interactions have been understudied in fragmented landscapes, most of the research has concentrated on particular types of mutualistic interactions such as seed dispersal, and that available studies of interspecific interactions have a strong geographical bias (arising mostly from studies carried out in Brazil, Chile, and the United States).

AB We studied fungal succession in decaying wood by compiling time-series data of fruit body observations. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of a primary species affects the probability of a succeeding species occurring later on the same log. Significant associations were detected for 15 species pairs; these were consistent with earlier findings on co-occurrence patterns in single time surveys. We used enrichment analysis to test if species with particular life-history attributes were more often associated with the occurrence of a succeeding species, or vice versa. White rot fungi and fungi abundant as mycelia were more often associated with the occurrence of succeeding species, compared to brown rot fungi and species with low mycelial abundance. Our results indicate that certain primary species cause priority effects and non-random co-occurrence patterns in the field. These successional patterns are likely to be connected both with substrate modification and species interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB We could show long-term effects of logging operation in a Malaysian forest. A forest selectively logged about 50 years ago had a longer sunfleck time and a less heterogeneous light spatially than primary forests.
   We compared forest light environments between a primary lowland tropical rainforest and a rainforest selectively logged 50 years ago in the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia using two different approaches to assess forest light environments, hemispherical canopy photographs and continuous measurements of forest photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and showed clear evidence of the long-term impact of selective logging on forest light environments. The selectively logged forest canopy consisted of shorter and smaller crowns with less variations of height and crown area than the primary forest. From the canopy structural characteristics of the selectively logged forest, we predicted that the selectively logged forest has brighter and more homogeneous forest light than the primary forest. Both hemispherical canopy photographs and measurements of PPFD showed that the selectively logged forest had more open canopies and longer sunfleck time than the primary forest. A significantly smaller variance of canopy openness and a shorter autocorrelation range in the selectively logged forest than in the primary forest were found, indicating that the selectively logged forest had a less heterogeneous light environment spatially than the primary forest. Therefore our predictions were confirmed. The results suggest that different light environments for the primary forest and forest after logging might promote different forest dynamics between them.

AB The agricultural landscape of the United States could soon be changed by planting of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) cultivars to meet government-mandated targets for lignocellulosic bioenergy production and consumption. This alteration could affect the genetic structure of wild switchgrass populations, which are native to the eastern half of North America through cultivar introgression. In this study, PCR amplification of microsatellite fragments as well as chloroplast gene-specific markers were utilized to quantify the genetic diversity and structure of five native populations and three agronomic fields (hereafter 'populations') planted with switchgrass cultivars. Microsatellite polymorphism across all the switchgrass populations ranged from 91.4 to 100 %. Overall, natural switchgrass populations had significantly higher mean genetic diversity than agronomic switchgrass cultivars (0.262 +/- A 0.102 and 0.201 +/- A 0.082 respectively, t test p < 0.008). Natural switchgrass populations had significantly higher total genetic diversity within (H-S) and among (H-T) as compared to agronomic switchgrass cultivars. A clear separation of natural and agronomic switchgrass populations was noted using principal component analysis and STRUCTURE analysis. A grouping pattern similar to that obtained in the microsatellite study was observed when chloroplast nucleotide sequence variation was assessed. In the realm of bioenergy sustainability, our results highlight the need to consider the genetic structure of cultivars for bioenergy when they are grown in proximity to native switchgrass populations.

AB In rural areas of northern Laos, a commercially valuable pioneer tree species, paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera L. Vent.) has been recommended for intercropping under plantations of commercial trees. However, less is understood about the growth of this pioneer tree species in the understorey and the mechanism underlying the shade intolerance. We measured growth characteristics for seedlings of paper mulberry under four light intensities. We compared the relative growth rates in aboveground biomass and standing leaf area (RGR(mass) and RGR(leaf)), light-capture efficiency, and seeding-level mass-based daily photosynthetic rates (A (mass)) with those of field-grown seedlings of eight shade-tolerant species to identify factors potentially responsible for shade-intolerance. Most growth traits of the paper mulberry seedlings did not differ consistently from those of the shade tolerant species. The ecophysiological-architectural model software showed higher A (mass) and RGR(mass) capacity in paper mulberry than in shade-tolerant species. Despite their higher RGR(mass), paper mulberry seedlings had negative RGR(leaf) under shaded conditions due to short leaf lifespan. The linear RGR(mass)-RGR(leaf) relationship for paper mulberry had a high RGR(mass) intercept, indicating that a high RGR(mass) was required to provide positive RGR(leaf). Progressive decreases in standing leaf area with time, and possibly photosynthesis, appear to be responsible for the shade-intolerance of paper mulberry. Although intercropping of paper mulberry has been suggested in the species' native region, understorey cultivation of paper mulberry would only be possible with relatively open canopies.

AB Campos de murundus (grasslands dotted with knolls that are covered with savanna-like woody vegetation) are a common landscape in central Brazil. In this study, we assessed for the first time the dynamics of the vegetation in a floodplain campo de murundus, describing changes in composition and structure of the woody vegetation. In 2005, we established 16 permanent 25 x 25 m plots, where we identified and mapped individuals with a trunk diameter at the base >= 2.86 cm, as well as measuring the height of those individuals. In 2008 (after two fire events), we resampled the plots. In 2005, we had registered 4.54 m(2) ha(-1) of basal area, 430 individuals, 42 species, 36 genera and 24 families. In 2008, we found an increase in basal area (to 4.65 m(2) ha(-1)) and a decrease in numbers of individuals (to 399), species (to 41), genera (to 35) and families (to 23). Species diversity did not differ between the two surveys. Mortality exceeded recruitment (2.68% year(-1) vs. 1.29% year(-1)). Nevertheless, the community showed a gain in basal area owing to the growth of surviving individuals and, particularly, to the rise in the number of basal sprouts. We argue that the small floristic turnover may be related to the great resilience of the woody vegetation, whereas the structural changes might reflect the effects of the burnings in the area.

AB The perturbation of Neotropical forests generates large disturbances in biological communities. The species that suffer least from the resulting habitat fragmentation are the pioneers, because they possess greater ability to inhabit disturbed environments. Therefore, it is expected that species diversity will be greater in areas subjected to intermediate disturbance, such as the opening of gaps, because a large number of pioneer species will develop and coexist with species of more advanced successional stages. This study aimed to compare two forest remnants that differed in size and disturbance intensity, in order to determine the effects of disturbances on species diversity and the size ratios of individual trees. This was accomplished with comparative analyses of diversity, richness and diameter ratios obtained for 10 plots at two semideciduous forest sites. We recorded a total of 85 species, of which 70 were in the private nature reserve Fazenda Santa Maria, 58 were in Iguacu National Park, and 43 were at both sites. Diversity was greater in the more disturbed remaining forest, because this area showed higher species richness, which is in accordance with some premises of the intermediate disturbance theory. There was also an increase in the number of pioneer individuals, and the less disturbed area showed individuals with larger diameters, which is likely attributable to the removal of large individuals from the more disturbed area during the anthropogenic process of forest modification.

AB The role of tropical secondary forests in carbon accumulation has been widely acknowledged, but the rates of changes in carbon stocks still remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in carbon pool sizes and accumulation rates associated withgrowth, recruitment and mortality of trees at differentages of forest succession in semi-evergreen tropical forests and relate these to the age of the secondary vegetation and prior land use intensity. The study was carried out in a chronosequence of secondary and mature forests around Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in southern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Permanent monitoring plots were established and measured in 2011 and 2012 to account all carbon stocks and changes due to tree increments, establishment of new trees and tree mortality in different age classes of secondary forests.
   We found that carbon stocks in living tree biomass increased rapidly in the early stages and decreased in the older secondary forests. The annual carbon dynamics of trees were higher in younger secondary forest compared to older forests due to higher tree growth and recruitment. Growth functions predict that the secondary forests recover live aboveground biomass carbon stocks to pre-disturbance levels (99.56 Mg C ha(-1)) at the age of about 125 years or more, while the basal area (33.2 m(2) ha(-1)) regains this level at the age of about 85 years. The longer carbon recovery time can be explained by the fact that mature forests are dominated by hardwood species whereas secondary forests are composed of softwood species and that species composition turnover during succession is relatively slow. Secondary forests of 35 years look similar to mature forests in terms of basal area, but this is located in large number of small and medium sized trees, whereas in mature forests, most of the basal area is in trees of >20 cm diameter. In addition, the intensity of slash and burn agriculture can negatively alter the velocity of carbon accumulation. These findings have important implications for national forest carbon monitoring systems, greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional level REDD+ strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forested tropical landscapes around the world are being extensively logged and converted to agriculture, with serious consequences for biodiversity and potentially ecosystem functioning. Here we investigate associations between habitat disturbance and functional diversity of ants and termites-two numerically dominant and functionally important taxa in tropical rain forests that perform key roles in predation, decomposition, nutrient cycling and seed dispersal. We compared ant and termite occurrence and composition within standardised volumes of soil and dead wood in old growth forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Termites occurred substantially less frequently in converted habitats than in old growth forest, whereas ant occurrences were highest in logged forest and lowest in old growth forest. All termite feeding groups had low occurrence in disturbed habitats, with soil feeders occurring even less frequently than wood feeders. Ant functional groups showed more variable associations, with some opportunist and behaviourally dominant groups being more abundant in degraded habitats. The importance of ants and termites in tropical ecosystems and such differing patterns of assemblage variation suggest that ecosystem functioning may be significantly altered in converted habitats.

AB Local, regional, and global extinctions caused by habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation have been widely reported for the tropics. The patterns and drivers of this loss of species are now increasingly well known in Amazonia, but there remains a significant gap in understanding of long-term trends in species persistence and extinction in anthropogenic landscapes. Such a historical perspective is critical for understanding the status and trends of extant biodiversity as well as for identifying priorities to halt further losses. Using extensive historical data sets of specimen records and results of contemporary surveys, we searched for evidence of local extinctions of a terra firma rainforest avifauna over 200 years in a 2500km(2) eastern Amazonian region around the Brazilian city of Belem. This region has the longest history of ornithological fieldwork in the entire Amazon basin and lies in the highly threatened Belem Centre of Endemism. We also compared our historically inferred extinction events with extensive data on species occurrences in a sample of catchments in a nearby municipality (Paragominas) that encompass a gradient of past forest loss. We found evidence for the possible extinction of 47 species (14% of the regional species pool) that were unreported from 1980 to 2013 (80% last recorded between 1900 and 1980). Seventeen species appear on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, and many of these are large-bodied. The species lost from the region immediately around Belem are similar to those which are currently restricted to well-forested catchments in Paragominas. Although we anticipate the future rediscovery or recolonization of some species inferred to be extinct by our calculations, we also expect that there are likely to be additional local extinctions, not reported here, given the ongoing loss and degradation of remaining areas of native vegetation across eastern Amazonia.

AB 1. Epigeic ants are functionally important arthropods in tropical and subtropical forests, particularly by acting as predators. High predation pressure has been hypothesised to be a mechanism facilitating high diversity across trophic levels. 2. In this study, standardised pitfall traps were used in a highly diverse subtropical forest to test if and how ant species richness is related to tree species richness and a comprehensive set of other environmental variables such as successional age, soil properties or elevation. 3. A total of 13 441 ant individuals belonging to 3839 species occurrences and 71 species were collected, of which 26 species were exclusive predators and 45 species were omnivores. 4. Occurrence and species richness of total and omnivore ants were positively related to soil pH. Predator ant occurrence was unrelated to all environmental variables tested. 5. The species richness of predator ants increased with tree species richness but decreased with leaf functional diversity and shrub cover. Elevation negatively influenced only total ant species richness. 6. The evenness of predators increased with tree species richness, while the evenness of all ants decreased with shrub cover. Omnivore ant evenness decreased with tree evenness, but increased with successional age. 7. The results highlight the value of diverse forests in maintaining species richness and community evenness of a functionally important predator group. Moreover, the results stress the importance of analysing trophic groups separately when investigating biodiversity effects.

AB The estimation of carbon accumulation in restoration areas over time is an important step for the evaluation of the success of restoration programs and to indicate the best practices for forest management and conservation. In the present study, we evaluated the aboveground biomass (AGB) of 10 tree species (fast-growing and slow-growing tree species) that are representative of the Brazilian Atlantic forest to test if biomass accumulation varies with tree age and ecological group (fast- and slow-growing). We also used regression models to simulate how much carbon is sequestered over time in restoration areas of tropical wet forests. The results exhibited differences between the two groups in terms of biomass accumulation; the slow-growing species accumulated an almost two-fold higher amount of total biomass (379.4 kg) than the fast-growing species (208.56 kg). The estimated age of the individuals explained the biomass accumulation: the long-lived and slow-growing species accumulate less biomass over a longer time, and the short-lived fast-growing species accumulate more biomass over a shorter period. These differences suggest that the fast-growing tree species contribute more to the carbon stock during the early years (approximately 37 years) of the restoration and that the slow-growing species contribute more significantly during the later stages of succession. We estimated that second-growth forests (4160 years old) accumulate more than two-fold carbon than immature forest (21-40 years old) and much more than ten-fold carbon than young forests (7-20 years old). These differences in carbon sequestration magnitudes suggest that services provided by restoration areas, can increase exponentially in the first 60 years, and this is particularly important for future conservation and management of areas undergoing restoration.

AB Large numbers of epiphytic bromeliads are regularly harvested from the canopy of cloud forests for traditional uses and illegal trade, with detrimental effects on the viability of populations. Since a significant proportion of natural mortality in epiphytes is caused by detachment from the support trees, harvesting of fallen plants represents a potential supply for commercial use that would have no impact on bromeliad population dynamics. We evaluated the potential of four cloud forest sites in southern Mexico to supply epiphytic bromeliads for commercialization. Bromeliad diversity and abundance was determined by sampling eight trees in each forest site and the number of fallen plants from these trees was recorded over three years. To determine the size of the potential harvest from the forest floor, the rate of bromeliad fall, and the species, condition and size of fallen individuals were recorded monthly in 10 plots (10 x 10 m) at each site over a period of five months. Bromeliad fall rate varied from 26,910 to 92,712 rosettes ha(-1) y(-1). Of these, ca. 60% (16,770 to 55,992 rosettes ha(-1) y(-1))\ of the 18 species identified were in a suitable condition for commercialization. Diversity and abundance in the canopy were positively related to that of the fallen rosettes (P < 0.05), indicating that the harvesting rate can be estimated from population densities in the host trees and that the fallen plants could therefore be used to indirectly evaluate the epiphyte community. Assessment revealed that the forest canopy could act as a nursery to supply a constant "rain" of bromeliads with minimum production costs. Even one ha of cloud forest can supply thousands of marketable bromeliads every year. Harvesting of fallen epiphytic bromeliads could add to the diversification of cloud forest management, contribute to the reduction of excessive canopy harvesting pressure and supply plants for forest enrichment programs. The results of this study are discussed in the context of the local stakeholder participation and national conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rural communities have traditionally valued forests for a diversity of products and services, with timber serving a minor role. No-where has this diversity been greater than in tropical South Asia, and in particular south India and Sri Lanka. As economies advance towards full development and populations become increasingly urbanized, forests become increasingly valued for their services. National development generally occurs at differing rates in different regions, with rural forest dependent communities falling behind and pockets of poverty long remaining. The demand for 'non-timber forest products' (NTFPs) therefore changes from subsistence to monetary based values. Overall, though, forests have suffered an unprecedented decline with development in the tropics, especially in Asia. This necessitates restoration which takes account of the enrichment of economy, wellbeing and culture which forest products provide. Methods for such restoration, and the fundamental principles upon which these must rest, are presented for species yielding NTFP's. In this paper we first review the history of NTFP species use within south India and Sri Lanka. Second we provide a description of the broad regional characterizations of the forest formations within this region in relation to their affiliated patterns of NTFP use and exploitation. We consider seven guilds as a way to categorize NTFP's into autecological groups for application in restoration silviculture, and use it as a framework to suggest restoration protocols for South Asian forests. We use examples of scenarios based on experimental studies of NTFP's in reforestation trials which take account of different social values and land tenures. We conclude with a call for further research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While metacommunities of bacterioplankton are generally considered to be structured primarily by local environmental conditions (through species sorting), additional ecological processes such as dispersal limitation, neutral dynamics or mass effects can influence community structure. Under the mass effects paradigm, continuous or large influxes of organisms, not self-maintaining in the target environment, affect community structure. We used communities of freshwater bacterioplankton to quantify the outcome of mass effects and species sorting in a laboratory experiment in which we exchanged cells between two communities from contrasting ponds (eutrophic and mesotrophic) at a rate of 0.025, 0.25, 2.5 and 12.5% of the cells present per day. When cells were exchanged only once on day 1 of the experiment, the reciprocally exchanged communities in all dispersal treatments remained as divergent, after 20days, as the unexchanged control communities, reflecting strong species sorting and no strong influences of dispersal limitation and neutral dynamics on the observed bacterioplankton. Under daily cell exchange, however, community similarity between the reciprocally exchanged communities increased significantly with increasing dispersal rate, indicating an increasing influence of mass effects relative to species sorting. The responses differed at the level of community composition and ecosystem processes, and depended on pond identity. At the community level, a daily exchange of 2.5% was necessary to increase community similarity compared with the unexchanged controls, while at the ecosystem process level (Biolog GN2 metabolic profiles), a daily exchange rate of 0.25% was sufficient. Mass effects can evidently overcome species sorting in freshwater bacterioplankton, but only under relatively high dispersal rates that are unlikely to occur in nature among habitats without a direct hydrological connection. Mass effects in the freshwater bacterioplankton acted differently at the community composition and ecosystem process level.

AB AimWe analysed the effects of grazing on the diversity and structure of dung beetle communities to see whether the biogeographical and ecological contexts influence dung beetle responses. We hypothesized that the responses of dung beetle communities are modulated by both the ecological conditions resulting from the transformation of native vegetation into grazing areas, and the history of the species inhabiting different biogeographical provinces.
   LocationThe state of Hidalgo, in the Mexican Transition Zone, central Mexico.
   MethodsWe used a standardized hierarchical sampling procedure in three biogeographical provinces located in Hidalgo. Within each province, we identified the dominant vegetation types, and within these we identified the sites with native vegetation and those modified by grazing. The design included 800 baited pitfall traps, and allowed us to study the response of dung beetle communities with different biogeographical histories to ecological context.
   ResultsWe captured 8707 beetles belonging to 37 species and 17 genera in the subfamily Scarabaeinae. We found that grazing areas only had a negative effect on dung beetle diversity in tropical forest; conversely, in dry environments (pine-oak forest and xerophilous scrubland) diversity in grazing areas was higher than in the native vegetation sites. We did not detect a clear effect in cloud forest sites. Species turnover between the native vegetation and pastures was high locally, and low over larger spatial scales (vegetation type or biogeographical province). In all four vegetation types grazing was associated with differences in dung beetle community composition.
   Main conclusionsThe impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity is dependent to a considerable degree on the local ecological conditions and the biogeographical context that has shaped the composition of communities over time.

AB Forest and water protection once relied primarily on regulatory means to achieve conservation ends, but an explosion of market-based and neoliberal approaches to environmental policy now depend instead on the creation and harnessing of financial instruments to value environmental goods and provide the funding needed for their preservation. Payments for environmental services (PES), which provides incentives for soil, water and forest conservation from users of services to those who provide them, is one of the most well-known of these approaches. However, many challenges remain for PES as a policy approach, and this paper explores how PES schemes have been implemented in practice in developing countries, how well they fit with descriptions of neoliberal environmental governance, and how these policies are being shaped by rural actors to make them more favourable to social, cultural or economic priorities in local areas. The paper shows that seemingly neoliberal policies like PES are actually a mix of both market economic incentives and regulatory approaches, and thus should not be labelled solely "neoliberal" per se. Further, much of this variegation in PES policy has resulted from active engagement of rural actors in shaping the parameters of what parts of neoliberal policy are acceptable, and what are not, and data from a Vietnam case study emphasize this point. Finally, the paper shows how key goals of neoliberal approaches, namely efficiency and conditionality, are often actually the weakest components of PES schemes, in Vietnam and elsewhere, particularly when they clash with local concerns over equity, which should pose a rethinking of how to understand PES success. The article concludes that PES plans should not be considered exclusively neoliberal per se, as they may in fact strengthen both state regulation and local participation and involvement in rural environmental management at the same time.

AB Litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems is an important first step for carbon and nutrient cycling, as senescent plant material is degraded and consequently incorporated, along with microbial products, into soil organic matter. The identification of litter affinity effects, whereby decomposition is accelerated in its home environment (home-field advantage, HFA), highlights the importance of plant-soil interactions that have consequences for biogeochemical cycling. While not universal, these affinity effects have been identified in a range of ecosystems, particularly in forests without disturbance. The optimization of the local decomposer community to degrade a particular combination of litter traits is the most oft-cited explanation for HFA effects, but the ways in which this specialized community can develop are only beginning to be understood. We explore ways in which HFA, or more broadly litter affinity effects, could arise in terrestrial ecosystems. Plant-herbivore interactions, microbial symbiosis, legacies from phyllosphere communities and attractors of specific soil fauna could contribute to spatially defined affinity effects for litter decomposition. Pyrosequencing soil communities and functional linkages of soil fauna provide great promise in advancing our mechanistic understanding of these interactions, and could lead to a greater appreciation of the role of litter-decomposer affinity in the maintenance of soil functional diversity.

AB In the absence of direct observations, demographic traits such as age and reproductive status may be modeled through proxies. We examined 35 yr of over 10,000 captures of Hawaiian green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and compared results from skeletochronology studies with mark-recapture records. For 109 turtles that were captured as juveniles and later observed nesting, we estimated maturity age first from skeletochronology-based models of age to length and second by estimating age at first capture using skeletochronology and then adding the time elapsed to first nesting. The second method involving mark-recapture gave younger and less variable age estimates. From these data we developed a scaling, rule that calculates that females first bred at 23 yr (95% interval: 16.8-28.1). This result was corroborated by tag returns in the Caribbean and Hawai'i showing that green turtles first nest at 16-20 yr. We validated this approach using life table models, successfully reconstructing four decades (1973-2012) of nesting surveys at East Island, French Frigate Shoals. We then compared our results with observed somatic growth rates, which suggest that nearshore studies may sample an atypical subset of the population that is chronically sedentary and slow growing. When exact life history traits are unknown, we recommend consulting multiple lines of evidence and independently validating proxy studies.

AB The seed-bank dynamics of cerrado, a savanna-like vegetation type in central Brazil, was monitored for a year after a fire event in the mid-dry season. Fifty paired soil and litter samples were collected 1 day before and 1 day after the fire to record the immediate effects on the seed bank, and thereafter at monthly intervals to investigate the post-fire seed bank dynamics. The samples were hand-sorted and the intact seeds were classified as monocot or dicot and counted. All seeds underwent germination trials in a germination chamber for 1 month. Seeds that did not germinate were checked for the presence and viability of the embryo. The sorted soil samples were placed in a greenhouse for 6 months, and the count of emerging seedlings was added to the number of germinated and dormant seeds from the germination trials to estimate the total number of viable seeds per sample. The fire did not affect the total seed-bank density: 63 +/- A 8 seeds m(-2) before the fire, and 83 +/- A 20 seeds m(-2) (mean +/- A se) immediately after it. Although monocots represented 65 % of the pre-fire seed bank, 1 year after the fire, the monocot seed density did not reach the pre-fire value, whereas the density of dicot seeds increased threefold. After the fire, the viable seed density and species richness, decreased with the onset of the rainy season coinciding with germination in the field. Therefore, post-fire recruitment increases genetic variability and contributes to the persistence of plant populations in cerrado communities.

AB Spectral properties of foliage express fundamental chemical interactions of canopies with solar radiation. However, the degree to which leaf spectra track chemical traits across environmental gradients in tropical forests is unknown.
   We analyzed leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra in 2567 tropical canopy trees comprising 1449 species in 17 forests along a 3400-m elevation and soil fertility gradient from the Amazonian lowlands to the Andean treeline. We developed quantitative links between 21 leaf traits and 400-2500-nm spectra, and developed classifications of tree taxa based on spectral traits.
   Our results reveal enormous inter-specific variation in spectral and chemical traits among canopy trees of the western Amazon. Chemical traits mediating primary production were tightly linked to elevational changes in foliar spectral signatures. By contrast, defense compounds and rock-derived nutrients tracked foliar spectral variation with changing soil fertility in the lowlands. Despite the effects of abiotic filtering on mean foliar spectral properties of tree communities, the spectra were dominated by phylogeny within any given community, and spectroscopy accurately classified 85-93% of Amazonian tree species.
   Our findings quantify how tropical tree canopies interact with sunlight, and indicate how to measure the functional and biological diversity of forests with spectroscopy.

AB Coral guard-crabs in the genus Trapezia are well-documented defenders of their pocilloporid coral hosts against coral predators such as the Crown-of-Thorns seastar (Acanthaster planci complex). The objectives of this study were to examine the protective services of six species of Trapezia against corallivory, and the extent of functional diversity among these Trapezia species.
   Studies conducted in Mo'orea, French Polynesia showed the Trapezia-coral mutualism protected the host corals from multiple predators through functional diversity in the assemblage of crab symbionts. Species differed in their defensive efficacy, but species within similar size classes shared similar abilities. Smallersize Trapezia species, which were previously thought to be ineffective guards, play important defensive roles against small corallivores.
   We also measured the benefits of this mutualism to corals in the midst of an Acanthaster outbreak that reduced the live coral cover on the fore reef to less than 4%. The mutualism may positively affect the reef coral demography and potential for recovery during adverse predation events through shelter of multiple species of small corals near the host coral. Our results show that while functional diversity is supported within the genus, some Trapezia species may be functionally equivalent within the same size class, decreasing the threat of gaps in coral protection caused by absence or replacement of any single Trapezia species.

AB Invasions by alien plants provide a unique opportunity to examine competitive interactions among plants. While resource competition has long been regarded as a major mechanism responsible for successful invasions, given a well-known capacity for many invaders to become dominant and reduce plant diversity in the invaded communities, few studies have measured resource competition directly or have assessed its importance relative to that of other mechanisms, at different stages of an invasion process. Here, we review evidence comparing the competitive ability of invasive species vs. that of co-occurring native plants, along a range of environmental gradients, showing that many invasive species have a superior competitive ability over native species, although invasive congeners are not necessarily competitively superior over native congeners, nor are alien dominants are better competitors than native dominants. We discuss how the outcomes of competition depend on a number of factors, such as the heterogeneous distribution of resources, the stage of the invasion process, as well as phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation, which may result in increased or decreased competitive ability in both invasive and native species. Competitive advantages of invasive species over natives are often transient and only important at the early stages of an invasion process. It remains unclear how important resource competition is relative to other mechanisms (competition avoidance via phenological differences, niche differentiation in space associated with phylogenetic distance, recruitment and dispersal limitation, indirect competition, and allelopathy). Finally, we identify the conceptual and methodological issues characterizing competition studies in plant invasions, and we discuss future research needs, including examination of resource competition dynamics and the impact of global environmental change on competitive interactions between invasive and native species.

AB The mechanisms that shape plant diversity along resource gradients remain unresolved because competing theories have been evaluated in isolation. By testing multiple theories simultaneously across a >2-million-year dune chronosequence in an Australian biodiversity hotspot, we show that variation in plant diversity is not explained by local resource heterogeneity, resource partitioning, nutrient stoichiometry, or soil fertility along this strong resource gradient. Rather, our results suggest that diversity is determined by environmental filtering from the regional flora, driven by soil acidification during long-term pedogenesis. This finding challenges the prevailing view that resource competition controls local plant diversity along resource gradients, and instead reflects processes shaping species pools over evolutionary time scales.

AB Understanding the ecological factors regulating exploited natural communities is important in establishing conservation and management strategies. Since the 1960s, artisanal fishermen have harvested up to 300 000 dry tons yr(-1) of wild populations of Lessonia spp. kelps. Adult kelps form a key habitat on the rocky shores of Chile, and benthic grazers regulate kelp populations by grazing or bulldozing microscopic and juvenile stages. To establish the role of the grazer assemblage in the recovery of kelp stands following harvesting, we conducted a manipulative experiment simulating artisanal kelp extraction and then manipulating the presence of grazers. We followed community succession and spatial distribution of L. berteroana recruits in manipulated and control rocky shore platforms for ca. 12 mo. Inter-individual distances of recruits and spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that the presence of grazers determined a patchy distributional pattern of L. berteroana. The aggregated spatial pattern of kelp recruits in the presence of grazers was followed by numerous coalescence events between small holdfasts, but no coalescence events were observed between recruits in the grazer removal areas. Our results suggest that grazing and recruit coalescence play an important role in the recovery of kelp stands following artisanal harvesting. Incorporating these processes into conservation and management strategies may bolster current strategies, which are based solely on the spatial structure of kelp stands.

AB We have investigated the processes of community assembly using size classes of trees. Specifically our work examined (1) whether point process models incorporating an effect of size-class produce more realistic summary outcomes than do models without this effect; (2) which of three selected models incorporating, respectively environmental effects, dispersal and the joint-effect of both of these, is most useful in explaining species-area relationships (SARs) and point dispersion patterns. For this evaluation we used tree species data from the 50-ha forest dynamics plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama and the comparable 20 ha plot at Bubeng, Southwest China. Our results demonstrated that incorporating an sizeclass effect dramatically improved the SAR estimation at both the plots when the dispersal only model was used. The joint effect model produced similar improvement but only for the 50-ha plot in Panama. The point patterns results were not improved by incorporation of size-class effects using any of the three models. Our results indicate that dispersal is likely to be a key process determining both SARs and point patterns. The environment-only model and joint-effects model were effective at the species level and the community level, respectively. We conclude that it is critical to use multiple summary characteristics when modelling spatial patterns at the species and community levels if a comprehensive understanding of the ecological processes that shape species' distributions is sought; without this results may have inherent biases. By influencing dispersal, the effect of size-class contributes to species assembly and enhances our understanding of species coexistence.

AB Tropical forests are vital ecosystems which provide numerous ecological functions and forest models can be used to simulate their dynamics. However, due to the high species diversity of tropical forests and the common lack of detailed knowledge about these species, simulating the behavior of each species separately is not feasible. Therefore, species with common characteristics are usually aggregated into species groups.
   Although the number of species groups is likely to be an important characteristic of forest models, little research has been done on its effect on the results of the model. In this article, we compare the effect of the number of species groups using a physiological forest gap model and review our results using 28 years of field data from a 50 ha forest plot in Panama as well as a chronosequence over four centuries from the same area. The number of simulated groups ranged from 1 to 4, 9 and 16. The parameterization with a single species group is a "neutral" parameterization with all simulated trees being ecophysiologically identical.
   The number of groups turned out to be an important characteristic of the model which influences its results on a fundamental level. Steady-states characteristics of forests like stem-numbers and stem-size distributions can be successfully simulated with even a single species group while modeling the long-term dynamics requires a higher number of groups. On the downside, a higher number of groups makes parameterization and fitting of the model more difficult. We conclude that the number of species groups is a vital characteristic of a forest model which has far-reaching consequences for its results and needs to be chosen with care. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding of the role of body mass in structural-functional relationships is pressing, particularly because species losses often occur non-randomly with respect to body size. Our study examined the effects of dung beetle body mass on dung removal at two levels. First, we used the lab experiment to evaluate the efficiency of eight dung beetle species belonging to two functional groups (tunnelers, dwellers) on dung removal. Second, the same species employed in the lab were used in field mesocosms to examine the effects of the two functional groups on dung removal maintaining realistic differences in the total body mass between tunneler and dweller assemblages. Furthermore, the experimental assemblages contained one and four species within each functional group, so the effect of body mass heterogeneity was examined. We used a statistical approach (offset method) which took into account a priori constraints due to the study design allowing us to analyse the effect of larger species in mesocosm style experiments. Body size played a crucial role in dung removal: large beetles were more efficient than small ones and the percentage of removed dung increased with higher body mass heterogeneity. Tunnelers were more efficient than dwellers over both short and long time periods (one month and one year). Significant effects of dwellers were found only after one year. Moreover, our study showed that not including the body mass as an offset in the model resulted in sometimes different results, as the offset expresses dung removal independently of the body mass. This approach confirmed that body size is likely a pivotal factor controlling dung removal efficiency at multiple levels, from single species to overall dung beetle assemblages. Even though other specific traits should be examined, this study has begun to address the consequences of losing individuals with specific traits that are especially sensitive to perturbations.

AB In the Dieng Mountains, encroachment of the protection forest by locals has resulted in conversion of the land into agricultural fields, followed by abandonment. Subsequent reforestation projects by the local authority have been uneven and ineffective in bringing back the protective function of the forest. With current farming practices, the trend of regrowth forest formation will persist into the future. We evaluated the reforestation approach in the Dieng Mountains by investigating the development of regrowth forests, and based on the result, suggest improvements to present restoration efforts. Vegetation data were collected using stratified systematic sampling on three types of disturbed habitats found in the area: woodland, shrubland, and grassland. The importance value index of each species was calculated; species richness and diversity were estimated using the Species Prediction and Diversity Estimation (SPADE) program. The development of the secondary vegetation in the Dieng Mountains was highly influenced by its land use history and the local government's reforestation programs. The low tree regenerations in all the habitats may be attributed to harsh environmental conditions caused by the high altitudinal location and the impact of forest clearings, as well as competition with herbs and the effect of human activities. Tree species planted during the reforestation programs, Acacia decurrens, Cupressus sempervirens, and Schima wallichii, dominated all habitats. Pioneer shrub species Melastoma affine and grasses Imperata cylindrica and Isachne globosa, as well as ruderal species Eupatorium odoratum, Eupatorium riparium, Buddleja asiatica, and Rubus rosaefolius dominated the undergrowth vegetation. Gleichenia dichotoma's domination seemed to suppress the growth of coexisting grass species, leading to the domination of Conyza javanica over pioneer grass species in grassland. Compared with similar studies in other secondary forests, the richness of plant species found in the Dieng Mountains was considerably lower, especially that of woody plants. As human populations in the Dieng Mountains continue to expand, the fate of the secondary vegetation in this area may be determined by future interference by humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Oenocaipus bataua var. bataua is a key species in the tropical rain forests of South America because it is one of the 10 most abundant tree species and one of most used by Amerindians. However, there is an acute lack of verifiable information about the duration of some of its ontogenic phases, the exact age of the palms, and the effect of gap formation on its spatial distribution. We employed 36 permanent plots (PP) of 0.1 ha randomly distributed in a forest of 700 ha in the Colombian Andes, in which we inventoried the stemmed palms at the establishment of the PP and after 13.4 years to study some ontogenic and demographic traits of this species. We dated underground and aboveground stems using the C-14 bomb-effect and estimated the stem's age by the rate of leaf-scar formation. We aimed at answering the following questions: (i) what are the main morphological characteristics of the underground stem and how long does it takes for its formation?; (ii) what is the pattern of its spatial distribution at the landscape level, and what factors help to explain it?; (iii) is the population structure and demography associated with the previous history of the forest?; (iv) is the first flowering a function of the vigour of the palms?. We found that the underground stem of adult palms is usually obconical and reaches 73 +/- 13 cm in length (+/- standard deviation). The duration of the establishment phase in eleven palms was almost constant: 37.5 +/- 0.7 years. The palms with smaller and larger diameters tend to flourish when the stems are 18 and 7 years old (44-55 years old from seedlings), respectively. We found that this species has a clumped spatial pattern. Several palms dated gave ages between 91 and 92 years, while others about 53 years. The bell shaped frequency distribution of the palm's length and age suggest a lack of younger palms in this area. We interpret that both, the clumped spatial pattern and their age distribution, are a legacy from past selective loggings that induced even-aged cohorts of palms at the landscape level. This species is not in equilibrium because the population tends to be reduced through time given that its doubling time is 37.4 years and its half-life 29.3 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Much attention has been recently paid to ex-post assessments of socioeconomic and environmental benefits of payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs on poverty reduction, water quality, and forest protection. To evaluate the effects of a regional PES program on water quality, we selected chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) as indicators of water quality. Statistical methods and an intervention analysis model were employed to assess whether the PES program produced substantial changes in water quality at 10 water-quality sampling stations in the Shaying River watershed, China during 2006-2011. Statistical results from paired-sample t-tests and box plots of COD and NH3-N concentrations at the 10 stations showed that the PFS program has played a positive role in improving water quality and reducing trans-boundary water pollution in the Shaying River watershed. Using the intervention analysis model, we quantitatively evaluated the effects of the intervention policy, i.e., the watershed PES program, on water quality at the 10 stations. The results suggest that this method could be used to assess the environmental benefits of watershed or water-related PES programs, such as improvements in water quality, seasonal flow regulation, erosion and sedimentation, and aquatic habitat.

AB Human activities, particularly agriculture, have transformed much of the world's terrestrial environment. Within these anthropogenic landscapes, a variety of relictual and semi-natural habitats exist, which we term countryside elements. The habitat value of countryside elements (hereafter termed 'elements') is increasingly recognised. We quantify the relative value of four kinds of such 'elements' (linear roadside remnants, native vegetation patches, scattered trees and tree plantings) used by a threatened Australian arboreal marsupial, the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis). We examined relationships between home range size and the availability of each 'element' and whether the usage was relative to predicted levels of use. The use of 'elements' by gliders was largely explained by their availability, but there was a preference for native vegetation patches and scattered trees. We found home range size was significantly smaller with increasing area of scattered trees and a contrasting effect with increasing area of linear roadside remnants or native vegetation patches. Our work showed that each 'element' was used and as such had a role in the conservation of the squirrel glider, but their relative value varied. We illustrate the need to assess the conservation value of countryside elements so they can be incorporated into the holistic management of agricultural landscapes. This work demonstrates the disproportional value of scattered trees, underscoring the need to specifically incorporate and/or enhance the protection and recruitment of scattered trees in biodiversity conservation policy and management.

AB The evolution of the flower is commonly thought to have spurred angiosperm diversification. Similarly, particular floral traits might have promoted diversification within specific angiosperm clades. We hypothesize that traits promoting the precise positional transfer of pollen between flowers might promote diversification. In particular, precise pollen transfer might produce partial reproductive isolation that facilitates adaptive divergence between parapatric populations differing in their reproductive-organ positions. We investigate this hypothesis with an individual-based model of pollen transfer dynamics associated with heterostyly, a floral syndrome that depends on precise pollen transfer. Our model shows that precise pollen transfer can cause sexual selection leading to divergence in reproductive-organ positions between populations served by different pollinators, pleiotropically causing an increase in reproductive isolation through a "magic trait'' mechanism. Furthermore, this increased reproductive isolation facilitates adaptive divergence between the populations in an unlinked, ecologically selected trait. In a different pollination scenario, however, precise pollen transfer causes a decrease in adaptive divergence by promoting asymmetric gene flow. Our results highlight the idea that magic traits are not "magic'' in isolation; in particular, the effect size of magic traits in speciation depends on the external environment, and also on other traits that modify the strength of the magic trait's influence on non-random mating. Overall, we show that the evolutionary consequences of pollen transfer dynamics can depend strongly on the available pollinator fauna and on the morphological fit between flowers and pollinators. Furthermore, our results illustrate the potential importance of even weak reproductive isolating barriers in facilitating adaptive divergence.

AB An ongoing debate in ecology concerns the impacts of ecological drift and selection on community assembly. Here, we show that there is a transition in diverse ecological communities between a selection-dominated regime (the niche phase) and a drift-dominated regime (the neutral phase). Simulations and analytic arguments show that the niche phase is favored in communities with large population sizes and relatively constant environments, whereas the neutral phase is favored in communities with small population sizes and fluctuating environments. Our results demonstrate how apparently neutral populations may arise even in communities inhabited by species with varying traits.

AB The spatial placement of recruits around adult conspecifics represents the accumulated outcome of several pattern-forming processes and mechanisms such as primary and secondary seed dispersal, habitat associations or Janzen-Connell effects. Studying the adult-recruit relationship should therefore allow the derivation of specific hypotheses on the processes shaping population and community dynamics. We analysed adult-recruit associations for 65 tree species taken from six censuses of the 50 ha neotropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We used point pattern analysis to test, at a range of neighbourhood scales, for spatial independence between recruits and adults, to assess the strength and type of departure from independence, and its relationship with species properties. Positive associations expected to prevail due to dispersal limitation occurred only in 16% of all cases; instead a majority of species showed spatial independence (approximate to 73%). Independence described the placement of recruits around conspecific adults in good approximation, although we found weak and noisy signals of species properties related to seed dispersal. We hypothesize that spatial mechanisms with strong stochastic components such as animal seed dispersal overpower the pattern-forming effects of dispersal limitation, density dependence and habitat association, or that some of the pattern-forming processes cancel out each other.

AB Plant species show different responses to the elevated temperatures that are resulting from global climate change, depending on their ecological and physiological characteristics. The highly invasive shrub Lantana camara occurs between the latitudes of 35 degrees N and 35 degrees S. According to current and future climate scenarios predicted by the CLIMEX model, climatically suitable areas for L. camara are projected to contract globally, despite expansions in some areas. The objective of this study was to test those predictions, using a pot experiment in which branch cuttings were grown at three different temperatures (22 degrees C, 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C). We hypothesized that warming would facilitate the invasiveness of L. camara. In response to rising temperatures, the total biomass of L. camara did increase. Plants allocated more biomass to stems and enlarged their leaves more at 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C, which promoted light capture and assimilation. They did not appear to be stressed by higher temperatures, in fact photosynthesis and assimilation were enhanced. Using lettuce (Lactuca sativa) as a receptor plant in a bioassay experiment, we also tested the phytotoxicity of L. camara leachate at different temperatures. All aqueous extracts from fresh leaves significantly inhibited the germination and seedling growth of lettuce, and the allelopathic effects became stronger with increasing temperature. Our results provide key evidence that elevated temperature led to significant increases in growth along with physiological and allelopathic effects, which together indicate that global warming facilitates the invasion of L. camara.

AB In this study we compared the epigeic ant assemblages in forest fragments with three different status of plant recovery (an area reforested in 2007, another reforested in 2005 and another one of secondary forest, with over 35 years of plant regeneration), located in the municipality of Laranjeiras, Sergipe, Brazil. The ants were sampled in February (dry season) and June (rainy season) of 2012. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) the species richness of ants increases with time after the process of forest restoration; and (2) there are significant changes in species composition of ants among the three stages of forest regeneration. Twenty-five pitfall traps were installed in each area. A total of 82 morphospecies of ants were sampled, distributed in 31 genera and seven subfamilies. The richness of ants was similar among the three sites (F = 1.71, p = 0.19). The composition of ant species, however, was different in the area of late regeneration (35 years) compared to other areas of early reforestation (p < 0.05). Thus, epigeic ants were partially sensitive to changes in the habitat studied in response to reforestation, presenting changes in species composition but no differences in ant species richness among areas. We conclude that seven years after reforestation are not enough to restore the same ant diversity in disturbed environments.

AB Background: Two contrasting intertidal habitats on the western Sabah coast (Malaysia), one is a rocky-sandy-mud flat at Sepangar (N6 degrees 2'18.57 ''; E116 degrees 06'40.07 '') and the other is a mangrove foreshore at Sulaman (N6 degrees 15'33.00 ''; E116 degrees 18'49.80 ''), are characterized by substrate zonation and homogeneous substrate (mud), respectively. Hermit crabs are one of the most conspicuous benthic macrofauna at both sites. The study examined the influence of habitat heterogeneity on the assemblages and shell use pattern of hermit crabs.
   Results: The heterogeneous intertidal flat at Sepangar (five species) supported a higher diversity and abundance of hermit crabs compared to Sulaman mangrove foreshore (two species). Hermit crabs at Sepangar used a greater variety of shells (30 species) compared to those at Sulaman (two species). Zonation of hermit crab species occurred at Sepangar where Diogenes klaasi dominated at the high-tide mark and two Clibanarius species (C. striolatus and C. merguiensis) dominated at the low-tide mark. Considerable overlap in habitat use (mid-and lower shore) occurred between D. tumidus and the two Clibanarius species which appeared to influence shell use pattern.
   Conclusions: This study supports the work of others showing that structurally complex habitats will allow habitat partition among species thus explaining the greater diversity and abundance of hermit crabs. Such a heterogeneous habitat provides a wider choice of shells for the hermit crabs, minimizing interspecific competition for the available shell resources.

AB There is currently a considerable effort to evaluate the performance of Payments for Ecosystem Services as an environmental management tool. The research presented here contributes to this work by using an experimental design to evaluate Payments for Ecosystem Services as a tool for supporting biodiversity conservation in the context of an African protected area. The trial employed a 'before and after' and 'with and without' design. We present the results of social and ecological surveys to investigate the impacts of the trial in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and equity. We find the scheme to be effective at bringing about additional conservation outcomes. However, we also found that increased monitoring is similarly effective in the short term, at lower cost. The major difference - and arguably the significant contribution of the Payments for Ecosystem Services - was that it changed the motives for protecting the park and improved local perceptions both of the park and its authority. We discuss the implications of these results for conservation efficiency, arguing that efficiency should not be defined in terms of short-term cost-effectiveness, but also in terms of the sustainability of behavioral motives in the long term. This insight helps us to resolve the apparent trade-off between goals of equity and efficiency in Payments for Ecosystem Services. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A life-history trade-off between low mortality in the dark and rapid growth in the light is one of the most widely accepted mechanisms underlying plant ecological strategies in tropical forests. Differences in plant functional traits are thought to underlie these distinct ecological strategies; however, very few studies have shown relationships between functional traits and demographic rates within a functional group. We present 8years of growth and mortality data from saplings of 15 species of Dipterocarpaceae planted into logged-over forest in Malaysian Borneo, and the relationships between these demographic rates and four key functional traits: wood density, specific leaf area (SLA), seed mass, and leaf C:N ratio. Species-specific differences in growth rates were separated from seedling size effects by fitting nonlinear mixed-effects models, to repeated measurements taken on individuals at multiple time points. Mortality data were analyzed using binary logistic regressions in a mixed-effects models framework. Growth increased and mortality decreased with increasing light availability. Species differed in both their growth and mortality rates, yet there was little evidence for a statistical interaction between species and light for either response. There was a positive relationship between growth rate and the predicted probability of mortality regardless of light environment, suggesting that this relationship may be driven by a general trade-off between traits that maximize growth and traits that minimize mortality, rather than through differential species responses to light. Our results indicate that wood density is an important trait that indicates both the ability of species to grow and resistance to mortality, but no other trait was correlated with either growth or mortality. Therefore, the growth mortality trade-off among species of dipterocarp appears to be general in being independent of species crossovers in performance in different light environments.

AB We assessed the origins and historical biogeography of a rich regional odonate fauna in New York State (NYS), Northeastern United States. We computed North American (NA) range centres and NYS range margins and reviewed the taxonomic literature to provide a useful phylogenetic framework for the fauna. We analysed results from a newly completed Odonata atlas using generalised linear anova models to assess the effects of species' origins and zoogeographic affinities on relative frequency and extinction risk metrics. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on taxonomic nomenclature revealed different patterns of diversification. Zygoptera in NYS is mainly of neotropical origin 60Ma displaying a pattern of tropical conservatism, but with a burst recent of Plio-Pleistocene speciation in certain groups. Alternatively, Anisoptera contains crown group endemic taxa and other very old lineages from the Mesozoic era before the breakup of Pangaea, highlighting the evolutionary significance of the Appalachian Mountains as an important global centre of temperate forest freshwater diversity. These high regional levels of odonate diversity have been brought about by at least three different mechanisms: dependence on forests, predominance of non-ecological speciation mechanisms, and niche conservatism across hundreds of millions of generations. NYS lies at a crossroads of both ancient and more recent Odonata evolution comprising separate boreal, temperate, and tropical faunas. Those species encountered less frequently and having higher overall extinction risk metrics generally tended to be the boreal species on the rear edge of their range, a widespread phenomenon for the insects of many regions generally attributed to ongoing climate change.

AB Premise of the study: Adansonia digitata L. is one of the most important indigenous fruit trees of mainland Africa. Despite its significance for subsistence and income generation of local communities, little is known about the genetic and morphological variability of East African populations of A. digitata, including those of Sudan. The aim of the current study, therefore, was to analyze genetic and morphological variability of different baobab populations in Kordofan, Sudan and to estimate the effect of human intervention on genetic differentiation and diversity.
   Methods: A total of 306 trees were randomly sampled from seven spatially separated locations in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan, to cover a wide range of differing environmental gradients and management regimes ('homesteads' and 'wild'). Genetic analyses were conducted using nine microsatellite markers. Because of the tetraploid nature of A. digitata, different approaches were applied to estimate patterns of genetic diversity. Investigations were completed by measurements of dendrometric and fruit morphological characters.
   Key results: Genetic diversity was balanced and did not differ between locations or management regimes, although tendencies of higher diversity in 'homesteads' were observed. A Bayesian cluster approach detected two distinct gene pools in the sample set, mainly caused by one highly diverse population close to a main road. The variability of tree characters and fruit morphometries was high, and signifi cantly different between locations.
   Conclusions: Results indicated a rather positive effect with human intervention. The observed populations provide a promising gene pool and likely comprise ecotypes well-adapted to environmental conditions at the northern distribution range of the species, which should be considered in conservation and management programs.

AB A cladistic and biogeographic analysis is presented of Heterostylum Macquart (Diptera: Bombyliidae), a New World bee-fly genus with 14 species. A phylogenetic hypothesis was obtained based on a data matrix with 27 characters, using the cladogram analysis and search program, TNT, and the matrix editing and tree viewing program, WINCLADA. Character states were polarized by tree rooting with the following outgroup taxa: Toxophora aurea Macquart, Apiformyia australis Yeates, Triploechus novus Williston, T. bellus Philippi, and T. heteronevrus Macquart. The monophyly of Heterostylum was well supported, and after successive weighting was applied, 2 major clades were found: a Nearctic clade including H. robustum (Osten Sacken), H. helvolum Hall & Evenhuis, H. deani Painter, H. croceum Painter, and H. engelhardti Painter, and a Neotropical clade with H. haemorrhoicum (Loew), H. rufum (Olivier), H. evenhuisi Cunha & Lamas, H. maculipennis Cunha & Lamas, H. ferrugineum (Fabricius), H. hirsutum (Thunberg), and H. pallipes Bigot. For the biogeographic analysis we derived an area cladogram based on the phylogenetic hypothesis obtained to analyze the distributional pattern and spatial diversification of Heterostylum. The divergence between Nearctic and Neotropical clades is associated with a spatial disjunction along the Mexican Transition Zone, which supports evidence that an ancient Caribbean event was mainly responsible for the diversification of major lineages of Heterostylum. This biogeographic scenario, as well as alternative scenarios, was also analyzed and discussed along with the results obtained from an event-based biogeographical analysis (DIVA).

AB In this study, we evaluated how different lizard species were distributed in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape and the influence of landscape metrics on lizard species richness in sampled fragments. We sampled (between July 2007 and March 2010) three continuous forest sites of the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu (REGUA), 12 forest fragments of different sizes and five pasture matrix areas. We recorded 8 lizard species, the most abundant being Ecpleopus gaudichaudii and Enyalius brasiliensis. Species richness in the continuous forest sites (N = 4) was lower than in the set of fragments (N = 8); fragments harbored both typical forest species and more generalist species. The forest areas differed in the composition of lizard species, with continuous forest sites having a composition similar to each other and to larger fragments, whereas the smaller fragments differed from the larger fragments but showed similarity to each other. These data indicated that fragment size (area) can be an important factor for the maintenance of lizard species diversity in fragmented Atlantic Forest landscapes.

AB Ants inhabiting inland dune and ridge woodlands in Worcester County, MD, were surveyed in 2008 and 2009 using a combination of pitfall traps and litter samples. We employed both methods in 2008 and pitfall traps only in 2009. Thirty dune sites were targeted for survey work. We collected and identified a total of 44,930 ants representing 67 species. Data on annual and seasonal variation in the ant community are reported, as is variation in species composition based on trapping method. Expanding survey efforts to include multiple years, seasons, and trapping methodology served to increase the overall number of species encountered primarily through documenting the presence of rare or infrequent species. We provide a list of ant species collected from inland dune and ridge woodlands and discuss the significance of apparent habitat-restricted species.

AB Niche differentiation is a major hypothesized determinant of species distributions, but its practical importance is heavily debated and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Trait-based approaches have been used to infer niche differentiation and predict species distributions. For understanding underlying mechanisms, individual traits should be scaled up to whole-plant performance, which has rarely been done.
   We measured seven key traits that are important for carbon and water balance for 37 tropical tree species. We used a process-based plant physiological model to simulate the carbon budget of saplings along gradients of light and water availability, and quantified the performance of the species in terms of their light compensation points (a proxy for shade tolerance), water compensation points (proxy for drought tolerance), and maximum carbon gain rates (proxy for potential growth rate). We linked species performances to their observed distributions (the realized niches) at two spatial scales in Bolivian lowland forests: along a canopy openness gradient at local scale (similar to 1 km 2) and along a rainfall gradient (1100-2200 mm/yr) at regional (similar to 1000 km) scale.
   We show that the water compensation point was the best predictor of species distributions along water and light resource gradients within and across tropical forests. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the stomatal regulation of minimum leaf water potentials, rather than stem hydraulic traits (sapwood area and specific conductivity), contributed to the species differences in the water compensation point of saplings. The light compensation point and maximum carbon gain, both driven by leaf area index and leaf nitrogen concentration, also contributed to differential species distributions at the local scale, but not or only marginally at the regional scale. Trait-and-physiology-based simulations of whole-plant performance thus help to evaluate the possible roles of individual traits in physiological processes underlying species performance along environmental gradients. The development of such whole-plant concepts will improve our ability to understand responses of plant communities to shifts in resource availability and stress under global change.

AB Following perturbation, different assemblages that originate under the same abiotic conditions initiate successional pathways that may continue to diverge or converge toward an eventual climax. Forest regeneration in the Central Amazon begins with alternative successional pathways associated with prior land use. In a 12-yr study of secondary forests, initially ranging between 2 and 19yrs after abandonment, we compared species compositions through time along two pathways, abandoned clear-cuts dominated by Cecropia and abandoned pastures dominated by Vismia; prior results at these sites have not directly evaluated species composition. At all ages, the Chao-Jaccard similarity index of species composition was highest comparing pasture transects to each other, lowest comparing pastures transects to clear-cut transects, and intermediate comparing clear-cut transects to each other. Through time, clear-cut transects became less similar to each other, as did pasture transects. Changes in similarity reflected declining dominance along both pathways, but Cecropia dominance of clear-cut transects declined more rapidly than Vismia dominance of pasture transects. A rich association of species replaced Cecropia in clear-cut transects, resulting in decreased similarity among them. In pasture transects one genus, Bellucia, replaced the lost Vismia, so similarity of Vismia transects was maintained despite some turnover in dominance. Overall, even with turnover of individuals and decline of the dominant pioneers, the alternative pathways exhibited strikingly different species assemblies after two decades of succession, suggesting that the effect of land use persists well beyond initial floristic composition.

AB We present a protocol for the transplantation of founding queens of the harvester ant Messor barbarus (LINNAEUS, 1767), monitoring their survival at six months, one year and 18 months. Once established, these ants are expected to have a positive impact on vegetation restoration via their ability to disperse seeds harvested by workers, thus accelerating the rehabilitation and restoration already undertaken using conventional civil engineering. The transplantations were performed on two sites currently undergoing ecological restoration, one previously degraded by intensive fruit growing (AOA) and the other destroyed by an industrial accident (OLA), and compared with natural colonisation on a reference steppe site. Founding-queen transplantation was also performed at the reference steppe site. We report here the first steps of the protocol, with results on transplantation success and on natural colonisation.
   Short-term rates of survival of the transplanted founding queens are encouraging: 15% at the AOA site (after one and a half years) and 35% at the OLA site (after one year). It will take a few years longer to assess any significant impact on composition, species richness and distribution of the different plant populations characteristic of the steppe. However, we demonstrate that the density of natural nests is significantly lower at the degraded site (AOA) than at the reference steppe. It also appears that natural recolonisation by Messor barbarus at the destroyed site (OLA) would be difficult without the creation of a favourable habitat. These two results attest to the value of transplantation operations and confirm our hypothesis that for successful establishment the suitability of host habitats for founding queens is a more limiting factor than dispersal during the nuptial flight.

AB Reforestation and afforestation often takes place in the form of monocultures. These have increasingly come under criticism due to their greater susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions and pathogens and because of the negative long-term impacts they have on soil fertility. Moreover, reservations have frequently been expressed as to whether monoculture is the only way to maximize biomass productivity. Subtropical forests in China are not only rich in tree species but are also diverse in terms of topography. However, historical clear-cutting and the high demand for wood have meant that considerable areas of these forests have been degraded or lost entirely. In recent years, great efforts have been made in subtropical China to restore and afforest vast areas. Nonetheless, conifer monoculture plantations are still prevalent owing to the lack of data on the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and the limited knowledge of the growth performance of native broad-leaved tree species in plantations in this region. In this study, we investigated the growth response of individual tree saplings in a large-scale forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment established in a highly heterogeneous environment in subtropical China (BEF-China). The experiment was established during the period November 2008 to April 2009 and incorporates a species pool of 24 tree species across 261 plots (0.067 ha each) and a broad richness gradient with 1-24 species per plot. Annual growth rates of tree height, stem diameter and crown width for 6723 saplings of 24 species in the third year after establishment were used as response variables. We analyzed the effects of initial size, local abiotic site conditions and local neighborhood on growth performance using mixed effects models. Initial size, local topographic (aspect, slope, curvature, elevation) and edaphic variables (total nitrogen, C/N ratio) as well as local neighborhood variables (competition index, Shannon index) were included as fixed effects. Random effects were plot and species identity. The results showed that growth performance of tree saplings was markedly species-specific and strongly affected by initial size and local site conditions. In this early stage of the experiment, local Shannon diversity did not yet explain a significant amount of variation in sapling growth. However, the significant effect of the increasing size of neighboring trees indicated that tree-tree interactions had already occurred. A greater investment in height growth at the expense of diameter growth suggested that light intercept is the priority for tree sapling growth. This study stresses the importance of better understanding the effects of local site conditions on initial growth in mixed-species plantations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Functional attributes of savanna soils: contrasting effects of tree
   canopies and herbivores on bulk density, nutrients and moisture dynamics

AB 1. Savannas are highly heterogeneous tree-grass mixtures, and the structural variation imposed by a discontinuous canopy cover results in spatial variation in soil properties such as plant-available nutrients, temperature and soil moisture. Many savannas are also dominated by large vertebrate herbivores, which impose a different suite of effects on soil properties related to consumption, excretion and physical disturbance.
   2. In nutrient-poor, water-limited systems, variation in soil resource availability may play a fundamental role in structuring plant communities, but the relative and interactive effects of key drivers of heterogeneity have received little attention in savanna ecosystems.
   3. We investigated the independent and interactive effects of herbivores and tree canopy cover on multiple soil properties up to a depth of 10 cm, including bulk density, soil C pools, total and plant-available nutrients, moisture dynamics and temperature at two contrasting sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We analysed samples from locations under and between adult tree canopies and inside and outside long-term herbivore exclosures using a nested design.
   4. We found strong positive effects of tree canopies on total and labile pools of soil C and N and negative effects on plant-available P and soil temperature. Tree canopy effects on soil moisture availability were small but clearly detectable. During precipitation events, trees increased moisture inputs on granite soils but decreased moisture inputs on basalt soils compared to open sites.
   5. Conversely, we found mixed evidence for herbivore effects on soil chemistry and temperature, but a clearer effect on soil moisture, with areas outside exclosures experiencing higher soil moisture retention, particularly immediately following precipitation events. Soil bulk density, a driver of both nutrient and soil moisture dynamics, was lower under trees and when herbivores were excluded.
   6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that variation in tree cover is the dominant biotic driver of C, N and P dynamics in these savanna systems in the top 10 cm of soil, that herbivores primarily affect soil moisture content, and that canopy and herbivore effects tend to be additive rather than synergistic.

AB Studies of the importance of ecosystem engineers have focused on their benefit to biodiversity through ameliorating environmental stress, without understanding the exact benefits gained by associated organisms. On monsoonal tropical shores, species experience strong seasonality in environmental conditions from almost temperate winters to tropical summers when mass mortalities can occur during daytime emersion. The limpet, Cellana grata, associates with an ecosystem engineer, the barnacle Tetraclita japonica, in summer, but not in winter. To understand the benefits of this association, physiological responses (heart rates and osmotic responses) of the limpet either amongst Tetraclita or on open rock surfaces were investigated under three environmental conditions in a laboratory mesocosm: awash (non-stressed), low (30 A degrees C) and high thermal stress (40 A degrees C) of varying durations (3 or 6 h). In general, at 30 A degrees C, limpets showed similar physiological responses under all conditions for both exposure durations. After 6 h at 40 A degrees C, however, all limpets on open rock surfaces died, whereas those associated with barnacles survived. The surviving limpets experienced similar levels of stress as those exposed to 40 A degrees C on open rock surfaces for half the time (3 h), showing that both the level and duration of stress were important. Limpets, therefore, gain benefits from engineering species when conditions are extreme or stress is prolonged. Under low temperatures or for short durations (e.g. winter), associating with barnacles does not provide physiological benefits. Understanding how, and to what extent, associates benefit from ecosystem engineers highlights how close the margin between survival and mortality can be when conditions are extreme.

AB Habitat fragmentation and invasive species are two of the most prominent threats to terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies have examined how these factors interact to influence the diversity of natural communities, particularly primary consumers. Here, we examined the effects of forest fragmentation and invasion of exotic honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii, Caprifoliaceae) on the abundance and diversity of the dominant forest herbivores: woody plant-feeding Lepidoptera. We systematically surveyed understory caterpillars along transects in 19 forest fragments over multiple years in southwestern Ohio and evaluated how fragment area, isolation, tree diversity, invasion by honeysuckle and interactions among these factors influence species richness, diversity and abundance. We found strong seasonal variation in caterpillar communities, which responded differently to fragmentation and invasion. Abundance and richness increased with fragment area, but these effects were mitigated by high levels of honeysuckle, tree diversity, landscape forest cover, and large recent changes in area. Honeysuckle infestation was generally associated with decreased caterpillar abundance and diversity, but these effects were strongly dependent on other fragment traits. Effects of honeysuckle on abundance were moderated when fragment area, landscape forest cover and tree diversity were high. In contrast, negative effects of honeysuckle invasion on caterpillar diversity were most pronounced in fragments with high tree diversity and large recent increases in area. Our results illustrate the complex interdependencies of habitat fragmentation, plant diversity and plant invasion in their effects on primary consumers and emphasize the need to consider these processes in concert to understand the consequences of anthropogenic habitat change for biodiversity.

AB Forest ground heterogeneity can affect interactions among tree species and control the assembly of local forest communities. Less is known of the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the maintenance of tree genetic variation through small-scale genotype x environment (G x E) interactions. We measured growth variation within and among 17 Betula pendula genotypes, planted in a clear-cut forest site through the summers 2009-2011. We assessed the spatial heterogeneity at two scales: among forest stands having history of the same or different tree species combinations (treated as replicate blocks), and along a gradient of within-block forest density, revealed by the stump density. To add a temporal perspective, we distinguished between old (cut 50 years earlier) and new stumps (cut one year earlier). The broad-sense heritabilities for growth were 0.093-0.055 and the coefficients of genotypic variation 0.37-0.21 in 2009-2011. The growth difference among the genotypes was 3.5-5.5 fold, significant in all years, and the rank of genotype means correlated positively between the years. The most favourable block had 106 % higher growth than the least favourable block and the amount of total variation explained by block increased from 0.4 % in 2009 to 6.9 % in 2011. Genotype x block interaction was marginally significant in 2009, but not later. Similarly, the response of growth to old stump density in sapling vicinity varied among the genotypes in 2009, but not later. In 2010 and 2011, the mean growth increased by 50-91 % along the old stump density gradient. Our results suggest that despite creating significant variation in sapling growth the small-scale forest ground heterogeneity, which reflects the recent forest history, may not significantly contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in B. pendula populations.

AB Enrichment planting is a technique that is gaining recognition for its potential to restore native forests. Due to the steep economic trade-offs involved and dearth of silvicultural and ecological knowledge about native flora, however, it remains unclear whether it has promise for widespread application. Focusing on growth performance, this study explores the restoration potential of twenty-one native tree species 3 years after planting in the understory of a rubber plantation in southern Bahia, Brazil. We tested the effects of slope, aspect, successional guild and basal area of the overstory rubber trees on the enriched species' height, root collar diameter, and diameter at breast height. Height was the growth parameter that most differentiated species, with Parkia pendula, Sloanea monosperma, and Tachigali densiflora being three of the most successful species. Pioneer species grew faster than the non-pioneer species. Overstory basal area was the most important variable influencing the performance of the planted tree seedlings, while aspect and slope were less important. For every additional unit of basal area per hectare of rubber, there was an incremental decrease in the growth rates of the enrichment species. This suggests that the tree species are likely limited by available light, and that there are distinct trade-offs between overstory rubber density and understory tree species growth that are important to consider when accelerating forest recovery by using enrichment planting techniques.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS
AB There has been an increased interest in using sustainability indicators for evaluating the impacts of development and conservation projects. Past and recent experiences have shown that sustainability indicators can be powerful tools for measuring the outcomes of various interventions, when used appropriately and adequately. Currently, there is a range of methods for applying sustainability indicators for project impact evaluation at the environment-development interface. At the same time, a number of challenges persist which have implication for impact evaluation processes especially in developing countries. We highlight some key and recurrent challenges, using three cases from Kenya, Indonesia and Brazil.
   In this study, we have conducted a comparative analysis across multiple projects from the three countries, which aimed to conserve biodiversity and improve livelihoods. The assessments of these projects were designed to evaluate their positive, negative, short-term, long term, direct and indirect impacts. We have identified a set of commonly used sustainability indicators to evaluate the projects and have discussed opportunities and challenges associated with their application. Our analysis shows that impact evaluation processes present good opportunities for applying sustainability indicators. On the other hand, we find that project proponents (e.g. managers, evaluators, donors/fundets) face challenges with establishing full impacts of interventions and that these are rooted in monitoring and evaluation processes, lack of evidence-based impacts, difficulties of measuring certain outcomes and concerns over scale of a range of impacts.
   We outline key lessons learnt from the multiple cases and propose ways to overcome common problems. Results from our analysis demonstrate practical experiences of applying sustainability indicators in developing countries context where there are different prevailing socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions. The knowledge derived from this study may therefore be useful to a wider range of audience who are concerned with sustainable integration of development and environmental conservation.

AB Herbivory has been identified as a potent evolutionary force, but its ecological impacts have been frequently underestimated. Leaf-cutting ants represent one of the most important herbivores of the Neotropics and offer an interesting opportunity to address the role played by herbivorous insects through a perspective that embraces population- to ecosystem-level effects. Here we: (1) qualitatively summarize the multiple ways leaf-cutting ants interact with food plants and their habitats and elucidate the ultimate outcome of such interactions at multiple organization levels; (2) update our understanding of leaf-cutting ant-promoted disturbance regimes; and (3) examine potential ecological roles by leaf-cutting ants within the context of human-modified landscapes to guide future research agendas. First, we find that leaf-cutting ants show that some herbivorous insects are able to generate ecologically important disturbance regimes via non-trophic activities. Second, impacts of leaf-cutting ants can be observed at multiple spatio-temporal scales and levels of biological organization. Third, ecosystem-level effects from leaf-cutting ants are ecosystem engineering capable not only of altering the abundance of other organisms, but also the successional trajectory of vegetation. Finally, effects of leaf-cutting ants are context-dependent, species-specific, and synergistically modulated by anthropogenic interferences. Future research should examine how leaf-cutting ants respond to deforestation and influence remaining vegetation in human-modified landscapes. By promoting either heterogeneity or homogeneity, leaf-cutting ants operate not only as agricultural pests but also as ecological key players.

AB Aim To determine whether there is evidence of changes in small mammals distributions and emergent metacommunity structure in the Atlantic Forest resulting from extensive habitat loss and fragmentation associated with anthropogenic activities.
   Location South American Atlantic Forest from northeastern Brazil to eastern Paraguay.
   Methods Using presence-absence data for non-volant small mammals, we analysed metacommunity structure for communities from 76 fragments distributed throughout Atlantic Forest. We evaluated coherence, range turnover and range boundary clumping for the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, marsupials, rodents and sigmodontine rodents separately. beta-diversity based on the multiplicative model was used to estimate the number of compartments (groups of sites with similar species composition) in Clementsian structures, and cluster analysis identified which sites formed compartments. Canonical correspondence analysis determined which environmental factors were associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Distance-decay analysis evaluated the spatial structure in small mammal and environmental data, and Mantel tests evaluated correlations between them.
   Results Rodent metacommunities had Clementsian structure, whereas marsupials had Gleasonian structure. Compartment locations for rodents were consistent with areas of endemism. Temperature seasonality was most associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Assemblage and environmental dissimilarity among sites had significant positive relationships with geographic distance.
   Main conclusions Compartment locations in Clementsian structures mirrored historical refugium locations and important vicariance events associated with large rivers. Despite extensive deforestation in Atlantic Forest, small mammal distributions are consistent with expectations based on historical biogeography, suggesting that anthropogenic activities have not yet greatly affected geographic distributions of emergent metacommunity structures. However, extinction debt associated with recent fragmentation and habitat loss may exist. Any effective conservation plan for large and fragmented biomes must consider areas of endemism to maintain regional biodiversity and maintain sufficiently large and connected fragments to facilitate rescue effects and minimize effects of extinction debt.

AB Negative density dependence (NDD) of recruitment is pervasive in tropical tree species. We tested the hypotheses that seed dispersal is NDD, due to intraspecific competition for dispersers, and that this contributes to NDD of recruitment. We compared dispersal in the palm Attalea butyracea across a wide range of population density on Barro Colorado Island in Panama and assessed its consequences for seed distributions. We found that frugivore visitation, seed removal and dispersal distance all declined with population density of A. butyracea, demonstrating NDD of seed dispersal due to competition for dispersers. Furthermore, as population density increased, the distances of seeds from the nearest adult decreased, conspecific seed crowding increased and seedling recruitment success decreased, all patterns expected under poorer dispersal. Unexpectedly, however, our analyses showed that NDD of dispersal did not contribute substantially to these changes in the quality of the seed distribution; patterns with population density were dominated by effects due solely to increasing adult and seed density.

AB In many human-modified tropical landscapes, biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services require large-scale restoration initiatives. Such initiatives must be able to augment the amount and the quality of remaining natural habitats. There is thus a growing need for long-term, multi-stakeholder and multi-purpose initiatives that result in multiple ecological and socioeconomic benefits at the biome scale. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP) is a coalition of 260+ stakeholders, including governmental agencies, private sector, NGOs and research institutions, aimed at restoring 15 million ha of degraded and deforested lands by 2050. By articulating, and then integrating common interests, this initiative has allowed different sectors of society to implement an ambitious vision and create a forum for public and private concerns regarding forest restoration. The AFRP adopts a set of governance tools so multiple actors can implement key processes to achieve long-term and visionary restoration goals. Having overcome some initial challenges, AFRP now has to incorporate underrepresented stakeholders and enhance its efforts to make forest restoration more economically viable, including cases where restoration could be less expensive and profitable. The AFRP experience has resulted in many lessons learned, which can be shared to foster similar initiatives across tropical regions.

AB Providing food and other products to a growing human population while safeguarding natural ecosystems and the provision of their services is a significant scientific, social and political challenge. With food demand likely to double over the next four decades, anthropization is already driving climate change and is the principal force behind species extinction, among other environmental impacts. The sustainable intensification of production on current agricultural lands has been suggested as a key solution to the competition for land between agriculture and natural ecosystems. However, few investigations have shown the extent to which these lands can meet projected demands while considering biophysical constraints. Here we investigate the improved use of existing agricultural lands and present insights into avoiding future competition for land. We focus on Brazil, a country projected to experience the largest increase in agricultural production over the next four decades and the richest nation in terrestrial carbon and biodiversity. Using various models and climatic datasets, we produced the first estimate of the carrying capacity of Brazil's 115 million hectares of cultivated pasturelands. We then investigated if the improved use of cultivated pasturelands would free enough land for the expansion of meat, crops, wood and biofuel, respecting biophysical constraints (i.e., terrain, climate) and including climate change impacts. We found that the current productivity of Brazilian cultivated pasturelands is 32-34% of its potential and that increasing productivity to 49-52% of the potential would suffice to meet demands for meat, crops, wood products and biofuels until at least 2040, without further conversion of natural ecosystems. As a result up to 14.3 Gt CO2 Eq could be mitigated. The fact that the country poised to undergo the largest expansion of agricultural production over the coming decades can do so without further conversion of natural habitats provokes the question whether the same can be true in other regional contexts and, ultimately, at the global scale.

AB Questions: Do ferns, which are physiologically less well adapted to conserve water than angiosperms but have more efficient propagule dispersal, show different vegetation-environment relationships than co-occurring angiosperm herbs? We hypothesized that ferns should show closer relationships to local environmental conditions and might be more closely associated with humid and shady microhabitats.
   Location: Pono and Bariri, two sites in lower montane primary tropical forest, Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.
   Methods: At each site, all terrestrial herbaceous plants were sampled in 200 plots of 5 m 9 5 m. Sixteen environmental factors describing soils, topography and canopy openness were recorded. Correlations were calculated to test the degree of similarity in the species richness and turnover of ferns and angiosperms, and their relationships with environmental factors. Species optima were calculated on each environmental axis and compared between plant groups via randomization tests.
   Results: In total, 184 herb morphospecies were encountered at Pono and 135 at Bariri, of which almost 60% at each site were ferns. At both sites, fern species turnover showed closer correlations with soil variables than did angiosperm turnover. At the more topographically heterogeneous site (Bariri) fern species turnover was also more closely associated with topographic differences than was angiosperm turnover. Habitat preferences of ferns and angiosperms appeared more similar at Bariri than Pono, with both tending towards lower topographic positions and richer soils, but steeper slopes, than expected at random. At Bariri, neither plant group tended towards shady microsites, whereas at Pono ferns were better represented than angiosperms in microhabitats with open canopies.
   Conclusions: As expected, ferns showed closer correlations with environmental factors than angiosperm herbs. Ferns did not, however, consistently favour humid microhabitats at both sites, and were not significantly associated with shady microhabitats at either site. Furthermore, it appears that physiological differences in water use do not lead to marked divergence in fern and angiosperm herb distributions in the humid understorey of this lower montane rainforest.

AB Agricultural census data and fieldwork observations are used to analyze changes in land cover/use intensity across Rondonia and Mato Grosso states along the agricultural frontier in the Brazilian Amazon. Results show that the development of land use is strongly related to land distribution structure. While large farms have increased their share of annual and perennial crops, small and medium size farms have strongly contributed to the development of beef and milk market chains in both Rondonia and Mato Grosso. Land use intensification has occurred in the form of increased use of machinery, labor in agriculture and stocking rates of cattle herds. Regional and national demands have improved infrastructure and productivity. The data presented show that the distinct pathways of land use development are related to accessibility to markets and processing industry as well as to the agricultural colonization history of the region. The data analyzed do not provide any indication of frontier stagnation, i.e., the slowdown of agricultural expansion, in the Brazilian Amazon. Instead of frontier stagnation, the data analyzed indicate that intensification processes in consolidated areas as well as recent agricultural expansion into forest areas are able to explain the cycle of expansion and retraction of the agricultural frontier into the Amazon region. The evolution of land use is useful for scenario analysis of both land cover change and land use intensification and provides insights into the role of market development and policies on land use.

AB Whole genome sequencing is helping generate robust phylogenetic hypotheses for a range of taxonomic groups that were previously recalcitrant to classical molecular phylogenetic approaches. As a case study, we performed a shallow shotgun sequencing of eight species in the tropical tree family Chrysobalanaceae to retrieve large fragments of high-copy number DNA regions and test the potential of these regions for phylogeny reconstruction. We were able to assemble the nuclear ribosomal cluster (nrDNA), the complete plastid genome (ptDNA) and a large fraction of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) with approximately 1000x, 450x and 120x sequencing depth respectively. The phylogenetic tree obtained with ptDNA resolved five of the seven internal nodes. In contrast, the tree obtained with mtDNA and nrDNA data were largely unresolved. This study demonstrates that genome skimming is a cost-effective approach and shows potential in plant molecular systematics within Chrysobalanaceae and other under-studied groups.

AB Ants are ecosystems engineers, keystone species and incredibly abundant worldwide. A major cosmopolitan interaction between ants and plants is ant-mediated seed dispersal (myrmecochory). The interaction involves more than 11,000 plant species, but far fewer ant species, possibly just a few dozen keystone species worldwide. Researchers only began recognizing this degree of asymmetry in ant-mediated seed dispersal in recent years, and we explore the ecological and evolutionary implications of the changed perspective. We review what makes ants effective dispersers, how plants coevolve with ant partners, and how the interaction may benefit both participants. We suggest that morphological adaptations for myrmecochory have evolved repeatedly and independently in many plants lineages worldwide, and these trait adaptations likely select for effective seed dispersing ants. We propose that myrmecochory evolves and spreads only in ecosystems where the ant community includes potentially effective seed dispersers in high abundance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the evolution and maintenance of the interaction only is possible where the distribution of traits between beneficial and antagonistic ants can fall under plant selection for the best partners.

AB This article reviews literature on the science and politics of deforestation in the Amazon from 1970 until today, focusing on their shifting meanings and the increasing relevance of climate change knowledge to their understanding and management. Since large-scale colonization of the region began in the 1970s, the debate on deforestation has been crucial in disputes involving science, development, and the environment. In the last decade, the issue of climate change has become more present in the science, politics, and policies related to deforestation in the Amazon. This debate has helped shift discussions on both the environmental and the development agenda for the region. Although there is a broad agreement that the Amazon is being increasingly integrated into global fluxes of knowledge, goods, and people, not all view this process under the same light. The review concludes that scientific views help condition the development of changing policy arrangements aimed at curbing deforestation, and the incorporation of climate change knowledge is an important aspect of the dynamics of environmental policies in the region.

AB The impact of logging on plant communities was studied in forest that has been logged selectively 1, 5 and 10 years previously (following a certified procedure): diversity was compared with that of primary rain forest in the Berau region of East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Four sets of 20 transects located within an area of 6 ha were sampled for all trees, saplings and seedlings, and records were made of topographic position, structure, composition and species diversity. There was a high level of floristic similarity between primary forests at the study sites compared to primary forest elsewhere in Kalimantan. The impact of logging is therefore likely to be the most important factor determining any differences between the plant communities of the selectively logged and primary forest sites. We found differences in species composition and abundance of most plants between selectively logged and primary forest. Overall, stem densities of trees in the primary forest were higher than in the three selectively logged forest sites. Stem densities of saplings were equivalent in all four forests. Seedling stem densities were higher in the forest site logged 10 years previously than in primary forest. Our results showed that the forests logged selectively under certified regimes still have a high plant diversity, possibly indicating that biodiversity values may be conserved by following certification procedures.

AB With increasing recognition that maximum oxygen demand is the unifying limit in tolerance, the first line of thermal sensitivity is, as a corollary, due to capacity limitations at a high level of organisational complexity before individual, molecular or membrane functions become disturbed. In this study the tropical mussel Perna viridis were subjected to temperature change of 0.4 degrees C per hour from ambient to 8-36 degrees C. By comparing thermal mortality against biochemical indices (hsp70, gluthathione), physiological indices (glycogen, FRAP, NRRT) and behavioural indices (clearance rate), a hierarchy of thermal tolerance was therein elucidated, ranging from systemic to cellular to molecular levels. Generally, while biochemical indices indicated a stress signal much earlier than the more integrated behavioural indices, failure of the latter (indicating a tolerance limit and transition to pejus state) occurred much earlier than the other indices tending towards thermal extremities at both ends of the thermal spectrum.

AB The potential influence of diversity on ecosystem structure and function remains a topic of significant debate, especially for tropical forests where diversity can range widely. We used Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) methodology to establish forest dynamics plots in montane wet forest and lowland dry forest on Hawai'i Island. We compared the species diversity, tree density, basal area, biomass, and size class distributions between the two forest types. We then examined these variables across tropical forests within the CTFS network. Consistent with other island forests, the Hawai'i forests were characterized by low species richness and very high relative dominance. The two Hawai'i forests were floristically distinct, yet similar in species richness (15 vs. 21 species) and stem density (3078 vs. 3486/ha). While these forests were selected for their low invasive species cover relative to surrounding forests, both forests averaged 5->50% invasive species cover; ongoing removal will be necessary to reduce or prevent competitive impacts, especially from woody species. The montane wet forest had much larger trees, resulting in eightfold higher basal area and above-ground biomass. Across the CTFS network, the Hawaiian montane wet forest was similar to other tropical forests with respect to diameter distributions, density, and aboveground biomass, while the Hawai` i lowland dry forest was similar in density to tropical forests with much higher diversity. These findings suggest that forest structural variables can be similar across tropical forests independently of species richness. The inclusion of low-diversity Pacific Island forests in the CTFS network provides an similar to 80-fold range in species richness (15-1182 species), six-fold variation in mean annual rainfall (835-5272 mm yr(-1)) and 1.8-fold variation in mean annual temperature (16.0-28.4 degrees C). Thus, the Hawaiian forest plots expand the global forest plot network to enable testing of ecological theory for links among species diversity, environmental variation and ecosystem function.

AB Even though it is well known that the flora of Amazonia is severely under-documented, botanical research in the region has been stagnant for the past two decades or more. An exception to this trend has been the international collaboration in the state of Acre, Brazil. The objective of this study was to assess botanical progress in Southwestern Amazonia, specifically the evolution of our knowledge of the flora of the state of Acre five years after production of the first catalogue of its flora. Between 2006-2011, the Acre data-base recorded 2,110 determinations, and among these were 347 new records for Acre, representing an increase of 8.6% in the known flora, which as of 2011 comprised 4351 species. Of the new records, 6.6% (23) were new records for Brazil and 14.4% (50) represented genera new to Acre. The new records comprised 322 species of vascular plants and 22 of non-vascular plants. The most significant finding was that one of every six identifications was a new record for Acre; the total flora of Acre is estimated to be at about 8,000 species. Advances in documentation of the Acre flora have been achieved through institutional partnerships, attention to rescuing and "cleaning" data, mobilizing taxonomic specialists, distributing duplicates to herbaria with significant Amazon collections, and undertaking expeditions to regions of the state that were poorly known or unknown. Indeed, the botanical inventory of Amazonia overall and the management and conservation of the Amazon flora can be realized only through programs that are systematic, integrative and participatory. Every effort must be made to guarantee that the inventory of Amazonia proceeds at least as rapidly as deforestation and development. This necessarily means far greater investment in training, employing, and supporting the field work of productive taxonomists.

AB Deforestation in the tropical Andes is affecting ecological conditions of streams, and determination of how much forest should be retained is a pressing task for conservation, restoration and management strategies. We calculated and analyzed eight benthic metrics (structural, compositional and water quality indices) and a physical-chemical composite index with gradients of vegetation cover to assess the effects of deforestation on macroinvertebrate communities and water quality of 23 streams in southern Ecuadorian Andes. Using a geographical information system (GIS), we quantified vegetation cover at three spatial scales: the entire catchment, the riparian buffer of 30 m width extending the entire stream length, and the local scale defined for a stream reach of 100 m in length and similar buffer width. Macroinvertebrate and water quality metrics had the strongest relationships with vegetation cover at catchment and riparian scales, while vegetation cover did not show any association with the macroinvertebrate metrics at local scale. At catchment scale, the water quality metrics indicate that ecological condition of Andean streams is good when vegetation cover is over 70%. Further, macroinvertebrate community assemblages were more diverse and related in catchments largely covered by native vegetation (>70%). Our results suggest that retaining an important quantity of native vegetation cover within the catchments and a linkage between headwater and riparian forests help to maintain and improve stream biodiversity and water quality in Andean streams affected by deforestation. This research proposes that a strong regulation focused to the management of riparian buffers can be successful when decision making is addressed to conservation/restoration of Andean catchments.

AB In this paper we analyse the degree of concordance in species richness and taxonomic distinctness (diversity) patterns among different freshwater taxonomic groups in order to test three long held patterns described in Mexican freshwater biogeography: 1. The aquatic biota of Mexico includes two distinct faunas, a rich Neotropical component in the south and a south-eastern region and a less rich Nearctic component towards central and northern latitudes of the country. 2. A hotspot of species richness and diversity has been recorded in the Usumacinta, including the Yucatan Peninsula. 3. The presence of two distinct biotas in Mexico, an eastern one distributed along the Gulf of Mexico slope, and a western one associated to the Pacific versant. We use species richness and taxonomic distinctness to explore patterns of diversity and how these patterns change between zoogeographical regions. This paper points out a clear separation between Neotropical and Nearctic drainage basins but also between eastern (Gulf of Mexico) and western (Pacific) drainage basins. Present data gives additional empirical support from freshwater biota for three long held beliefs regarding distributional patterns of the Mexican biota. The neotropical basins of Mexico are generally host to a richest and more diversified fauna, that includes more families, genera and species, compared to the less rich and less diverse fauna in the nearctic basins.

AB Recent investigations have highlighted the dependence of Mediterranean forest production on spring rainfall. The current work introduces the concept of the start of the dry season (SDS) and performs a three-step analysis to determine the effect of SDS on Mediterranean forest production.
   Seven forest zones of Tuscany (Central Italy), which present differently pronounced Mediterranean features, are considered. First, a statistical analysis investigates the influence of spring water budget on forest Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) inter-annual variations during July August. The analysis is then extended to assess the impact of inter-annual SDS variability on forest gross primary production (GPP) simulated by a NDVI driven parametric model, modified C-Fix. These simulations lead to rank the considered forest types according to the relevance of SDS in regulating inter-annual GPP variations. The application of similar statistical analyses to detrended tree ring-width time series of typical Tuscany forests confirms the existence of an eco-climatic gradient in the functional relevance of SDS. The influence of SDS on tree growth is attenuated moving from Mediterranean arid to temperate humid environments. These findings are examined and interpreted from an eco-physiological viewpoint taking into consideration the peculiarity of Mediterranean forest ecosystems. Next, relevant implications are discussed in view of the possible consequences of ongoing climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The loss of forest biodiversity via anthropogenic disturbance is severe in tropical countries and its consequences to ecological functions are of global concern. Selective logging is one of the main causes of tropical forest degradation, and its ecological impacts often result from the construction of road networks such as skid trails, logging roads and log yards. However, the effects of such narrow road clearings on forest-dependent species and associated ecological functions have rarely been studied. The present study therefore aimed to assess the impacts of such clearings on dung burial and secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles. The abundance of all functional guilds and the total biomass of dung beetles were drastically low at road clearings, but guild composition was only significantly different between the forest interior and log yards. Dung burial rates decreased with canopy openness, where 40% of dung remained unburied at logging roads and log yards. However, beads (seed mimics) in the dung piles were buried deeper and more frequently in log yards than the forest interior. In contrast, horizontal seed-removal distance was longer in the forest interior than at all road clearing sites. Reduced dung burial rates, and deeper but shorter, seed removal in clearings implies a negative effect of road clearings on the efficiency of secondary seed dispersal and other ecological functions of dung beetles. The imposition of limits on the number and size of logging road networks would be effective for retaining the ecological functions performed by the diverse forest-dependent species after logging.

AB Restoration of tropical forest depended in large part on seed dispersal by fruit-eating animals that transported seeds into planted forest patches. We tested effectiveness of dispersal agents as revealed by established recruits of tree and shrub species that bore seeds dispersed by birds, bats, or both. We documented restoration of dispersal processes over the first 76 months of experimental restoration in southern Mexico. Mixed-model repeated-measures randomized-block ANOVAs of seedlings recruited into experimental controls and mixed-species plantings from late-secondary and mature forest indicated that bats and birds played different roles in the first years of a restoration process. Bats dispersed pioneer tree and shrub species to slowly regenerating grassy areas, while birds mediated recruitment of later-successional species into planted stands of trees and to a lesser extent into controls. Of species of pioneer trees and shrubs established in plots, seven were primarily dispersed by birds, three by bats and four by both birds and bats. Of later-successional species recruited past the seedling stage, 13 were of species primarily dispersed by birds, and six were of species dispersed by both birds and bats. No later-successional species primarily dispersed by bats established in control or planted plots. Establishment of recruited seedlings was ten-fold higher under cover of planted trees than in grassy controls. Even pre-reproductive trees drew fruit-eating birds and the seeds that they carried from nearby forest, and provided conditions for establishment of shade-tolerant tree species. Overall, after 76 months of cattle exclusion, 94% of the recruited shrubs and trees in experimental plots were of species that we did not plant.

TI How Does Conversion of Natural Tropical Rainforest Ecosystems Affect

AB Uganda's forests are globally important for their conservation values but are under pressure from increasing human population and consumption. In this study, we examine how conversion of natural forest affects soil bacterial and fungal communities. Comparisons in paired natural forest and human-converted sites among four locations indicated that natural forest soils consistently had higher pH, organic carbon, nitrogen, and calcium, although variation among sites was large. Despite these differences, no effect on the diversity of dominant taxa for either bacterial or fungal communities was detected, using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Composition of fungal communities did generally appear different in converted sites, but surprisingly, we did not observe a consistent pattern among sites. The spatial distribution of some taxa and community composition was associated with soil pH, organic carbon, phosphorus and sodium, suggesting that changes in soil communities were nuanced and require more robust metagenomic methods to understand the various components of the community. Given the close geographic proximity of the paired sampling sites, the similarity between natural and converted sites might be due to continued dispersal between treatments. Fungal communities showed greater environmental differentiation than bacterial communities, particularly according to soil pH. We detected biotic homogenization in converted ecosystems and substantial contribution of beta-diversity to total diversity, indicating considerable geographic structure in soil biota in these forest communities. Overall, our results suggest that soil microbial communities are relatively resilient to forest conversion and despite a substantial and consistent change in the soil environment, the effects of conversion differed widely among sites. The substantial difference in soil chemistry, with generally lower nutrient quantity in converted sites, does bring into question, how long this resilience will last.

TI The world's biogeographical regions revisited: global patterns of
   endemism in Tipulidae (Diptera)

DE Areas of endemism; biogeography; VNDM; Tipulidae
ID SOUTH-AMERICA; AREAS; SEARCH; TAXA
AB This paper explores the distributional data of 4,224 Tipulidae (Insecta: Diptera) species to search for endemism patterns in a worldwide scale and to test the extent to which the global patterns of endemism of the group fit into previously proposed regionalization schemes, particularly Wallace's system and recent revisions of it. Large scale areas of endemism are assessed using the grid-based method implemented in VNDM. VNDM depends on the prior definition of the grid size for analysis, but a criterion for choosing beforehand a particular grid size is not clear. The same holds for the choice of the level of similarity in species composition selected for the calculation of consensus areas. In our study, we developed a methodological approach that helped defining objective criteria for choosing suitable values for these critical variables. Large-scale areas of endemism around the globe are identified and ranked according to endemicity levels: 1-West Palaearctic, 2-Nearctic, 3-East Palaearctic-Oriental, 4-West North America, 5-Australia, 6-Neotropical, 7-Sub-Saharan Africa, 8-Palaearctic, and 9-Middle East. Our main conclusion is that there are still some limitations in applying biogeographical classifications proposed mostly on the basis of vertebrate distribution to other taxonomic groups, such as the Tipulidae. While there is a general congruence of the broad-scale areas of endemism of tipulids with previously proposed regionalization schemes, for some areas, the sharpness of boundaries between traditional regions is not so acute, due to a great level of overlap of part of its biotic elements.

AB Throughout the Amazon region, the age of forests regenerating on previously deforested land is determined, in part, by the periods of active land use prior to abandonment and the frequency of reclearance of regrowth, both of which can be quantified by comparing time-series of Landsat sensor data. Using these time-series of near annual data from 1973-2011 for an area north of Manaus (in Amazonas state), from 1984-2010 for south of Santarem (Parastate) and 1984-2011 near Machadinho d'Oeste (Rondonia state), the changes in the area of primary forest, non-forest and secondary forest were documented from which the age of regenerating forests, periods of active land use and the frequency of forest reclearance were derived. At Manaus, and at the end of the time-series, over 50% of regenerating forests were older than 16 years, whilst at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste, 57% and 41% of forests respectively were aged 6-15 years, with the remainder being mostly younger forests. These differences were attributed to the time since deforestation commenced but also the greater frequencies of reclearance of forests at the latter two sites with short periods of use in the intervening periods. The majority of clearance for agriculture was also found outside of protected areas. The study suggested that a) the history of clearance and land use should be taken into account when protecting deforested land for the purpose of restoring both tree species diversity and biomass through natural regeneration and b) a greater proportion of the forested landscape should be placed under protection, including areas of regrowth.

AB Canopy gaps created by wind-throw events, or blowdowns, create a complex mosaic of forest patches varying in disturbance intensity and recovery in the Central Amazon. Using field and remote sensing data, we investigated the shortterm (four-year) effects of large (>2000 m(2)) blowdown gaps created during a single storm event in January 2005 near Manaus, Brazil, to study (i) how forest structure and composition vary with disturbance gradients and (ii) whether tree diversity is promoted by niche differentiation related to wind-throw events at the landscape scale. In the forest area affected by the blowdown, tree mortality ranged from 0 to 70%, and was highest on plateaus and slopes. Less impacted areas in the region affected by the blowdown had overlapping characteristics with a nearby unaffected forest in tree density (583 +/- 46 trees ha(-1)) (mean +/- 699% Confidence Interval) and basal area (26.7 +/- 2.4 m(2) ha(-1)). Highly impacted areas had tree density and basal area as low as 120 trees ha(-1) and 14.9 m 2 ha(-1), respectively. In general, these structural measures correlated negatively with an index of tree mortality intensity derived from satellite imagery. Four years after the blowdown event, differences in size-distribution, fraction of resprouters, floristic composition and species diversity still correlated with disturbance measures such as tree mortality and gap size. Our results suggest that the gradients of wind disturbance intensity encompassed in large blowdown gaps (>2000 m(2)) promote tree diversity. Specialists for particular disturbance intensities existed along the entire gradient. The existence of species or genera taking an intermediate position between undisturbed and gap specialists led to a peak of rarefied richness and diversity at intermediate disturbance levels. A diverse set of species differing widely in requirements and recruitment strategies forms the initial post-disturbance cohort, thus lending a high resilience towards wind disturbances at the community level.

AB Fragmentation and loss of extensive populations of habitat-forming macroalgae have occurred worldwide as a result of human-driven coastal habitat degradation. Contributing to such declines may be the influence of opportunistic algae, which quickly respond to stresses such as nutrient loading and warmer sea temperatures. The early life stages of fucoids are particularly likely to be affected by the combined impacts of altered physical conditions and increased competition with stress-tolerant species. In this study, we examined the interactions between the early life stages of the intertidal fucoid Hormosira banksii and fast-growing, opportunistic green algae Ulva spp. Through a series of laboratory experiments, we tested (1) the impact of Ulva spp. on the settlement of H. banksil zygotes; (2) the impact of Ulva spp. on the rates of post-settlement survival and growth of H. banksii germlings under ambient and increased levels of temperature and nutrient concentration; (3) the interactions between the 2 taxa under grazing pressure of the abundant intertidal trochid Lunella smaragdus. Ulva spp. impaired the settlement of H. banksil zygotes, through both physical and chemical mechanisms, and the growth of the germlings; but Ulva spp. was also preferentially consumed by the grazers, thereby indirectly facilitating H. banksii.. In addition, Ulva spp. responded positively to increased temperature and nutrients, while we found an indication that post-settlement survival of H. banksii may decline with warmer waters. These findings augment extensive field-based research addressing the loss of algal beds and shed light on biotic and physical mechanisms affecting the most critical phases of the life cycle of a key habitat-forming species.

AB Forest fragmentation affects animal population dynamics mainly by loss of habitat and disruption of animal movement. Lizard assemblages are affected by environmental changes, but, depending on their ecological needs, some species might be more vulnerable than others. The southern Amazon suffers accelerated anthropic actions replacing natural environments by farmland (crops and pasture). This region is considerably drier than most of the northern Amazon, with stational semi-deciduous forests fragmented and isolated by pasture, and crops to a lesser extent. Here we report data on lizard assemblages using semi-deciduous forests, forest edge and the surrounding pasture in the southern Amazon in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Lizards were collected in 21 forest fragments (41 to 7,035 ha) surrounded by pasture; using pitfall traps placed on a degradation gradient - from pasture inwards forest fragment (up to 200 m). We collected 242 individuals (14 species, seven families) in 6,300 trap-days. The pattern of species occurrence was largely nested and this nesting was associated with three habitat guilds (generalist, edge-tolerant, and forest species). Although there was no obvious fragmentation effect on lizards diversity community-wise, Hoplocercus spinosus, Bachia dorbignyi, Micrablepharus maximiliani and Kentropyx calcarta were more vulnerable to such effects than all other ten species collected. We verified that assemblages inhabiting pasture and forest edge are a nested subset of assemblages from the forest core. The remnant native vegetation is not distributed homogeneously and lizards species can persist in different parts of the landscape, therefore we recommend the protection of forest remnants as an important conservation action for lizards of the southern Amazon.

AB In rural areas of Mexico, the native "escamolera" ant (Liometopum apiculatum Mayr) is socioeconomically important. However, this ant is being exploited unsustainably, and studies of habitat of this species in central Mexico are nonexistent. During spring-summer 2012, fourteen habitat variables were evaluated, habitat use by the ant was identified and its nest density was estimated. Data were analyzed with stepwise logistic regression, correspondence analysis, Chisquare and simultaneous Bonferroni confidence intervals analyses, and the minimum Akaike Information Criteria. The variables that better described the presence of the ant were width of the agave pineapple, percentage of agaves infested with scale insects, woody plant-cacti-agave density, soil cover and terrain slope. The probability of finding nests increased (odds ratio>1) when the width of the agave pineapple and the percentage of agaves with scale insects increased. In contrast, the probability decreased (odds ratio<1) when the slope of the terrain and bare soil increased. The ant selected (p <= 0.05) flat terrain (0-10 % slope) and southwest-facing slopes, but avoided microphyllous shrub habitats, moderately flat terrain (1-20 % slope), southeast-facing slopes and terrain of the lowest available elevation (1940-2050 m). Soil cover at nests sites was composed of grasses (27.5 %), bare soil (24.5 %), rock (20.2 %), herbs (20.2 %) and shrubs (7.6 %). The nest density was higher (alpha=0.05) in the moderate level of disturbance (11.9 nests ha(-1)). The ant did not use habitat components according to their availability, avoided bare soil, land with low elevation and selected the slopes with southwest exposure.

AB It is still unclear whether simple niche-derived or neutrality-derived statistical models is better to quantify the experimental species-abundance distribution pattern (SAD) for microarthropod communities. In the present study, by utilizing the sampling diversity data of three microarthropod taxonomic groups (oribatids, collembolans and mesostigmatids), my objectives are to test and compare five alternative statistical models for fitting empirical microarthropod SAD curves, including neutral, Zipf, broken stick, niche preemption and geometric models. Fitting power of the models were evaluated using chi(2) test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). my results showed that, for the SAD of the whole microarthropod community and mesostigmatid group, Zipf model is the best model identified by AIC criteria. For oribatid and collembolan SAD curves, geometric model is the most favored one. However, all the models yielded significant difference between the expected and observed SAD patterns over different taxonomic groups, as indicated by both chi(2) and K-S tests. Thus, either neutral and niche models could explain SAD patterns of microarthropod communities perfectly. In summary, the synergy of different mechanisms and the development of hybrid models and the proper transformation might be of some helps to remove the observed significant difference for microarthropod communities.

AB In the Himalayan states of India, with increasing population and activities, large areas of forested land are being converted into other land-use features. There is a definite cause and effect relationship between changing practice for development and changes in land use. So, an estimation of land use dynamics and a futuristic trend pattern is essential. A combination of geospatial and statistical techniques were applied to assess the present and future land use/land cover scenario of Gangtok, the subHimalayan capital of Sikkim. Multi-temporal satellite imageries of the Landsat series were used to map the changes in land use of Gangtok from 1990 to 2010. Only three major land use classes (built-up area and bare land, step cultivated area, and forest) were considered as the most dynamic land use practices of Gangtok. The conventional supervised classification, and spectral indices-based thresholding using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) were applied along with the accuracy assessments. Markov modelling was applied for prediction of land use/land cover change and was validated. SAVI provides the most accurate estimate, i.e., the difference between predicted and actual data is minimal. Finally, a combination of Markov modelling and SAVI was used to predict the probable land-use scenario in Gangtok in 2020 AD, which indicted that more forest areas will be converted for step cultivation by the year 2020.

AB Plants are able to cope with herbivores by inducing defensive traits or growth responses that allow them to reduce or avoid the impact of herbivores. Since above- and belowground herbivores differ substantially in life-history traits, for example feeding types, and their spatial distribution, it is likely that they induce different responses in plants. Moreover, strong interactive effects on defense and plant growth are expected when above-and belowground herbivores are jointly present. The strengths and directions of these responses have been scarcely addressed in the literature. Using Taraxacum officinale, the root-feeding nematode Meloidogyne hapla and the locust Schistocerca gregaria as a model species, we examined to what degree above-and belowground herbivory affect (1) plant growth responses, (2) the induction of plant defensive traits, that is, leaf trichomes, and (3) changes in dispersal-related seed traits and seed germination. We compared the performance of plants originating from different populations to address whether plant responses are conserved across putative different genotypes. Overall, aboveground herbivory resulted in increased plant biomass. Root herbivory had no effect on plant growth. Plants exposed to the two herbivores showed fewer leaf trichomes than plants challenged only by one herbivore and consequently experienced greater aboveground herbivory. In addition, herbivory had effects that reached beyond the individual plant by modifying seed morphology, producing seeds with longer pappus, and germination success.

AB 1. Small population size in plants is often associated with decreased fruit set through lower pollinator visitation and reduced offspring fitness as a result of inbreeding. Whether the potentially negative impacts of small population size are realized may be potentially influenced by the behaviour and ecology of pollinators.
   2. Here, we investigate changes in both guild composition and pollinator behaviour with plant population size in the bird-pollinated Anigozanthos flavidus (Haemodoraceae) and the consequences for fruit set and seed germinability. We used a germination stimulant to reduce the potentially confounding affects of interpopulation variation in dormancy when quantifying seed germinability.
   3. All populations were visited in small numbers by western spinebills, while the behaviourally dominant New Holland honeyeaters only visited large populations. Fruit set was extremely high (mean = 96.4 +/- 0.6%) regardless of population size.
   4. The percentage of foraging bouts interrupted by aggressive interactions tended to be less in small plant populations. The percentage of interrupted foraging bouts was as high as 31% in some populations, suggesting that aggression may frequently promote pollen movement. Western spinebills tended to visit fewer stems per plant than New Holland honeyeaters, a behaviour that potentially favours greater outcrossing.
   5. There was no relationship between seed germinability or seeds produced per capsule and plant population size, suggesting that the foraging behaviour of western spinebills provides sufficient pollinator services in small populations to mitigate the potential reduction in seed production and germinability.
   6. Our findings highlight that, even within a pollinator guild, differences in behaviour can have important implications for the fitness of plants in small populations, with the potential for some pollinators to provide unexpected levels of resilience.

AB 1. Habitat structure is important in explaining species diversity patterns for many animal groups. If we could map habitat structure over large spatial scales, we could use habitat structure-species diversity (HS-SD) relationships to model species diversity and inform conservation planning and management. Traditional approaches for measuring habitat structure cannot be applied over entire landscapes, but remote sensing tools are now able to overcome this limitation. Here, we explore the potential of airborne lidar for the assessment and monitoring of animal species diversity in terrestrial environments.
   2. We review the habitat attributes commonly recorded in the study of HS-SD relationships and the spatial scale of their measurement, in papers published between 1960 and 2013. We also gather evidence for the use of lidar to make relevant measurements at similar scales.
   3. Eight out of 15 attributes of habitat structure commonly used in published studies relate to the vertical dimension of habitat. The core strength of lidar is that it is a vertical profiler, and this technology can be used to derive estimates of all but one of these structural attributes. Lidar can also be used to improve the measurement of the four commonly used attributes focusing on the horizontal heterogeneity of habitat patches. The spatial grain and extent of HS-SD studies is usually within the operational capability of airborne lidar; when a vertical measure of habitat structure has been employed, this is true in 84% of published studies. The potential efficacy of lidar in this field of biodiversity studies is underlined by several published examples of lidar modelling of animal species diversity.
   4. We conclude that lidar remote sensing is fit for the purpose of biodiversity assessment and monitoring through its ability to characterize habitat structure, a key driver of animal species diversity, over large spatial scales. We advocate wider application of lidar-based HS-SD indicators to help tackle the current biodiversity crisis. In combination with other remote sensing products, these indicators may support the implementation and monitoring of environmental legislation, inform gap analyses and the planning of management actions for protected areas and species, and drive greater synergy with forest-based climate change mitigation.

AB Ants are highly influential organisms in terrestrial ecosystems, including the tallgrass prairie, one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America. Through their tunneling, ants affect soil properties and resource availability for animals and plants. Ants also have important ecological roles as consumers of plant tissue and seeds. In the last several decades, various organizations, agencies, and agricultural producers have attempted to create wildlife habitat or reduce soil erosion by seeding thousands of hectares of bare cropland in the central United States with tallgrass prairie seed mixes. Although initially, monitoring of these restorations and of unplowed prairie remnants focused on plants and birds, in recent years the response of invertebrates such as ants has increasingly been the subject of research. An understanding of tallgrass prairie ant communities can help land managers and scientists better monitor the ecological condition of tallgrass prairie and guide management and restoration efforts. Here I review our current knowledge of ant species found within tallgrass prairie, their ecological roles, and their response to management.

AB Scarabaeinae dung beetles are indicator insects used in the evaluation of the ecological effects caused by changes in habitat structure and ecosystem integrity resulting from environmental degradation. We compared dung beetle diversity in conserved restinga forests (coastal tropical moist broadleaf forest) and in reforested areas of various ages during the rainy and dry seasons, on the coast of Paraiba State, Brazil. A total of 3,634 individuals comprising 14 species were collected. In the reforested areas there was a gradual increase in species abundance relative to the area's age, but in the conserved restinga the abundance of individuals was 10-20 times higher than that recorded in areas of recent reforestation. The highest species richness was found in the conserved restinga and in the oldest reforested area (16 years old) during the rainy season. During the dry season, when environmental conditions do not seem to favor adult survival, most of the species were found in the conserved restinga forest. The dung beetle community structure was related to the increases in habitat heterogeneity in the successional processes of the reforested areas. Our results suggest that reforested areas act as a source of and refuge for dung beetle species.

AB Small holy woods protected for centuries for cultural purposes may have conservation value for small animals, despite their tiny sizes. To verify this hypothesis we used transects to quantified ants in a small sacred forest in a hot Mediterranean region, and the impact of cattle presence in part of it. We hypothesized that it should be mainly inhabited by species having a northern temperate distribution. We detected ants belonging to 39 species including 15 new species for the region. As expected, the majority of them had Palearctic distribution, while others were endemic to the Levant. All of them were known to live in regions with temperate climate. The presence of cattle did not statistically impact on either the number of species or on their biodiversity indices: the average number of ant species per transect was 21 +/- A 4.6 (SD) in the presence of cows and 23 +/- A 4.8 in their absence. As hypothesized, the main impact of cattle was on community composition: in the presence of cattle more species were specialists for, or tolerant to, disturbed habitats, resulting in a relatively low Jaccard coefficient of similarity between the two parts of the forest (S-j = 0.56). In conclusion, this small sacred forest, protected for centuries, facilitates the conservation of a great number of shade-loving ant species in a hot region by providing suitable habitats, but the presence of livestock reduces the conservation value of the forest by promoting ant species tolerant to disturbed habitats.

AB Anthropogenic habitat modifications, including conversion of forest to agricultural production cause losses of native species. In this study we examined the losses suffered by ant communities in relation to the intensity of management in cocoa plantations established in former tropical forest. An extensive sampling protocol consisting of pitfall trapping, leaf litter sampling, soil sampling and hand sampling was used to characterize ant species richness and composition in the native forest and compare it with three cocoa farms differing in their management intensity. Species richness was negatively correlated with management intensity and differed greatly between management practices and the forest. Two subfamilies (Myrmicinae and Amblyoponinae) showed a significant negative correlation with agricultural intensification probably because their species are constrained to living in forest like habitat. The species composition differed greatly between management practices and the forest. Intensively and moderately managed cocoa plantations were most dissimilar to the forest. In contrast, forest ants were well represented in the least intensively managed plantation. Overall, the findings of this study show that only slightly managed cocoa plantations sustain an ant diversity that comes close to that of the forest. This also holds true for cocoa plantations on former agricultural, and thus previously heavily used, land. The findings may help in the conservation of biodiversity as management practices most likely to sustain forest like ant communities have been identified.

AB Community ecologists use functional groups based on the rarely tested assumption that within-group responses to ecological processes are similar and thus members are functionally equivalent. However, recent research suggests that functional equivalency may break down with human impacts. We tested the equivalency assumption and model predictions of responses to simulated human alterations in nutrients and large herbivores for two models of coral reef algae, the Relative Dominance Model (RDM) and the Functional Group Model (FGM). Results of both mesocosm and field experiments using assembled communities were compared to model predictions, and within- and between-group variability were assessed. Both models' predictions of group response to herbivory matched experimental outcomes, but only the RDM predicted response to nutrients. However, within-group variability was dramatic, because the RDM grouped species with opposite responses to herbivory and the FGM grouped species with unique responses to nutrients. These heterogeneous responses resulted in loss of information and masked strong interactions between herbivory and nutrients that were not included in the models. As humans continue to impact major ecological processes in ecosystems globally, we postulate that functional-group models may need to be reformulated to account for shifting baselines.

AB Loss of native vegetation cover is thought to be a major driver of declines in pollination success worldwide. However, it is not well known whether reducing the fragmentation of remaining vegetation can ameliorate these negative effects. We tested the independent effects of composition vs. configuration on the reproductive success of a keystone tropical forest herb (Heliconia tortuosa). To do this we designed a large-scale mensurative experiment that independently varied connected forest-patch size (configuration) and surrounding amount of forest (composition). In each patch, we tested whether pollen tubes, fruit, and seed set were associated with these landscape variables. We also captured hummingbirds as an indication of pollinator availability in a subset of patches according to the same design. We found evidence for an effect of configuration on seed set of H. tortuosa, but not on other aspects of plant reproduction; proportion of seeds produced increased 40% across the gradient in patch size we observed (0.64 to >1300 ha), independent of the amount of forest in the surrounding landscape at both local and landscape scales. We also found that the availability of pollinators was dependent upon forest configuration; hummingbird capture rates increased three and one-half times across the patch size gradient, independent of forest amount. Finally, pollinator availability was strongly positively correlated with seed set. We hypothesize that the effects of configuration on plant fitness that we observed are due to reduced pollen quality resulting from altered hummingbird availability and/or movement behavior. Our results suggest that prioritizing larger patches of tropical forest may be particularly important for conservation of this species.

AB Aim of study: Our objective was to find habitat associations at a microhabitat level for two endemic birds in a Chilean temperate forest (biodiversity "hotspots"), in order to integrate biodiversity into forest planning.
   Area of study: Nahuelbuta Range, Chile.
   Material and methods: The two birds studied were Scelorchilus rubecula (Chucao Tapaculo) and Scytalopus magellanicus (Magellanic Tapaculo), both belonging to the Rhinocryptidae family. Presence or absence of the two species was sampled in 57 census spots. Habitat was categorized according to presence/absence results. We assessed the influence of abiotic variables (altitude, exposure, slope) and vegetation structure (percentage of understory cover, number of strata) using a statistical cluster analysis.
   Main results: The two bird species selected the habitat. Most frequent presence was detected at a range of 600-1100 masl, but Magellanic Tapaculo was associated to more protected sites in terms of vegetation structure (50-75% for understory cover and 2-3 strata). Slope was the most relevant abiotic variable in habitat selection due to its linkage to vegetation traits in this area.
   Research highlights: Our results can help managers to integrate biodiversity (endemic fauna species) into forest planning by preserving certain traits of the vegetation as part of a habitat (at a microhabitat level) selected by the fauna species. That planning should be implemented with both an adequate wood harvesting cuts system and specific silvicultural treatments.

AB Early models of plant defense conceived resistance and tolerance to herbivore damage as mutually exclusive strategies. Support for this idea has been equivocal and studies on these two strategies are still needed to understand the evolution of defenses in natural populations. In Arabidopsis lyrata, the production of trichomes, a documented resistance trait, has been associated with a fitness cost in the absence of herbivores. We examined whether trichome production is also associated with reduced tolerance to simulated herbivore damage.
   We conducted a field experiment in a natural Swedish population of A. lyrata where we inflicted leaf (0 vs. 50% of the area of each leaf removed) and inflorescence damage (0 vs. 50% of inflorescences removed) to trichome-producing and glabrous plants in a factorial design. We examined the response (survival, growth and reproduction) of the plants to the imposed damage over 2 years.
   Trichome-producing plants were not less tolerant than glabrous plants to simulated herbivore damage (no significant morph x leaf damage or morph x inflorescence damage interactions). Inflorescence and leaf damage had independent negative effects on the performance of damaged plants. Leaf damage reduced rosette size the year of damage, but effects on reproductive output in the year of damage, and on survival and reproductive performance the following year were weak and not statistically significant. Inflorescence damage significantly reduced the number of flowers, fruits and seeds the year of damage, but not in the following year. Irrespective of morph, the study population was more tolerant to leaf than to inflorescence damage. The results indicated no trade-off between trichome production and tolerance, suggesting that these two defense mechanisms have the potential to evolve independently in this A. lyrata population.

AB The margay (Leopardus wiedii) is a small felid currently facing critical population declines in many regions throughout its Central-South American range. This species is thought to be the most arboreal of the New World felids, which has led to concern that it may be especially sensitive to deforestation and habitat destruction. Due to the margay's elusive nature, little is known about its ecology and natural history. In the present study, a camera trap survey was used to investigate whether margay abundance and activity patterns are correlated to vegetational structure in a mid-elevation forest in the eastern Andes of Ecuador. Structural habitat variables were measured at each camera station to assess whether these factors were predictive of margay camera "trap" success. The data show that canopy cover, average distance to nearest trees, and distance to forest edge were significant predictors of margay trap success, although compositional analysis indicated that the highest margay presence was in areas of 51-75% canopy cover rather than the very densest locations. These results highlight the importance of curbing habitat destruction and deforestation as part of efforts to reverse the margay's declining population trend and protect its habitat.

AB South America spans about 44 degrees latitude, covers almost 18 million km(2), and is second only to Africa in continental mammal species richness. In spite of this richness, research on the status of this fauna and on the nature and magnitude of contemporary threats remains limited. Distilling threats to this diverse fauna at a continental scale is challenging, in part because of the limited availability of rigorous studies. Recognizing this constraint, we summarize key threats to small mammals in South America, emphasizing the roles of habitat loss and degradation, direct persecution, and the increasing threat of climate change. We focus on three regional 'case studies': the tropical Andes, Amazonia and adjacent lowland regions, and the southern temperate region. We close with a brief summary of recent findings at our long-term research site in north-central Chile as they pertain to projected threats to this fauna. Habitat alteration is a pervasive threat that has been magnified by market forces and globalization (e.g. extensive agricultural development in Amazonia), and threatens increasing numbers of populations and species. Climate change poses even greater threats, from changes in rainfall and runoff regimes and resulting changes in vegetative structure and composition to secondary influences on fire dynamics. It is likely that many changes have yet to be recognized, but existing threats suggest that the future may bring dramatic changes in the distribution of many mammal taxa, although it is not clear if key habitat elements (vegetation) will respond as rapidly as climatic factors, leading to substantial uncertainty. Climate change is likely to result in 'winners' and 'losers' but available information precludes detailed assessment of which species are likely to fall into which category. In the absence of long-term monitoring and applied research to characterize these threats more accurately, and to develop strategies to reduce their impacts, managers already are being faced with daunting challenges. As the line between 'pure' and 'applied' research blurs in the face of converging interests of scientists and society we hope that solutions to these critical issues will be incorporated in addressing anticipated conservation crises.

TI Threat evaluation for biodiversity conservation of forest ecosystems

   FRAMEWORK; HOTSPOTS; CRITERIA
AB Up-scaling the evaluation of threat status of biodiversity from species to ecosystem level has remained for long a research challenge in global conservation science. To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5 km x 5 km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems. Finally, identification of ecosystems especially those facing increasing extinction risks, as attempted in the present study, can help in devising an appropriate policy and management agenda for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

AB Individual species are distributed inhomogeneously over space and time, yet, within large communities of species, aggregated patterns of biodiversity seem to display nearly universal behaviour. Neutral models assume that an individual's demographic prospects are independent of its species identity. They have successfully predicted certain static, time-independent patterns. But they have generally failed to predict temporal patterns, such as species ages or population dynamics. We construct a new, multispecies framework incorporating competitive differences between species, and assess the impact of this competition on static and dynamic patterns of biodiversity. We solve this model exactly for the special case of a Red Queen hypothesis, where fitter species are continually arising. The model predicts more realistic species ages than neutral models, without greatly changing predictions for static species abundance distributions. Our modelling approach may allow users to incorporate a broad range of ecological mechanisms.

AB Theoretical studies have shown that coexistence between competitors can be favored in a spatially heterogeneous environment by a number of mechanisms, which ultimately allow the expression of persistent or transitory variation in species competitive abilities, colonization, or reproduction. Four distinctive paradigms to model metacommunities have been identified according to assumptions about the biology of the species and essential aspects of the environment. Missing from these are mechanisms of coexistence that can arise from the dispersal process itself without explicit spatial heterogeneity or biological trade-offs. These mechanisms have only recently received attention, but they may be common in marine communities and other systems in which dispersal is obligatory and modulated by the physical environment. We investigate coexistence in spatially homogeneous metacommunities where there is no partitioning of resources, no competition colonization trade-off, and no possibility of source sink dynamics. Coexistence is shown to be possible through three distinct mechanisms related to the dispersal process itself. Firstly, in a neutral scenario, inclusion of temporal variability in the connectivity matrix, emulating an intrinsic attribute of ocean character and other turbulent environments, can promote the invasion of an equally matched competitor and, in a hierarchical competition scenario, the persistence of an otherwise unviable, inferior competitor (the dispersal variability mechanism). Secondly, a sufficiently large difference in the shape of the time-independent dispersal kernels of the two species, which may result from differences in larval-release timing, buoyancy, or behavior, can produce stable coexistence in the center of their shared range (the dispersal-shape mechanism). Thirdly, asymmetry in the dispersal process due to biased advection renders the metapopulation model reactive,, such that small variations in the upstream abundances can be sufficient for the subordinate species to stably persist (the dispersal-bias mechanism). These results demonstrate that a subordinate species may persist by occupying a dispersal niche that differs sufficiently from that of the dominant species. Further theoretical research is necessary to develop simple empirical tests for these and other dispersal-based coexistence mechanisms.

AB Urbanisation is considered an important driver of current biodiversity loss, but the underlying causes are not fully understood. It is generally assumed that this loss reflects the fact that most organisms do not tolerate well the environmental alterations associated with urbanisation. Nevertheless, current evidence is inconclusive and the alternative that the biodiversity loss is the result of random mechanisms has never been evaluated. Analysing changes in abundance between urbanised environments and their nonurbanised surroundings of > 800 avian species from five continents, we show here that although random processes account for part of the species loss associated with urbanisation, much of the loss is associated with a lack of appropriate adaptations of most species for exploiting resources and avoiding risks of the urban environments. These findings have important conservation implications because the extinction of species with particular features should have higher impact on biodiversity and ecosystem function than a random loss.

This study synthesizes data from manipulative studies and from studies contrasting ecosystem processes in different vegetation microsites (that is, shrub or herbaceous canopy versus intercanopy microsites), to assess how changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 affect biogeochemical cycles by altering plant and microbial physiology and ecosystem structure. Further, we explore how ecosystem structure impacts on biogeochemical cycles differ across a climate gradient. We found that: (1) our ability to project ecological responses to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 is limited by a dearth of manipulative studies, and by a lack of measurements in those studies that can explain biogeochemical changes, (2) changes in ecosystem structure will impact biogeochemical cycling, with decreasing pools and fluxes of C and N if vegetation canopy microsites were to decline, and (3) differences in biogeochemical cycling between microsites are predictable with a simple aridity index (MAP/MAT), where the relative difference in pools and fluxes of C and N between vegetation canopy and intercanopy microsites is positively correlated with aridity. We conclude that if climate change alters ecosystem structure, it will strongly impact biogeochemical cycles, with increasing aridity leading to greater heterogeneity in biogeochemical cycling among microsites. Additional long-term manipulative experiments situated across dry shrublands are required to better predict climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycling in deserts.

AB 1. Deterministic theories predict that local communities assemble from a regional species pool based on niche differences, thus by plant functional adaptations. We tested whether functional traits can also explain patterns in species dominance among the suite of co-occurring species.
   2. We predicted that along a gradient of secondary succession, the main driver of species dominance changes from environmental filtering in the relatively harsh (dry and hot) early successional conditions, towards increased competitive interactions and limiting similarity in later successional conditions (when light is limited).
   3. We used the Kurtosis (K) (a measure of peakedness) of the functional trait distribution of secondary forest communities in high-diversity tropical rain forest in Chiapas, Mexico. The forests ranged 1-25 years in age, and we used eight functional leaf traits related to a plants' carbon, water and heat balance. We calculated the functional trait distribution based on species dominance, where trait values were weighted by species' relative basal area, as well as based on species presence, all species counting once. 'K-ratio' was subsequently computed by dividing kurtosis based on species dominance by kurtosis based on species presence. If the K-ratio is high, the dominant species are functionally similar and we interpreted this as environmentally driven functional convergence allowing species to become dominant. If the K-ratio is small, dominant species are a functionally dissimilar subset of the species present and we interpreted this as competitively driven functional divergence allowing species to become dominant.
   4. We found that in early succession, dominant species represent a functionally narrow subset of species with similar traits, and in late succession, dominant species increasingly represent a wide subset of the species present. This trend was found for traits that reflect photosynthetic performance and light capture, and indicates increased competition for light with succession. No trend was found for traits that indicate defence against herbivory, suggesting no successional changes in herbivore pressure.
   5. Synthesis. This is one of the first studies showing that drivers of species dominance change along a gradient of secondary succession. During the early successional time window we evaluated, the importance of environmental filtering as a driving force fades away rapidly, and the importance of niche partitioning for species dominance starts to emerge.

AB We examined if smallholders that immigrated to the Amazon over the last 40 years (highway-era families) and households with historical ties to the region (rubber-era families) adopt different livelihood activities and land-use/land-cover (LULC) patterns, in four communities along the Tapajs River in the Brazilian Amazon. Using quantitative data, we characterized three portfolios of livelihood activities, each associated to different LULC. Both rubber-era and highway-era families practice a wide range of activities from all portfolios; however, families that have been in the region for several generations tend to adopt traditional activities (e.g., fishing, non-timber forest product gathering and sales), while recently settled families tend to practice agrarian activities more intensively (e.g., cattle ranching, sale of non-native crops). We then draw on qualitative data to examine some of the underlying reasons for these differences. While recognizing that livelihoods are complex systems with many influential factors, we reflect on some of the overlooked drivers of livelihood and LULC choices such as knowledge, visions of development, and the immaterial value and symbolic meaning of resources. We also reflect on how they shape intended land management choices and relate to household settlement histories. The implications for regional resource-use planning and future research are mentioned.

AB Short-term nitrous oxide (N2O) pulse emissions caused by precipitation account for a considerable portion of the annual N2O emissions and are greatly influenced by soil nitrogen (N) dynamics. However, in Chinese semiarid temperate steppes, the response of N2O emissions to the coupling changes of precipitation and soil N availability is not yet fully understood. In this study, we conducted two 7-day field experiments in a semiarid temperate typical steppe of Inner Mongolia, China, to investigate the N2O emission pulses resulting from artificial precipitation events (approximately equivalent to 10.0 mm rainfall) under four N addition levels (0, 5, 10, and 20 g N/(m(2)center dot a)) using the static opaque chamber technique. The results show that the simulated rainfall during the dry period in 2010 caused greater short-term emission bursts than that during the relatively rainy observation period in 2011 (P < 0.05). No significant increase was observed for either the N2O peak effluxes or the weekly cumulative emissions (P > 0.05) with single water addition. The peak values of N2O efflux increased with the increasing N input. Only the treatments with water and medium (WN10) or high N addition (WN(2)0) significantly increased the cumulative N2O emissions (P < 0.01) in both experimental periods. Under drought condition, the variations in soil N2O effluxes were positively correlated with the soil NH4-N concentrations in the three N input treatments (WN5, WN10, and WN(2)0). Besides, the soil moisture and temperature also greatly influenced the N2O pulse emissions, particularly the N2O pulse under the relatively rainy soil condition or in the treatments without N addition (ZN and ZWN). The responses of the plant metabolism to the varying precipitation distribution and the length of drought period prior to rainfall could greatly affect the soil N dynamics and N2O emission pulses in semiarid grasslands.

AB Most large reserves in Brazil do not hold viable populations of jaguars to guarantee the species' long-term survival. Corridors linking populations have been identified as a potential tool to avoid negative effects of isolation, increasing population viability. Here, we performed a Brazil-wide evaluation of potential large scale corridors connecting protected jaguar populations. Six variables (human population size, dam reservoir size, number of dams, roads, railways and cities) expected to negatively impact jaguar movement were analyzed across 180 potential corridors connecting 298 protected jaguar areas. We established overall disturbance scores for the corridors using a principal components analysis and compared them among the Brazilian biomes. We further investigated which variables separated biomes using a canonical variates analysis. The Atlantic Forest and the semi-arid Caatinga have the most impacted potential corridors, whereas the Amazon and Pantanal still have the best potential corridors. Corridor quality in the Cerrado grasslands was intermediate. All variables but human population size and corridor length contributed significantly to differences in corridor variables among biomes. Our conclusions suggest that we need to plan the implementation of large scale corridors in the Amazon, Pantanal and particularly the Cerrado soon, while potential corridors might still be economically viable. In the much more impacted Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, the need for conservation actions is strongest, but logistical difficulties and costs may turn implementation of corridors unfeasible.

AB Coordination of water movement among plant organs is important for understanding plant water use strategies. The hydraulic segmentation hypothesis (HSH) proposes that hydraulic conductance in shorter lived, 'expendable' organs such as leaves and longer lived, more 'expensive' organs such as stems may be decoupled, with resistance in leaves acting as a bottleneck or 'safety valve'.
   We tested the HSH in woody species from a Mediterranean-type ecosystem by measuring leaf hydraulic conductance (K-leaf) and stem hydraulic conductivity (K-S). We also investigated whether leaves function as safety valves by relating Kleaf and the hydraulic safety margin (stem water potential minus the water potential at which 50% of conductivity is lost (Psi(stem) - Psi(50))). We also examined related plant traits including the operating range of water potentials, wood density, leaf mass per area, and leaf area to sapwood area ratio to provide insight into whole-plant water use strategies.
   For hydrated shoots, Kleaf was negatively correlated with KS, supporting the HSH. Additionally, Kleaf was positively correlated with the hydraulic safety margin and negatively correlated with the leaf area to sapwood area ratio.
   Consistent with the HSH, our data indicate that leaves may act as control valves for species with high KS, or a low safety margin. This critical role of leaves appears to contribute importantly to plant ecological specialization in a drought-prone environment.

AB Seedling survival plays an important role in the maintenance of species diversity and forest dynamics. Although substantial gains have been made in understanding the factors driving patterns of seedling survival in forests, few studies have considered the simultaneous contribution of understory light availability and the local biotic neighborhood to seedling survival in temperate forests at different successional stages. Here, we used generalized linear mixed models to assess the relative importance of understory light availability and biotic neighborhood variables on seedling survival in secondary and old-growth temperate forest in north eastern China at two levels (community and guild). At the community level, biotic neighborhood effects on seedling survival were more important than understory light availability in both forests. In both the old-growth and secondary forests, conspecific basal area had a negative effect on seedling survival, consistent with negative conspecific density dependence. At guild levels, the relative importance of light and biotic neighborhood on seedling survival showed considerable variation among guilds in both forests. Available understory light tended to have positive effects on seedling survival for shrub and light-demanding species in the old-growth forest, but negative effects on survival of shade-tolerant seedlings in the secondary forest. For tree species and shade-tolerant species, the best fit models included neighborhood variables, but that was not the case for shrubs, light-demanding, or mid shade-tolerant species. Overall, our results demonstrate that the relative importance of understory light availability and biotic factors on seedling survival vary with species life-history strategy and forest successional stage.

AB Since the early 1990s, sustainable forest management (SFM) has emerged as a paradigm of forest management on global, regional and national levels. In developing countries, avoiding deforestation is a preliminary step towards SFM. The Korean peninsula experienced severe deforestation and forest degradation after the Korean War (1950-1953). In the 1970s and 1980s, South Korea achieved forest restoration through the National Greening Program. In contrast, North Korea failed to restore forests in spite of continuous trials with forest restoration plans. In North Korea, deforestation has accelerated since the mid-1980s. Deforestation and forest degradation in North Korea threatens stability throughout the Korean peninsula. This study focuses on comparing the forest policy and laws of South Korea and North Korea and suggesting forest policy that promotes sustainability in the Korean peninsula. The research findings can provide developing countries with significant information on forest policy and laws to avoid deforestation and forest degradation and move towards sustainability.

AB This study uses 2010-2011 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to estimate total forested area in Haiti. The thematic map was generated using radiometric normalization of digital numbers by a modified normalization method utilizing pseudo-invariant polygons (PIPs), followed by supervised classification of the mosaicked image using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations Land Cover Classification System. Classification results were compared to other sources of land-cover data produced for similar years, with an emphasis on the statistics presented by the FAO. Three global land cover datasets (GLC2000, Globcover, 2009, and MODIS MCD12Q1), and a national-scale dataset (a land cover analysis by Haitian National Centre for Geospatial Information (CNIGS)) were reclassified and compared. According to our classification, approximately 32.3% of Haiti's total land area was tree covered in 2010-2011. This result was confirmed using an error-adjusted area estimator, which predicted a tree covered area of 32.4%. Standardization to the FAO's forest cover class definition reduces the amount of tree cover of our supervised classification to 29.4%. This result was greater than the reported FAO value of 4% and the value for the recoded GLC2000 dataset of 7.0%, but is comparable to values for three other recoded datasets: MCD12Q1 (21.1%), Globcover (2009) (26.9%), and CNIGS (19.5%). We propose that at coarse resolutions, the segmented and patchy nature of Haiti's forests resulted in a systematic underestimation of the extent of forest cover. It appears the best explanation for the significant difference between our results, FAO statistics, and compared datasets is the accuracy of the data sources and the resolution of the imagery used for land cover analyses. Analysis of recoded global datasets and results from this study suggest a strong linear relationship (R-2 = 0.996 for tree cover) between spatial resolution and land cover estimates.(c) 2014 The Authors.

AB Numerous studies have demonstrated that tree survival is influenced by negative density dependence (NDD) and differences among species in shade tolerance could enhance coexistence via resource partitioning, but it is still unclear how NDD affects tree species with different shade-tolerance guilds at later life stages. In this study, we analyzed the spatial patterns for trees with dbh (diameter at breast height) >= 2 cm using the pair-correlation g(r) function to test for NDD in a temperate forest in South Korea after removing the effects of habitat heterogeneity. The analyses were implemented for the most abundant shade-tolerant (Chamaecyparis obtusa) and shade-intolerant (Quercus serrata) species. We found NDD existed for both species at later life stages. We also found Quercus serrata experienced greater NDD compared with Chamaecyparis obtusa. This study indicates that NDD regulates the two abundant tree species at later life stages and it is important to consider variation in species' shade tolerance in NDD study.
