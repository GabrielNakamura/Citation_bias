AB During field ecological expeditions, plant samples were collected from oligotrophic bogs in Western Siberia and the steppes of the Southern Trans-Urals. HPLC spectra of flavonoid biosynthesis of wild plants were analysed. It was shown for the first time that, irrespective of the plant species and habitats, biosynthesis of flavonoids has a fractal structure. High species specificity of fractal structures of flavonoid biosynthesis has been shown.
   Analysis of the bifurcations of the metabolic pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis showed the possibility of biosynthesis of some substances by alternative pathways. It was shown for the first time that, irrespective of the plant species and habitats, biosynthesis of flavonoids has a fractal structure. The possibility of hit compound several of metabolic pathways at some common point (substance) has experimentally shown the effectiveness of neutral mechanisms.

AB Flavonoid biosynthesis is characterized by extremely high flexibility; and it occurs in plants with different adaptive strategies in different habitats. The article proves that the flexibility of flavonoid biosynthesis has a fundamental nature and is the result of two circumstances: the special organization of the pathways of flavonoid metabolism and the relatively low specificity of the main enzymes of biosynthesis.

AB The area of tropical secondary forests is increasing rapidly, but data on the physical and biological structure of the canopies of these forests are limited. To obtain such data and to measure the ontogeny of canopy structure during tropical rainforest succession, we studied patch-scale (5 m(2)) canopy structure in three areas of 18-36 year-old secondary forest in Costa Rica, and compared the results to data from old-growth forest at the same site. All stands were sampled with a stratified random design with complete harvest from ground level to the top of the canopy from a modular portable tower. All canopies were organized into distinct high- and low-leaf-density layers (strata), and multiple strata developed quickly with increasing patch height. The relation of total Leaf Area Index (LAI, leaf area per area of ground) to patch canopy height, the existence of distinct high and low leaf- density layers (strata and free air spaces), the depth and LAI of the canopy strata and free air spaces, and the relation of the number of strata to patch canopy height were remarkably constant across the entire successional gradient. Trees were the most important contributor to LAI at all stages, while contribution of palm LAI increased through succession. We hypothesize that canopy physical structure at the patch scale is driven by light competition and discuss how this hypothesis could be tested. That canopy physical structure was relatively independent of the identity of the species present suggests that canopy physical structure may be conserved even as canopy floristics shift due to changing climate.

AB This study described the floristic-structural variations between edges consisting of one bordering the road and the other by the forest stands with the interior of the forest. The effects of the relationships between environmental aspects in the Atlantic Forest remnant in Brazil was also studied. The structure of the vegetation stratum differed between the edges with the interior and the relationship between the distribution of species with the environmental variables reflected the changes which occurred in the edges towards the interior. For vegetation sampling, 36 plots were established over an area of 0.9 ha and were distributed on both edges and inside the remnant. All individuals with diameter at breast height of >= 2.5 cm were measured and identified. The results revealed the differences in the structure and composition of species distribution pattern in the remnant were influenced by environmental variables such as humidity, resistance to penetration, cation exchange capacity and sodium and potassium contents. These results reinforced the need to create conservation strategies to minimise forest degradation and loss of biodiversity in these forest ecosystems.

AB Ants form an important insect group in many terrestrial ecosystems. The research of ant species diversity is a relevant line of ecological and faunistic studies to completely reveal the biodiversity. Particular attention is given to Protected Areas where a high level of ant species diversity is known. The study of ant fauna and ant community structure was carried out in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve in 2014-2020. Material has been obtained using hand collecting, on census routes, and using carbohydrate and protein baits. The annotated list of ants in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve includes 42 species belonging to 11 genera and three subfamilies. Of them, 17 species are reported for the first time in this Protected Area. Most ant species belong to the genera of Formica, Lasius, and Myrmica, which amount to approximately 75% of the ant species richness in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve. The zoogeographical analysis of the ant fauna demonstrated seven geographical range types with a predominance of the European-West-Siberian and North-Palaearctic ranges. The ant diversity was analysed using the Renyi diversity profile based on census route data. The spatial distribution of ant species was estimated using detrended correspondence analysis. We found a high level of ant species diversity, conditioned by the effect of species evenness in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve. The most species-specific habitats were pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests with Convallaria majalis predominance in herb layer, linden (Tilia cordata) forests with participation of Betula pendula and Picea abies, dry Poa pratensis-dominated meadows, and moist meadows with predominance of Lupinus polyphyllus. The differences between the studied habitats were determined by microclimate conditions for specific ant species. On the model plots, the ant species density was about 7 species per 100 m(2) in average.

AB Neighbourhood models are useful tools for understanding the role of positive and negative interactions in maintaining the tree species diversity in mixed forests. Under such a presumption, we aimed at testing several hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of autogenic species coexistence in an old-growth, beech-fir-spruce stand, which is part of the Slatioara forest reserve (Eastern Carpathians). Univariate/bivariate spatial point pattern analyses, the individual tree species-area relationship, the species mingling analysis and generalised linear mixed models of neighbour interference were applied on data concerning the position and allometry of all saplings and trees occurring within a 0.24 ha plot.
   The monospecific distribution of either beech or spruce saplings did not support the spatial segregation hypothesis. There was no evidence of conspecific negative distance dependence, as no spatial segregation was detected between the saplings and trees of any species. Within 4 m- neighbourhood, the beech saplings appeared as diversity accumulators, which might be indicative of indirect facilitation (e.g., herd protection hypothesis). At tree stage, none of the three species showed either accumulator or repeller patterns in their neighbourhood with respect to sapling species richness. Signals of positive and negative interspecific association were found in tree-sized beech (at scales of 10 to 20 m) and spruce (at scales of 4 to 17 m), respectively. The former, highly interspersed pattern is in accordance with the hypothesis of positive complementary effects, whereas the latter, poorly intermingled pattern is probably linked to the unexpected, positive neighbouring effect of spruce trees on the stem growth of their conspecific saplings. Such self-favouring process might be due to a facilitative below-ground mechanism. Conversely, the beech saplings were suppressed through interference from the neighbouring conspecific trees.
   The beech appears to be the key promoter of tree species coexistence in the study forest stand, in contrast to the low interspersion of spruce in the overstorey leading to lower local tree diversity.

AB Nature reserves harbour considerable richness and diversity of saproxylic organisms since dead wood is preserved in situ, this being also the case of Voivodeasa beech- spruce-fir forest in North-Eastern Romania, the area investigated under the present research. Flight interception traps were employed to capture insects during a vegetation season with the goal to characterize saproxylic Coleoptera community in terms of diversity and several other structural features. Among the captured insects, the majority pertained to obligate saproxylic species (217 species). However, the unexpected high species richness corresponded to an area with modest representation of deadwood due to previous status of commercial forest. The identified beetles were members of different habitat-guilds depending on what type of substrate they colonized: recently dead wood ( 23%), decomposed dead wood (41%), wood inhabiting fungi (34%) and treehollow detritus ( 2%). According to their trophic position, the identified saproxylic beetles pertained to the following guilds: xylophagous ( 40%), mycetophagous (39%), predatory (14%), and species relying on other food resources. The observed richness corresponded to the case of hyperdiverse communities where sampling never leads to the stabilization of species richness under a realistic sampling scheme. The diversity profiles constructed on Shannon, Gini-Simpson, Berger-Parker and evenness indices for the pooled inventory and for separate samples across the vegetation season indicated the aggregated saproxylic community as highly diverse and highly uneven, with rich representation of rare species, dominated by few abundant species. We assembled four bipartite, unweighted, and undirected networks to approach the temporal changes across the sampling period extended over one vegetation season. The topology of beetles' community and of the three main trophic guilds ( xylophagous, mycetophagous and predatory) networks linked to time sequences are characterized by high connectance, high nestedness and modularity, with the exception of the mycetophagous sub-network not displaying significant modularity. Among the identified species, 13% indicate high degree of naturalness of the Voievodeasa forest. 62 of the identified species are included in the Red List of European Saproxylic Beetles of which five are near threatened (Protaetia fieberi, Cucujus cinnaberinus, Crepidophorus mutilatus, Ceruchus chrysomelinus, Prostomis mandibularis), Ischnodes sanguinolentus is vulnerable and Rhysodes sulcatus is an endangered species. During the study, two Coleoptera species, new for Romanian insect fauna were identified: Denticollis interpositus Roubal, 1941 and Hylis procerulus (Mannerheim 1823).

AB The availability and the residue of phosphate in soil are influenced by the addition of phosphorus (P) fertilizer and its uptake by plant. The addition of P fertilizer also commonly affects the plant yield. This research is aimed to assess the effect of chemical fertilizer and bioorganic-phosphate on the P-available and P-residue in soil, P-uptake by plant, and the yield of soybean. Field experiment was carried out in a Vertisol of South Lombok, Indonesia, which consisted of four treatments arranged in a randomized complete block design and replicated five times. The four treatments were P0 = control, P1 = bioorganic-phosphate + 125 kg PHONSKA ha(-1), P2 = bioorganic-phosphate + 187.5 kg PHONSKA ha(-1), and P3 = 250 kg PHONSKA ha(-1). The P2 treatment resulted the highest P-available and P-residue in soil, the highest P-uptake by plant, and the highest yield of soybean. Meanwhile, the effect P1 and P3 on all parameters were not significantly different. There is a strong positive correlation (r = 0.97) between P-uptake by plant and the yield of soybean. As the P2 treatment produced the highest yield of soybean, and the yield at the P1 is relatively the same as P3, this indicates that the application of bioorganic phosphate can reduce the dose of chemical fertilizer by up to 50%.

AB Costa Rica successfully increased forest cover from 21% to 57% between 1987 and 2017 through its PES scheme. A critical first phase culminating in recently signed agreements recognizing the reduction of 12 million tCO(2e) emissions fixed in regenerated forestland and forest fires control with the World Bank, and 14.7 million tCO(2e) for the results-based payment with the Green Climate Fund. The country has committed to become CO2 neutral by 2050. Achieving this goal entails a paradigm shift in all productive sectors towards carbon neutrality; either by reducing emissions or by compensating at the national or international level. For Costa Rica, this means transforming the transportation sector, ensuring the most effective and efficient use of the forest cover that exists today, and shifting the focus from a primarily quantitative measurement of forest cover to one that further values the qualitative benefits of species utilized and services produced. In addition, halting deforestation in sensitive areas, increasing forest coverage in areas still available (approximately 3% for forest and 5% for agroforestry) incorporating agroforestry, silvopastoral and multi-use systems that will allow for more sustainable production systems increasing ecosystem services. Efforts are being undertaken to upgrade the PES scheme towards ensuring negative CO2 emissions from the land use sector to compensate those from other economic sectors. For its success, this new generation scheme - PES 2.0 - must increase ecosystem services beyond traditional forest service, promote conversion of land under agricultural production (i.e. cattle and diary) into agroforestry operations, and increase its long term socio-economic sustainability.

AB Studying the dietary habits of wild animals is essential for the efficient wildlife management. This paper presents the results of dietary overlap of Cuvier's gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) and two species of livestock to evaluate whether or not they compete for forage. The study was conducted from September 2016 to August 2017 in the Djebel Messaad Forest, Algeria, using microhistological analysis. The diet of Cuvier's gazelle and livestock maintained a high proportion of grasses, shrubs and trees. At Djebel Messaad Forest, of the total 48 food plant species identified in fecal samples, 39 of which were found in Cuvier's gazelle, 29 and 36 from domestic sheep and goats respectively; 20 genera occurred in the annual diets of both Cuvier's gazelle and livestock. The principal foods were browses (N% = 52.6) for Cuvier's gazelle, while the dominant forage species included Stipa tenacissima, Artemisia herba alba, Pistacia terebinthus, Stipa parvylora, Helianthemum sp. The food diversity was invariably high for Cuvier's gazelle in autumn and generally decreased from winter to summer, we conclude that this gazelle exhibited a higher dietary diversity than livestock. Shared species 21 represented a higher proportion of dietary items for Cuvier's gazelle (N%= 76.9) than for sheep (N%= 54.0). While shared 28 species, a very higher proportion of those used by Cuvier's gazelle (1\1% = 91.4) than by goats (N% = 61.2). Dietary overlap indices confirmed that, livestock had very similar diets. while, both of them had moderate diet overlap with Cuvier's gazelle.

AB The fragmentation of tropical forests threatens plant community compositions worldwide. In the present study, we examined the impact of fragmentation on plant community compositions over 30 years in sacred forest grove fragments in southern India. For this study, we randomly selected 30 sacred grove patches (hereafter referred to as fragments) of different sizes to examine the effects of fragment size and historical changes on the plant community compositions. A total of 414 woody plant individuals consisting of 53 species belonging to 45 genera and 20 families were recorded from the 30 sites. The total area of the fragments was not significantly related to the current species richness or diversity, although there were significant negative relationships between the total fragment size and the species composition and between the total fragment size and the species evenness, indicating that fragmentation negatively impacted woody plant compositions. Interestingly, our results showed that the woody tree abundance was significantly and positively related to the total fragment size, suggesting a potential increase in recruitment due to the various forms of ongoing human disturbances. Moreover, the woody plant species compositions may be declining in these venerated forest patches due to the removal of plant resources, potentially resulting in declining fragment sizes.

AB Climatic conditions that prevailed during the deposition time of the Tehuacan Formation, Mexico (upper Oligocene) are proposed based on a previous model using wood anatomical characters. Different paleoclimatic variables were calculated, and the anatomical characteristics of the Tehuacan Formation paleoflora were compared with the characteristics of other extant and fossil plant communities to infer water conductive capacities of the Tehuacan Fm. plants. The paleoclimatic inference suggests that the environmental conditions under which the fossilized plants of the Tehuacan Fm. grew were seasonally warm and humid. Statistical analysis and the presence of growth rings in some woods suggest that the paleoflora of the Tehuacan Fm. were similar to extant tropical communities such as tropical semi-deciduous forests and the tropical deciduous forests, most probably representing a transitional community: containing plants that were efficient in transporting water like those in the tropical wet forests, but with phenological adaptations typical of drier tropical forests.

AB Aim of study: Alien and indigenous species emergence patterns within canopy gaps in urban subtropical forests are poorly understood. This study compared canopy gap floristics in relation to abiotic and physical characteristics across three subtropical urban forests differing in disturbance history.
   Area of study: Three Northern Coastal Forests of varying disturbance histories located in coastal subtropical urban KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa (SA).
   Main results: Closed canopy (n = 15 quadrats per forest) and four gaps (n = 12 quadrats per forest) from three size classes ('small' < 25 m(2), 'medium' 25 - 45 m(2); 'large' > 45 m(2)) were surveyed for the primary least disturbed (PLD), primary highly disturbed (PHD) and transitional highly disturbed (THD) forests using classical vegetation sampling techniques. Soil moisture content and air temperature were measured within each gap.
   Research highlights: Cumulatively all forest gaps hosted 198 species. Equivalent number of species (Hill numbers from H = 0 to H = 2) were constantly higher in the PHD forest followed by the PLD forest and lowest in the THD forest. Alien and indigenous plant density were negatively correlated. Species richness was positively correlated with gap size and soil moisture content, and negatively correlated with air temperature.

AB In Ecuador, there is a progressive loss of the native forest. To mitigate these problems, several reforestation plans have been carried out in the country. To recover the Andean forest, Polylepis racemosa was introduced from Peru, due to its similarity to native species like Polylepis incana. This genus fulfills important ecological functions that help mitigate the effects of local climate change. However, reforestation of introduced species close to natural populations threatens the genetic diversity of Polylepis native forests. In the long term, it can trigger hybridization processes and create problems for ecosystem conservation. This study used geometry morphometric (GM), to differentiate species quickly and economically, using the form of leaves, stomata, flowers, and pollen of P. incana and P. racemosa in three populations: Illinizas Ecological Reserve, Mojanda Lagoons and Cayambe-Coca National Park. To obtain the data, the composite leaves were scanned, the stomata and pollen were photographed with an increase of 400x and on flowers with 100x. 15, 10, 12, and 9 landmarks (LM) were digitized for leaves, stomata, flowers, and pollen, respectively, using ImageJ software. Then, the shape variables and statistical analysis were performed in MorphoJ software. As a result, it was obtained that the discriminant function analysis (DFA) shows that leaves and flowers can be used as indicators to differentiate species from this genus, discarding stomata and pollen. After that, Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) of leaves and flowers showed that reforested species jointly are separated into two different species; except for the flowers of the population of Mojanda, where there is an intersection of few individuals, which share similar phenotypic characteristics so they can be considered as potentially hybrid individuals. This study generates information on the location of species introduced inside and outside the National System of Protected Areas that threaten the Andean highlands. Finally, GM is an accessible tool for monitoring biodiversity through morphological characteristics and discriminating against species with complex taxonomic problems.

AB Mixed-species flocks are a key facilitative interaction for tropical birds. Forest fragmentation leads to species loss and spatial turnover in these flocks, yet it is unknown how these changes to composition influence within-flock species interactions. We used network analysis to characterize flocking interactions along a fragment-size gradient in the Colombian Western Andes. We asked 1) how patch size, edge density, and vegetation structure explained network measures indicative of flock cohesion, 2) whether changes were driven by flocking species turnover or changes to the frequency of species co-occurrence, and 3) whether nuclear species, those that maintain flock stability and cohesion, changed in importance across the gradient. We constructed weighted social networks from flock compositions observed on 500-m transects, and then calculated global network measures and the centrality of six nuclear species. Patch size and edge density did not correlate with interspecific co-occurrence patterns, but interaction strength increased with canopy height. Flocks contained numerous, weak interactions, and there were no flock subtypes, suggesting flock composition was dynamic and unstructured. Several redundant nuclear species were present and varied in importance based on ecological conditions. A chlorospingus (Passerellidae) was most central in old-growth forest, whereas several tanager (Thraupidae) species became more central in smaller fragments and disturbed forest. When partitioning network dissimilarity, we found that 66% of dissimilarity resulted from species turnover, whereas only 34% resulted from changes to species co-occurrence. This finding suggests that coherence of flocking behavior itself is maintained even as extensive species turnover occurs from continuous forest to small fragments.

AB Questions A leading hypothesis for species coexistence in species-rich, lowland tropical forests is conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), driven by host-specific pests and pathogens and competition for available resources. The extent to which this applies to Afromontane forests with relatively low diversity, a high frequency of single-species stands, relatively few pests and pathogens and larger edge:core ratios, is unknown. We hoped that the results of our investigation would either confirm the generality of CNDD across these different tropical forest types or offer novel insights into alternative mechanisms leading to the maintenance of Afromontane tree species diversity.
   Location Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve, southeastern Nigeria.
   Methods We monitored the survival of 10,741 seedlings of 93 species over two years in a long-term Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) study plot in a montane forest in Nigeria. We assessed the effect of conspecific and heterospecific seedling and adult neighbours on the survival of every seedling and seedling guild (shade vs light-demanding; canopy vs understorey; edge specialists vs generalists; small vs large seedlings).
   Results We found strong evidence for non-species-specific positive and negative density dependence. CNDD was stronger in canopy species and light-demanding species than in the other growth form and shade tolerance guilds.
   Conclusions Our study offers some clear predictions about drivers of community coexistence in this environment, which will require further testing using field-based experiments.

AB Questions The assembly of plant communities depends strongly on mechanisms that determine the recruitment of different plant species. Studying recruitment using a trait-based approach may help in the search for general or dominant mechanisms involved in this process. Here, we try to disentangle what traits of saplings and established (canopy) plants can be considered as functional for recruitment, and whether the complementarity of these functional traits may be a driver of the plant community assembly.
   Location Regional. Two pine-oak forest communities in Sierra Sur de Jaen and one in Sierra de Segura, southeast of the Iberian peninsula.
   Methods In each forest community, we established three 50 m x 50 m plots, where we identified the saplings of each species recruiting under the canopy of each species or in open interspaces. The study focuses on 37 woody species. Measures of 18 traits were conducted for 30 saplings and 10 adults of each species.
   Results Seed mass and the ratio height:basal diameter of saplings were positively associated with species abundance in the sapling bank under vegetation, while abundance in the sapling bank in open interspaces was only related to the type of mycorrhizal association. On the other hand, some traits of adult plants (leaf mass per unit area [LMA], seed dispersal mechanism, leaf habit and branch density) favour the recruitment of other species in their close proximity. However, we found only circumstantial evidence of canopy/recruit trait complementarity affecting recruitment.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that the assembly of canopy-recruit interactions is primarily driven by the filtering effect of canopy species on recruitment, through traits that affect both seed arrival and soil properties. Species abundance in the sapling bank was related to resource acquisition traits. We did not find any clear evidence supporting that trait complementarity is involved in the interaction between canopy and recruit species.

AB Natural communities are dynamic systems in time and space. The spatial distribution of plants and animals tends to coincide with the availability of resources needed for the survival and reproduction of each species. Natural treefall gaps offer a number of resources that influence the distribution of birds within the forest. We compared the understory bird assemblages of natural treefall gaps (15 sampling points) with those found in the adjacent forest (15 points) in the Humaita Forest Reserve in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. We used mist-nets to sample birds and obtained 700 captures of 105 species. Species richness, number of individuals, and species composition were all similar between gaps and forest, although six species presented some degree of association with the gaps, and nine with the forest. Nectarivores preferred gaps significantly over forest, whereas insectivores and frugivores were distributed equally between gaps and forest. Vegetation height and density differed between gaps and forest, and influenced the distribution of bird species in the two environments. Fruit availability was positively correlated with frugivore abundance in gaps. Overall, 33.3% of the birds associated with the treefall gaps are from lower forest canopy, while the others are understory species. We showed that the use of natural gaps by birds in a fragmented landscape of the Amazon forest contributes to the environmental heterogeneity and succession dynamics following natural events of habitat disturbance.

   ecology; Trade-offs; Trait-environment relationships
AB Wood density is one of the main functional traits affecting demographic rates of tropical trees. However, little is known about how this translates into abundance of trees in local assemblages. I hypothesized that: (1) higher wood density would generally result in better adaptation to prevailing environmental conditions in seasonally dry semideciduous forests, which would translate into numerical dominance of denser-wood species; (2 and 3, respectively) as drought severity and disturbance intensity increase, the performance of individuals of denser-wood species would drop, so that the numerical dominance of those species would decline. A community-level functional measure (Delta MWD) was used to access the role played by wood density in shaping numerical dominance in assemblages. I obtained the value of Delta MWD for 30 local assemblages by computing the difference between wood density mean value of two species groups in each assemblage: dominant and rare. The proportion of Delta MWD positive values was significantly greater than 0.5, thus supporting hypothesis 1. This finding may be explained by the possible ability of denser-wood species to continue growing under drought conditions due to greater resistance to drought-induced cavitation of vessels associated with higher wood density. Pearson correlation coefficients between Delta MWD and drought severity and between Delta MWD and disturbance intensity were negative and statistically significant, supporting hypotheses 2 and 3, respectively. Also supporting these hypotheses, Glm fitting showed that drought severity and disturbance intensity had significant negative effects on Delta MWD; and the median values of Delta MWD of the subsets of assemblages showing higher levels of drought severity and disturbance intensity were significantly smaller than that of their respective counterparts. These findings may be explained by shifts of adaptive advantages from denser-wood drought tolerant strategists to softer-wood drought avoidance strategists, and from denser-wood resource conservative strategists to softer-wood resource acquisitive strategists, as drought severity and disturbance intensity increase, respectively.

TI How evergreen and deciduous trees coexist during secondary forest

SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION

   distribution; Density-dependent regulation; Interspecific association
AB Deciduous broadleaved forests and evergreen broadleaved forests constitute the majority of global subtropical forests. Subtropical vegetation has faced strong anthropogenic pressures, and many natural forests destroyed throughout history have been restored to secondary forests due to various government conservation policies. In early forest restoration, deciduous and evergreen species with significantly different functional traits play different roles and jointly determine secondary forest successional trends, questioning how coexistence and competition between evergreen and deciduous trees profoundly impact community assembly and forest restoration. Although subtropical forest has been seriously threatened, scientific information on how these important ecological processes influence secondary forest regrowth is lacking. We established a 6-ha plot in a subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests in Guanshan National Nature Reserve, southeastern China. All trees individual were stem-mapped, identified to species and measured for diameter at breast height (DBH) and height. Pair-correlation and marked correlation functions indicated that deciduous species are comparatively more vulnerable to density-dependent regulation and size reduction in adjacent individuals during secondary forest succession. The interspecific association between deciduous and evergreen trees in the same DBH class gradually changes from significantly positive to negative as DBH increases, indicating seedling coexistence and competition between large late successional trees at a fine scale. Our results indicate that self-thinning caused by conspecific density-dependent regulation in deciduous trees and interspecific repulsion between evergreen and deciduous trees lead to forest gaps where clustered offspring naturally regenerate to coexist, embodying the important coexistence mechanisms facilitating secondary forest recovery to the zonal climax vegetation types dominated by evergreen species in this region. These findings improve our understanding of the self-recovery mechanisms of subtropical forests in secondary succession and provide important theoretical support to accelerate the future recovery of secondary forests.

AB Natural environments, like soils or the mammalian gut, frequently contain microbial consortia competing within a niche, wherein many species contain genetically encoded mechanisms of interspecies competition. Recent computational work suggests that physical structures in the environment can stabilize local competition between species that would otherwise be subject to competitive exclusion under isotropic conditions. Here we employ Lotka-Volterra models to show that interfacial competition localizes to physical structures, stabilizing competitive ecological networks of many species, even with significant differences in the strength of competitive interactions between species. Within a limited range of parameter space, we show that for stable communities the length-scale of physical structure inversely correlates with the width of the distribution of competitive fitness, such that physical environments with finer structure can sustain a broader spectrum of interspecific competition. These results highlight the potentially stabilizing effects of physical structure on microbial communities and lay groundwork for engineering structures that stabilize and/or select for diverse communities of ecological, medical, or industrial utility.
   Author summary
   Natural environments often have many species competing for the same resources and frequently one species will out-compete others. This poses the fundamental question of how a diverse array of species can coexist in a resource-limited environment. Among other mechanisms, previous studies examined how interactions between species-like cooperation or predation-could lead to stable biodiversity. In this work we looked at this question from a different angle: we used computational models to examine the role that the environment itself might play in stabilizing species that compete with each other when in proximity. We modeled how species arrange themselves in space when the environment contains objects that alter the interfaces along which competing species meet. We found that these 'structured' environments can stabilize species coexistence, across a range of density of those objects and in a way that was robust to differing strengths of interspecies competition. Thus, in addition to biological factors and other forms of environmental variation, our work presents a potentially generic mechanism by which the physical structure of the environment can influence ecological outcomes and stabilize biodiversity.

AB Increasing evidence demonstrates a role for the cross-habitat spillover process in the maintenance of biodiversity in managed agricultural landscapes. However, the mechanisms that drive this process are less well understood. In particular, it is critical to know how landscape structure modulates spillover movements, and whether species are moving through the matrix to acquire resources or simply to disperse between habitat fragments. We tested landscape effects and food resource use within cattle pasture matrices. We used mist-nets to collect data on avian communities across 51 sampling sites, spanning a forest cover gradient. We additionally integrated stable isotopic analysis (delta C-13 signature) to determine the provenance of resources used (either forest - dominated by C-3 plants; or pasture, dominated by C-4). Bird movement across pasture matrices was extremely reduced, and bird occupation was concentrated near forest edges. There was a clear distinction of resource use according to species' habitat preferences, with forest-species foraging predominantly in-forests, open-area species in pastures, and generalist species having more varied diets, but still relying on a large proportion of C-3 sources. Forest cover was unrelated to avian spillover from forests into pastures, but positively related to C-3 signatures for both forest and open-area associated species. Finally, we found that most birds moving from forests to pastures were habitat generalists (63%), and that pastures work as a barrier for forest-associated species movement. Landscapes dominated by pasture are very unfavorable to the conservation of forest species, but potentially can maintain ecosystem services from the spillover of generalist species.

AB Sediment transfer from land to ocean begins in coastal settings and, for large rivers such as the Amazon, has dramatic impacts over thousands of kilometers covering diverse environmental conditions. In the relatively natural Amazon tidal river, combinations of fluvial and marine processes transition toward the ocean, affecting the transport and accumulation of sediment in floodplains and tributary mouths. The enormous discharge of Amazon fresh water causes estuarine processes to occur on the continental shelf, where much sediment accumulation creates a large clinoform structure and where additional sediment accumulates along its shoreward boundary in tidal flats and mangrove forests. Some remaining Amazon sediment is transported beyond the region near the river mouth, and fluvial forces on it diminish. Numerous perturbations to Amazon sediment transport and accumulation occur naturally, but human actions will likely dominate future change, and now is the time to document, understand, and mitigate their impacts.

AB Mountainous regions represent an excellent model to test ecological hypotheses encompassing assemblage diversity and body traits of species. Among insects, there is no uniform body size pattern across temperature gradients, suggesting that processes controlling body size may differ among species. The aim of this study was to explore diversity and body size patterns of dung beetle species of the genus Onthophagus Latreille, 1802 across altitudinal gradients at two mountains in Mexico. Tropical mountain species were sampled from 2200 to 3400 m a.s.l. In both mountains, there was a decrease of richness and abundance of Onthophagus with increasing altitude. There were contrasting relationships between beetle body size and altitude, which varied depending on the data set analyzed. Furthermore, interspecific variations of body size were not related to the number of altitudinal bands recorded by each species. Species from high altitudes were also recorded at lower mountain altitudes, suggesting that diversity at the highest altitudes represents a subgroup of lowland diversity. This may indicate that the fauna inhabiting higher elevations could be the most eurytopic one. Here we present an example of an assemblage that partially contradicts Bergmann's rule, with contrasting effects of altitude on dung beetle body size.

AB Understanding the dynamics of native forest loss and gain is critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, especially in regions experiencing intense forest transformations. We quantified native forest cover dynamics on an annual basis from 1990 to 2017 in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Despite the relative stability of native forest cover during this period (similar to 28 Mha), the ongoing loss of older native forests, mostly on flatter terrains, have been hidden by the increasing gain of younger native forest cover, mostly on marginal lands for mechanized agriculture. Changes in native forest cover and its spatial distribution increased forest isolation in 36.4% of the landscapes. The clearance of older forests associated with the recut of 27% of younger forests has resulted in a progressive rejuvenation of the native forest cover. We highlight the need to include native forest spatiotemporal dynamics into restoration programs to better estimate their expected benefits and unexpected problems.

AB Our ability to describe the highly diverse pool of low abundance populations present in natural microbial communities is increasing at an unprecedented pace. Yet we currently lack an integrative view of the key taxa, functions and metabolic activity which make-up this communal pool, usually referred to as the 'rare biosphere', across the domains of life. In this context, this review examines the microbial rare biosphere in its broader sense, providing an historical perspective on representative studies which enabled to bridge the concept from macroecology to microbial ecology. It then addresses our current knowledge of the prokaryotic rare biosphere, and covers emerging insights into the ecology, taxonomy and evolution of low abundance microeukaryotic, viral and host-associated communities. We also review recent methodological advances and provide a synthetic overview on how the rare biosphere fits into different conceptual models used to explain microbial community assembly mechanisms, composition and function.

AB Alpine vegetation is scarce in central Mexico (approximate to 150 km(2)) and occurs on the 11 highest peaks of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). Timberline occurs at (3700) 3900 m, and at 4750 m vascular plants cease to exist. The alpine vascular flora comprises 237 species from 46 families and 130 genera. Asteraceae (44), Poaceae (42), and Caryophyllaceae (21) possess 45% of the species; none of the remaining families have more than 10 species. Four species are strict endemics, and eight others are near endemics. Thirteen species are restricted to alpine vegetation but also occur outside the study area. Seventy-seven species are endemic to Mexico, 35 of which are endemic to the TMVB. In terms of biogeography, the strongest affinities are with Central or South America. Fifteen species are also native to the Old World. Size of the alpine area seems to not be the determining factor for its floristic diversity. Instead, the time since and extent of the last volcanic activity, in addition to the distance from other alpine islands, appear to be important factors affecting diversity. There is evidence for upward vegetational shifts having occurred during the last century.

AB Diversity, richness, and abundance of Collembola communities from the canopy of a montane cloud forest at Hidalgo State, Mexico were studied, through the rainy and drought seasons in 2004 and 2005, using natural piretrine insecticide in three areas: one at the border close to the road, a second one at an intermediate distance, and a third one in the internal and better preserved area. A total of 5267 springtails from eleven families and 22 genera were obtained, of them, 4377 (83 %) belong to the rainy season, and 890 (17 %) at drought. Most abundant families were Hypogasturidae (with cases such as Schoettella distincta and Xenylla sp.), Entomobryidae (Entomobrya sp., Orchesella sp. and Willowsia mexicana), Paronellidae (Salina sp.), and Dicyrtomidae (Dicyrtoma sp.). In the internal area, 1586 (30 %) springtails were collected, the highest abundance was presented at the intermediate area with 2157 (41 %) specimens. The lowest amount was recorded at the border area with 1527 (29 %). Diversity and equitability indexes were calculated and the effect of sampling season and site on the abundance of Collembola were estimated. A significant variation in composition, abundance, and diversity of the community was observed between both seasons, and the border effect has a significant influence in springtails composition in the canopy, with more cosmopolite groups in the border area.

AB The high capacity of many ant species to accumulate trace metals raises the question of whether the metal concentration in ants' bodies could reliably reflect the contamination of ecosystems. The idea of applying the metal accumulation in ants for bioindication purposes is tempting; however, the methods should consider that ants are unique organisms due to their social way of life. In this study, we describe the between-colony variation in the accumulation of Zn and Cd in workers of the common garden ant Lasius niger originated from the post-mining area of a zinc-and-lead smelter in southern Poland. We show that the accumulation of both metals differs significantly between colonies even within the same study site; at the maximum, we detected a three-fold difference in Zn accumulation and a six-fold difference in Cd. The results showed that in the study area, the capacity of L niger to accumulate metals is highly colony-specific. If future studies on other ant species concur with our findings, this may suggest that incorporating the between-colony variation of metal accumulation in prospective bioindication protocols would provide a higher accuracy of the assessments on the contamination of impacted environments. We suggest that using ants for bioindication should be preceded by preliminary studies to assess representative samples of colonies that could reliably indicate the contamination of the investigated area.

AB Introduction: Native forest reserves in southern Chile are the largest carbon sinks in the country, but the amount and level of grouping of the polygons that form these coverages is unknown.
   Objective: To estimate aerial biomass (AB) and carbon content in native forests in the county of Valdivia, Los Rios region, as well as the degree of grouping of polygons containing carbon in aerial biomass.
   Materials and methods: 21 land plots of 50 x 10 m were installed. Tree species were identified, and their diameter and height were measured. The AB was calculated using allometric equations, and the carbon content was calculated relating the AB to the factor 0.5. The degree of grouping of polygons with carbon content was calculated using the Getis-Ord G statistic.
   Results and discussion: The total carbon content in AB was estimated at 599.6 Mg C.ha(-1). Carbon is concentrated in three forest types, Evergreen being the most important (63.3 %). The most abundant species was Nothofagus obliqua (Mirb.) Oerst. (18.34 %). There is a clustered spatial dependence on carbon-containing polygons in areas with forest reserves; the rest of the territory showed random distribution. Spatial dependence is related to the physiographic characteristics of the study area.
   Conclusions: The use of allometric functions for the estimation of aerial biomass and factors to obtain the carbon content is a valid methodology. The carbon polygons of the native forests in Valdivia have grouped spatial distribution.

AB Regional floristic lists are essential for defining biodiversity conservation strategies and are key to assist in filling knowledge gaps. They aim to provide a data source for applying tools to reduce extinction rates and to conserve ecosystems. Herein we present the results of an inventory of vascular plants in a rainforest in the Caparao National Park (CNP) and approach their implications for conservation and management of this protected area and the surrounding communities. We conducted botanical expeditions between the years 2012 and 2017 in a montane and upper-montane forest of the CNP. We found 361 species distributed in 78 families and 181 genera. The study area is home to new species for science that have recently been described in other publications outside that location, and 4 new records for Espirito Santo State; also 43 species listed in different extinction threat categories (VU, EN and CR) and another 190 categorized with lesser concerns (LC and NT). The families with the highest species richness were: Melastomataceae (41 spp.), Lauraceae and Myrtaceae (30), Orchidaceae (26), Rubiaceae (24), and Asteraceae (20). Our results contribute to greater knowledge of the CNP flora, of the montane environments in Brazil and the vegetation of Espirito Santo state, in addition to demonstrate the importance of this protected area to the conservation Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

AB The Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), launched in 2004, promoted a drastic conservation reform in Brazil. To date, the plan has been through four distinct phases: PPCDAm-I (2004-2008), II (2009-2011), III (2012-2015), and IV (2016-2020). A substantial decline from historically high deforestation rates in the Amazon occurred from 2004 to 2012, part of which (particularly after 2007) can be attributed to the PPCDAm, and part to economic factors such as commodity prices and the currency exchange rates that affect the profitability of agricultural exports. After 2012 deforestation has trended upward despite control efforts. The PPCDAm evolved through its four phases, consequently changing the patterns of deforestation in Amazonia. Here, we review the conservation instruments and strategies promoted under the PPCDAm umbrella and, when possible, provide estimates of their impacts on deforestation based on rigorous, counterfactual evaluations. While the literature emphasizes some of the most well-known PPCDAm actions, e.g., improved satellite-based monitoring, the "blacklist" of municipalities, expansion of protected areas, land tenure regularization, credit access restrictions, and moratoria, we highlight a number of other PPCDAm activities that, along with the previous examples, are arguably also responsible for a significant share of the reduction of deforestation in the region.

AB Protected areas (PAs) monitoring is a technical bottleneck that limits the implementation of decision-making processes for natural resource and wildlife management. Recent methodological advances make passive acoustic monitoring and associated acoustic index analysis an increasingly suitable method for PAs monitoring. Acoustic indices are mathematical filters that can provide standardised comparative information about the acoustic en-ergy, which can be applied to compare communities. In this study we test whether acoustic indices are sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in the soundscape within each of the four seasons between a PA (the Serra do Cipo National Park, Brazil) and a surrounding farmland area. Statistical analysis of results from 12 acoustic indices is used to identify which of 20 acoustic regions, defined by frequency range and time period, present the greatest differences between the two sites. The soundscapes of the two sites differed most in autumn within the acoustic region 6, representing 05:30 - 09:00am and a range of 0.988-3.609 kHz. This acoustic region exhibited significant differences for all the 12 indices tested. Visual examination of 65 long-duration false-colour (LDFC) spectrograms resulted in the selection of 865 (from 1365) sound files with acoustic events within the range of acoustic region 6. Sonotype analysis of the 865 files showed that the soundscape outside the park is strongly influenced by human activity, with domestic animals rare in the park soundscape (1% of the sound files), but very common in the surrounding farmland environment (63% of the sound files). The main goal of monitoring programmes detecting biodiversity trends across space and time, which is here achieved via passive acoustic monitoring and acoustic indices. This confirms the utility of the techniques used here for PA monitoring, especially for detecting trends in anthropogenic disturbance, which is a common threat to natural habitats in parks and reserves in the tropics.

AB Land-use changes or plant species have a profound impact on soil chemical properties, but under their combined action, little is known about the changes in soil fungal communities and functional guilds. We investigated the effects of different land-use types and plant species on the fungal community and functional guilds in the eastern mountainous area of Liaoning Province, including natural secondary forests (Quercus mongolica, shrub wood), plantation forests (Larix gmelini, Pinus koraiensis), and farmland (Zea mays). Fungal community diversity and composition were analyzed using Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing. Responses of soil fungal communities to environmental factors were assessed through canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Pearson correlation analysis. The results illustrated that LG, and PK did not improve soil conditions to the same degree as QM. In addition, compared to SW, ZM decreased soil fertility. The dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, with average relative abundances of 55.3% and 31.78%, respectively. The phylum Ascomycota was the dominant group in QM, SW, and ZM, while, Basidiomycota dominated in LG, and PK. Heatmap (P<0.05) and NMDS (stress = 0.07) plots showed that soil fungal communities from LG, PK, and ZM tended to be separated from those of QM and SW. Additionally, soil fungal community functions from QM, SW, and LG were separated from those of PK and ZM. Both analyses demonstrated that different land-use types and plant species had significantly different impacts on the soil fungal communities. Canonical correlation analysis suggested that soil pH value, NH4+-N, and NO3--N contents were the main factors affecting the soil fungal community diversity and composition. Our results demonstrated that fungal community diversity, composition, and functional groups significantly differed among the three different land use types, so were differences in different plant species under the same land-use type.

AB Biodiversity patterns are shaped by the combination of dispersal, environment, and stochasticity, but how the influence of these drivers changes in fragmented habitats remains poorly understood. We examined patterns and relationships among total (gamma) and site-level (alpha) diversity, and site-to-site variation in composition (beta-diversity) of tree communities in structurally contiguous and fragmented tropical rainforests within a human-modified landscape in India's Western Ghats. First, for the entire landscape, we assessed the extent to which habitat type (fragment or contiguous forest), space and environment explained variation in alpha-diversity and composition. Next, within fragments and contiguous forest, we assessed the relative contribution of spatial proximity, environmental similarity, and their joint effects in explaining beta-diversity. We repeated these assessments with beta-diversity values corrected for the confounding effects of alpha- and gamma-diversity using null models (beta-deviation). Lower gamma-diversity of fragments resulted from both lower alpha- and beta-diversity compared to contiguous forests. However, beta-deviation did not differ between contiguous forests and fragments. Fragmented and contiguous forest clearly diverged in floristic composition, which was attributable to beta-diversity being driven by differences in elevation and MAP. Within fragmented forest, neither space nor environment explained beta-diversity, but beta-deviation increased with greater elevational differences. In contiguous forests by comparison, environment alone (mainly elevation) explained the most variation in beta-diversity and beta-deviation of both species' occurrences and abundances. Spatial gradients in environmental conditions played a larger role than dispersal limitation in shaping diversity and composition of tree communities across forest fragments. Thus, location of remnant patches at different elevations was a key factor underlying site-to-site variability in species abundances across fragments. Understanding the environmental characteristics of remnant forests in human-modified landscapes, combined with knowledge of species-environment relationships across different functional groups, would therefore be important considerations for management and restoration planning in human-modified landscapes.

AB 1. The potential for competition is highest among species in close association. Despite net benefits for both parties, mutualisms can involve costs, including food competition. This might be true for the two neotropical ants Camponotus femoratus and Crematogaster levior, which share the same nest in a presumably mutualistic association (parabiosis).
   2. While each nest involves one Crematogaster and one Camponotus partner, both taxa were recently found to comprise two cryptic species that show no partner preferences and seem ecologically similar. Since these cryptic species often occur in close sympatry, they might need to partition their niches to avoid competitive exclusion.
   3. Here, we investigated first, is there interference competition between parabiotic Camponotus and Crematogaster, and do they prefer different food sources under competition? And second, is there trophic niche partitioning between the cryptic species of either genus?
   4. Using cafeteria experiments, neutral lipid fatty acid and stable isotope analyses, we found evidence for interference competition, but also trophic niche partitioning between Camponotus and Crematogaster. Both preferred protein- and carbohydrate-rich baits, but at protein-rich baits Ca. femoratus displaced Cr. levior over time, suggesting a potential discovery-dominance trade-off between parabiotic partners. Only limited evidence was found for trophic differentiation between the cryptic species of each genus.
   5. Although we cannot exclude differentiation in other niche dimensions, we argue that neutral dynamics might mediate the coexistence of cryptic species. This model system is highly suitable for further studies of the maintenance of species diversity and the role of mutualisms in promoting species coexistence.

AB Karst landscapes are among the topographically most complex systems with various microhabitats, where species can persist despite unfavourable macro-environmental changes. These microhabitats can also function as stepping stones during range shifts. Although the enclosed depressions (dolines, sinkholes or tiankengs) of karst landscapes may act as such safe havens, data on the functional diversity of their animal assemblages are scarce. Here, we investigate the functional diversity (i.e., certain functional groups and functional traits) of ant assemblages in dolines and study whether dolines surrounded by resource-poor environments (i.e., Fagus sylvatica forests) may function as safe havens for different kinds of ants. We found that dolines have the potential to maintain distinctive ant assemblages characterised by specific functional groups and traits that are rare in the surrounding habitats. Although continuous Fagus sylvatica cover in dolines had a detrimental impact on ant assemblages, grassland dolines surrounded by grasslands or Fagus sylvatica forests supported the presence of some specific functional groups and traits. These results suggest that conservation management needs to consider the influence of vegetation characteristics not only in dolines but also on the surrounding plateau. Moderate grazing and/or mowing would be desirable in order to prevent shrub encroachment into grasslands to ensure optimal vegetation structure for ants in the long run. Therefore, proper management and conservation of these safe havens may mitigate the rate of biodiversity loss under global warming. There is a need to explore a wide variety of taxonomic groups and taxon-specific traits in parallel with the quality of the surrounding habitats when evaluating current and potential microrefugia.

AB Biodiversity is known to be influenced by agricultural practices in many ways. However, it is necessary to understand how this relation takes place in particular agroecosystems, sociocultural contexts and for specific biological groups, especially in highly biodiverse places. Also, in order to systematically study and track how biodiversity responds or changes with agricultural practices, it is necessary to find groups that can be used as practical indicators. We conduct a study of beetle (Coleoptera) diversity in maize-based agricultural plots with heterogeneous management practices in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, Mexico, a region with outstanding biodiversity and a long agricultural history. We use a mixture of local knowledge and multivariate statistics to group the plots into two broad and contrasting management categories (traditional vs. industrialized). Then, we present an analysis of Coleopteran diversity for each category, showing higher levels across different diversity indexes for the traditional plots. Specifically, Coleopteran guilds associated with natural pest control and soil conservation are more common in traditional plots than in industrialized ones, while herbivorous beetles are more abundant in the second. Also, our results let us postulate the Curculionidae family as an indicator of both management type and overall Coleopteran diversity in the agricultural lands of the study site. We discuss our results in terms of the agricultural matrix quality and its role in strategies that favor the coexistence of culturally meaningful agricultural systems and local biodiversity.

AB Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are an innovative solution to reduce environmental degradation. However, most existing experience with PES implementation is related to the agricultural, forestry and marine sectors, and the application of PES in rangelands is limited. Although a PES could be an option to reduce rangeland degradation, there is no specific framework or experience for its implementation in Iran. Financial resources for funding the scheme are important, although funding by itself is not sufficient, and details are important in designing a successful PES system. This study aimed to design and introduce the framework of a PES scheme based on field surveys, information collection and analysis emphasising soil and water conservation functions, and identification and discussion of the challenges and obstacles facing implementation of the designed framework. After delineating the vegetation types on rangeland ecosystems, their current ecological condition was considered the baseline, and minimum and maximum payments were considered, equal to the livestock reduction compensation and the total value of the increased ecosystem services as a result of PES implementation respectively. Results suggest designing the practical steps of PES schemes is complicated despite the concept's simplicity, and a lack of clear property rights can increase complexity and multiply the costs. Considering different socioeconomic and ecological contexts, and the detailed framework in all the processes of identification and investigation, development, pilot testing, and project operation can increase the effectiveness of PES schemes. Our findings appear useful for policy-making to balance utilisation pressure in natural areas, not only in Iran, but also in many arid and semiarid rangelands elsewhere.

AB Deforestation in Indonesia in recent decades has made increasingly large parts of the region vulnerable to fires. Burning is particularly widespread in deforested peatlands, and it leads to globally significant carbon emissions. Here we use satellite-based observations to assess loss and fragmentation of primary forests and associated changes in fire regimes in Sumatra and Kalimantan between 2001 and 2019. We find that fires did not penetrate undisturbed primary forest areas deeper than two kilometres from the forest edge irrespective of drought conditions. However, fire-resistant forest now covers only 3% of peatlands and 4.5% of non-peatlands; the majority of the remaining primary forests are severely fragmented or degraded due to proximity to the forest edge. We conclude that protection and regeneration of the remaining blocks of contiguous primary forest, as well as peatland restoration, are urgently needed to mitigate the impacts of potentially more frequent fire events under future global warming.

DT Review
ID BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION
AB Habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation impacts are the most direct threat to global biodiversity. In this Primer, we discuss how these three forms of habitat transformation are inextricably intertwined, and how their effects on biodiversity and ecosystems are often context specific. We draw on recent analyses that have explored this context-dependence directly to discuss how local-scale impacts of habitat transformation are mediated by biogeographic-scale variation in evolutionary histories and species' geographic ranges. We also discuss how changes to ecosystem functions and services in modified habitats can be just as context-dependent-and how these changes are further obscured by high levels of ecological redundancy in species functions, which can confer resilience to habitat transformation. To avoid the impending extinction of millions of species, it is crucial that the impacts of habitat transformation are mitigated through a combination of preventing further habitat loss while simultaneously extending and repairing the habitats that remain.

Here, we experimentally simulated this upward herbivore range shift by translocating low-elevation herbivore insects to alpine grasslands. We report that the introduction of novel herbivores and increased herbivory disrupted the vertical functional organization of the plant canopy. By feeding preferentially on alpine plants with functional traits matching their low-elevation host plants, herbivores reduced the biomass of dominant alpine plant species and favored encroachment of herbivore-resistant small-stature plant species, inflating species richness. Supplementing a direct effect of temperature, novel biotic interactions represent a neglected but major driver of ecosystem modifications under climate change.

AB Pierce's disease (PD) caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is a deadly disease of grapevines. This study used 20 SSR markers to genotype 326 accessions of grape species collected from the southeastern and southwestern United States, Mexico and Costa Rica. Two hundred sixty-six of these accessions, and an additional 12 PD resistant hybrid cultivars developed from southeastern US grape species, were evaluated for PD resistance. Disease resistance was evaluated by quantifying the level of bacteria in stems and measuring PD symptoms on the canes and leaves. Both Bayesian clustering and principal coordinate analyses identified two groups with an east-west divide: group 1 consisted of grape species from the southeastern US and Mexico, and group 2 consisted of accessions collected from the southwestern US and Mexico. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range appeared to be a phylogeographic barrier. The state of Texas was identified as a potential hybridization zone. The hierarchal STRUCTURE analysis on each group showed clustering of unique grape species. An east-west divide was also observed for PD resistance. With the exception of Vitis candicans and V. cinerea accessions collected from Mexico, all other grape species as well as the resistant southeastern hybrid cultivars were susceptible to the disease. Southwestern US grape accessions from drier desert regions showed stronger resistance to the disease. Strong PD resistance was observed within three distinct genetic clusters of V. arizonica which is adapted to drier environments and hybridizes freely with other species across its wide range.

AB Background: Previous research has shown diverse vertical space use by various taxa, highlighting the importance of forest vertical structure. Yet, we know little about vertical space use of tropical forests, and we often fail to explore how this three-dimensional space use changes over time.
   Methods: Here we use canopy tower systems in French Guiana and passive acoustic monitoring to measure Neotropical bat activity above and below the forest canopy throughout nine nights. We use a Bayesian generalized linear mixed effect model and kernel density estimates to demonstrate patterns in space-use over time.
   Results: We found that different bats use both canopy and understory space differently and that these patterns change throughout the night. Overall, bats were more active above the canopy (including Cormura brevirostris, Molossus molossus, Peropteryx kappleri and Peropteryx macrotis), but multiple species or acoustic complexes (when species identification was impossible) were more active in the understory (such as Centronycteris maximiliani, Myotis riparius, Pteronotus alitonus and Pteronotus rubiginosus). We also found that most bats showed temporally-changing preferences in hourly activity. Some species were less active (e.g., P. kappleri and P. macrotis) whereas others were more active (Pteronotus gymnonotus, C. brevirostris, and M. molossus) on nights with higher moon illuminance.
   Discussion: Here we show that Neotropical bats use habitat above the forest canopy and within the forest understory differently throughout the night. While bats generally were more active above the forest canopy, we show that individual groups of bats use space differently over the course of a night, and some prefer the understory. This work highlights the need to consider diel cycles in studies of space use, as animals use different habitats during different periods of the day.

AB Trophic ecology of dung beetles has been widely studied because of the important ecological role of these taxa. However, previous studies have focused on a limited number of potential food items (mainly vertebrate dung and carrion) and have used only one approach (either field or laboratory). Moreover, recent studies showed high abundance of dung beetles in defaunated areas with a low abundance of these resources.
   In this study, we combined a field and laboratory approach to explore dung beetle trophic attraction to different potential native resources in the Atlantic forest; and we evaluated whether results can explain the high abundance of dung beetles in defaunated areas. Through laboratory olfactometry experiments, we first exposed individuals to vertebrate carrion, omnivorous dung, and decomposing fungi. Then, we exposed species that exhibited a preference for dung to monkey, tapir, and feline dung; and those that preferred carrion and decomposing fungi to chicken, cow meat, and arthropod carcasses. We compared trophic attractions in the field and laboratory conditions with generalised additive models.
   We found that coprophagous species preferred monkey dung, and all necrophagous and sapro-necrophagous species preferred arthropod carcasses. These results suggest that the importance of arthropods carcasses as an important resource for dung beetles has been largely underestimated.
   The results of this study might provide an explanation for the high abundance of necrophagous and sapro-necrophagous dung beetles in defaunated areas. In addition, the use of omnivorous dung and arthropod carcasses could be an effective sampling method for dung beetle assemblages.

AB From the southwestern termination of the Agulhas current, anticyclonic eddies are emitted and drift across the South Atlantic Ocean. This study is based on a FORSA (Following Ocean Rings in the South Atlantic) oceanographic cruise, from Cape Town (South AFRica) to Arraial do Cabo (Brazil) in June 2015, during which three eddies of different ages (E1, 7 months; E3, 11 months; E5, 24 months) from the Agulhas current were sampled for microplankton identification and determination of functional traits. The stations where sampling occurred at each eddy included a control outside the eddy and three stations inside the eddy-border, midway (between the border and center), and center (identified through satellite images of sea level anomaly - SLA). Functional traits were determined based on microscopic observations and consultation of the literature. An evident decay in the Agulhas eddies toward the west was observed, and each eddy proved to be different. E1 represented a younger and more robust structure. At the same time, the other eddies, E3 and E5, were more alike with similar physical, chemical, and ecological characteristics and almost the same indices values of functional diversity, demonstrating that although their species compositions were different, the strategies used by the species were the same. The most crucial ecological trait for microplankton was nutrition mode. The microplankton contained mainly mixotrophic dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria adapted to oligotrophic conditions. The functional strategy of microplankton did not differ among the eddies and stations, with mixotrophy being the most striking trait. Therefore, the older eddies' microplankton community fits the neutrality theory, whereby species perform similar ecological functions, and the younger eddy fits in the niche complementarity. Even with the species composition being different in each eddy and/or within the same eddy, the functional strategy was the same, with scarce resources and species selected that best use any source of nutrients or use evolutionary advantages to live in an oligotrophic environment.

AB Forest plantations may have detrimental effects on biodiversity. However, these plantations are widely used to restore degraded habitats, yet their contribution to restoring functional diversity remains largely unknown. We assessed vegetation structure, resource availability, and bird abundance, as well as bird morphological, behavioral, life history, and functional diversity in similar to 35-year-old monospecific protected Andean alder (Alnus acuminata) forest plantations in the Central Andes range at elevations between 2,400 and 2,800 m, to determine if plantation structure and resource availability favor bird functional diversity. We compared our findings to a 35- to 45-year-old secondary forest that had naturally regenerated. We found similarities in bird functional diversity but different functional composition between the Andean alder plantation and secondary forest. The bird life history, behavioral, and morphological traits from the secondary forest were more heterogeneous than those from the plantation. In addition, standing dead trees in the Andean alder plantation promoted bird functional diversity and the presence of birds in the plantation interior. Overall, vegetation structure and understory resource availability of Andean alder plantations appear sufficient to enable bird functional diversity partially resembling that of secondary forests in the region.

AB The Chilean freshwater crayfishes of the family Parastacidae have been little studied, in particular regarding their intraspecific variation. Here we perform an analysis of mitochondrial DNA variation aimed to characterize the genetic diversity and to pose primary hypothesis of species boundaries for populations currently assigned to Parastacus nicoleti, one of the two Chilean currently recognized species. Analyses were based on the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). 206 individuals from 33 localities, along the distributional range of the species, were analysed. We found a deep genealogy that is geographically structured, where most localities present private and closely related haplotypes. Genetic variants fall in nine main divergent and allopatric clades, which form three major clades that latitudinally replace each other. Distinct single locus species delimitation analysis recovers between six and 10 putative species; therefore, we suggest that P. nicoleti is a species complex, which should be further tested with analysis of morphology and nuclear data.

AB As a crucial primary producer of the earth, terrestrial plants play important functions in energy flow and biogeochemical cycles of the planet. However, their real wealth contributions to human society are not properly evaluated because of their widespread distribution and limitations in evaluation methods. This study used the emergy methodology to evaluate the ecological economic value of global terrestrial plants. Terrestrial plants were divided into three groups of bryophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms for the emergy evaluation. The area of the system boundary for terrestrial plants was 13.5 E+9 ha. Total annual emergy use of the terrestrial plants was 10.29 E + 24 sej yr(-1) which consisted of 9.19 E + 24 sej yr(-1) by angiosperms, 1.00 E + 24 sej yr(-1) used by gymnosperms, and 0.09 E + 24 sej yr(-1) by bryophytes. The total emergy stored in the terrestrial plants was 648.50 E + 24 sej, with 550.28 E + 24 sej stored in angiosperms, 91.64 E + 24 sej in gymnosperms, and 6.58E+24 sej in bryophytes. The Unit Emergy Values (UEVs) of the Net Primary Production (NPP) of terrestrial plants was calculated as 183.31 E + 6 sej gC(-1). For each plant group, UEVs were 189.00 E + 6 sej gC(-1) for angiosperms, 145.54 E + 6 sej J(-1) for gymnosperms, and 159.63 E + 06 sej gC(-1) for bryophytes. The emdollar values were calculated to determine approximate monetary values for production and storage of the terrestrial plants. The ecological values of the annual plant production were 5.14 trillion (em)$ for the all terrestrial plants with 4.59 trillion, 0.50 trillion, and 0.05 trillion (em)$ for angiosperm, gymnosperm, and bryophytes respectively. The ecological values stored in the plant biomasses were 324.25 trillion (em)$ for all the terrestrial plans, with 275.14 trillion, 45.82 trillion, and 3.29 trillion (em)$ for angiosperm, gymnosperm, and bryophytes respectively.

AB Biotic and abiotic drivers of seedling establishment and survival are fundamental not only for elucidating processes occurring at plant early life stages, but also for assisting species natural regeneration. Keystone, multipurpose and economically important tree species such as Afzelia africana Sm. are reportedly facing recruitment constraints, yet little is known about how abiotic and biotic factors shape the species seedling dynamics. Here, we monitored the species seedlings over one year across three seasons in West Africa savannahs to determine how conspecific and heterospecific biotic neighborhood and habitat heterogeneity correlate with initial seedling density, leaves' fungal infection and herbivory and how all these factors combined, influence the species seedling survival.
   Seedling densities increased with increasing conspecific adult densities, and were highest in tree savannahs and on sandy-silt soils. Leaves' fungal infection and herbivory were also positively associated with conspecific adult density, but were more abundantly observed in tree savannahs than in shrub savannahs. Seedling survival was constrained on higher slope, and negatively affected by conspecific adult density, especially in shrub savannahs.
   There was a strong evidence for negative density-dependence effects of conspecific adults on seedling survival, which operated through negative effects of herbivory and fungal infection. Habitat heterogeneity was also an important driver, which modulated biotic factors' effects on seedling survival: tree savannahs promote positive conspecific density-dependence of seedling fungal infection and herbivory more than shrub savannahs. Nonetheless, seedlings were more sensitive to natural enemies in shrub savannahs, suggesting increased negative conspecific density-dependence effects on seedling survival in less dense vegetation, possibly as a result of enhanced specialization of predators and pathogens on a limited set of species. The study brings important insights into the mechanisms that drive the establishment and survival of the species seedling, which should be considered in the design of management activities aiming at the conservation of this endangered species.

AB Brazil has high levels of biodiversity and has received strong criticism for the increasing country-wide deforestation that threatens it. Although a significant percentage of land area in Brazil is protected, the areas are insufficient and unevenly distributed. Many studies have contributed to the biogeographical knowledge of Brazilian flora, but no endemicity analysis (EA) has been conducted including all endemic angiosperms. We investigated the spatial component, drawing on a huge and taxonomically diverse dataset based on 827 016 records collected over the last two centuries. We conducted an EA for 15 034 species from 173 families using an optimality criterion with 2 degrees and 3 degrees grid sizes, in order to search for distributional concordance, to identify the biogeographical units and discuss the implications for conservation. Six analyses were run for basal angiosperms, monocots and eudicots. The EA recovered 66 consensus areas (CAs). The concordance of CAs enabled the identification of five best-supported areas of endemism--three in the Atlantic and Parana Forest and two areas in the Cerrado province--supported by species of 120 families. The age of divergence for some genera that contributed significantly to the identification of areas recovered in the Cerrado coincides with the recent, <10 Ma, estimated age of that province. By contrast, the areas in the Atlantic and Parana Forest are supported by genera with earlier diversification >30 Ma, supporting an ancient origin. Most areas in the Atlantic Forest are partially superimposed with the limits of the protected areas, however, big gaps were identified in the Cerrado. Protecting Brazilian biomes was at the heart of Brazil's environmental policy. Regrettably, this scenario has radically changed based on misleading divergences in conservation policy. Areas of endemism are pivotal for biodiversity conservation due to the common evolutionary history shared by their endemic taxa. Thus, we hope that these congruent patterns of endemism support the establishment of biodiversity priorities.

AB 1. Ants are the dominant insects in tropical forest canopies. The alpha and beta diversities of ants change in response to forest disturbance. Understanding the response of ants to forest disturbance will help to guide ant conservation and forest management plans, especially in endangered ecosystems such as the tropical dry forest. 2. We analysed ant alpha and beta diversities in 15 fragments (5 mature, 5 disturbed, and 5 secondary) of a tropical dry forest in central Mexico. We identified and measured all of the trees in two transects (10 x 50 m) established within each fragment. Pit-fall traps were used to sample ants in all of the trees. 3. We identified 52 ant species (from a total of 11,524 individuals). The mature forest presented the greatest quantity of exclusive species and the highest alpha diversity. Ant composition differed among the mature forest but not between disturbed and secondary forest, and was related to tree size and richness. The beta diversity was lower in the disturbed forest, reflecting the cost of biotic homogenization (15%). Among the beta diversity components in all three forest types, this diversity was mainly influenced by turnover, while nestedness diminished in the disturbed forest. 4. In the tropical dry forest studied, anthropogenic disturbance homogenises the ant community, probably because the availability of resources is also homogenised, decreasing the alpha diversities of the canopy ants. Our results show the importance of the conservation of mature forests in terms of maintaining the diversity of canopy ants.

AB Recursive adaptations and counter-adaptations of plant-feeding insects are thought to have driven chemical and physical diversity in plant defenses. Among existing theories on defensive diversity, the syndromes hypothesis predicts that plants may evolve suites of covarying defense traits along evolutionary arms races with herbivores. We use the large, phenotypically diverse angiosperm genus Ficus (Moraceae) to test the major predictions of this hypothesis: (1) plant species will form distinctive combinations of defensive traits; (2) these traits will be correlated within each syndrome. Trait combinations need not map well onto phylogenies because plant species can converge onto similar trait values, but strong phylogenetic signal driven by selection (as opposed to drift) suggests roles for escalation and coevolution. Finally, Ficus species with complementary combinations of defenses will be less susceptible to insect damage and harbor distinct insect communities. We quantified susceptibility to insect herbivory and nine leaf traits related to resource acquisition and defense in 36 Ficus species growing in a common-garden setting in dry and wet seasons over 2 yr. We recovered a set of three syndromes defined by relatively small sets of trait combinations. Broadly speaking, these syndromes grouped fig species with different life forms. For example, epiphytic figs had nutrient-poor, tough, tannin-rich leaves, while free-standing trees tended to have leaves covered in trichomes and full of alkaloid-rich latex. When season and species identity were accounted for, the combination of two traits, higher C:N and higher latex tannin content, provided significantly stronger defense than did either trait taken singly. Several individual traits (C:N, latex tannin, and trichome density) were significantly negatively correlated with herbivore damage, while alkaloid content was positively correlated (perhaps as a result of feeding by adapted herbivores). Several defensive traits influenced insect herbivore community structure. Finally, traits followed different evolutionary trajectories. While latex tannin, C:N, and leaf tannin fit a Brownian-motion model of evolution, the first two escalating across Ficus phylogeny, others appeared to have more limited phylogenetic signal or tended to de-escalate. Overall, the patterns we detected support the concept of coordinated defense syndromes, demonstrating that evolutionary arms races can drive combinations of traits in this genus.

AB Herbivory is one of the major biotic stress factors that affect the establishment of plants. However, the main factors that drive herbivory in seedlings of Amazonian tree species are still not well understood. Here we investigated whether contrasting levels of irradiance influence herbivory according to different herbivory indicators and which leaf traits are most related to interspecific variation in herbivory under contrasting irradiance conditions.
   We measured the leaf area lost as a result of insect herbivory in five tree species planted in a silvicultural system of secondary forest enrichment according to two indicators, herbivore damage (accumulated since plant germination) and herbivory rate (measured over time), and two irradiance conditions, understorey PPFD 2.6 mol center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1)) and gap PPFD 33.1 mol center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1). Furthermore, we related the interspecific variation in herbivory to a set of leaf traits: SLA, RWC, sclerophylly, phenolic compound content, tannins, condensed tannins and non-structural carbohydrates.
   Herbivore damage was significantly affected by light availability and species, with the highest percentage variation observed in the Meliaceae (Carapa guianensis and Swietenia macrophylla). For the herbivory rate, only the interspecific variation was significant, with Bertholletia excelsa having the lowest rates. Chemical characteristics (phenolic compounds and tannins) were most related to herbivory rates, as well as highly influenced by light conditions. Non-structural carbohydrates (starch and sucrose) were also related to the interspecific variation in herbivory.
   The phenolic compounds and starch, as affected by light quantity, are species dependent. Thus, the selective pressure on herbivores may be driven by species-dependent responses to light conditions.

TI Deciphering functional redundancy in the human microbiome

AB Although the taxonomic composition of the human microbiome varies tremendously across individuals, its gene composition or functional capacity is highly conserved - implying an ecological property known as functional redundancy. Such functional redundancy has been hypothesized to underlie the stability and resilience of the human microbiome, but this hypothesis has never been quantitatively tested. The origin of functional redundancy is still elusive. Here, we investigate the basis for functional redundancy in the human microbiome by analyzing its genomic content network - a bipartite graph that links microbes to the genes in their genomes. We find that this network exhibits several topological features that favor high functional redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a simple genome evolution model to generate genomic content network, finding that moderate selection pressure and high horizontal gene transfer rate are necessary to generate genomic content networks with key topological features that favor high functional redundancy. Finally, we analyze data from two published studies of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), finding that high functional redundancy of the recipient's pre-FMT microbiota raises barriers to donor microbiota engraftment. This work elucidates the potential ecological and evolutionary processes that create and maintain functional redundancy in the human microbiome and contribute to its resilience. Here, the authors develop a genome evolution model to investigate the origin of functional redundancy in the human microbiome by analyzing its genomic content network and illustrate potential ecological and evolutionary processes that may contribute to its resilience.

TI Effects of repeated thinning at different intensities on the recovery of
   hardwood species diversity in a Cryptomeria japonica plantation
SO JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Intensive thinning; mixed hardwood and conifer forests; replacement;
   successional status
AB To explore how and to what extent repeated thinning at different intensities affects the recovery of species diversity, we investigated the recruitment patterns of hardwoods (height >= 1.5 m) from 2003 to 2017 after first (2003) and second (2008) thinnings in 67% (Intensive), 33% (Weak), and 0% (Control) thinning treatments in a Cryptomeria japonica plantation in northern Japan. With intensive thinning, the numbers of individuals and species both increased rapidly after the first thinning, but slowly after the second thinning, irrespective of successional status (i.e., early, mid, and late succession). With weak thinning, both numbers increased monotonically but slowly in most years. With time after the second weak thinning, the numbers of early and mid-successional species both decreased, while the numbers of late-successional species increased monotonically, suggesting a replacement of shade-intolerant early and mid-successional species by shade-tolerant late-successional species. As a result, little differences were observed in both the numbers between the two thinning intensities. These traits suggest that thinning intensity has a minimal effect on species richness, but affects the future species composition (i.e., the dominance of late-successional species with weak thinning and co-dominance of all successional states with intensive thinning). For large individuals (diameter at breast height >= 5 cm), the numbers of both individuals and species were greater with intensive thinning. Therefore, although recovery of the species diversity in the forest understory can be realised with weak thinning, a mixed conifer-hardwood forest at the canopy level is more likely to be achieved with repeated intensive thinning.

AB Fire is one of the primary disturbances to the distribution and ecological properties of the world's major biomes and can influence the surface fluxes and climate through vegetation-climate interactions. This study incorporates a fire model of intermediate complexity to a biophysical model with dynamic vegetation, SSiB4/TRIFFID (The Simplified Simple Biosphere Model coupled with the Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics Model). This new model, SSiB4/TRIFFID-Fire, updating fire impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle every 10 d, is then used to simulate the burned area during 1948-2014. The simulated global burned area in 2000-2014 is 471.9 Mha yr(-1), close to the estimate of 478.1 Mha yr(-1) in Global Fire Emission Database v4s (GFED4s), with a spatial correlation of 0.8. The SSiB4/TRIFFID-Fire reproduces temporal variations of the burned area at monthly to inter-annual scales. Specifically, it captures the observed decline trend in northern African savanna fire and accurately simulates the fire seasonality in most major fire regions. The simulated fire carbon emission is 2.19 Pg yr(-1), slightly higher than the GFED4s (2.07 Pg yr(-1)).
   The SSiB4/TRIFFID-Fire is applied to assess the long-term fire impact on ecosystem characteristics and surface energy budget by comparing model runs with and without fire (FIRE-ON minus FIRE-OFF). The FIRE-ON simulation reduces tree cover over 4.5% of the global land surface, accompanied by a decrease in leaf area index and vegetation height by 0.10m(2) m(-2) and 1.24 m, respectively. The surface albedo and sensible heat are reduced throughout the year, while latent heat flux decreases in the fire season but increases in the rainy season. Fire results in an increase in surface temperature over most fire regions.

AB Restoration of degraded areas might be assessed via faunal communities of a particular region, and birds are one of the taxa most suitable in such assessments. This study evaluated the dynamics of a bird community in an area of Cerrado under natural regeneration, comparing it with one in the forest remnants. Birds were censused by a total of 24 point counts in both areas comprising 96 h of total sampling. Richness, abundance and diversity were greater at the regeneration area, possibly due to the heterogeneity of habitats, the consequent niche diversity, and the connectivity between patches of vegetation. Functional groups were also distinct between both sites, including species composition, feeding guilds and foraging strata. The regeneration site presented a higher abundance of omnivorous, granivorous and nectarivorous species, which might be related to the presence of sparser canopy, multiple opportunities for the development of grasses and forest-edge plants blooms in open areas. In contrast, higher abundance of invertebrate predators and frugivorous was found in the forested area, further confirming the relationship between those guilds and dense vegetation cover with closed canopies.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate how the temporal patterns of the most abundant species in the communities determine the succession processes in different vegetation formations of the Cerrado Biome. In the first inventory, in 2010 in the Cerrado stricto sensu and Cerradao, the diameter of all individuals 30 cm above the ground (DAS, 0.30m) >= 5.0cm was identified and measured. For the SSF in 2011, all living individuals with breast height diameter (DBH) >= 5,0 cm were measured and identified. The second inventory in the three phyto-physiognomies was carried out in 2015, when the same criteria of the previous inventory were adopted. Mortality was higher than recruitment, in all populations studied, 15 populations had no individuals recruited and only two species (Bowdichia virgilioides Kunth and Caryocar brasiliense Cambess) did not lose individuals. Changes in dynamic parameters varied among populations and recruitment was higher in populations with the highest loss of individuals, indicating that these species, regardless of their phyto-physiognomy, have a greater regeneration potential after disturbances.

   subprovinces; spatial turnover
AB Understanding the ecological and historical causes and processes that shape biodiversity distribution patterns remains a challenging and fundamental task in biogeography, ecology, and evolution. To address this issue, taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity can help us to assess the importance of ecological and historical factors that structure these biotic patterns. To make inferences about the processes underlying current spatial patterns in communities of Cricetidae across the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, their taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity were assessed jointly. Our aims were: 1) to examine taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity and their turnover and nestedness components among physiographic subprovinces; 2) to test for statistical significance of observed phylogenetic beta diversity against the expected values of a null model; and 3) to evaluate if these metrics were correlated with geographical distance. We obtained the species composition for 12 subprovinces based on distribution models for 49 cricetid species present in Oaxaca, then carried out a maximum likelihood analysis to estimate their phylogenetic relationships. Our results show that the taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarities mainly were explained by the turnover component of species and lineages. In almost all pairwise comparisons, the null model approach revealed random patterns for phylogenetic beta diversity values and its components. Mantel correlation models showed that the values of total taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and their components are correlated with the geographical distances between subprovinces. Our results suggest that both taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity are explained by the interplay between biogeographical history from southern Mexico, and the recent speciation processes in cricetid rodents. Given that speciation processes are allopatric for most cricetid taxa, the high values of spatial turnover can be explained by the small ranges of species, coupled with current abiotic conditions that act as filters, promoting specialization of species on particular conditions. Our results show the importance of the phylogenetic approach to unravel the multidimensional spatial patterns of biodiversity.

AB This study estimated 18.35 Mg C/ha in standing biomass of natural forest and 15 Mg C/ha in Hardwickia binata Roxb. plantation in a tropical dry deciduous forest located in the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. The study area of Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), Bhopal, resembled a degraded dry scrubland in 1988 and for over about three decades, the degraded forest recovered remarkably, and ecological processes evolved favorably with canopy cover reaching over 60% in some patches and about 50% in general at most part of the campus. The study was conducted in 18 randomly laid plots in natural forest and over one-acre (0.405-ha) plantation area of Hardwickia binata for assessing the above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass and subsequent carbon content. The lower-diameter classes accounted for the maximum above-ground biomass, basal area and tree density. The forest is predominantly occupied by Leucaena leucocephala, an exotic tree species which showed higher standing biomass carbon storage of 3.79 Mg C/ha followed by Holoptelea integrifolia (2.11 Mg C/ha), Azadirachta indica (1.29 Mg C/ha), Gardenia latifolia (1.26 Mg C/ha) and Lannea coromandelica (1.24 Mg C/ha) besides Hardwickia binata plantation (15 Mg C/ha). It is recommended to plant and promote local native tree species in the urban forests of tropical dry deciduous nature as a means to mitigate climate change effects.

AB Understanding how individual body size is affected by habitat quality allows us to assess the consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation on the morphology of arthropods. In this study, we examined the effect of habitat quality (litter depth and dry mass, understory density, canopy openness, and diameter at breast height of trees) on the body size of the litter dwelling scorpion Tityus pusillus Pocock, 1893 in fragmented rainforests of Brazil. The study was performed during the dry season in 10 forest fragments, and scorpions were collected with the aid of ultraviolet light lamps. Females, but not males, responded to the environmental attributes measured. Litter dry mass was positively related to individual body size of T. pusillus. These results suggest scorpion body size is sensitive to habitat structure. Environmental characteristics determine specific ranges of body size in scorpion populations, wherein smaller individuals inhabit sites that have less litterfall.

AB Coral reefs ecosystems fulfil important ecological functions, but risk degradation not only from climate change but also from increasing demands for the socioeconomic functions they also offer to local communities and international tourism. Coral reef diving tourism is a source of environmental pressure but at the same time represents a source of conservation funding, balancing these pressures. Tailoring the divers' experience to extract increased payments requires insights into the role of diving experiences for willingness to pay (WTP) for the access to dive in the waters surrounding Sipadan. We developed a choice experiment and applied it to a sample of 507 recreational scuba divers at the diving site Sipadan, Borneo in Malaysia. We investigated the role of divers' most recent and overall diving experiences for their willingness to pay additional diving fees for features related to the conservation status and the diving operations. Results show that a majority of divers prefer lower litter pollution levels in the water and lower density of divers in each dive. When comparing the less experienced divers with the more experienced divers, the latter group express significant preferences over more of the marine biodiversity and recreational attributes of the diving experience. The less experienced group only tended to express significant preferences for fewer of these attributes. We also note that less experienced divers are more likely to have felt crowded and less likely to have seen pelagic species, suggesting, which may, in turn, explain their lower observed WTP.

AB Exploring natural regeneration facilitates a better understanding of the mechanisms of community assembly and biodiversity formation. However, convincing data on tree regeneration in threatened tropical plant communities are lacking. Dacrydium pectinatum is a constructive and endangered species in tropical montane forests of Hainan Island. This study aims to identify the seedling regeneration patterns of D. pectinatum formation and their key drivers. A total of 204 seedling plots were investigated in the northwest (Bawangling, 90 plots), southwest (Jianfengling, 90 plots) and southeast (Diaoluoshan, 24 plots) of Hainan Island. We examined the variations in the seedling/adult composition, density and richness along local scales and elevation gradients and analyzed the relationships between biotic/abiotic variables and seedling regeneration. The seedling distribution pattern changed with environmental gradients, and the seedling density and richness decreased from low to high latitudes and from low to high elevations. Additionally, the adult density and total base area also showed consistent trends. At the community and species levels, the biotic neighborhood variables had a primary impact on the seedling density and richness. Multiple environmental factors (such as the canopy density, elevation, slope, soil organic matter, and soil total nitrogen) also showed significant correlations with the seedling density and richness. Our study supports conspecific negative density dependence and niche filtering as the general mechanisms of natural regeneration of D. pectinatum formations. Both biotic and abiotic factors might affect the survival and growth of seedlings, and their relative importance varies with environmental gradients and species. We conclude that enclosing forests with moderate stand densities in low-elevation areas to reduce human interference will help optimize the community structure. However, for high-elevation areas and high-density forests, appropriate thinning, manual regeneration and open gaps are needed to improve the light environment and soil nutrients, thereby promoting the natural regeneration of D. pectinatum formations.

AB Sulawesi is an important island for primates. All 17 species that are found there are endemics. The island also includes contact zones between species of macaques (genus Macaca) where hybrids may arise. Sulawesi continues to be deforested, especially in the lowlands most suitable for estate crops and other agricultural products. We carried out an island-wide review of the current extent and rates of deforestation, and the impact this is having on the habitat available to all primates and within macaque hybrid zones. The provinces of West Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi suffered the highest rate of deforestation. Macaca ochreata in Southeast Sulawesi and Tarsius pelengensis on Peleng island in Central Sulawesi have lost the most habitat at 14%, followed by M. hecki and M. tonkeana. Forest loss also occurred in all macaque contact zones. The greatest losses occurred at contact zones between the western population of M. tonkeana and M. ochreata. Corn, coffee, cocoa, and oil palm are commodities that are spreading throughout the island. The extent of deforestation in the hybrid zones is alarming, particularly as none of them are represented in protected areas. To help address these problems, a careful integration of conservation and development is suggested, including making trade-offs explicit, and conducting transdisciplinary research on social-ecological systems at the interface of policy and management at local scales.

AB Aims Multi-stemming supports plants' resilience to disturbances and then contributes to soil stabilization and forest function, especially in mountain habitats. Many questions remain about (i) the ontogenetic phase at which multiple stems can occur, (ii) how habitat drivers affect multi-stemming and (iii) whether ontogenetic phase and habitat drivers interact. We asked these questions for Quercus glauca (ring-cupped oak), the dominant species and sprouter across large warm-temperate areas of Asia; its multi-stemmed trees reflect individual survival, population regeneration and forest ecosystem stability.
   Methods In a 5-ha permanent plot of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in eastern China, we examined the temporal patterns and spatial distribution of multi-stemmed trees of Q. glauca within 99 quadrats of 20 m x 20 m.
   Important Findings There were three temporal modes for multi-stemming among the Q. glauca trees and most of them appeared to produce multiple stems from an early stage. Environmental disturbances related to slope convexity appear to be the main drivers of multi-stemming of Q. glauca. Moreover, the closer to the ridge, the earlier the multi-stemming occurs. Thus, also for other woody species in other forests and climate zones, ontogeny and environmental drivers promoting disturbance (not only geomorphology, but also extreme weather events, soil drought, fire), as well as soil fertility, need to be considered in combination to better understand multi-stemming and its consequences for community structure.

AB Mutualisms between nectarivorous birds and the plants they pollinate are functionally diverse. Nectarivorous birds which hover while feeding (the majority of hummingbirds) tend to have straight bills, while those that perch while feeding (some hummingbirds and almost all passerine nectarivores) tend to have decurved bills. Sunbirds typically use their curved bills to feed in an arc from a perching position and we thus predicted that they would prefer, and feed most efficiently on, flowers that are curved towards a perching position. To test this, we examined the responses of sunbirds to model flowers differing in curvature (straight or curved), orientation (facing upwards or downwards), and availability of a top perch (present or absent). Birds did not show preferences among model flower types in terms of number of landings to feed or number of probes. In general they preferred to use perches above model flowers, particularly those that curved upwards, but they tended to perch below model flowers that curve downwards and in such cases also took the least time to insert their bills. These results are consistent with the idea that perching birds with curved beaks will feed most efficiently from flowers that are curved towards the perching position. We discuss the implications of these results for the evolution of floral architecture, including provision of perches.

AB Fifty years ago, Janzen (1970) and Connell (1971) independently published a revolutionary idea to explain the hyperdiverse tree communities of the tropics. The essential observations were that seedfall is concentrated in the vicinity of fruiting trees, whereas saplings recruit at a distance from reproductive conspecifics. These observations were encapsulated in a simple focal-tree model constructed of intersecting curves for seedfall and escape from host-specific enemies postulated to attack propagules (seeds and seedlings) in the vicinity of reproductive conspecifics. In conflict with the thinking of the times, the mechanism operates from the top down rather than from the bottom up. A deterrent to broad acceptance has been the giant intuitive leap required to generalize the focal tree model to an entire forest community. Recent theoretical and empirical results have succeeded in bridging the gap between the focal tree model and its community-level implications. With these new findings, Janzen-Connell has come of age.

AB Riparian forests play key roles in protecting biodiversity and water resources, making them priorities for conservation in human-dominated landscapes, but fragmentation associated with expanding tropical croplands threatens their ecological integrity. We compared the structure of tropical riparian forests within intact and cropland catchments in a region of intensive soybean production in the southeastern Brazilian Amazon. We studied forest plots (varying from 120 to 210 m long) that bisected riparian zone forests and headwater streams in ten catchments. Four plots were within large areas of intact primary forest and six were in bands of protected riparian forest along streams within croplands as required by the Brazilian Forest Code. We found that riparian forests in croplands harbored fewer species of trees and seedlings/saplings, and had higher proportions of opportunistic, pioneer tree species. We also found greater variation in tree species composition, and higher internal dissimilarity in croplands compared with forests. The observed patterns in tree species composition were driven mainly by differences between riparian forest-cropland edges and those bordering intact upland forests. Forests nearest to streams in cropland and forested catchments were more similar to one another. Results suggest that wider buffers are needed at the edges of croplands to maintain riparian forest structure. The minimum 30-m riparian buffers now required by the Brazilian Forest Code may thus be insufficient to prevent long-term shifts in riparian forest species composition and structure.

AB The mission of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) is to increase "...knowledge about the past, present and future of tropical biodiversity and its relevance to human welfare." Scientists pursue their own research interests within this broad mandate. This review concerns the history of STRI and recent ecological and applied research conducted at STRI, emphasizing research that extends across decades due to sustained efforts of single investigators or multiple investigators working across generations. STRI began as a rustic field station established in the forests of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama in 1923 that prospered without outside funding setting the stage for the subsequent development of a major research center. Today, STRI employs 34 scientists, maintains nine field stations and six laboratories and hosts 1,200 visiting scientists and students each year. BCI provides examples of modern research being informed by results published up to 95 years earlier. Baselines recorded more systematically starting 50 years ago will be even more valuable in the future. The same will be true for each field station and research network described in this volume. As the natural world changes, data from these field stations and research networks will provide irreplaceable insights into how tropical forests and coral reefs once functioned and how function changed through time.

AB Tropical West African savannas are exposed to high climatic variability with potential impacts on tree growth, forest dynamics and ecosystem productivity. In such context, understanding the long-term ecological responses of savanna trees to changing environmental conditions is of great relevance for taking appropriate conservation actions. We conducted the first study on tree-ring analysis and quantitative wood anatomy on Afzelia africana Sm. in Burkina Faso, to investigate the life-span growth trajectories and wood anatomical adjustment to site and to climate variations. A total of 24 stem discs was collected in four protected forests along the Sudano-sahelian and the Sudanian climatic zones. Wood samples were analyzed using standard dendrochronological methods and quantitative wood anatomy. The mean annual growth rates varied from 1.002 (+/- 0.249) mm. year-1 in the Sudanian zone to 1.128 (+/- 0.436) mm. year-1 in the Sudano-sahelian zone. Analysis of growth trajectories showed high variations within sites and between climatic zones. Wood anatomical traits significantly varied between sites. Principal Component Analysis revealed strong relationships between ring width, wood density and vessel traits, with 82.81 % of the total variance explained. Vessel size significantly increased from the pith to the bark, highlighting the ontogenetic effects on xylem anatomical variations. Inverse relationships were found between vessel size and vessel density across the driest site and the wettest site, suggesting that the higher the rainfall, the taller the tree, the larger vessel size, but the lower vessel density. By contrast, more arid conditions and high evapotranspiration lead to smaller vessel sizes and higher vessel density. Such anatomical adjustments highlight the trade-offs between water conductance efficiency and hydraulic safety, and emphasize physiological responses to climate variability. These variations on the long-term dynamics and xylem anatomical patterns underline complex interactions between ontogenetic effects and contrasting environmental factors that affect the eco-physiological functioning of A. africana throughout the Sudanian region.

AB The Cerrado is the richest savanna and is undergoing one of the planet's most rapid land transformations for pasture and agriculture; around 45% of the biome has been deforested. Agriculture is of strategic importance to Brazil, but it also modifies ecosystems and jeopardizes habitats and biodiversity. Well-managed agricultural lands can have a favorable impact on environmental conservation. In this paper, we reviewed our current knowledge about water ecology and fire management to show that an ecosystem services perspective can bring about a conciliation of agriculture production with conservation by supporting effective land use decision-making and the optimization of public policy. The landscape/watershed scale seems to be the most relevant for decision-making on how to achieve production and conservation results. This scale appears to be an appropriate level for engaging with stakeholders. Fire frequency and timing (season) combination are determinant of individuals' survivorship. The combination determines vegetation recovery, and it is important to maintain high biodiversity, especially for the herbaceous layer, but it is a limitation to woody vegetation recovery. A pragmatic and conciliatory land use agenda must be based on scientific knowledge and support innovative decision-making solutions for policy-makers and stakeholders, particularly farmers and donors.

AB Studies of phenology and natural history of anurans provide information useful for its conservation. This is particularly important in current scenarios of emergent diseases, high rates of deforestation, and climate change. We recorded the timing of breeding of the Glass Frog Nymphargus grandisonae and its relationship to precipitation and environmental temperature for four years in a population located in the Central Andes of Colombia, South America. In addition, we recorded the causes of mortality in egg clutches of this species. We quantified infestation by fly larvae and its impact on the survival of embryos. We found that the reproductive activity of N. grandisonae (number of males calling) was seasonal and occurred in months with highest precipitation. The main cause of embryo mortality in clutches was associated with the infestation by a spittlebug fly of the genus c.f. Cladochaeta (Drosophilidae). The survival of embryos in infested clutches was significantly lower than in those clutches not infested by fly larvae. Our results provide baseline data for the monitoring of anuran population dynamics in the Andean region using the glass frog N. grandisonae as a model system.

AB Gradient analysis was used to determine factors driving small-scale variation of cloud forest communities harboring Magnolia dealbata, a threatened species and bioculturally relevant tree for the Chinantecan, Mazatecan, Nahuan, and Zapotecan ethnicities in southern Mexico. Particularly, we aimed to: (a) determine factors explaining major community gradients at different heterogeneity scales along a small-scale elevational gradient, (b) test the Decreasing and the Continuum hypotheses along elevation, and (c) classify vegetation to assist in identifying conservation priorities. We used a stratified random sampling scheme for 21 woody stands along a small-scale (352 m) elevational transect. Four main data matrices were used (presence-absence, density, basal area, and guild data). Through Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS), Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), and distance-based Redundancy Analysis (db-RDA), we found that major community variation was explained by soil pH, displaying an outstanding vegetation discontinuity, separating the species-rich relic Oreomunnea-Ticodendron-stands from stands with higher importance values for M. dealbata. The high species richness observed was explained by a combination of the windward effect of dry-seasonal maximum cloud condensation gain and habitat differentiation-specialization, a phenomenon that may also explain the mid-peak hypothesis and ensure the survival of relic species. Sampling-truncation and conservation status also played a role in this. Our results do not support the Decreasing and Continuum hypotheses along elevation.

AB Research Highlights: Rare, or sparsely distributed, species drive the floristic diversity of upland, terra firme and seasonally flooded forests in the central Jurua-a remote and hitherto floristically poorly known area in the Brazilian Amazon. Background and Objectives: Floristic inventories are critical for modelling and understanding the role of Amazonian forests in climate regulation, for sustainable management of forest resources and efficient conservation planning. Yet, detailed information about the often complex spatial distributions of many Amazonian woody plants is limited. Here, we provide information about forest structure and species composition from a remote terra firme forest and an adjacent floodplain forest in the western Brazilian Amazon. More specifically, we ask (1) how floristically different are the terra firme and floodplain forests? and (2) how variable is species composition within the same forest type? Materials and Methods: Between September 2016 and October 2017, we inventoried 97 plots (each 0.1 ha; 100 x 10 m) placed at least 800 m apart, with 46 plots in terra firme forest and 51 in seasonally flooded forest. We included all trees, hemi-epiphytes and palms with diameter at breast height (dbh) > 10 cm and woody lianas > 5 cm dbh. We examine forest structure, family- and species-level floristic composition and species diversity within and between forest types using family and species importance values, rarefaction curves and dissimilarity matrices. Results: Terra firme forest and seasonally flooded forest woody plant communities differ both in structure and species composition, which was highly variable within forest types. Many species were shared between terra firme and seasonally flooded forests, but most species were forest type-specific. Whereas species richness was greatest in the terra firme forest, floodplain species richness was among the highest regionally. Conclusions: Floodplain forests are a crucial complement to terra firme forests in terms of Amazonian woody plant diversity.

AB Degradation of tropical forests is a major driver of the global extinction crisis. A key question is understanding the role of evolution history during forest succession in the context of forest restoration for maintaining ecosystem function and stability. This study was conducted in a fragmented forest landscape in the central highlands of Vietnam. We sampled living trees with diameters at breast height of >= 6.0 cm in nineteen 0.25 ha plots to evaluate forest community structure changes over two early successional stages (<10 years and 10-20 years old) after abandonment and old-growth. We used both statistically metric and nonmetric analyses to examine correlations of community composition during successional stages and along elevational gradients. We found that (i) significant differences existed in the structural compositions between early successional forests and old-growth forests, but did not exist within early successional forests; (ii) the phylogenetic structure shifted from overdispersion to clustering with increasing successional ages; and (iii) above-ground biomass (AGB), representing ecosystem functioning, significantly increased from early-to-late successional stages, but did not correlate with phylogenetic diversity or elevation. Our results revealed that the forest community structure was strongly affected by degradation, particularly AGB and phylogenetic structure. These findings have clear implications for sustaining biodiversity persistence and ecosystem functioning in human-modified landscapes in the study region.

TI Microhabitats choice in intertidal gastropods is species-, temperature-
   and habitat-specific
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Gastropods; Behaviour; Temperature; Microhabitat choice; Aggregation
AB Understanding how behavioural adaptations can limit thermal stress for intertidal gastropods will be crucial for climate models. Some behavioural adaptations are already known to limit desiccation and thermal stresses as shell-lifting, shell-standing, towering, aggregation of conspecifics or habitat selection. Here we used the IRT (i.e. infrared thermography) to investigate the thermal heterogeneity of a rocky platform, with four different macrohabitats (i.e. bare rock, rock with barnacles, mussels and mussels incrusted by barnacles) over four thermally contrasted months. We investigated the body temperature of Littorina littorea and Patella vulgata found on this platform and the temperature of their microhabitat (i.e. the substratum within one body length around of each individual). We also considered the aggregation behaviour of each species and assessed the percentage of thermal microhabitat choice (i.e choice for a microhabitat with a temperature different than the surrounding substrate). We did not find any aggregation of L. littorea on the rocky platform during the four studied months. In contrast, P. vulgata were found in aggregates in all the studied periods and within each habitat, but there was no difference in body temperature between aggregated and solitary individuals. These two gastropods species were preferentially found on rock covered by barnacles in the four studied months. The presence of a thermal microhabitat choice in L. littorea and P. vulgata is habitat-dependent and also season-dependent. In June, July and November the choice was for a microhabitat with temperatures lower than the temperatures of the surrounding substrate whereas in December, individuals choose microhabitats with higher temperatures than the temperatures of their substratum. Taken together, these results suggest that gastropods species are able to explore their environment to find sustainable thermal macrohabitats and microhabitats and adapt this behaviour in function of the conditions of temperatures.

ID OF-THE-ART; DEFORESTATION
AB Population growth and rising incomes have led to increasing global demand for meat products. Meeting this demand without converting remaining natural ecosystems or further degrading ecosystems is one of the largest global sustainability challenges. A critical step to overcoming this challenge is to increase the productivity of livestock grazing systems, which occupy the largest land area of any type of agriculture globally. Integrated crop-livestock systems (iCL), which re-couple crop and livestock production at the farm scale, have been considered a promising strategy to tackle this challenge by restoring degraded pasturelands and providing supplemental nutrition to livestock. However, few studies have analyzed the economic viability of such systems, especially in Brazil, an important player in global food systems. This paper presents an economic analysis of iCL in Mato Grosso, Brazil, the largest grain and beef producer in the country, which spans the ecologically diverse Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes. We compare the economic performance of an integrated soybean/corn and beef cattle system to a continuous crop (soybean/corn) system and a continuous livestock (beef cattle) production system from 2005 to 2012. We use empirical case study data to characterize a 'typical' farm for each production system within the study region. We find that the integrated crop-livestock system has a higher annual net present value (NPV) per hectare (ha) than continuous cropping or livestock under a range of discount rates. However, under a scenario of substantially higher crop prices, the continuous cropping outperforms iCL. While iCL is not feasible in all regions of the Amazon and Cerrado, our results indicate that in places where the biophysical and market conditions are suitable for production, it could be a highly profitable way to intensify cattle production and potentially spare land for other uses, including conservation. Nevertheless, additional credit and technical support may be needed to overcome high upfront costs and informational barriers to increase iCL areas as a sustainable development strategy for agriculture in the Amazon and Cerrado regions.

AB In Brazil, malaria transmission is mostly confined to the Amazon, where substantial progress has been made towards disease control in the past decade. Vector control has been historically considered a fundamental part of the main malaria control programs implemented in Brazil. However, the conventional vector-control tools have been insufficient to control or eliminate local vector populations due to the complexity of the Amazonian rainforest environment and ecological features of malaria vector species in the Amazon, especially Anopheles darlingi. Malaria elimination in Brazil and worldwide eradication will require a combination of conventional and new approaches that takes into account the regional specificities of vector populations and malaria transmission dynamics. Here we present an overview on both conventional and novel promising vector-focused tools to curb malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazon. If well designed and employed, vector-based approaches may improve the implementation of malaria-control programs, particularly in remote or difficult-to-access areas and in regions where existing interventions have been unable to eliminate disease transmission. However, much effort still has to be put into research expanding the knowledge of neotropical malaria vectors to set the steppingstones for the optimization of conventional and development of innovative vector-control tools.

AB Many developing countries face a major challenge today: how to safeguard the biodiversity maintained in the fields of the rural poor which constitute a national and global public good whilst meeting those same people's development needs and rights? A solution to this dilemma has thus been sought in adapting the design and implementation of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) concepts to the conservation of agrobiodiversity.
   Here we review the application of nine such Payments for Agrobiodiversity Conservation (PACS) schemes that have been applied to date in four Latin American countries over the period 2010-2018. These covered 130 threatened varieties across a number of major food crops, and involved over 100 farming communities and 1,100 farmers (45 % of which were women). Conservation service offers were received through a competitive tender mechanism. Average bid offers revealed high heterogeneity, varying between US$675/ha. to ten times as much
   In relation to issues identified as key to PES, such as spatial targeting, differentiated payments and conditionality, the underlying design of the PACS schemes may be considered solid. PACS-related prioritisation processes allow for the a priori identification of sites with high ecosystem service densities and high threat levels. The use of competitive tenders permits accounting for cost heterogeneity in the provision of conservation services and for payments to be differentiated. Conditionality is strong.
   In terms of implementation, a "back of the envelope" calculation based on the results of the competitive tenders suggests that conservation costs are modest. For a priority conservation portfolio of 100 varieties (which may be from different crops) each with a target area of five hectares, costs would amount to just under US $860,000 over twenty years or US$70,000 p.a. at a 5 % discount rate. The small-scale and one-off nature of the interventions realised to date, along with threatened crop variety seed availability constraints, have however meant that environmental effectiveness has been incomplete in the short-term (area cultivated with specific threatened varieties increased, but still below the "not at risk" threshold). The establishment of systematic monitoring systems is required to determine longer-term impacts and inform more regular PACS interventions within a dynamically evolving systems context.

AB The genus Phytophthora represents a group of plant pathogens with broad global distribution. The majority of them cause the collar and root-rot of diverse plant species. Little is known about Phytophthora communities in forest ecosystems, especially in the Neotropical forests where natural enemies could maintain the huge plant diversity via negative density dependence. We characterized the diversity of soil-borne Phytophthora communities in the North French Guiana rainforest and investigated how they are structured by host identity and environmental factors. In this little-explored habitat, 250 soil cores were sampled from 10 plots hosting 10 different plant families across three forest environments (Terra Firme, Seasonally Flooded and White Sand). Phytophthora diversity was studied using a baiting approach and metabarcoding (High-Throughput Sequencing) on environmental DNA extracted from both soil samples and baiting-leaves. These three approaches revealed very similar communities, characterized by an unexpected low diversity of Phytophthora species, with the dominance of two cryptic species close to Phytophthora heveae. As expected, the Phytophthora community composition of the French Guiana rainforest was significantly impacted by the host plant family and environment. However, these plant pathogen communities are very small and are dominated by generalist species, questioning their potential roles as drivers of plant diversity in these Amazonian forests.

SO JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION

DE Conservation unity; Overlapping; Sufficiency; Number of papers
ID CONSERVATION; CLIMATE; TRENDS
AB Protected areas (PAs) are crucial to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Moreover, the creation, management, and efficiency of PAs are associated with the historical geography (the type of PA and number of PAs over the years), bioclimatic sufficiency, and informetric factors (number of papers and number of hits on the internet). These variables vary across the PA network, and combining these factors can help to understand biases of PAs and the future direction to preserve the Brazilian Cerrado biodiversity. In this paper, we evaluated the historical geography, bioclimatic representation, and informetric factors of the Brazilian Cerrado PAs. Although the number of PAs and the cumulative area of PAs has increased significantly, we detected that some new PAs are overlapping other PAs. The overlapping was not idiosyncratic, where some PAs categorized overlapped more than others. The number of papers and hits of PAs on the internet showed a positive correlation and asymmetric distribution, where most PAs had few papers/hits. The bioclimatic variables registered in PAs did not contemplate all bioclimatic variabilities found in the Cerrado. Thus, new areas are fundamental to increase the sufficiency of the PA network and to conserve the Cerrado biome. Our summarized analysis revealed that some variables showed a positive correlation, for example, age, area, number of papers, number of hits, and some PA categories. Finally, our results indicated concordance of some biases, e.g., historical geography and informetric factors. Besides, we recommend the addition of new PAs to increase the sufficiency of the Cerrado PA network.

TI Brazil's Amazon Soy Moratorium reduced deforestation
SO NATURE FOOD
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREST CONSERVATION; POLICY; LIMITS; RATES
AB Between 2004 and 2012, multiple policies contributed to one of the great conservation successes of the twenty-first century-an 84% decrease in the rate of Brazilian Amazon deforestation. Among the most prominent of these policies is the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an agreement by grain traders not to purchase soy grown on recently deforested land. The ASM inspired widespread adoption of similar zero-deforestation commitments, but its impact is poorly understood due to its overlap with other conservation policies. Here, we apply an econometric triple-differences model to remotely sensed deforestation data to isolate the ASM's impact within Brazil's Arc of Deforestation. We show that the ASM reduced deforestation in soy-suitable locations in the Amazon by 0.66 +/- 0.32 percentage points relative to a counterfactual control, preventing 18,000 +/- 9,000 km(2) of deforestation over its first decade (2006-2016). Although these results highlight potential benefits of private conservation policies, the ASM's success was dependent on complementarities with public property registries and deforestation monitoring.
   Disentangling the impacts of anti-deforestation interventions from other conservation efforts remains a challenge. An econometric analysis of remotely sensed data reveals the efficacy of the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation and the extent to which its success relies on complementary policies.

AB Understanding the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation and the agents of such drivers is important for introducing appropriate policy interventions. Here, we identified drivers and agents of drivers through the analysis of local perceptions using questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions, and field observations. The Likert scale technique was employed for designing the questionnaire with scores ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). We found nine direct drivers of forest deforestation and forest degradation, namely illegal logging (4.53 +/- 0.60, +/- is for standard deviation), commercial wood production (4.20 +/- 0.71), land clearing for commercial agriculture (4.19 +/- 1.15), charcoal production (3.60 +/- 1.12), land clearing for subsistence agriculture (3.54 +/- 0.75), new settlement and land migration (3.43 +/- 0.81), natural disasters (3.31 +/- 0.96), human-induced forest fires (3.25 +/- 0.96), and fuelwood for domestic consumption (3.21 +/- 0.77). We also found four main indirect drivers, namely lack of law enforcement, demand for timber, land tenure right, and population growth. Our analysis indicates that wood furniture makers, medium and large-scale agricultural investors, charcoal makers, land migrants, firewood collectors, and subsistent farmers were the agents of these drivers. Through focus group discussions, 12 activities were agreed upon and could be introduced to reduce these drivers. In addition to enforcing the laws, creating income-generating opportunities for locals along with the provision of environmental education could ensure long-term reduction of these drivers. The REDD+ project could be an option for creating local income opportunities, while reducing deforestation and forest degradation.

AB Understanding how and why species abundance distributions (SADs) vary with sampling scale has been a long-standing issue in ecology. By fitting various SAD models with observations collected in three large forest field plots, the objective of this study is to explore how the shape of SADs and the predictive ability of SAD models vary with sampling scales. Based on a large dataset collected in the Changbaishan, Jiaohe and Liangshui forests in northeastern China, observed SADs were compared with SADs estimated using five different models (log-normal, broken stick, Zipf, niche preemption and neutral model) at four sampling scales (10 x 10 m, 30 x 30 m, 60 x 60 m and 90 x 90 m). The results show that the studied SADs are scale dependent. Niche-based models provided a better fit at small sample sizes, the predictive ability decreasing with increasing sampling scale. The neutral model performed better at large sample sizes, the predictive ability increasing with increasing sampling scale. We identify the models that provided the best fit to observed species abundance distributions across spatial scales, and conclude that there is not one best SAD model for all spatial scales. Future studies should consider the scale effects on the species abundance distribution.

AB The intertidal zone is an especially stressful thermal habitat, typically exposing residents to air temperatures for up to 6 h at a time, twice daily. Tolerance to elevated temperatures has been particularly well-studied for a variety of intertidal species, especially with regard to upper thermal limits during summers. However, in recent years, as climates have been changing around the world, temperate zone intertidal organisms have sometimes been exposed to periods of unusually high air temperatures during the winter. The present study sought to examine the impact of elevated temperatures on survival and clearance rates of winter-acclimated intertidal individuals of the sedentary marine suspension-feeding gastropod Crepidula fornicata. Individuals were collected intertidally from Nahant, Massachusetts from late January to early April each year for 5 years, maintained in the laboratory at the acclimation temperature of 6 degrees C, and exposed in the laboratory for 3 h to temperatures as high as 37 degrees C in seawater either once or twice, 24 h apart. Although mean clearance rates were substantially reduced for at least the next 12-24 h after individuals were returned to the 6 degrees C control condition following exposures to elevated temperatures as low as 21-26 degrees C, we saw little mortality even following two 3 h exposures to 35 degrees C, or single exposures to 37 degrees C. Mortality was substantial, however, in one experiment following a double exposure to 37 degrees C. Smaller individuals (similar to 5-12 mm in shell length) were somewhat more sensitive to the thermal stress than adults were. Intertidal members of C. fornicata in Massachusetts seem well-prepared to deal with the increasing range of winter air temperatures associated with the global climate confusion predicted for future years. Addi-tional studies will be required to understand the physiological and biochemical mechanisms used by winter acclimated individuals of this species to tolerate such periodic substantial temperature increases of 29-31 degrees C.

AB Studying the variations in soil microbial community diversity and structure along a climate gradient can help to understand the impact of climate change on ecosystem functions regulated by soil microbes. Herein we aimed to reveal and compare the distribution patterns of soil bacterial and fungal communities along different vertical climate zones. Five climate zones from subtropical to cold temperate, with altitudes ranging from 1600 m to 3200 m corresponding to different forest types, were selected across the eastern slope of Mount Gongga. The structure and diversity patterns, co-occurrence network of soil microbial communities along the climate gradient and influential factors were studied. The bacterial Shannon and Simpson indices were higher in subtropical and cold temperate zones than in warm and mid-temperate zones, whereas fungal community diversity changed only slightly. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) indicated apparent differences in both bacterial and fungal community composition across the climate zones. The microbial co-occurrence network was more closely connected for fungal than for bacterial communities. Variation partition analysis (VPA) demonstrated that climate, vegetation and soil properties caused variations in bacterial community diversity, while spatial factors were the main factors affecting fungal diversity. These results indicate that climate zonation is more apparent for bacterial than fungal communities, and bacterial communities are more vulnerable to environmental change than fungal communities. The results also indicate that future climate change may affect ecosystem functions by altering microbial community composition structure and diversity.

AB Acid deposition from the emission of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) has become an important factor affecting the soil nutrient balance and biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. The average levels of N and S deposition in the rainy area of southwestern China from 2008 to 2010 were 9.5 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 19.3 g S m(-2) y(-1), respectively. External additions of N and S fertilizers combined with high levels of acid deposition may affect the soil ecological stoichiometry in the region's widely distributed subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. Therefore, we investigated the responses of the soil stoichiometric ratios and enzyme activities to added N ( + N), added S ( + S), added N and S ( + NS), and a control (Ctr) in the 0-20 cm layer in an evergreen broad-leaved forest in the rainy area of southwestern China from April 2013 to April 2015. The results showed that the soil total N (TN) concentration and N/P ratio were higher and the soil organic C (SOC) concentration and C/N ratio were lower in the fertilization treatments than the Ctr, although N and S additions did not significantly alter the soil total P (TP) concentration. The + N, +S, and + NS treatments increased the soil acid phosphatase activity and reduced the soil invertase, cellulase, catalase, and polyphenol oxidase activities. The +N and + NS treatments increased the soil urease activity and reduced soil peroxidase activity. The +S treatment reduced the soil urease activity and did not alter soil peroxidase activity. N and S additions had synergistic decreasing effects on the SOC concentration, C/N ratio, and soil cellulose and catalase activities. Moreover, structural equation models identified that N and S additions regulated the SOC, TN, and TP concentrations via shifting the activities of soil enzymes and the pathways differed between N addition and S addition. In conclusion, N and S additions decreased the SOC concentration, C/N ratio, and most soil C-cycle enzyme activities and increased the TN concentration, N/P ratio, and soil acid phosphatase activity. All these results indicated that external N and S additions combined with acid deposition increased soil N concentrations and exacerbated soil C and P limitations in this forest.

AB The regime of frequent small disturbances, such as the formation of tree-fall gaps, is an important mechanism maintaining the diversity in tropical forests. Occurring primarily in forest gaps, or in riparian vegetation, ant gardens (hereafter AGs) are mutualistic associations involving several epiphytic plant species and ants. In the Amazon rainforest, a widespread AGs association is assembled by two aggressive species of parabiotic ants (Camponotus femoratus and Crematogaster levior). Working together, these ants aggressively monopolize food resources and attack any intruder on the AGs. Here, we demonstrated the extended protective effect of parabiotic ants on the leaf herbivory of neighboring plants, contrasting plants with and without extrafloral nectaries (hereafter EFNs). We performed the fieldwork in South Amazonia where we found 33 forest gaps, 16 with and 17 without AGs. Independently of the presence of AGs, plants possessing EFNs have less area removed by herbivores and fewer leaves with herbivore marks than those without EFNs. This decrease in herbivory was remarkable on EFN-plants growing in gaps that also harbor AGs. Additional manipulative experiments confirmed this pattern: The AG-ants were more efficient than no-AG ants in removing live termite baits placed on EFN-plants, but few attacks were observed on plants without EFNs. Thus, AG-ants can extend their role in defending ant gardens from other plants growing in the same area, particularly those with EFNs. This extension of the mutualism benefits can affect the dynamics of the ecological succession and coevolutionary process in the Amazon forest.

AB Context Island Biogeography Theory and Habitat Amount Hypothesis postulate species richness and densities to increase with connectivity and habitat amount, while niche theory highlights the importance of environmental heterogeneity for species coexistence. Additional ecological niches in heterogeneous landscapes increase species richness and functional and phylogenetic diversity, but larger, less isolated habitats are expected to enlarge species densities by mass effects without effects on functional or phylogenetic diversity. Objectives We assessed the relative contribution of habitat amount, isolation and environmental heterogeneity on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of the particular canga vegetation, i.e., rupestrian savannas associated to banded ironstone outcrops from the Carajas Massif, Eastern Amazon. Methods We sampled vegetation at 48 sampling points comprising different physiognomies from 5 canga patches. Diversity measures were modelled as response variables in linear mixed models, using non-collinear predictors of habitat amount, isolation and environmental heterogeneity. Results Diversity and species composition differed among canga physiognomies, indicating that environmental filters segregate canga plant metacommunity in physiognomy-specific species pools. Landscape roughness, a proxy for heterogeneity on the landscape level, increases species densities and functional richness. Additionally, habitat amount was positively associated with the degree of phylogenetic relatedness and functional diversity in communities. Conclusions Our results suggest that configurational landscape heterogeneity increases the number of available ecological niches, while larger habitat amounts select for functionally and phylogenetically convergent species. These different underlying mechanisms need to be considered for management plans and reserve design for canga ecosystems, so that functional canga portions can be protected.

AB Predicting changes in the abundance of species over time is a central goal of conservation ecology. Typically, demographic data are used to parameterise models which describe population dynamics. Vital rates of plants vary across a species' distribution, yet most demographic estimates are spatially constrained. Banksia ornata (Proteaceae), a widespread serotinous obligate-seeding shrub in southern Australia, has previously had a fire management model developed based on demographic data derived from a chronosequence in one part of the species' range. We asked: are demographic data collected from a limited geographic range robust for developing population dynamic models that are applied across the broader species' range? How much variation exists in the demography of species across their range and does this matter for estimating fire return intervals necessary for species persistence? We examine site-to-site variation in the pyrodemography of six populations of B. ornata encompassing its geographic range. We documented changes in population density, time to first reproduction and canopy seed bank accumulation in stands varying in age from 0.5 to 55 years. We model year of maximum seed production on demographic parameters such as population starting density and survival rate. Density, primary juvenile period, rates of mortality and seed bank accumulation varied across populations. Primary juvenile period varied across populations (from 6 to <20 years), while time to maximum seed production was estimated to take 34-39 years after fire. Hence, the fire intervals that correspond to minimising extinction risk (due to variation in primary juvenile periods) diverge moreso among populations than the fire intervals that produce (on average) the highest maximum seed production with respect to time since fire. Demographic data collected at different locations in a species' range are likely valuable for building realistic species response models to disturbance, providing underlying assumptions about key transitions, such as mortality rate, are made explicit.

AB Plants allocate biomass to different organs in response to resource variation for maximizing performance, yet we lack a framework that adequately integrates plant responses to the simultaneous variation in above- and below-ground resources. Although traditionally, the optimal partition theory (OPT) has explained patterns of biomass allocation in response to a single limiting resource, it is well-known that in natural communities multiple resources limit growth. We study trade-offs involved in plant biomass allocation patterns and their effects on plant growth under variable below- and above-ground resources-light, soil N and P-for seedling communities.
   We collected information on leaf, stem and root mass fractions for more than 1,900 seedlings of 97 species paired with growth data and local-scale variation in abiotic resources from a tropical forest in China.
   We identified two trade-off axes that define the mass allocation strategies for seedlings-allocation to photosynthetic versus non-photosynthetic tissues and allocation to roots over stems-that responded to the variation in soil P and N and light. Yet, the allocation patterns did not always follow predictions of OPT in which plants should allocate biomass to the organ that acquires the most limiting resource. Limited soil N resulted in high allocation to leaves at the expense of non-photosynthetic tissues, while the opposite trend was found in response to limited soil P. Also, co-limitation in above- and below-ground resources (light and soil P) led to mass allocation to stems at the expense of roots. Finally, we found that growth increased under high-light availability and soil P for seedlings that invested more in photosynthetic over non-photosynthetic tissues or/and that allocated mass to roots at the expense of stem.
   Synthesis. Biomass allocation patterns to above- and below-ground tissues are described by two independent trade-offs that allow plants to have divergent allocation strategies (e.g. high root allocation at the expense of stem or high leaf allocation at the expense of allocation to non-photosynthetic tissues) and enhance growth under different limiting resources. Identifying the trade-offs driving biomass allocation is important to disentangle plant responses to the simultaneous variation in resources in diverse forest communities.

AB Recent global commitments to forest and landscape restoration in the tropics call for new management approaches that benefit both biodiversity and livelihoods of forest-dependent people. The sustainable use of wild forest products is a promising pathway, but requires clarity about harvested species' demography and harvesters' rights. Here, we explored how the exploitation of fruits of the threatened palm Euterpe edulis, a key fruit source for wildlife in Brazil's globally important Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, could trigger local community involvement in restoration. This palm has both non-destructive (fruit) and destructive (palm heart) culinary uses, each with unique biological and resource-use conditions. We quantified all demographic stages of this species in multiple agroforests, secondary forests, and protected areas to parameterize demographic projections of palm populations, harvest profitability, and fruit provisioning to wildlife under different management scenarios. Field observations showed a clear depression of adult palm populations in protected areas, likely due to palm heart poaching, and of intermediate size classes in agroforests, probably from weeding by farmers. Field data and demographic models reveal that in this region, agroforests and secondary forests can successfully conserve this species while providing lasting profits for farmers under most scenarios. These findings demonstrate a clear case where local stakeholders both contribute to and benefit from restoration through harvest of wild products and also highlight a potential source of income from regenerating tropical forests.

AB The Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot, has changed dramatically due to land use pressures causing deforestation, degradation, and forest fragmentation. A major challenge is to understand and potentially mitigate the consequences of these changes, for the capacity of forests to deliver essential environmental services to rural areas. Here, we focus on unraveling the mechanisms underpinning spatial variation in forest leaf area index. Forest leaf area index can be used as an environmental indicator that controls key forest functions underlying environmental services and is also expected to respond to land use change. Specifically, we use Structural Equation Modelling to determine the direct and indirect pathways that link environmental drivers to canopy leaf area index (LAI) variation across forest types in the Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil. We sampled 240 sample units (each 4000 m(2)), from a systematic and permanent forest inventory set which covers the State of Santa Catarina in a 10 km x 10 km grid, using hemispherical photographs. Environmental variables were extracted for each sample unit, including climatic and topographic data as well as indicators of anthropogenic pressure. Our results showed that forest types differed in their leaf area index (but not all of them) and that forest canopies show complex responses to environmental drivers, encompassing direct and indirect pathways. A major pathway was the positive effect of 'Distance to city' on the 'Percentage of cropland in the matrix'. This led to a decline in the distance of the sample unit to the forest edge, indirectly reducing LAI, presumably because of elevated tree mortality at the forest edge. 'Terrain steepness' and 'Rainfall in the driest month' independently affected the 'Percentage of cropland in the matrix' and the 'Distance to forest edge'. Halting forest fragmentation and increasing fragment size by landscape planning will mitigate these anthropogenic LAI declines. This can be achieved with a combination of legal and market mechanisms, like enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Act regulation on buffer zones around water bodies and steep slopes, landscape planning, and payment for environmental services to compensate the farmers for maintaining forest cover on otherwise productive land.

AB River Chania as a water provisioning ecosystem service gets polluted by both point and non-point pollutants threatening this critical service. Command and control strategies aid in mitigating point source pollution, but are less effective in dealing with non-point pollution making payment for ecosystem services (PES) a better choice. The plausibility of PES was evaluated from a buyer's perspective using a questionnaire survey and water quality data coupled with satellite images from Landsat. A sample of 119 respondents were chosen and stratified sampling technique utilized. A total of 50.8% depend on river water for use, 80.2% are concerned about the current state of the river and 98.4% would be willing to participate in a conservation program such as PES. PES was concluded to be plausible from this angle. Sustainable land management practices, education on good farming practices and riparian zones protection are some of the incentives these payments can be used for.

AB Crop production in water-limited environments may be enhanced through improved soil function by facilitating precipitation capture and erosion control. Soil macrofauna are known to support improved soil structure and water dynamics through ecosystem engineering activities, and their populations can be influenced by management. We examined the effect of bare summer fallow frequency on soil macrofauna communities and soil physical properties in a long-term (32-yr) dryland no-till agroecosystem experiment at two sites in eastern Colorado, USA. Treatments represented a gradient of fallow frequency and organic matter inputs, which included wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow, wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow, and continuously cropped with no planned summer fallow. The design also included a perennial grass treatment with minimal management consisting of six native grasses. We observed links between soil macrofauna and soil functional metrics, particularly related to soil aggregation and water infiltration. There was a trend toward higher macrofauna populations and soil function with increased cropping system intensity, and perennial grass outperformed the cropped treatments significantly for most soil health parameters. Multivariate analyses revealed that different treatments support relatively distinct macrofauna communities. Our results suggest that soil macrofauna populations may be important facilitators of soil structure and associated water dynamics in dryland no-till agroecosystems and respond positively to reduced fallow and higher organic inputs.

AB Plant morphology and physiology change with growth and development. Some of these changes are due to change in plant size and some are the result of genetically programmed developmental transitions. In this study we investigate the role of the developmental transition, vegetative phase change (VPC), on morphological and photosynthetic changes.
   We used overexpression of microRNA156, the master regulator of VPC, to modulate the timing of VPC in Populus tremula x alba, Zea mays, and Arabidopsis thaliana to determine its role in trait variation independent of changes in size and overall age.
   Here, we find that juvenile and adult leaves in all three species photosynthesize at different rates and that these differences are due to phase-dependent changes in specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf N but not photosynthetic biochemistry. Further, we found juvenile leaves with high SLA were associated with better photosynthetic performance at low light levels.
   This study establishes a role for VPC in leaf composition and photosynthetic performance across diverse species and environments. Variation in leaf traits due to VPC are likely to provide distinct benefits under specific environments; as a result, selection on the timing of this transition could be a mechanism for environmental adaptation.

AB Invasive ants are a significant pest around the world and have negative impact on natural and agricultural environments. Chemical control is mainly accomplished with residual sprays and toxic baits. Hydrogel baits are a novel bait formulation that has proven highly effective against multiple invasive ant species, but potential non-target effects have not been investigated. The baits are typically saturated in 25% sucrose solution which makes them attractive to foraging ants and potentially non-target organisms such as pollinators. The objective of the current study was to perform field studies to assess the potential attractiveness of hydrogel baits to various pollinating and non-pollinating arthropods in a variety of ecosystems, including tallgrass prairies, urban pollinator gardens, and commercial apiaries. The study focused on social Hymenoptera as pesticides are acutely toxic to various Hymenoptera and have been implicated as one of the contributing factors in pollinator declines. Results show that Diptera were overwhelmingly the most common visitors and accounted for >40% of all visitors. Other common groups included beetles and yellowjackets. Common pollinating insects such as honeybees, solitary bees, and butterflies rarely visited the baits and accounted for ca. 3% of all visits and were never found on ground baits. Results show that the risk to pollinators is relatively low; most arthropods attracted to the baits were taxa that are extremely abundant, not of conservation concern, and in some cases pestiferous or invasive. The deployment of hydrogels for invasive ant control in areas where multiple invasive insect taxa are present may have the additional benefit of controlling multiple pests.

AB Functional redundancy (FR) is commonly invoked as one of the main mechanisms underlying ecological resilience. However, little is known about the extension of FR from single to multiple functions and its variation among ecological assemblages at biogeographic scales. We studied 51 assemblages of Eurasian small mammals (Mammalia: Rodentia and Mammalia: Soricomorpha), analyzing FR across and within assemblages. We quantified FR for trait sets related to five different functions: parasitic interactions, diet, habitat preferences, body mass and diel activity. We then evaluated the relationships between FR based on different functional trait sets across and within mammal assemblages, to determine whether small mammal assemblages and their species are redundant for single or multiple trait sets and thus, whether they are complementary or fully redundant when considering multiple functions. Further, we analyzed the influence of geography, climate, plant productivity and land use on FR. We found that FR based on mammal parasitic interactions, body mass and diel activity were positively correlated, whereas FR based on mammal body mass and habitat preferences were negatively related. These relationships were consistent across and within mammal assemblages. Additionally, FR mainly varied along geographic gradients (latitude and longitude). FR based on parasitic interactions, body mass and diel activity followed similar patterns, increasing at northern latitudes, possibly as a response to environmental filtering processes. FR for diet and habitat preferences increased at easterly longitudes, which may be due to landscape homogeneity in sites across central and eastern Asia. Despite redundancy across multiple functional trait sets, Eurasian small mammal assemblages were complementary when considering all five trait sets. Our results warn against conclusions drawn from the study of FR based on traits related to a single function.

AB Lake Tana Basin is located in upper Blue Nile Basin which is comprises a total area of 15,096 km(2) of which 3063 km(2) is covered by the Lake which is the source of Blue Nile river. Lake Tana Basin and Blue Nile River provide various benefits also for downstream countries. The basin is highly degraded by different natural and manmade problems and it influence both Ethiopia and downstream countries. The main cause of basin degradation is inappropriate LULC. Huge area of cultivated land using without suitable management is the major basin problem. It is due to insure food security coming from unprecedented population growth rate. Forested land has encouraged the infiltration capacity and permeability of the land. It helps to increase the recharge capacity contribute to base flow whereas it is vice versa for cultivated land which is quick overland flow and significant soil erosion have observed. Besides, the soil erosion from agricultural land is the main source of nutrient enters to the lake which is the cause for eutrophication. To combat such problems both up and downstream countries should discuss together and design and implement appropriate basin management strategies to sustain the biodiversity and hydrological system of the basin.

AB The studies of bat flies of the family Streblidae Kolenati, 1863 in Mexico have intensified in the last five years, usually providing new geographical records of species and new bats host records. Currently, the Mexican fauna of streblids is composed of 59 species, representing 26% of total global species richness. Veracruz is one of the states with a high number of species in Mexico with 69% of species recorded in the country. We sampled a total of 527 bats of four subfamilies and 12 species, collecting a total of 870 specimens of 19 species of streblids. Megistopoda proxima (Seguy, 1926) and Paratrichobius longicrus (Miranda Ribeiro, 1907) were the most abundant species in the collection and are the two species found in a higher number of bat species. We provide comments on the taxonomy and host species for bat flies, increase the species records for this state, and add new host records for some streblids, contributing to the knowledge of streblid fauna of the mountain central region of the state of Veracruz, Mexico.

AB Aim The spatio-temporal connectivity of forest patches in lowland agricultural landscapes and their age matter to explain current biodiversity patterns across regional as well as biogeographical extents, to the point that their effect exceeds the one of macroclimate for plant diversity in the understorey of temperate forests. Whether this remains true for other taxonomic groups is still largely unknown. Yet, this relative influence has important consequences for ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services. Focusing on carabid beetle assemblages, we assessed the relative importance of macroclimatic, landscape and patch attributes in driving local species richness (alpha-diversity) and species dissimilarity between patches (beta-diversity).
   Location Deciduous forest patches in seven regions along a 2,100-km-long latitudinal gradient across the European temperate forest biome, from southern France to central Sweden.
   Methods We sampled 221 forest patches in two 5-km x 5-km landscape windows with contrasting management intensities. Carabid beetles were classified into four habitat-preference guilds: forest-specialist, forest-generalist, eurytopic and open-habitat species. We quantified the multi-level environmental influence using mixed-effects models and variation partitioning analysis.
   Results We found that both alpha- and beta-diversity were primarily determined by macroclimate, acting as a large-scale ecological filter on carabid assemblages among regions. Forest-patch conditions, including biotic and abiotic heterogeneity as well as patch age (but not patch size), increased alpha-diversity of forest species. Landscape management intensity weakly influenced alpha-diversity of forest species, but increased the number of non-forest species in forest patches. Beta diversity of non-forest species increased with patch heterogeneity and decreased with landscape management intensity.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight the leading role of broad macroclimatic gradients over local and landscape factors in determining the composition of local carabid communities, thereby shedding light on macroecological patterns of arthropod assemblages. This study emphasizes the urgent need for preserving ancient forest patches embedded in agricultural landscapes, even the small and weakly connected ones.

AB Entomophthoralean fungi with pathogenic abilities to infect social insects are rare. Here, we describe a fungus isolated from leafcutter ants. Morphologically, the fungus has spherical primary conidia and two types of microconidia: one with the same shape as the primary conidia and another with an elliptical to half-moon shape. The fungus also produces villose conidia known previously only from Conidiobolus coronatus. A multilocus phylogenetic analysis was performed with nuc rDNA sequences from three regions (28S, 18S, and internal transcribed spacer [ITS]). Our isolates are distinguished as a new species, described here as Conidiobolus lunulus, and is more closely related to C. brefeldianus than to C. coronatus, despite the greater morphological resemblance to the latter. Morphological differences, unique phylogenetic placement, and isolation from an altogether new host support this finding. This is the first record of an entomophthoralean species isolated from leafcutter ants.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) management remains a critical challenge for agriculture worldwide, and yet we are still unable to predict soil P dynamics as confidently as that of carbon (C) or nitrogen (N). This is due to both the complexity of inorganic P (P-i) and organic P (P-o) cycling and the methodological constraints that have limited our ability to trace P dynamics in the soil-plant system. In this review, we describe the challenges for building parsimonious, accurate, and useful biogeochemical models that represent P dynamics and explore the potential of new techniques to usher P biogeochemistry research and modeling forward. We conclude that research efforts should focus on the following: (1) updating the McGill and Cole (1981) model of P-o mineralization by clarifying the role and prevalence of biochemical and biological P-o mineralization, which we suggest are not mutually exclusive and may co-occur along a continuum of P-o sub-strate stoichiometry; (2) further understanding the dynamics of phytate, a six C compound that can regulate the poorly understood stoichiometry of soil P; (3) exploring the effects of C and P-o saturation on P sorption and P-o mineralization; and (4) resolving discrepancies between hypotheses about P cycling and the methods used to test these hypotheses.

AB Common approaches to reverse the trend of tropical deforestation and loss of wildlife include systems of protected areas (PAs) such as national parks, payments for ecosystem services programs (PES) that provide financial reward to landowners protecting their forests, and ecotourism that attempts to increase local economic gains and protect biodiversity while minimizing detrimental ecological effects from tourists. For example, Costa Rica successfully reversed deforestation by restoring forest cover from 24.4% in 1985 to >50% by 2011 through implementation of national environmental protection policies in the 1990s that included a portfolio of PAs, PES, and ecotourism. However, the social-ecological effectiveness of this conservation portfolio in terms of interactions between deforestation, biodiversity, and community participation is not clear across local scales. Therefore, we conducted multitemporal geospatial analysis to determine forest cover change from 2001-2017, broad census surveys to determine primate species richness and group encounter rate, and surveyed private landowners to determine participation in PES and ecotourism across four regions of Costa Rica. Net forest loss varied seven-fold across regions and occurred in both protected and non-protected areas across all regions from 2001-2017, although rates were lower inside PAs. Primate group encounter rate varied significantly across all regions with an 11-fold difference between the region with the most primates compared to the region with the least. All but one region contained the full community of primate species present. Participation in conservation incentives also varied seven-fold across regions, with those reporting the highest participation having the highest primate density and diversity, as well as the lowest deforestation rates. These results suggest that the most effective strategy to simultaneously curb tropical deforestation, protect primates, and ensure community benefits may depend on a complete portfolio of PAs, PES, and ecotourism, rather than a subset of these strategies. Future studies will explore finer scale differences and similarities across PA, PES, and ecotourism forests, including measures of primate physiology and behavior, forest structure, and pesticide exposure.

AB The decline in Urmia Lake basin's water resources has resulted in a severe drought of the lake. The drought of this hyper-saline lake has put lives of 6.4 million inhabitants at risk. This study was conducted to assess the technical and economic employability of a payment for ecosystem services (PES) method as a policy tool to improve water resources management of Siminehroud river basin which is the most important tributary of Urmia Lake basin. For this purpose, the target areas were identified after the development of a land-use map for the basin. Then, by recruiting the integrated interview method and distributing 398 questionnaires, the required data were collected to assess the employability of the proposed PES method. Among various PES schemes, two methods including a) payment for shifting irrigation methods and b) payment to change cropping patterns in the frame of "Willingness to Accept" (WTA) were proposed to farmers. The results suggest that farmers highly welcomed both proposed methods. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for the change in irrigation system was 3.98, whereas the changes for the cropping pattern were 0.8 (for rapeseed), 0.72 (for soybean), and 1.09 (for safflower). As a result, shifting irrigation methods and changing cultivation patterns to safflower are both economically justifiable.

AB Vertical stratification (VS) is a widespread phenomenon in plant and animal communities in forests and a key factor for structuring their species richness and biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests. The organisms composing forest communities adjust and shape the complex three-dimensional structure of their environment and inhabit a large variety of niches along the vertical gradient of the forest. Even though the degree of VS varies among different vertebrate groups, patterns of compositional stratification can be observed across taxa. Communities of birds, bats, primates, and non-flying small mammals are vertically stratified in terms of abundance, species richness, diversity, and community composition. Frugivorous members of these taxa play important roles as seed dispersers and forage on fruit resources that, in turn, vary in quantity and nutritional value along the vertical gradient. As a consequence, plant-seed disperser interaction networks differ among strata, which is manifested in differences in interaction frequencies and the degree of mutual specialization. In general, the canopy stratum is composed of strong links and generalized associations, while the lower strata comprise weaker links and more specialized interactions. Investigating the VS of communities can provide us with a better understanding of species habitat restrictions, resource use, spatial movement, and species interactions. Especially in the face of global change, this knowledge will be important as these characteristics can imply different responses of species and taxa at a fine spatial scale.

AB Physical disturbances, such as fire, may affect the relationship between ants and plants. We evaluated the extent to which severe fires alter the protective effect of ants against the herbivores of an extrafloral-nectary bearing tree. We performed an ant removal experiment and sampled the ant fauna from the same trees over 4 years: the pre-fire year, the fire-year, and again 1 and 2 years later. Ants reduced insect herbivory in the pre-fire year and in the fire-year but failed to provide any plant protection in the two years after fire. The magnitude of the ant effect on herbivory did not differ between the pre-fire year and the fire-year. Fire reduced the abundance of ants with strictly arboreal-nesting habits. However, in the fire year (but not in the subsequent ones), this decline was compensated by an increase in the abundance of arboreal generalists and ground-nesting ants foraging in trees. Our results indicate that severe fires can affect the strength and direction of the ant effects on herbivory by altering the structure of the arboreal ant community and the abundance of insect herbivores. Fire disturbance is thus an important factor of conditionality of ant-plant mutualisms in fire-prone habitats, like the Cerrado savannas.

AB We report the first casual record of Eurasian wild boar Sus scrofa in Nahuelbuta Mountain Area. located in the coastal Temperate Forest of south-central Chile. Camera-trapping was conducted between January 2018 and February 2019 at two sites comprised by native native forest and commercial tree plantations. Wild boars were detected within plantations of Monterey pine mainly during Austral summer (December to February). daytime (between 11:00 and 20:00) and close (3 km) to Nahuelbuta National Park. The combination of its highly adaptable generalist behaviour and the extensive presence of commercial tree plantations in Nahuelbuta Mountain Area may favour the expansion of the invasive wild boar throughout this imperilled ecosystem, including its potential occurrence within the small and isolated protected areas present in it.

AB Research Highlights: Frugivores able to disperse large seeds over large distances are indispensable for seedling recruitment, colonization and regeneration of tropical forests. Understanding their effectiveness as seed dispersal agents in degraded habitat is becoming a pressing issue because of escalating anthropogenic disturbance. Although of paramount importance in the matter, animal behaviour's influence on seed shadows (i.e., seed deposition pattern of a plant population) is difficult to evaluate by direct observations. Background and Objectives: We illustrated a modeling approach of seed shadows incorporating field-collected data on a troop of northern pigtailed macaques (Macaca leonina) inhabiting a degraded forest fragment in Thailand, by implementing a mechanistic model of seed deposition with random components. Materials and Methods: We parameterized the mechanistic model of seed deposition with macaque feeding behavior (i.e., consumed fruit species, seed treatments), gut and cheek pouch retention time, location of feeding and sleeping sites, monthly photoperiod and movement patterns based on monthly native fruit availability using Hidden Markov models (HMM). Results: We found that northern pigtailed macaques dispersed at least 5.5% of the seeds into plantation forests, with a majority of medium- to large-seeded species across large distances (mean > 500 m, maximum range of 2300 m), promoting genetic mixing and colonization of plantation forests. Additionally, the macaques produced complementary seed shadows, with a sparse distribution of seeds spat out locally (mean >50 m, maximum range of 870 m) that probably ensures seedling recruitment of the immediate plant populations. Conclusions: Macaques' large dispersal distance reliability is often underestimated and overlooked; however, their behavioral flexibility places them among the last remaining dispersers of large seeds in disturbed habitats. Our study shows that this taxon is likely to maintain significant seed dispersal services and promote forest regeneration in degraded forest fragments.

AB Indonesia's new planned capital in East Kalimantan is being touted as a "smart, green, beautiful and sustainable city" but has stoked fears of massive environmental damage to the island of Borneo, one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots and carbon sinks. Precedents of other planned capitals can contribute to an understanding of the potential long-term impacts of Indonesia's new capital. We used historical nighttime lights to quantitatively assess the spatial growth footprint of 12 previous planned capitals, and conducted land-use analyses to identify the potential environmental impacts on Borneo's natural environment. Our assessment suggests that it is likely that the direct footprint of the new capital could grow rapidly, expanding over 10 km from its core in less than two decades and over 30 km before mid-century. We identified sensitive ecosystems which may be affected by the new capital's direct and indirect footprint, such as forest reserves, mangrove and peat. Deforestation emissions from the new capital's direct (30 km) and indirect (200 km) footprint could be approximately 50 MtCO(2e) and 2326 MtCO(2e) respectively, equivalent to 2.7% and 126% of Indonesia's 2014 greenhouse gas emissions. We discuss how planned capitals can spatially restructure the socio-political geographies of cities and nation-states by interacting with meanings, symbolisms and power relations, which may aggravate environmental impacts but also be seized upon as a catalyst for improving environmental performance in Borneo and Indonesia. Finally, we recommend the use of best practices in impact assessment and sustainability as a necessary first step towards protecting Borneo.

AB Payments for forest environmental services (PFES) is a major breakthrough policy in the Vietnamese forestry sector because it contributes 25% of the total investments in the forestry sector and serves as the first market-based instrument employed to protect forests. However, there is little empirical evidence of its effectiveness. Is the policy meeting the core objectives of improving forest cover and forest quality and is it also achieving its claims of supporting local livelihoods? This paper analyses the environmental, social, and economic impacts of PFES in Son La province, the longest standing implementation of a PFES scheme in Vietnam. Our study uses a sampling method that incorporates pre-matching and a before-after-control-intervention approach. Data was collected from government statistics, remote sensing analysis, focus group discussions involving 236 people, surveys with a total of 240 households, and key informant interviews with 45 people. Our findings show that additionality of PFES in Son La is controversial and depends on who collects the data and what data is used to evaluate the impacts of PFES. Data collection is also politicized to serve central, provincial and district government interests. Evidence shows that PFES has provided little additional income to individual villagers to protect forests in Son La. However, total PFES revenue paid to communities generates significant income for village communities. Moreover, not all villagers can receive continuous payments from PFES, meaning that PFES has not become a stable source of income, rendering the permanence of PFES limited. Improving monitoring and evaluation policies coupled with transparent, inclusive, independent mechanisms are essential to providing a more accurate reflection of impacts from PFES in Vietnam.

AB Farmers in developing countries depend on communal natural resources, yet countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are facing the severe degradation of communal lands due to the so-called "tragedy of the commons". For the sustainable management of common resources, policy interventions, such as farmer seminars, are necessary to ensure high-level cooperation among farmers for land conservation. However, the effects of this type of information provision are not well known. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the dissemination of conservation information on collaborative communal forest management using an economic field experiment with 936 farmers selected by random sampling from 11 villages in the northern Ethiopian Highlands. We conducted a public goods game experiment using a framework of voluntary contribution to communal land conservation with an intervention to remind participants about the consequence of their behaviors. The results show that the volunteer contribution increased after the intervention, and thereafter the decay of the contribution was slow. The results indicate that providing information about the consequences leads to a higher contribution. The effects of information provision are heterogeneous in terms of social condition, such as access to an urban area and social capital, and individual characteristics, such as wealth. These findings imply that information provision effectively improves farmer collaboration toward natural resource conservation in developing countries.

AB Tropical forest regions in equatorial Africa are threatened with degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss as a result of land-cover change. We investigated historical land-cover dynamics in unprotected forested areas of the Littoral Region in south-western Cameroon during 1975-2017, to detect changes that may influence this important biodiversity and wildlife area. Processed Landsat imagery was used to map and monitor changes in land use and land cover. From 1975 to 2017 the area of high-value forest landscapes decreased by c. 420,000 ha, and increasing forest fragmentation caused a decline of c. 12% in the largest patch index. Conversely, disturbed vegetation, cleared areas and urban areas all expanded in extent, by 32% (c. 400,000 ha), 5.6% (c. 26,800 ha) and 6.6% (c. 78,631 ha), respectively. The greatest increase was in the area converted to oil palm plantations (c. 26,893 ha), followed by logging and land clearing (c. 34,838 ha), all of which were the major factors driving deforestation in the study area. Our findings highlight the increasing threats facing the wider Littoral Region, which includes Mount Nlonako and Ebo Forest, both of which are critical areas for regional conservation and the latter a proposed National Park and the only sizable area of intact forest in the region. Intact forest in the Littoral Region, and in particular at Ebo, merits urgent protection.

AB Information about the effects of environmental degradation on the health of terrestrial forest wildlife is limited, especially for rare species. In this study, we analyse the influence of ecological factors such as landscape characteristics and seasonality on the health status of Baird's tapirs in Calakmul, Mexico. We collected georeferenced photographic records of healthy (n = 32) and unhealthy (n = 22) tapirs from 2008 to 2019 and characterized landscape composition around each record at three spatial scales (circular buffers of 1, 2 and 3-km radii according to Baird's tapir home ranges). Our logistic model building process consisted in selecting the best spatial scale for each landscape cover class, before including them along with distance to human settlements and seasonality in a full model. The model that best explained the occurrence of unhealthy tapirs included the percentage of agriculture within a 1-km radius. This study hints at the negative effect that land-use change to agriculture occurring in Calakmul might have on tapir health, with 95.45% of unhealthy tapirs recorded in such landscapes. Further studies should investigate the proximate determinants of tapir health in anthropogenic landscapes, which might be linked to stress or to contact with domestic animals.

AB The eophylls (first photosynthetic leaves) of palm trees play crucial roles in seedling establishment, although information concerning their development and ecophysiology remain scarce. This work sought to evaluate eophyll development and the effects of shading on young plants of the neotropical oil palm Attalea vitrivir. Eophyll ontogenesis was characterized, and the effects of shading levels (0, 58, 73 and 93%) on their anatomy, histochemistry, and seedling development where evaluated. Photosynthetic responses were compared between plants exposed to full sunlight or shade. After germination, the cotyledonary petiole elongates downward, which promotes the burial of the vegetative axis. Two eophylls are formed by the apical meristem, and they develop a short petiole and a much-folded blade that grows through the action of a basal meristem. The eophylls emerge below soil level and show a typical leaf structure and an intense and diverse vasculature. Shading levels do not affect blade tissue thicknesses, stomatal density, or the presence of primary and secondary metabolic compounds. A low photosynthetic performance under shade conditions is compensated by greater blade growth, so that plant development is not affected by shading. The ontogenesis of A. vitrivir eophylls below the soil surface and their response to shading contributes to seedling establishment and the adaptation of the species to seasonal and anthropized environments.

AB Long-term additions of lime and/or phosphate fertilizer caused an indirect and/or direct increase in the availability of P in mixed mesophytic deciduous forest soil on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau, southeast Ohio, USA. As expected, the activities of extracellular phosphatases declined across all treatments (by 23-65%), in both organic and mineral soil horizons. In contrast, there were few effects of P availability on either C or N acquiring extracellular enzyme activities. However, enzyme vector analysis showed the relative activity of phosphatases decreased with respect to N-acquiring enzymes (vector angles fell 4-30%) and the relative activity of C acquisition increased (vector lengths rose 9-51%) relative to the activities of both N and P acquiring enzymes. Thus, the overall ecoenzymatic stoichiometry of extracellular enzymes was altered by P availability. Also, the relative contribution of phosphodiesterase declined relative to phosphomonoesterase by an average of 16 +/- 16% as overall phosphatase activity declined, suggesting a reduction in the relative contribution of the less efficient enzyme as P demand decreased. Finally, contrary to expectations, the relative contribution of leucine aminopeptidase to total N acquiring enzyme activity did not increase with pH, but showed a bimodal relationship to soil NH4+ concentration. In summary, phosphatase activity declined with increased P availability but with little response in C or N acquiring activity suggesting emerging co-limitations by C and/or N in this ecosystem.

AB A goal of ecology is to identify the stabilizing mechanisms that maintain species diversity in the face of competitive exclusion and drift. For tropical forest tree communities, it has been hypothesized that high diversity is maintained via Janzen-Connell effects, whereby host-specific natural enemies prevent any one species from becoming too abundant. Here we explore the plausibility of this hypothesis with theoretical models. We confirm a previous result that when added to a model with drift but no competitive exclusion-that is, a neutral model where intrinsic fitnesses are perfectly equalized across species-Janzen-Connell effects maintain very high species richness that scales strongly with community size. However, when competitive exclusion is introduced-that is, when intrinsic fitnesses vary across species-the number of species maintained by Janzen-Connell effects is substantially reduced and scales much less strongly with community size. Because fitness variation is pervasive in nature, we conclude that the potential of Janzen-Connell effects to maintain diversity is probably weak and that the mechanism does not yet provide a sufficient explanation for the observed high diversity of tropical forest tree communities. We also show that, surprisingly, dispersal limitation can further reduce the ability of Janzen-Connell effects to maintain diversity.

AB The massive development of oil palm plantations puts significant pressure on forest converting in Melawi Regency, West Kalimantan Province. This is supported by the target of opening 200,000 ha of new oil palm plantations in West Kalimantan Province until 2034. Meanwhile, deforestation is the most critical climate change issue in tropical countries including Indonesia. This research examines the feasibility of clearing forest areas to be converted to palm oil plantations. This research employs the insurance approach to assess the benefits of forest ecosystems. Based on the calculation of the cost-benefits of financial and environmental feasibility, it is found that the protection of forest ecosystems is more feasible than opening palm oil plantations. However, based on the socio-economic cost-benefit calculation results, it is found that opening palm oil plantations is more feasible to implement than ecosystem protection activities. Finally, from the calculation of the total benefits-cost financial, environmental, and socio-economic feasibility, it is found that forest ecosystem protection activities are more feasible to implement than opening palm oil plantations. Another finding stated that an opening of 10,000 ha forest area for palm oil plantations would cause 6.4401 times more damage than the benefits that might be obtained if 10,000 ha of forest area ecosystem is not converted into a palm oil plantation area.

AB A better understanding of seed movement in plant community dynamics is needed, especially in light of disturbance-driven changes and investments into restoring degraded plant communities. A primary agent of change within the sagebrush-steppe is wildfire and invasion by non-native forbs and grasses, primarily cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). Our objectives were to quantify seed removal and evaluate ecological factors influencing seed removal within degraded sagebrush-steppe by granivorous Owyhee harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex salinus Olsen). In 2014, we sampled 76 harvester ant nests across 11 plots spanning a gradient of cheatgrass invasion (40%-91% cover) in southwestern Idaho, United States. We presented seeds from four plant species commonly used in postfire restoration at 1.5 and 3.0 m from each nest to quantify seed removal. We evaluated seed selection for presented species, monthly removal, and whether biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., distance to nearest nest, temperature) influenced seed removal. Our top model indicated seed removal was positively correlated with nest height, an indicator of colony size. Distance to seeds and cheatgrass canopy cover reduced seed removal, likely due to increased search and handling time. Harvester ants were selective, removing Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) more than any other species presented. We suspect this was due to ease of seed handling and low weight variability. Nest density influenced monthly seed removal, as we estimated monthly removal of 1,890 seeds for 0.25 ha plots with 1 nest and 29,850 seeds for plots with 15 nests. Applying monthly seed removal to historical restoration treatments across the western United States showed harvester ants can greatly reduce seed availability at degraded sagebrush sites; for instance, fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) seeds could be removed in <2 months. Collectively, these results shed light on seed removal by harvester ants and emphasize their potential influence on postfire restoration within invaded sagebrush communities.

AB Background Honeybees have extraordinary phenotypic plasticity in their senescence rate, making them a fascinating model system for the evolution of aging. Seasonal variation in senescence and extrinsic mortality results in a tenfold increase in worker life expectancy in winter as compared to summer. To understand the evolution of this remarkable pattern of aging, we must understand how individual longevity scales up to effects on the entire colony. In addition, threats to the health of honey bees and other social insects are typically measured at the individual level. To predict the effects of environmental change on social insect populations, we must understand how individual effects impact colony performance. We develop a matrix model of colony demographics to ask how worker age-dependent and age-independent mortality affect colony fitness and how these effects differ by seasonal conditions. Results We find that there are seasonal differences in honeybee colony elasticity to both senescent and extrinsic worker mortality. Colonies are most elastic to extrinsic (age-independent) nurse and forager mortality during periods of higher extrinsic mortality and resource availability but most elastic to age-dependent mortality during periods of lower extrinsic mortality and lower resource availability. Conclusions These results suggest that seasonal changes in the strength of selection on worker senescence partly explain the observed pattern of seasonal differences in worker aging in honey bees. More broadly, these results extend our understanding of the role of extrinsic mortality in the evolution of senescence to social animals and improve our ability to model the effects of environmental change on social insect populations of economic or conservation concern.

AB Tropical forests are fundamental ecosystems, essential for providing terrestrial primary productivity, global nutrient cycling, and biodiversity. Despite their importance, tropical forests are currently threatened by deforestation and associated activities. Moreover, tropical regions are now mostly represented by secondary forest regrowth, with half of the remaining tropical forests as secondary forest. Soil invertebrates are an important component to the functioning and biodiversity of these soil ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how these past land-use activities and subsequent secondary forest developments have altered the soil invertebrate communities and any potential ecological consequences associated with this. DNA metabarcoding offers an effective approach to rapidly monitor soil invertebrate communities under different land-use practices and within secondary forests. In this study, we used DNA metabarcoding to detect community-based patterns of soil invertebrate composition across a primary forest, a 23-year-old secondary forest, and a 33-year-old secondary forest and the associated soil environmental drivers of the soil invertebrate community structure in the Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge of Costa Rica (MNWR). We also used a species contribution analysis (SIMPER) to determine which soil invertebrate groups may be an indication of these soils reaching a pre-disturbed state such as a primary forest. We found that the soil invertebrate community composition at class, order, family, and ESV level were mostly significantly different across that habitats. We also found that the primary forest had a greater richness of soil invertebrates compared to the 23-year-old and 33-year-old secondary forest. Moreover, a redundancy analysis indicated that soil moisture influenced soil invertebrate community structure and explained up to 22% of the total variation observed in the community composition across the habitats; whereas soil invertebrate richness was structured by soil microbial biomass carbon (C) (C-mic) and explained up to 52% of the invertebrate richness across the primary and secondary forests. Lastly, the SIMPER analysis revealed that Naididae, Entomobryidae, and Elateridae could be important indicators of soil and forest recuperation in the MNWR. This study adds to the increasing evidence that soil invertebrates are intimately linked with the soil microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) and that even after 33 years of natural regrowth of a forest, these land use activities can still have persisting effects on the overall composition and richness of the soil invertebrate communities.

AB Earth system models predict large increases in global terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) over the next century, largely reflecting positive effects of climate change and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on plant growth. However, while theory predicts that soil phosphorus (P) availability may keep pace with P demand as the climate warms, we lack experimental evidence to support this prediction. Here, using a set of laboratory experiments and incubations, we measured both the effect of temperature on the mechanism of biochemical P mineralization-phosphatase (Ptase) enzyme activities-and on rates of soil P mineralization in soils from a range of ecosystem types from the tropics to the Arctic. Consistent with temperature effects on soil nitrogen (N) mineralization, we found that both Ptase activities and P availability in soil increased with temperature following macromolecular rate theory (MMRT) based kinetics. However, across all sites and temperatures, there was no relationship between Ptase activity and mineralized P, indicating that the potential responses of P mineralization with warming vary among ecosystems. The lack of relationship between Ptase and P availability with increasing temperature is consistent with previous work showing that P mineralization rates are also strongly affected by other biotic and abiotic factors, including organic P substrate availability and the geochemical properties of soil. However, our results indicate that the use of Ptase temperature kinetics alone as a proxy for soil P mineralization in terrestrial ecosystems is insufficient to predict future P availability accurately, and modeling efforts that do so will likely overestimate the effects of temperature on soil P availability.

AB In a local community of closely related species exploiting the same food source its abundance as a strong selective pressure directs the ecological niche partitioning that can be mirrored in different life-history traits. In dung beetles (Scarabaeoidea) that feed on patchy and timely limited excrements of large vertebrates, competition is mirrored in their specific adaptations in behaviour and morphology. In a local community from Slovenia, we sought for a morphological variation of 36 morphological traits in 28 dung beetle species belonging to two families (Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae) that can be linked to their evolutionary background (family, subfamily, tribe, species) and their life style (i.e. nesting behaviour: rollers, dwellers, tunnelers). We showed that morphological traits specific for each ecomorphological group reflect the functional adaptations to their life strategies of nesting behaviour, but also phylogenetic (family, subfamily) membership. The unique combinations of evolutionary background and same life styles within/among different phylogenetic lineages (families, subfamilies, tribes) revealed the morphological traits that are a result of different evolutionary scenarios (convergences/divergences between members of different/same phylogenetic lineage with same/different life nesting behaviour). At least four (Aphodiinae - dwellers, Geotrupinae - tunnelers, Scarabaeinae - tunnelers, Scarabaeinae - rollers) ecomorphological groups were recognised from a local community, but an existence of a possible fifth group represented by Coprimorphus scrutator of Aphodiinae indicates that the ecomorphological differentiation exists also at a smaller scale. Finally, by the quantification of gaps in morphological space between the pairs of defined ecomorphological groups we showed that the guild membership overrides the family/subfamily membership in a light of ecomorphological adaptations to specific nesting behaviours.

AB Fungal pathogens are implicated in driving tropical plant diversity by facilitating strong, negative density-dependent mortality of conspecific seedlings (C-NDD). Assessment of the role of fungal pathogens in mediating coexistence derives from relatively few tree species and predominantly the Neotropics, limiting our understanding of their role in maintaining hyper-diversity in many tropical forests. A key question is whether fungal pathogen-mediated C-NDD seedling mortality is ubiquitous across diverse plant communities. Using a manipulative shadehouse experiment, we tested the role of fungal pathogens in mediating C-NDD seedling mortality of eight mast fruiting Bornean trees, typical of the species-rich forests of South East Asia. We demonstrate species-specific responses of seedlings to fungicide and density treatments, generating weak negative density-dependent mortality. Overall seedling mortality was low and likely insufficient to promote overall community diversity. Although conducted in the same way as previous studies, we find little evidence that fungal pathogens play a substantial role in determining patterns of seedling mortality in a SE Asian mast fruiting forest, questioning our understanding of how Janzen-Connell mechanisms structure the plant communities of this globally important forest type.

AB Questions As urban areas expand around the world, understanding how to restore and maintain forests within the urban environment becomes increasingly important. Given that a comprehensive understanding of regeneration dynamics is critical to designating appropriate management interventions we ask the following: how does regeneration, vis-a-vis the buried seed bank, vary in heterogenous urban forests? And, can forest patch size be used to predict regeneration and consequent management interventions?
   Location Vacant lots and public parks throughout New Haven, CT, USA.
   Methods We sampled buried seed banks in 131 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes ranging from large intact parks (95-126 ha), to small parks (1-19 ha), and vacant lots (0.05-0.65 ha). We collected soil samples from the surface mineral soil and stratified them over sand in a greenhouse over a period of five months to record germination.
   Results By examining seed bank floristics in a range of forest patch sizes we found that species composition, nativity, and dominance of specific functional groups shifted with patch size representing a spectrum of urbanization within just one city. Seed bank floristics in large parks more closely resembled results from seed bank studies in rural forests with over 85% native germinants on average. In contrast, vacant lots were dominated by non-native germinants and more ruderal species indicative of earlier successional stages. Seed banks in small parks were variable and in some cases were more similar to large parks or vacant lots.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that large parks in urban areas may be largely self-sustaining whereas smaller parks may require more intensive management for site rehabilitation, especially in early states of succession. Furthermore, our results confirm the highly heterogenous nature of urban forest patches and call for more systematic sampling of urban areas to capture this variation and improve management prescriptions and outcomes.

AB Microbial communities are comprised of many species that coexist on small spatial scales. This is difficult to explain because many interspecies interactions are competitive, and ecological theory predicts that one species will drive the extinction of another species that competes for the same resource. Conversely, evolutionary theory proposes that natural selection can lead to coexistence by driving competing species to use non-overlapping resources. However, evolutionary escape from extinction may be slow compared to the rate of competitive exclusion. Here, we use experimental co-cultures of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the evolution of coexistence in species that compete for resources. We find that while E. coli usually outcompetes S. cerevisiae in co-culture, a few populations evolved stable coexistence after similar to 1000 generations of coevolution. We sequenced S. cerevisiae and E. coli populations, identified multi-hit genes, and engineered alleles from these genes into several genetic backgrounds, finding that some mutations modified interactions between E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Together, our data demonstrate that coexistence can evolve, de novo, from intense competition between two species with no history of coevolution.

AB Aim Long-term monitoring of forest understorey species was used to describe changes in native and invasive exotic plant abundances over time within different disturbed or undisturbed forest types. This information was then used to determine the predictive invasion model (passenger/opportunist, driver or back-seat driver). Location Cheat Ranger District of the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, USA. Methods Understorey vegetation of mature and clear-cut forests was sampled every 5-6 years for 16 years. Stands were stratified across three land types following a moisture gradient. Invasive plant richness, frequency and abundance were evaluated across land type and disturbance type with general linear mixed models. Change in richness, diversity and abundance of both native and invasive non-native plants was evaluated as a measure of impact. Results The mesic mature stands had the greatest invasive plant richness, frequency and abundance. The moderately mesic clear-cut stands initially showed the greatest invasive plant richness, frequency and abundance, but over time these values became greater for the drier clear-cuts. The mature forests showed no change in native species abundance in response to invasion. Clear-cut-drier stands showed a decrease, while the more mesic stands showed an increase in native plant richness, diversity and abundance in response to invasion. The drier clear-cuts, with increasing invasions and negative native species impacts, were indicative of the back-seat driver model. The hitchhiker model, a new term, described increasing plant invasions with no measurable impacts. Main Conclusions The drier clear-cut stands exhibit a lack of biotic resistance to invasion, unlike the mesic clear-cut stands. Increasing invasion in the mature forests suggests that a threshold may be reached that results in impacts on the native vegetation, but with no increase in native plant abundance to help alleviate these effects.

AB Habitat area and fragmentation are recognised as important factors that influence population size, community structure and extinction risk. Abundance and species richness universally increase with habitat area. However, the effects of different aspects of habitat fragmentation, including variation in patch size, number and isolation are often not distinguished from each other or the overall effects of habitat amount. Here we experimentally tested predictions concerning the effects of isolation on abundance, species richness and community structure of coral reef fishes colonising patch reefs by constructing clusters of patches of the same number and size, but manipulating reef spacing. Hexagonal clusters of 7 experimental patch reefs (6 edge and 1 central) with 3 levels of isolation (1 m, 5 m, and 15 m spacing) were established at Kavieng, Papua New Guinea and colonisation was recorded after 6 weeks in 2014. We also deployed video cameras to test whether isolation affected the activity of transient predatory fishes. As predicted, isolation had a positive effect on both mean abundance and species richness at both the cluster and patch scale. The cumulative abundance and species richness exhibited linear increases in relation to habitat area within clusters (from 1 to 7 patch reefs), but the slope increased with the degree of isolation. There was some evidence that transient predators remained longer and were more successful when patches were close together, which may explain the lower abundance and richness of juvenile fish assemblages on more aggregated patch reefs. This study demonstrates that while habitat amount is fundamentally important, isolation has significant effects that will need to be distinguished from other aspects of fragmentation when examining the processes structuring reef fish communities.

AB The optimal partitioning theory predicts that plants of a given species acclimate to different environments by allocating a larger proportion of biomass to the organs acquiring the most limiting resource. Are similar patterns found across species adapted to environments with contrasting levels of abiotic stress? We tested the optimal partitioning theory by analysing how fractional biomass allocation to leaves, stems and roots differed between woody species with different tolerances of shade and drought in plants of different age and size (seedlings to mature trees) using a global dataset including 604 species. No overarching biomass allocation patterns at different tolerance values across species were found. Biomass allocation varied among functional types as a result of phenological (deciduous vs evergreen broad-leaved species) and broad phylogenetical (angiosperms vs gymnosperms) differences. Furthermore, the direction of biomass allocation responses between tolerant and intolerant species was often opposite to that predicted by the optimal partitioning theory. We conclude that plant functional type is the major determinant of biomass allocation in woody species. We propose that interactions between plant functional type, ontogeny and species-specific stress tolerance adaptations allow woody species with different shade and drought tolerances to display multiple biomass partitioning strategies.

AB Tropical forest degradation from logging, fire, and fragmentation not only alters carbon stocks and carbon fluxes, but also impacts physical land surface properties such as albedo and roughness length. Such impacts are poorly quantified to date due to difficulties in accessing and maintaining observational infrastructures, as well as the lack of proper modeling tools for capturing the interactions among biophysical properties, ecosystem demography, canopy structure, and biogeochemical cycling in tropical forests. As a first step to address these limitations, we implemented a selective logging module into the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) by mimicking the ecological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes following a logging event. The model can specify the timing and aerial extent of logging events, splitting the logged forest patch into disturbed and intact patches; determine the survivorship of cohorts in the disturbed patch; and modifying the biomass and necromass (total mass of coarse woody debris and litter) pools following logging. We parameterized the logging module to reproduce a selective logging experiment at the Tapajos National Forest in Brazil and benchmarked model outputs against available field measurements. Our results suggest that the model permits the co-existence of early and late successional functional types and realistically characterizes the seasonality of water and carbon fluxes and stocks, the forest structure and composition, and the ecosystem succession following disturbance. However, the current version of FATES overestimates water stress in the dry season and therefore fails to capture seasonal variation in latent and sensible heat fluxes. Moreover, we observed a bias towards low stem density and leaf area when compared to observations, suggesting that improvements are needed in both carbon allocation and establishment of trees. The effects of logging were assessed by different logging scenarios to represent reduced impact and conventional logging practices, both with high and low logging intensities. The model simulations suggest that in comparison to old-growth forests the logged forests rapidly recover water and energy fluxes in 1 to 3 years. In contrast, the recovery times for carbon stocks, forest structure, and composition are more than 30 years depending on logging practices and intensity. This study lays the foundation to simulate land use change and forest degradation in FATES, which will be an effective tool to directly represent forest management practices and regeneration in the context of Earth system models.

AB Formed by tall flat-topped mountains known as tepuis, the Pantepui is an important center of vascular plant endemism and diversity in South America. In Brazil, the Pantepui is mostly on the border of Venezuela, and an isolated area, Serra do Araca, stands out as the tepui southernmost. In this paper we present a floristic survey of the vascular plants that occur on Serra do Araca, compare the richness to other tepuis, and commented on the conservation of Amazonian "campos rupestres". Our dataset includes over 1600 records, either collected by us in three field expeditions, or by other botanists. A checklist with 436 species of vascular plants is provided. Our study also shows that among the 34 tepuis of the Pantepui, Serra do Araca ranks tenth in species richness and has 24 endemic species. Serra do Araca, like other tepuis, houses representatives of ancestral lineages of vascular plants of South America, showing how important tepuis are as cradles of lineages. Despite its importance for Amazonian biodiversity, Serra do Araca is one of the natural reserves in the Amazon with the highest number of requests for mining.

AB Soil properties and light availability have been long recognized as fundamental drivers of species distribution and are especially important during the regeneration phase. The role of nutrients such as exchangeable base cations is poorly understood, despite forests facing considerable changes in soil composition due to climatic change and atmospheric acid deposition, including in south China.
   With the aim of understanding the response of naturally regenerating seedling communities to a wide range of abiotic conditions, we quantified seedling growth and survival of over 2000 seedlings representing 166 morpho-species within four subtropical forests in south China, for two years. We assessed their responses to canopy openness, and a natural gradient of soil characteristics: moisture, pH, total nitrogen (N), total carbon (C), C:N ratio, available phosphorus (P), available potassium (K), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and sulfur (S). We conducted our analyses at three levels: landscape (1), forest site (4), and species (7).
   We found statistically clear effects of several soil properties on seedling growth and survival, at all levels of analysis, while canopy openness showed a minimal negative effect on survival and none on growth. Seedling growth was positively affected by increasing soil Ca and Mn and negatively by increasing soil Mg at the landscape level (all four forest sites combined). Seedling survival responded positively to soil Fe and C:N ratio, but negatively to soil Ca, Mg, Mn, N, and S. The observed patterns were forest site- and species-specific. These results are especially relevant in a region experiencing severe changes in soil conditions as well as intense deforestation and land use change. Reforestation programs should consider the site specificity of soil properties with respect to a wide range of soil nutrients when planning restoration activities.

AB Artificial gaps are widely created for forest management. However, the interactive effects of gap sizes and within-gap locations on seedling regeneration are rarely tested. Therefore, whether there are lower and upper size limits for artificial gaps remains controversial. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the effects of within-gap positions on seedling regeneration are dependent on gap sizes. Newly germinated wild seedlings of shade-intolerantQuercus mongolicascattered in different positions within artificially created gaps of different sizes were surveyed to test our hypothesis. Large gaps promoted seedling growth more than medium and small gaps. The increase inQ. mongolicaseedling growth in large gaps can be largely attributed to the dormancy breaking of the apical buds and increased net photosynthetic rates. More importantly, we showed that the effects of within-gap position were prominent only in medium gaps, i.e., the effect of within-gap position appears to be dependent on gap size. We show an integrative effect of gap size and within-gap location on seedling performance of shade-intolerant oaks, suggesting future studies should evaluate the influence of within-gap location in conjunction with the role of gap size. We therefore suggest that gap creation in silvicultural systems should highlight the lower and upper size limits of forest gaps, which will vary with the species and regions studied.

AB Plants link interactions between aboveground and belowground organisms. Herbivore-induced changes in plant chemistry are hypothesized to impact entire food webs by changing the strength of trophic cascades. Yet, few studies have explored how belowground herbivores affect the behaviors of generalist predators, nor how such changes may act through diverse changes to the plant metabolome. Using a factorial experiment, we tested whether herbivory by root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita) affected the aboveground interaction among milkweed plants (Asclepias fascicularisorAsclepias speciosa), oleander aphids (Aphis nerii), and aphid-tending ants (Linepithema humile). We quantified the behaviors of aphid-tending ants, and we measured the effects of herbivore treatments on aphid densities and on phytochemistry. Unexpectedly, ants tended aphids primarily on the leaves of uninfected plants, whereas ants tended aphids primarily at the base of the stem of nematode-infected plants. In nematode-infected plants, aphids excreted more sugar per capita in their ant-attracting honeydew. Additionally, although plant chemistry was species-specific, nematode infection generally decreased the richness of plant secondary metabolites while acting as a protein sink in the roots. Path analysis indicated that the ants' behavioral change was driven in part by indirect effects of nematodes acting through changes in plant chemistry. We conclude that belowground herbivores can affect the behaviors of aboveground generalist ant predators by multiple paths, including changes in phytochemistry, which may affect the attractiveness of aphid honeydew rewards.

AB The human microbiome consists of five major regional biomes distributed in or on our five body sites including skin, oral, lung, gut, and reproductive tract. Its biogeography (the spatial and temporal distribution of its biodiversity) has far-reaching implications to our health and diseases. Nevertheless, we currently have very limited understanding on themechanismsshaping the biogeography, since it is often rather difficult to determine the relative importance of drift, dispersal, speciation, and selection, the four processes (mechanisms) determining the patterns of microbial biogeography and community dynamics according to a recent synthesis in community ecology and biogeography. To disentangle these mechanisms, I utilize multisite neutral (MSN) model and niche-neutral hybrid (NNH) model to analyze large number of truly multisite microbiome samples covering all five major human microbiome habitats, including 699 metacommunities and 5,420 local communities. Approximately 89% of metacommunities and 92% local communities exhibit patterns indistinguishable from neutral, and 20% indistinguishable from niche-neutral hybrid model, indicating the relative significance of stochastic neutral forces versus deterministic niche selection in shaping the biogeography of human microbiome. These findings cast supporting evidence to van der Gast's revision to classic Bass-Becking doctrine of microbial biogeography: "Some things are everywhere and some things are not. Sometimes the environment selects and sometimes it doesn't," offering the first educated guess for "some" and "sometimes" in the revised doctrine. Furthermore, the logistic/Cox regression models describing the relationships among community neutrality, niche differentiation, and key community/species characteristics (including community diversity, community/species dominance, speciation, and migration rates) were constructed to quantitatively describe the niche-neutral continuum and the influences of community/species properties on the continuum.

AB Great losses of biodiversity in natural ecosystems are occurring as a result of growing anthropic threats. A better understanding of the contributions of spatial scales to biodiversity organization would allow improved spatial management to conserve biodiversity in those regions that are strongly impacted by anthropic activities, such the Brazilian Cerrado. The aim of this study was to evaluate how dung beetle diversity is spatially organized along the cerrado sensu stricto, a common savanna formation in central Brazil. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) dung beetle diversity shows nonrandom patterns that vary between spatial scales within the same phytophysionomy, and (2) different functional groups and the abundant and rare species display distinct and nonrandom spatial patterns of diversity along spatial scales due to different life histories. We collected dung beetles in eight areas of cerrado sensu stricto distributed in two fragments and analyzed the spatial organization of dung beetle diversity using additive diversity partitioning. A total of 6130 individuals and 54 species were collected. Additive partitioning of diversity showed a prominent importance of the scale of areas in the organization of diversity, demonstrating a stronger influence of local factors on this organization. Assemblages divided into functional groups showed differential contributions of diversity components, indicating distinct habitat influences on these groups. This work provides new insights into the spatial organization of dung beetle diversity, encompassing three spatial levels for the same phytophysionomy in the Brazilian Cerrado. These findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining spatial heterogeneity of habitats. Thus, multiple localities within a region must be preserved because of their unique diversity structuring.

AB Reforestation is a feasible option for the eventual restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services on deforested oil-sands mining sites. The associations between plant diversity and productivity spanning the different strata of restoration forests, in conjunction with specific factors that may impact these relationships, remain uncertain. We sampled 94 sites that encompassed conifer, mixed-wood, and broadleaved overstory types as three exemplar substrates following the reforestation of oil-sands mining sites in Alberta, Canada. We employed structural equation modeling to investigate the correlations between species diversity and aboveground biomass production spanning forest vegetation strata, while concurrently accounting for the effects of overstory composition, functional diversity/identity, soil fertility, and restoration age. We found that the relationships between species diversity and biomass were negative, or inconsequential across restoration forest strata. Overstory biomass was linked to the coniferous tree proportion and community-weighted mean of leaf nitrogen, rather than the species and functional diversity of overstory trees. Further, overstory composition, diversity, and biomass were the key features involved in the diversity and biomass of understory strata. Our results demonstrated the importance of overstory tree species composition and selection effects toward driving overstory and understory productivity in restoration forests at post-oil sands mining sites. Coniferous trees were observed to have lower leaf nutrient levels and negative impacts on the productivity and diversity of overstory and shrub layers. Therefore, it was recommended that a greater proportion of broadleaved trees should be incorporated to promote productivity and species diversity in restoration forests through the enhancement and utilization of available resources.

AB Secondary forests are increasing in the Brazilian Amazon and have been cited as an important mechanism for reducing net carbon emissions. However, our understanding of the contribution of secondary forests to the Amazonian carbon balance is incomplete, and it is unclear to what extent emissions from old-growth deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth. Using MapBiomas 3.1 and recently refined IPCC carbon sequestration estimates, we mapped the age and extent of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon and estimated their role in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions since 1985. We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km(2)of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 +/- 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change.

AB There is growing evidence that herbivory-induced legacy effects permit plants to cope with herbivory. However, herbivory-induced defense strategies in plants against grazing mammals have received little attention. To further understand the grazing-induced legacy effects on plants, we conducted a greenhouse experiment with Leymus chinensis experiencing different grazing histories. We focused on grazing-induced legacy effects on above-ground spatial avoidance and below-ground biomass allocation. Our results showed that L. chinensis collected from the continuous overgrazing plot (OG) exhibited higher performance under simulated grazing in terms of growth, cloning and colonizing ability than those collected from the 35-year no-grazing plot (NG). The enhanced adaptability of OG was attributed to increased above-ground spatial avoidance, which was mediated by larger leaf angle and shorter height (reduced vertical height and increased leaf angle contributed to the above-ground spatial avoidance at a lower herbivory stubble height, while reduced tiller natural height contributed to above-ground spatial avoidance at a higher herbivory stubble height). Contrary to our prediction, OG pre-allocated less biomass to the rhizome, which does not benefit the herbivory tolerance and avoidance of L. chinensis; however, this also may reflect a tolerance strategy where reduced allocation to rhizomes is associated with increased production of ramets.

AB Ant communities are extremely diverse and provide a wide variety of ecological functions in tropical forests. Here, we investigated the abiotic factors driving ant composition turnover across an elevational gradient at Mont Itoupe, French Guiana. Mont Itoupe is an isolated mountain whose top is covered by cloud forests, a biogeographical rarity that is likely to be threatened according to climate change scenarios in the region. We examined the influence of six soil, climatic, and LiDAR-derived vegetation structural variables on leaf litter ant assembly (267 species) across nine 0.12-ha plots disposed at three elevations (ca. 400, 600, and 800m asl). We tested (a) whether species cooccurring within a same plot or a same elevation were more similar in terms of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic composition, than species from different plots/elevations, and (b) which environmental variables significantly explained compositional turnover among plots. We found that the distribution of species and traits of ant communities along the elevational gradient was significantly explained by a turnover of environmental conditions, particularly in soil phosphorus and sand content, canopy height, and mean annual relative humidity of soil. Our results shed light on the role exerted by environmental filtering in shaping ant community assembly in tropical forests. Identifying the environmental determinants of ant species distribution along tropical elevational gradients could help predicting the future impacts of global warming on biodiversity organization in vulnerable environments such as cloud forests.

AB Marine protists are highly heterogeneous and play key roles in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. However, little is known on the underlying biogeographic processes and seasonal diversity patterns that shape their community assembly in a regional scale in marginal sea. In this study, we conducted high-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA gene to survey the protist community compositions (PCCs) of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) plume, an intensely human-affected coastal area, to the adjacent continental shelf waters over three seasons. Furthermore, the different impacts of environmental and spatial factors on marine PCCs were examined. The results revealed significant dissimilarities of PCC's diversity among seasons and habitats, with more obvious seasonal variations in the Changjiang plume. Procrustes analysis showed better consistency of the community-environment relationship in shelf area, further supported by stronger correlation coefficients computed in the Mantel tests. This might be explained by seasonal dynamics of Changjiang Diluted Waters (i.e., the mixing of the Changjiang runoff with inshore water of the East China Sea) that changed the environmental conditions of coastal area dramatically, resulting in lower importance of spatial factors (dispersal limitation) on PCCs compared with environmental filters, including physicochemical properties (e.g., water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients), as well as biotic factors (e.g., Chlaand food abundance). This was further explained by higher immigration rate and fitness to neutral model, which suggested a predominant role of neutral process in shaping the PCCs in coastal area. Different richness, diversity, and taxonomic compositions but comparable biogeographic patterns were observed among abundant and rare sub-communities. In general, the abundant sub-communities exhibited higher dispersal ability which tend to respond to environmental selection during dispersal, whereas the rare sub-communities appeared to be present only in few samples due to dispersal limitation. Co-occurrence network further indicated the importance of biotic interactions in community assembly and potential roles of rare taxa in maintaining the community structure. Overall, this study suggests the dynamic in the biogeographic patterns of PCCs of the Changjiang plume to the adjacent waters in the ECS responding with the changing environmental conditions and geographical factors.

AB Soil is a relevant driver of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic composition at local scales. However, the mechanisms by which the soil act in these components or how these components interact with each other are not elucidated. Herein, we propose to understand the role of soil (environmental filtering) on the turnover of taxonomic and phylogenetic components and their role in determining the functional composition of Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) communities. We sampled all the arboreal individuals with Diameter at Breast Height equal to or higher than 3 cm and collected soil variables of 25 units from five SDTF fragments located in the Brazilian Caatinga Domain. These data enabled us to obtain the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic composition of each plot, which were then analyzed by Structural Equation Models jointly with the soil variables. Our results suggest that the soil conditions select specific phylogenetic lineages from a regional species pool according to the adaptive potential, which affects the distribution and abundance of species (taxonomic composition). However, it was not possible to establish a direct relationship between the phylogenetic composition and the taxonomic composition, possibly due to the use of labile functional traits in the analysis. We also found that soil acts directly on the functional composition, leading to a differential success of individuals which would represent a direct and indirect effect of taxonomic composition on the functional composition. Thus, we found community aspects result from different ecological mechanisms which act in a continuous and progressive way between functional, phylogenetic and taxonomic composition.

AB Growth rings have been reported for several tropical species under seasonal precipitation regimes and have often been related to leaf phenology. We investigated growth ring distinctiveness, wood markers, and leaf shedding and flushing patterns of 16 tree species from a subtropical seasonal deciduous forest under abundant and well-distributed rainfall regime in southern Brazil. Distinct growth rings were found in 13 species, 10 of which presented clear anatomical boundaries. Seven species were deciduous, five semideciduous and four perennial. Leaf shedding peaked during winter and spring months for the deciduous species, while it peaked during spring and summer months for the perennial and semideciduous species. Leaf flushing peaked in spring and summer for all species. All the deciduous species exhibited growth rings with clear boundaries. Marginal parenchyma, associated or not with other anatomical markers, was present in deciduous species but was not present in species with other leaf shedding patterns. Growth rings in Allophylus edulis, Erythrina falcata, Jacaranda micrantha and Luehea divaricata were described for the first time. The presence of seasonal leaf phenological patterns and growth rings in most of the species suggests that seasonality of the photoperiod and/or temperature influence the development of trees in moist subtropical seasonal deciduous forests.

AB Genetic variation and phylogeographic studies have been crucial for understanding mechanisms of speciation. We analyzed genetic variation and phylogeography to reconstruct the demographic history of the Rivoli's Hummingbird (Eugenes fulgens) species complex and also evaluated their morphological differentiation. This widely distributed species inhabits the highlands of Mexico and northern Central America, with 2 subspecies separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (west: E. f. fulgens, east: E. f. viridiceps). We surveyed genetic variation in 2 mitochondrial DNA markers (mtDNA, with 129 individuals) and nuclear DNA (6 microsatellites, with 85 individuals). We also inferred the demographic history, estimated divergence times, and analyzed morphological variation using 470 vouchered specimens. We modeled the current potential distribution of the species using ecological niche modeling and projected it into the past to model the effects of the Pleistocene climatic cycles. Haplotype networks, pairwise F-ST comparisons, AMOVA, and morphological analysis revealed differences between geographically isolated populations separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (IT; corresponding to the 2 recognized subspecies: fulgens and viridiceps), and by the Motagua-Polochic-Jocotan (MPJ) system fault. Demographic scenarios revealed a contraction in distribution during the last interglacial, and expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) with little change since the LGM. Divergence between groups separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec similar to 59,600 yr ago occurred in the presence of gene flow, suggesting that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is a semipermeable barrier to gene flow. STRUCTURE analyses of microsatellite data detected 3 genetically differentiated groups. Several results fit a model of recent lineage divergence, including a significant signal of genetic differentiation, demographic expansion, decreased gene flow from past to present, and northward expansion during the LGM and contraction during the interglacial periods. We conclude that the genetic differentiation of E. fulgens in the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands resulted from recent geographical isolation of populations separated by natural barriers (IT and MPJ).

AB Aims Plant-pollinator interaction networks are dynamic entities, and seasonal variation in plant phenology can reshape their structure on both short and long timescales. However, such seasonal dynamics are rarely considered, especially for oceanic island pollination networks. Here, we assess changes in the temporal dynamics of plant-pollinator interactions in response to seasonal variation in floral resource richness in oceanic island communities.
   Methods We evaluated seasonal variations of pollination networks in the Yongxing Island community. Four temporal qualitative pollination networks were analyzed using plant pollinator interaction data of the four seasons. We collected data on plant pollinator interactions during two consecutive months in each of the four seasons. Four network-level indices were calculated to characterize the overall structure of the networks. Statistical analyses of community dissimilarity were used to compare this community across four seasons to explore the underlying factors driving these patterns. We also evaluated the temporal variation in two species-level indices of plant and pollinator functional groups.
   Important Findings Both network-level specialization and modularity showed a significantly opposite trend compared with plant species richness across four seasons. Increased numbers of plant species might promote greater competition among pollinators, leading to increased niche overlap and causing decreased specialization and modularity and vice versa. Further analyses suggested that the season-to-season turnover of interactions was dominated by interaction rewiring. Thus, the seasonal changes in niche overlap among pollinators lead to interaction rewiring, which drives interaction turnover in this community. Hawkmoths had higher values of specialization and Apidae had higher values of species strength compared with other pollinator functional groups. These findings should be considered when exploring plant-pollinator interactions in ecosystems of isolated oceanic islands and in other ecosystems.

AB Understanding people's attitudes towards wildlife species is key for developing and effectively implementing conservation initiatives. Although attitudes towards different wildlife classes have been examined separately within a variety of regions, there have been no comprehensive comparisons of attitudes towards wildlife between different tropical ecoregions over large spatial scales. Here, we examined attitudes of 106 rural wage-earners from two ecoregions in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We used generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to examine the influence of socioeconomic variables and ecoregion type on attitudes towards wildlife species, grouped into three classes (liked, disliked, and damage income). Overall we obtained attitudes regarding 57 wildlife species that were organized into 11 faunal groups (amphibians, ants, bats, birds, fishes, medium-bodied mammals, large-bodied mammals, primates, snakes, tortoises and turtles, and other invertebrates). Ecoregions where wage-earners lived was the strongest predictor of the total number of liked and disliked wildlife species. The total number of species damaging income was explained by socioeconomic variables related to the number of people living in the property and level of education. Medium and large-bodied mammals were most frequently reported both as liked and causing damage, while snakes were most frequently reported as disliked in both ecoregions. Although socioeconomic variables were important predictors to wage-earners' attitudes towards wildlife species, the environment (ecoregion) was the strongest predictor affecting human-wildlife attitudes. Our findings contribute with information about the importance of considering differences in local attitudes across a representative spectrum of wildlife species to inform the identification of effective focal species in different tropical regions.

AB Over the past five decades, many studies have examined the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, which posits that host-specific natural enemies, such as insect herbivores and fungal pathogens, promote plant species coexistence by providing a recruitment advantage to rare plant species. Recently, researchers have been exploring new and exciting angles on plant-enemy interactions that have yielded novel insights into this long-standing hypothesis. Here, we highlight some empirical advances in our understanding of plant-enemy interactions in tropical forests, including improved understanding of variation in plant species' susceptibility to enemy effects, as well as insect and pathogen host ranges. We then review recent advances in related ecological theory. These theoretical studies have confirmed that specialist natural enemies can promote tree diversity. However, they have also shown that the impact of natural enemies may be weakened, or that natural enemies could even cause species exclusion, depending on enemy host range, the spatial extent of enemy effects, and variation among plant species in seed dispersal or enemy susceptibility. Finally, we end by discussing how human impacts on tropical forests, such as fragmentation, hunting, and climate change, may alter the plant-enemy interactions that contribute to tropical forest diversity.

AB There is accumulating evidence that the abundance and biomass of lianas are increasing with global climate change in the Neotropics. However, our knowledge of growth-trait relationships among lianas is surprisingly rare. Here, we monitored the relative growth rate of 2860 individuals from seven deciduous and four evergreen liana species in a 20 ha subtropical cloud forest dynamics plot at high elevation (2472-2628 m a.s.l.) in southwest China. We linked the relative growth rate of lianas with nine leaf traits associated with leaf morphology, nutrient concentrations, and water hydraulic capacity as indicated by leaf vein density, and five stem wood traits related to stem water transport capacity and wood density. Our results showed that deciduous lianas have higher relative growth rates than their evergreen counterparts. Across all lianas studied, the relative growth rate was positively correlated with the leaf area and specific leaf area, but negatively correlated with leaf dry matter content. The relative growth rate of lianas was strongly correlated with nitrogen concentration after excluding the legume liana species. The relative growth rate was decoupled from leaf phosphorus and potassium concentrations, leaf vein density, and stem vessel traits across all lianas investigated. For four evergreen lianas, there were positive associations of the relative growth rate with the leaf thickness and diameter of the largest vessels. This study is the first to illustrate the relationships of liana growth with leaf and stem traits in the high-elevation subtropical cloud forest. More studies from diverse forest ecosystems are needed to comprehensively understand the mechanism underlying liana growth patterns.

AB Deforestation causes diverse and profound consequences for the environment and species. Direct or indirect effects can be related to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, floods, landslides, etc. As such a significant process, timely and continuous monitoring of forest dynamics is important, to constantly follow existing policies and develop new mitigation measures. The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the Para state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of high-resolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000-2006; for the period 2006-2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019-2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies.

AB This study characterizes the structure and composition of mangrove forests across urban gradients in Puerto Rico. It then uses a suite of hydrologic, water chemistry, and land cover variables to test for the relative importance of urban intensity alongside flooding and water chemistry in explaining observed variability in forest structure and composition. Three separate statistical tests suggest a significant but limited influence of urbanness on forest composition and structure. In the most urban sites, the diameters of the largest trees were 27% larger, but all structural measurements were best explained by surface water chemistry, primarily nitrogen concentrations. Concentrations of ammonium and total Kjeldahl nitrogen best explained stem density, tree girth and canopy height. The most urban forests also contained 5.0 more species per hectare, on average, than the least urban forests, and simple regression suggests that urban metrics were the most powerful predictors of forest composition. The most urban forests were more dominated by Laguncularia racemosa, while both Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle were found to be less abundant in the most urban sites, a trend that may be linked to the influence of precipitation and tidal connectivity on porewater salinity across the urban gradient. In multiple regression, no statistical difference was detected in the importance of surrounding land cover, flooding, or water quality in explaining the variance in either composition or structural metrics. This suggests that while a given forest metric may be strongly linked to either land cover, water quality, or flooding, all three are likely important and should be considered when characterizing these forests. With more human dependents in urban areas, the provisioning of important ecosystem services may be influenced by land use variables in addition to the more commonly measured metrics of water chemistry and flooding.

AB Payments for ecosystems services (PES) can promote natural resource conservation by increasing compliance with environmental laws. Law enforcement and PES proponents assume that individuals make decisions about compliance based on expectations of gains, likelihood of being caught in non-compliance, and magnitude of sanctions. Brazil's Forest Code, characterized by low levels of compliance, includes incentive and disincentive mechanisms. We interviewed landowners in the Atlantic Forest to understand their motivations to participate (or not) in a PES project, the effects of knowledge and perceptions of environmental regulations on compliance, and how both environmental regulations and PES affect land management decision-making. We found that neither expectations of financial gains nor PES payments drive behavioral change and that the perception of systemic corruption reduced compliance with environment regulations. There were important behavioral differences between long-term residents for whom the land is their main source of income and recent residents with little dependence on land-generated income.

AB Environmental and dispersal-based processes have been widely investigated for the understanding of community assembly. However, the relative importance of these ecological processes across spatial scales, life history stages and forest types needs to be largely studied. We test the variability of ecological processes in shaping tree community composition across life stages and spatial scales, and in particular, the hypothesis that dispersal limitation dominates at smaller scales and early life stages, but environmental filtering at larger scales and later life stages. We used spatially explicit point process models to estimate the relative importance of environmental and dispersal processes and their combined effect on beta diversity across spatial scales and life stages in tropical and subtropical forests. These models fit the observed species distribution pattern and generated realizations of the fitted models for each species. We found that the importance of environmental and dispersal processes did not shift with life stages or vegetation types, but did with spatial scales. Dispersal provided the best explanation of large-scale patterns, but dispersal combined with environmental selection was superior for small-scale patterns. In conclusion, we confirm the importance of spatial scale for the effects and identification of community assembly mechanisms. Our results also suggest that the importance of both dispersal and environmental processes for community assembly could be pervasive across life stages and vegetation types. The generality of these findings should be tested further in different vegetation types and life stages to assess whether specific ecological processes have consistent effects on community structure across life stages and vegetation types.

AB Tropical forests are acknowledged for providing important ecosystem services and are renowned as "the lungs of the planet Earth" due to their role in the exchange of gasses-particularly inhaling CO2 and breathing out O-2-within the atmosphere. Overall, the forests provide 50% of the total plant biomass of the Earth, which accounts for 450-650 PgC globally. Understanding and accurate estimates of tropical forest biomass stocks are imperative in ascertaining the contribution of the tropical forests in global carbon dynamics. This article provides a review of remote-sensing-based approaches for the assessment of above-ground biomass (AGB) across the tropical forests (global to national scales), summarizes the current estimate of pan-tropical AGB, and discusses major advancements in remote-sensing-based approaches for AGB mapping. The review is based on the journal papers, books and internet resources during the 1980s to 2020. Over the past 10 years, a myriad of research has been carried out to develop methods of estimating AGB by integrating different remote sensing datasets at varying spatial scales. Relationships of biomass with canopy height and other structural attributes have developed a new paradigm of pan-tropical or global AGB estimation from space-borne satellite remote sensing. Uncertainties in mapping tropical forest cover and/or forest cover change are related to spatial resolution; definition adapted for 'forest' classification; the frequency of available images; cloud covers; time steps used to map forest cover change and post-deforestation land cover land use (LCLU)-type mapping. The integration of products derived from recent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) satellite missions with conventional optical satellite images has strong potential to overcome most of these uncertainties for recent or future biomass estimates. However, it will remain a challenging task to map reference biomass stock in the 1980s and 1990s and consequently to accurately quantify the loss or gain in forest cover over the periods. Aside from these limitations, the estimation of biomass and carbon balance can be enhanced by taking account of post-deforestation forest recovery and LCLU type; land-use history; diversity of forest being recovered; variations in physical attributes of plants (e.g., tree height; diameter; and canopy spread); environmental constraints; abundance and mortalities of trees; and the age of secondary forests. New methods should consider peak carbon sink time while developing carbon sequestration models for intact or old-growth tropical forests as well as the carbon sequestration capacity of recovering forest with varying levels of floristic diversity.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Trophic niches condition the energetic performance of species within food webs providing a vital link between food web assembly, species diversity, and functioning of ecosystems. Our understanding of this important link is, however, limited by the lack of empirical tools that can be easily applied to compare entire food webs at regional scales. By comparison, with different a priori synthetic models defined according to specific assembly rules (i.e., purely random, limiting similarity, and niche filtering), we demonstrate that a set of food web properties (trophic richness, evenness, and divergence) are controlled by ecological processes. We further demonstrate that although both limiting similarity and niche filtering are statistically significant assembly processes shaping our studied lake food webs, their relative importance is richness-dependent, and contextual to the specific food web property under consideration. Our results have both important theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, the observed richness-dependent variation on food web properties contradicts the common criticism on food web theory that food web properties are roughly scale-invariant. Practically, these properties can help avoiding spurious conclusions, while providing useful information for multiple food web niche spaces supporting the ecosystem functioning.

AB Characterizing wildlife conservation problems is essential to properly inform conservation planning, and requires detailed knowledge on critical life stages, such as reproduction. Large tropical raptors often require large emergent trees to build their huge nests. However, large emergents are also in heavy demand by the timber industry. Here, we review the literature to characterize nesting structures used by Earths largest eagle, Harpy Eagles (Harpia harpyja) and examine to what extent nest-tree selectivity is targeted by selective logging. We show that Harpy Eagles selected specific forest canopy structures as nesting platforms. Nests were large (mean size 152 x 99 cm) and typically located on the main fork of 28 emergent tree species, 92.8% of which are commercially targeted by the timber industry. AIC-based stepwise regression indicated that, compared with non-nesting emergent trees, nest trees were 19.6% taller at the first bifurcation; had crowns 26.6% wider; had 33.3% fewer branches < 45 degrees, which were on average 35% lower-angled. Tree size varied widely across the range of nesting tree species, but peaked near the Equator, and were high-statured in unflooded forest compared with flooded forests. Our results show that commercial loggers target the same set of species and individuals on which Harpy Eagles nest, questioning whether large tracts of selectively logged Amazonian primary forests still provide suitable nesting habitat for this mega-raptor. We conclude that suitable Harpy Eagle nesting trees have been rapidly lost over the species last stronghold, and this information may prove useful to the upcoming species evaluation by IUCN.

AB Mammals embody the apex of ecosystems processes, and their majestic diversity is overwhelmingly threatened in the Neotropical realm. Mammal population declines erode not only several levels of biological diversity, but may also impoverish critical ecosystem services (ES). Based on 2,427 putative baseline mammal assemblages derived from IUCN ranges polygons, we sought to understand, for the first time, the effects of mammal defaunation on natural ecosystem services throughout the entire Neotropical realm. At the assemblage-level, we simulated both stochastic and deterministic regimes of mammal defaunation, examining both diversity indices and classic metrics of ecological networks (e.g. modularity and nestedness). Our results show that ES losses are induced by declines in both taxonomic and functional diversity. Given any defaunation regime, Neotropical provinces undergo levels of ES erosion typically reaching less than a third of all potential network links. Geographic patterns of lost ecosystem services-resulting from simulated and real-world mammal extinctions-indicate that this will detrimentally affect human livelihoods across all major Neotropical provinces. We conclude that the ongoing defaunation process will promote irreversible failures of several mammal-mediated ecosystem processes at varying timescales.

AB This article presents a systematic review of the factors and motivations that explain participation in payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs in the Global South. PES are voluntary conservation incentive programs and participation is determined by eligibility, willingness, and ability to participate. Following the PRISMA guide-lines, we review 78 studies and summarize how willingness (financial and non-financial motivations) and ability (based on the capital assets framework) to participate are measured and the direction of influence of these variables. An increasing number of studies assess the role of both financial and non-financial motivators on PES participation. Financial and non-financial motivators, including pro-social, pro-environmental, and risk reduction, positively influence willingness to participate. Most studies consider the role of at least one capital asset in determining ability to participate in PES programs. In general, participants in PES programs have more capital assets than non-participants. Our findings suggest that the theory behind how PES mechanisms work needs to be updated to account for more complex behavioral theories and a wider set of factors and motivations. Results from this systematic review can be used to inform the design of PES programs and help shed light on why PES programs achieve their environmental or socioeconomic objectives.

AB Acanthina monodon commonly deposits its egg capsules in the intertidal zone. Capsule aerial exposure during low-tide can impact oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of embryos and intracapsular oxygen availability, and expose embryos to desiccation. OCR increased as embryonic development progressed, and was greater when capsules were submerged in seawater than when exposed to air. Oxygen available within the capsule was always less than that available in the immediate external environment, whether capsules were immersed or exposed. The highest internal oxygen concentrations were recorded during periods of air exposure for embryos in more advanced development stages. When exposed to air, capsules lost water the fastest when they contained early embryos, and suffered the highest mortalities following exposure. Collectively, these data suggest that, although encapsulation helps the embryos to develop across wildly fluctuating environmental conditions, the amount of stress the embryos experience will vary depending on their exact positioning within the intertidal zone.

AB It is generally assumed that forests improve ecosystem service (ES) provisioning within landscapes. These as-sumptions drive policies (e.g. Payment for Ecosystem Services) that affect land-use without knowing if the desired services are achieved. Here we use a data-intensive approach to explore the synergies and tradeoffs between three regulating (hydrologic regulation, water quality, carbon storage) and one supporting ES (biodiversity). Using field-based measurements for ten ES indicators collected within eight land use/land cover (LULC) types we assess: (1) the relationship between ES indicators and LULC type and (2) the synergies and tradeoffs across ES indicators. For objective one, we found that primary forests promote more favorable hydrological services, including having greater base flow, flow regulation, and soil conductivity. For objective two, we observed synergies across many ES where management of one would improve provisioning for several other ES, specifically between low flow, carbon storage, and biodiversity. However, many ES parameters (e.g. water quality) had no relationship with other ES parameters. Our results underscore the value of site-specific research in addressing assumptions about the relationship between LULC and ES provisioning.

AB Plant species are mostly delimited solely by morphological characteristics, but this method has drawbacks and may result in identification errors. Pollination and ecological speciation studies may serve as additional tools for species delimitation. Sinningia lutea and S. allagophylla are species hitherto considered synonyms, and recent accounts suggest that the taxa present overlapping morphological features. Here we seek to improve the taxonomic circumscription of both taxa through the comparative study of floral traits, pollination and breeding systems. Our results indicate significant differences in morphological characters and confirm that the two species are pollinated by different animals. Therefore, both species are ecologically isolated and can be considered independent species. Our results highlight the potential of supplementing morphological analyses with ecological data to establish correct taxonomic relationships.

AB High irradiance utilization efficiency is one important character for some invasive plants. Chromolaena odorata is one noxious invasive species originating from Latin America, which had spread widely in most tropical and subtropical areas. To explore why C. odorata perform better than native plants in the understory of planted forests, we compared the irradiance utilization efficiency between invasive C. odorata and three co-occurring species (Merremia vitifolia, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Litsea monopetala). We found that C. odorata had lower leaf thickness but higher specific leaf area, net photosynthetic rate per leaf thickness and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency than the three native species. The photosynthetic resistance to irradiance damage was stronger for C. odorata than for the three native species. These traits may have contributed to the higher performance of C. odorata than native plants, which may in turn facilitate its invasion in the understory.

AB Premise of research. Salviais one of the most species-rich genera in the world. Its outstanding diversity and subcosmopolitan distribution have prevented the preparation of a modern comprehensive monograph and reevaluation of its classification. As phylogenetic efforts advance to untangle the evolutionary relationships ofSalvia, the need for a solid taxonomic footing is increasingly imperative. Accordingly, we present an updated checklist of the species richness and distribution ofSalviasubg.Calosphace, which constitutes more than half of the diversity of the genus. Methodology. A preliminary checklist of the species ofSalviasubg.Calosphacewas compiled through examination of the literature and online databases; this was revised and discussed by the authors in order to retrieve a consensus list. The distribution of each species by country or territory as well as by biome was also recorded from the sources consulted; affinities in composition were visualized with the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean based on a dissimilarity matrix (Sorensen's index). Pivotal results. Salviasubg.Calosphacecomprises 580 species; 30 were qualified as unresolved and require further analysis. The countries with the highest species richness are Mexico (295 spp.), Peru (77 spp.), Colombia (60 spp.), Brazil (58 spp.), Guatemala (49 spp.), and Ecuador (41 spp.). The affinity in species composition between countries and between biomes is explained mainly by geographical proximity. Conclusions. The updated list of the species ofSalviasubg.Calosphacewill help to guide sampling for phylogenetic analyses, enabling the achievement of a more stable and solid phylogenetic hypothesis. At the same time, it is a potentially important tool for underpinning discussions toward a new sectional classification of the lineage.

AB Climate changes during the late Pleistocene influenced the demography and distribution of species in Patagonia. During the last glacial maximum (LGM), ice sheets covered a great extent of the temperate rainforest in the western Patagonian Andes. The persistence of forest species in refugia during the LGM has been debated for many vertebrates, but rarely for birds. The Green-backed Firecrown (Sephanoides sephaniodes) is an important avian pollinator distributed from the south of the Atacama Desert (28 degrees S) to Tierra del Fuego (54 degrees S) in South America. We evaluated the species' evolutionary history, combining molecular data and models for past and current species distribution. Our results show two distinct haplogroups: the genetically diverse North-South clade (NS) restricted to the Mediterranean and coastal temperate regions that exhibits a signature of population expansion after LGM, and the Austral-East clade (AE) confined to the temperate intermountain range, eastern temperate, and sub-Antarctic regions, with lower genetic diversity and evidence of a more recent population expansion. This AE clade and the past distribution models support the species survival in valleys and lowlands south of the ice sheets limit during LGM until the present. A secondary contact zone was observed with haplotypes from the AE clade distributed in low frequency along with the northern areas. Our results support the paleorefugia hypothesis during the LGM with postglacial secondary contact.

AB Madagascar is regarded by some as one of the most degraded landscapes on Earth, with estimates suggesting that 90% of forests have been lost to indigenous Tavy farming. However, the extent of this degradation has been challenged: paleoecological data, phylogeographic analysis, and species richness indicate that pyrogenic savannas in central Madagascar predate human arrival, even though rainfall is sufficient to allow forest expansion into central Madagascar. These observations raise a question-if savannas in Madagascar are not anthropogenic, how then are they maintained in regions where the climate can support forest? Observation reveals that the savanna-forest boundary coincides with a dispersal barrier-the escarpment of the Central Plateau. Using a stepping-stone model, we show that in a limited dispersal landscape, a stable savanna-forest boundary can form because of fire-vegetation feedbacks. This phenomenon, referred to as range pinning, could explain why eastern lowland forests have not expanded into the mesic savannas of the Central Highlands. This work challenges the view that highland savannas in Madagascar are derived by human-lit fires and, more importantly, suggests that partial dispersal barriers and strong nonlinear feedbacks can pin biogeographical boundaries over a wide range of environmental conditions, providing a temporary buffer against climate change.

AB Anticipatory changes in organismal responses, triggered by reliable environmental cues for future conditions, are key to species' persistence in temporally variable environments. Such responses were tested by measuring the physiological performance of a tropical high-shore oyster in tandem with the temporal predictability of environmental temperature. Heart rate of the oyster increased with environmental temperatures until body temperature reached similar to 37 degrees C, when a substantial depression occurred (similar to 60%) before recovery between similar to 42 degrees and 47 degrees C, after which cardiac function collapsed. The sequential increase, depression, and recovery in cardiac performance aligned with temporal patterns in rock surface temperatures, where the risk of reaching temperatures close to the oysters' lethal limit accelerates if the rock heats up beyond similar to 37 degrees C, coinciding closely with the body temperature at which the oysters initiate metabolic depression. The increase in body temperature over a critical threshold serves as an early-warning cue to initiate anticipatory shifts in physiology and energy conservation before severe thermal stress occurs on the shore. Cross-correlating the onset of physiological mechanisms and temporal structures in environmental temperatures, therefore, reveals the potential role of reliable real-time environmental cues for future conditions in driving the evolution of anticipatory responses.

AB Modeling functional connectivity in altered landscapes is one of the growing fields of expertise in landscape ecology, and many research teams have proposed different methods to evaluate it for a wide range of species. However, very few have empirically validated the efficiency of such models in discriminating real corridors from theoretical ones. Models that are not validated or those only based on structural connectivity could result in inefficient management decisions. Moreover, validation could potentially reveal that functional connectivity differs between focal species and spatial scales. Here we empirically compared different validation methods for two commonly used connectivity models applied to two cervid species (i.e. moose Alces americanus and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus) during a road enlargement project. For both species, we built functional connectivity maps using CircuitScape (circuit-based model) and LinkageMapper (least-cost path model). We then validated them empirically using four different metrics: density of cervid-vehicle collisions, distance to the nearest wintering ground and detection rate calculated with automated cameras and with sand traps. Validation was carried out at various spatial scales (150, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m). The circuit-based models performed better at identifying functional corridors of connectivity for moose. Validation strength differed greatly between the four metrics used, and the spatial scale at which the correlation between connectivity and data was assessed had little effect. Our study emphasizes the importance of validating functional connectivity models to provide the best decision-making tools.

AB The interactions of fungal guilds have recently been proposed as drivers of organic matter transformation in forest soils. We conducted a pot experiment with Norway spruce seedlings planted in spruce needle litter inoculated with several fungal strains belonging to different ecological guilds (saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and root endophytic) to assess how the fungi and their interactions affect the transformation of humic substances (HS) and phosphorus (P) in the litter. Several methods for the characterization of P forms and HS were employed, including P-31 NMR, UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy.
   Our results show that fungal interactions influence not only the flow of P in decaying (plant) litter but also the transformation of the soil organic matter itself. Pots with saprotrophic Gymnopus androsaceus generally retained more P and prevented the accumulation of phosphonates caused by mycorrhizal Hyaloscypha finlandica, highlighting the strong competitive ability of the former species. The increased mineralization of P caused by G. androsaceus was not observed in the combined treatments, suggesting that other present fungi took up part of the inorganic P. The tested fungi did not affect the amount of HS produced but changed the characteristics of the HS. Mycorrhizal H. finlandica and root endophytic Phialocephala fortinii increased the relative proportion of carboxylic moieties in the HS regardless of the presence or absence of G. androsaceus, probably via the production and incorporation of melanins. The UV-Vis absorbance characteristics of the HS were significantly influenced by fungal interactions. Mycorrhizal H. finlandica and Hebeloma bryogenes retarded humification, as determined by the A4/6 ratio. We attribute the similar shift observed in Serpula himantoides to the partial oxidative degradation of HS.
   Our study shows that fungal root endophytes can significantly contribute to litter transformation along with mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. The extent and patterns of the transformation seem to be species-dependent in all studied fungal groups.

AB Evaluating the influences of fine-scale habitat heterogeneity on the composition, diversity, structure and functioning of forests is critical to understand how tropical forests will respond to climate change and devise forest management strategies that will enhance biodiversity conservation and aboveground biomass stock. Here, we hypothesized that topographic and soil factors determine fine-scale habitat differentiation, which in turn shape community composition, species richness, structure and aboveground biomass at the local scale in tropical forests. To test this hypothesis, we selected two areas (each 100 x 100 m) with contrasting fine-scale topographic conditions where all trees, palms and lianas with a diameter at breast height >= 10 cm were tagged and identified to species. In each selected area, 100 subplots of 10 x 10 m were established. We mainly found that higher topographic variability caused higher habitat differentiation with changes in species composition and community structure, but did not change species richness. Our habitat-scale analyses indicated that, in the less heterogeneous area, the distribution of species was more uniform along a fine-scale topographical gradient with no variation in convexity, which induced changes in structure and aboveground biomass, but not in species richness. The nonsignificant relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass may be attributable to species redundancy or functional dominance. This study suggests that environmental filtering is a fundamental process for shaping community assembly and forest functioning along a local topographical gradient in tropical forests.

AB The cultural universe is sometimes confusing, surprising and murky, so many cultural maps get drawn, discussed and envisioned. A study was undertaken around Mabira Forest Reserve in central Uganda to identify the trees and shrubs culturally managed on-farm, assess the cultural practices of forest and tree system management and determine the relationship between farmer gender and forest and tree system management. We engaged 203 farmers in focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews to collect data. Qualitative data were jointly evaluated with farmers; quantitative data were analyzed in SPSS 20.0. The results showed a high likelihood for involvement of local people in tree or forest management for economic gain, as timber and fast-growing species were highly ranked. Food and medicinal species were also regarded as important, suggesting high prospects of integrating them into the local farming system or protecting them in the forest. Numerous cultural practices (including rituals, trenching, bark slashing, ring barking, spot weeding and use of organic manure and pesticides) of forest and tree system management were acknowledged. However, their knowledge was mixed and unclear about distinct cultural and supportive arrangements for natural forest and tree restoration. While gender was not a significant cultural attribute for knowledge of the forest and allied tree system management, age substantially affected farmer propensity for various timber products. Also farmer's family size influenced the collection of tree wildings and fodder. We encourage considering gender disparities and livelihood needs including income, during selection of cultural practices for forest and tree restoration.

AB Secondary vegetation is the land use that has increased the most in the Brazilian Amazon in recent years. Approximately 49% of the increase in the total area since the mid-2000s was due to forest regeneration. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate how environmental policies and economic conditions have influenced forest regeneration in the Amazon biome. This study is based on the Forest Transition theory, which is associated to a long-term phenomenon in which a decline in primary forest area is followed by forest regeneration. We used panel data procedures to estimate several models to assess sources of forest regeneration. Our results indicate that variables associated to secondary forest change are the value and intensity of fines, rural credit, agricultural share of GDP, and agricultural and extractive prices. We conclude that public policies that impose fines to combat illegal deforestation favored an increase in forest regeneration, which was an environmentally positive spillover effect as these policies may promote second forest regeneration as well as decreases in deforestation.

AB Ecotourism can be defined as an environmental activity that takes place in well-preserved areas for recreation and with the responsibility of promoting their conservation. Nowadays, ecotourism is seen as a friendly pastime, but it can potentially affect negatively community diversity and structure by a number of processes such as soil compaction, erosion, and habitat alteration, among many others. Nonetheless, there is hardly any information on the impact of ecotourism in the Tropical Dry Forests and protected areas of the Neotropical region. In an attempt to fill this knowledge gap, the effect of ecotourism was evaluated in a study of a Tropical Dry Forest in the Tayrona National Natural Park of Colombia using dung beetles as bioindicators. A large-scale sampling of three sites with different levels of tourism intensity (no tourism - NT, low tourism - LT, and high tourism - HT) was performed using pitfall tramps baited with human/pig dung during two climatic seasons (rainy and dry). A total of 3238 individuals belonging to nine genera and 15 species were collected. Significant differences in abun-dances, richness, and the Shannon Wiener diversity index were observed between areas with tourism and those without. These differences disappeared during the dry season in response to the strong reduction in species abundance and richness associated to that time of year. All areas maintained a homogeneous beetle structure in terms of functional groups present irrelevant of the intensity level of tourism. Beta diversity analysis shows that the dung beetle assemblage has a nested structure, indicating that the pressure exerted by tourism entails the loss of particular species. Our results advocate that it is necessary to implement conservation strategies in order to reduce the negative impact of tourism on the National Park's biodiversity.

AB An indirect method for estimating biodiversity from Earth observations is the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH). SVH states that the higher the spatial variability of the spectral response of an optical remotely sensed image, the higher the number of available ecological niches and hence, the higher the diversity of tree species in the considered area. Here for the first time we apply the concept of the SVH to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to understand the relationship between the height heterogeneity (HH) of a forest and its tree species diversity, a concept we have named the 'Height Variation Hypothesis' (HVH). We tested HVH in two different European forest types: a coniferous mountain forest in the eastern Italian Alps and a mixed temperate forest in southern Germany. We used the heterogeneity index Rao's Q to estimate HH using a Canopy Height Model (CHM) at different resolutions derived from LiDAR data, and linear regression models and relation analysis to assess the relationships between HH and three species diversity indices derived from in situ collected data: Shannon's H, Simpson's S and species richness. The relationships were calculated for all plots in both study areas, and separately for plots with a defined Canopy Closure (CC 70%, CC > 80%, CC > 90%) to un-derstand the effect of forest density on the relationship between HH and tree species diversity. Our results showed that HH is related to the tree species diversity of the forest ecosystems reaching (in the case of Shannon's H) values of R2 = 0.63 for the coniferous mountain forest and R2 = 0.56 for the mixed temperate forest, par-ticularly when calculated with a CHM resolution of 2.5 m. The associations also increased with increasing ca-nopy closure suggesting that HVH is scale and forest density dependent. Our results also underlined that the abundance-based diversity measures are more highly correlated with HH than with species richness. Finally, our findings suggest that the HVH is a valuable tool for assessing tree species diversity in forest ecosystems, and could also be useful for overall biodiversity estimates.

AB The spatial pattern of forests impacts on biodiversity, stability and sustainability of forest ecosystems. Afforestation and reforestation projects have massively increased forested areas on the Chinese Loess Plateau, however, the spatial pattern of the new and old forests, as well as their interaction, remains unknown. Here we study the spatiotemporal dynamics of old and new forests for the period 2001-2016, and found that 84.21% of the old forests existed throughout the study period. Moreover, core forests (defined as a forest area which is surrounded by other forest areas) significantly increased (2585 km(2) yr(-1), in total 39, 597 km(2)). Two ecological restoration projects have left clear footprints on the forest landscape of the Loess Plateau: (1) The Natural Forest Conservation Project, aiming at expanding old forest, has resulted in the establishment of considerable areas of new forest surrounding old forest. Consequently, this has promoted new core forest areas to emerge. (2) The Grain for Green Project has mainly caused a fragmented landscape of forest islets which gradually connect to core forest areas. The general increase in core forest areas can be considered an ecological improvement, and the assessment method presented here may guide stakeholders in measuring the success of forest restoration activities that goes beyond a classical quantification of forest cover.

AB Understanding the abundance of organic P in soil is a prerequisite for predicting the effects of climate change on P dynamics and availability in cold alpine regions. We sampled plant roots (up to 40 cm depth) and soils (100 cm depth) in grasslands along a 2300 m altitude gradient (1286-3589 m above sea level, mean annual temperature (MAT) from 9 to 0.3 degrees C) between alpine steppes on the Loess Plateau and alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. A modified Hedley P fractionation in combination with root and microbial P, alongside phosphatase activity, was used to characterize P transformations depending on climate. Both the roots and microorganisms stored more P and produced higher phosphatase activity in cold meadow than in warm steppe soils. Total inorganic P (Pi) content decreased in cold meadow (MAT < 3 degrees C) compared with warm steppe soils because of the decrease of moderately labile Pi (extracted with diluted HCl) in cold meadow soils. Available P (NaHCO3) and labile Pi (NaOH) contents increased upslope, whereas the recalcitrant Pi (concentrated HCl) contents remained stable at all sites down to 100 cm soil depth. Labile (NaHCO3), moderately labile (NaOH) and recalcitrant (concentrated HCl) organic P (Po) contents sharply increased in cold meadow compared with warm steppe soils. The residue P in the 0-100 cm along the temperature gradient was similar to that of all Po fractions. The Po proportion in the total P was less than 10 % at sites with a MAT above 3 degrees C, but sharply increased up to 50 % at sites with a MAT below 0.7 degrees C. The greater root and microbial P uptake versus slower Po mineralization in cold meadows than in warm steppes increase the incorporation of Pi into organic pools in cold alpine areas. This accumulation of Po forms is a mechanism to prevent P losses by leaching as inorganic forms. The increased plant available P in cold meadows was associated with the increased phosphatase activity and Po contents compared with warm steppe soils. We conclude that the on-going climate warming could stimulate P cycling more in cold meadows than in warm steppe regions because Po dominated the total soil P in cold areas.

AB Monoculture plantations of fast-growing trees are increasing worldwide and, in many cases, these replace highly diverse natural environments. The Mesopotamian Savannas and the Ibera marshes ecoregions of northeastern Argentina are a mosaic of habitat types in which extensive areas of natural grasslands have been replaced by the planting of non-native pines (Pinus spp.). Their impact on the natural communities is unknown. We evaluated the effect of these plantations, the landscape configuration and the forestry management practices on the assemblages of medium to large-size terrestrial mammals of this region at landscape and stand levels. Camera-trap stations were deployed in three environments: 89 in natural grasslands, 54 in native forest patches, and 91 in tree plantations. At a landscape level, we evaluated the effect of the type of environment and of the extent of different land covers on mammal richness per station using GLM, and on species composition using one-way PERMANOVA and redundancy analysis. At a stand level, we assessed the effect of understory vegetation, and of the age and density of tree plantation stands, on the similarity in mammal species composition between tree plantations and native environments, using non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses and GLM. Species richness and species composition differed between native forests and other environments, but not between grasslands and plantations The variations in composition between the environments differed among the two ecoregions: the species composition in the plantations was different from the grassland assemblage only in the Ibera marshes, which suggests that the impact of tree plantations depends on the local pool of species. Mammal assemblages were also affected by the proportion of forests and wetlands and the environmental heterogeneity in the landscape. The similarity between the mammal assemblages of pine plantations and those of native forests increased with the age of the stand and at intermediate tree densities. In this grassland-dominated but heterogeneous landscape, it seems that most medium and large grassland mammals do not perceive tree plantations as a barrier, regardless of their management. Actions at a stand level, such as planting at intermediate tree densities and promoting longer rotation times, are desirable to encourage the forest mammal assemblage to use the plantations. Forests and wetlands are acting as keystone habitats for many species that are clearly associated with the presence of these environments in the landscape. Keeping large areas of natural grasslands and wetlands sprinkled with forests is essential for the conservation of the mammal assemblages of this region.

AB Question We aimed to analyze how the topography, temperature and rainfall influence the floristic distribution in three different topographic areas and their surrounding vegetation. We addressed three main questions: (i) How is the distribution of species among the topographic areas? (ii) Which abiotic variable is driving this distribution? and (iii) What is the difference among the mountain forests and between mountain forests and the Caatinga vegetation? Location The Maranguape mountain forest were divided into three topographic categories: windward (600-800 m, WMA), leeward (600-800 m, LMA) and top (above 800 m, TMA). We also considered another six areas of mountain forests and four Caatinga areas in Ceara State. Methods We calculated different structural parameters and the floristic diversity of each category. A Principal Correspondence Analysis was performed to analyze the indirect ordination of forest sites by species abundance. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis was conducted to evaluate which variables were driving species distribution. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling distance and the average linkage method to investigate the similarity among mountain forests and Caatinga. Results A total of 1,536 individuals belonging to 144 tree species distributed in 44 families and 93 genera were recorded. Myrtaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae were the most species-rich families.Myrcia splendenshad the highest importance value followed byGuapira nitidaandMollinedia ovata. The leeward slope showed the highest richness and diversity index, whereas the windward showed the highest density and the top showed the highest basal area. The ordination indicated a greater similarity between TMA and WMA than LMA. Conclusion Our results suggest that temperature, precipitation and slope angle are the abiotic factors driving species distribution in Maranguape. Those mountains are heavily anthropized and continuously explored, therefore these outcomes will be useful for conservation and restoration purposes in the poorly known semiarid region of Northeast Brazil.

AB The urbanization process systematically leads to the loss of biodiversity. Only certain arthropods are resilient to the urbanization process and can thrive in the novel conditions of urbanized landscapes. However, the degree to which arthropod communities survive in urban habitats depends on landscape and local effects and biological interactions (e.g., trophic interactions). In the present study, we examined the relative importance of various factors at landscape (isolation, edge density and area of surrounding greenery) and local (size of park, canopy cover, understory vegetation cover, defoliation depth, weight of dried leaves, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH) spatial scales on the diversity of ants, beetles and spiders in urban parks. Our results indicated that park edge density was negatively correlated with diversity metrics in ants, beetles, and spiders in urban parks relative to the degree of proximity with the peri-urban forest. In other words, parks that located adjacent to the peri-urban forest may not necessarily have high biodiversity. The results suggested that man-made structures have been effective dispersal barriers that limit the spillover effects of ants and spiders but not the spillover of comparatively strong fliers, such as beetles. However, the area of surrounding greenery may have facilitated the colonization of forest-dependent taxa in distant parks. Large parks with reduced edge density supported a higher arthropod diversity because of the minimal edge effect and increased habitat heterogeneity. Vegetation structure consistently explained the variability of ants, beetles, and spiders, indicating that understory plant litter is crucial for providing shelters and hibernation, oviposition, and foraging sites for the major taxa in urban parks. Therefore, efforts should focus on the local management of ground features to maximize the conservation of biological control in urban landscapes.

AB Aims Nitrogen (N) deposition causes compositional shifts in subalpine grassland, which can threaten their high plant species diversity. The effects of the interaction of N deposition and climate change are unknown. What are the independent and joint effects of N deposition, warming and water stress on plant functional group cover in subalpine grassland? Do these results apply to the main grassland types of this region typical of base-poor and -rich soils? What vegetation changes can we expect with the current N critical load limits in a warmer future? Location Central Alps, southeast Switzerland. Methods A fully-factorial three-way transplant experiment was established, with a water treatment and three-level N addition (+0, +3, +15 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1)) along an elevation gradient representing temperature changes of -1.4 to +3.0 degrees C. In all, 216 monoliths, sourced from six summer pastures and with vegetation typical of base-poor and base-rich soils, were grown in the experimental site for five years. The cover of functional groups (grasses, sedges, forbs and legumes) was estimated annually. Results Nitrogen addition increased sedge cover only at cooler sites. Grass cover was higher at warmer compared to cooler sites, but the watering treatment reversed this pattern. N addition increased grass cover at warmer sites. Legumes showed a unimodal temperature response with maximum cover at +0.7 to +1.8 degrees C. Further warming decreased their cover and also that of forbs. Watering increased the cover of the latter two functional groups at warmer sites especially. Conclusions In subalpine grassland, the stimulating effect of increased N on sedge cover is dampened by increased temperatures in both grassland types. Within the current critical N load limits, however, a distinct compositional change - increased grass cover - is expected in a warmer climate. Forb and legume cover decreases with temperature increases greater than 2 degrees C, attributable to both water deficit and temperature.

AB Defense, vigilance, and optimal foraging are frequently related to the formation of flocks in birds. Few studies concerning long-distance migrant shorebirds analyzed whether phylogeny and ecological similarities of species are associated with the formation of heterospecific flocks. Here, we explore (1) the niche conservatism theory, (2) the competition-relatedness hypothesis, and (3) the niche construction hypothesis to explain the formation of wintering Nearctic-Neotropical heterospecific shorebird flocks in the southeastern coast of Brazil. In the first, closely-related species keep their ecological traits over time. In the last two hypotheses, ecological dissimilar and distant-related species may coexist due to strong biotic interactions. Our results discard the influence of relatedness between species and/or phylogenetic filtering signals that could act in the formation of heterospecific flocks. Co-participation of species in flocks is explained by similarities in body weight and tarsus length, which invokes the niche construction hypothesis. Probably, some similar-sized and niche-constructing species are relocating in space and changing the environment that they experience to optimize individual capacity to flee from predators. From an ecological perspective, numerous phenotypically similar species with redundant roles could lead to greater resilience of the community under anthropogenic disturbances. From an evolutionary perspective, different species with similar phenotypes may diminish costs of activity matching and augment individual fitness.

AB In Amazonia, human activities that occurred hundreds of years ago in the pre-European era can leave long-lasting effects on the forests - termed ecological legacies. These legacies include the intentional or nonintentional enrichment or depletion of certain species. The persistence of these legacies through time varies by species, and creates complex long-term trajectories of post-disturbance succession that affect ecosystem processes for hundreds of years. Most of our knowledge of Amazonian biodiversity and carbon storage comes from a series of several hundred forest plots, and we only know the disturbance history of four of them. More empirical data are needed to determine the degree to which past human activities and their ecological legacies affect our current understanding of Amazonian forest ecology.

AB Ground-nesting ant species are known to promote plant growth by soil nutrient enhancement.Camponotus compressusants regularly visit the extrafloral nectary-bearing, lycaenid-infested cowpea,Vigna unguiculataplants and construct a shelter for the lycaenid caterpillars at the plant base. The present study shows that ants may influence the overall fitness of the infested cowpea plants by providing nutrients via soil and foliar pathways. Total carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content of ant constructed shelter (ACS) soil of the lycaenid-harbouring plants were assessed, microbes from the ACS soil were isolated and their plant growth promotion ability was evaluated. Nitrate content of the ant faecal matter was estimated and overall plant fitness was assessed in terms of its growth and yield. The results revealed higher content of total C, N and P in the debris and chamber soil of ACS as compared to the control soil from the base of ant-excluded plants. The microbes isolated from the ACS and ant nest soil were found to possess plant growth promotion abilities. Ant faecal matter was found to contain substantial amount of nitrate. The ant-included, lycaenid-infested plants as well as those lacking the caterpillars demonstrated significantly higher number of pods, number of seeds per pod, root length, shoot length, plant height, number of leaves, plant fresh and dry weight as compared to the control plants. Lycaenid caterpillar tending ant species with a high propensity for visiting plants thus have the potential to increase plant fitness by increasing nutrient availability via multiple pathways.

AB Fire is a key factor triggering ecological processes in old-growth grasslands and savannas and could have strong implications for reproduction via seeds for the herbaceous layer. In the Neotropical savannas, grasses show strong synchronous post-fire flowering, and their reproduction is often considered fire-dependent, with their massive post-fire seed production being suggested as a source of population maintenance. However, literature lacks studies to provide evidence of fire-dependent flowering and no study has assessed the quality of the post-fire seed production. Therefore, we aimed to describe a phenological pattern across early-flowering Neotropical savanna grasses in both recently burnt and unburnt cerrado communities addressing three questions: (1) Do the early-flowering species rely on fire for reproduction via seeds? (2) If no, what are the effects of fire on their reproductive phenology? (3) Does the massive seed production in post-fire cerrado communities lead to high-quality seeds? We recorded the reproductive phenology of nine early-flowering grasses for 17 weeks in unburnt and recently burnt cerrado communities. We collected the seeds, estimated the production of fertile seeds, and tested germination. No species showed a pattern of fire-dependent reproduction. Fire stimulated earlier flowering while reproduction in the unburnt community was related to continuous rainfall. Seed production following fire was of low quality, and no species produced > 7% fertile seeds. Seed germination remained below 50% for most species. Post-fire seed production of early-flowering species led to poor seed quality, suggesting a constraint to the recruitment of new individuals of early-flowering Neotropical savanna grasses in recently burnt cerrados.

AB Context Tropical forest loss and fragmentation and the associated loss in species diversity are increasing in both magnitude and scope. Much attention has been paid to how attributes of forest fragments, such as area and forest structure, impact the diversity and functional composition of vertebrate communities, while more recent work has begun to consider the importance of landscape-level variables, such as surrounding tree cover. Yet, the relative impacts of these factors on species diversity and functional composition remain unclear, particularly among under-studied taxonomic groups. Objectives We quantified how species richness, community composition, and functional traits of terrestrial birds and mammals are associated with variation in fragment area, elevation, habitat structure and surrounding tree cover. Our goal was to determine the degree to which these diverse explanatory variables contribute to species diversity. Methods We used motion-activated camera traps to sample terrestrial birds and mammals in 22 forest fragments in northwestern Ecuador. We used a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model accounting for imperfect species detection to estimate species richness and species composition differences among fragments, weighted multiple regression and distance matrix regression to assess covariates of richness and composition, and an RLQ ordination to assess co-variation of environmental conditions and species traits. Results Terrestrial mammals and birds exhibited similar relationships to key environmental variables, but also showed guild-specific differences. Elevation was significantly associated with differences in species richness and community composition for both groups. Forest cover in the surrounding matrix was associated with higher species richness and changes in community composition in mammals, but not terrestrial birds. Canopy openness showed a positive association with mammalian species richness but no relationship with bird species richness. There was no association between density of large trees and richness for either group. We found no significant associations between environmental variation and functional composition among forest fragments. Conclusions This work highlights the general importance of elevation and forest cover in shaping patterns of species diversity and composition in forest fragments and suggests heightened sensitivity to matrix conditions in mammals relative to terrestrial birds.

AB Although studies of biogeography in soil bacterial communities have attracted considerable attention, the generality of these patterns along with assembly processes and underlying drivers is poorly understood in the inner tissues of plants. Plant tissues provide unique ecological habitats for microorganisms, which play an essential role in plant performance. Here, we compared core bacterial communities among five soil-plant associated compartments of common bean across five sampling sites in China. Neutral and null modelling consistently suggested that stochastic processes dominated the core community assembly processes and escalated from the belowground compartments to the inner tissues of aerial plant parts. The multiple distance-decay relationships also varied and had flattened patterns in the stem endosphere, which were shaped by distinct environmental factors in each compartment. Coexistence patterns also varied in topological features, in addition with the sparsest networks in the stem endosphere resulted from the interaction with the stochastic processes. This study considerably expanded our understanding of various biogeographic patterns, assembly processes, and the underlying mechanisms of core bacterial communities between aerial and belowground compartments of common bean. That will provide a scientific basis for the reasonable regulation of core bacterial consortia to get better plant performance.

AB Human pressure mapping is important for understanding humanity's role in shaping Earth's patterns and processes. Our ability to map this influence has evolved, thanks to powerful computing, Earth-observing satellites, and new bottom-up census and crowd-sourced data. Here, we provide the latest temporally inter-comparable maps of the terrestrial human footprint and assessment of change in human pressure at global, biome, and ecoregional scales. In 2013, 42% of terrestrial Earth could be considered relatively free of direct anthropogenic disturbance, and 25% could be classed as "wilderness'' (the least degraded end of the human footprint spectrum). Between 2000 and 2013, 1.9 million km(2)-an area the size of Mexico-of land relatively free of human disturbance became highly modified. The majority of this occurred within tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannah, and shrubland ecosystems, but the rainforests of Southeast Asia also underwent rapid modification. Our results show that humanity's footprint is eroding Earth's last intact ecosystems, and greater efforts are urgently needed to retain them.

AB Climate and land-use change lead to decreasing invertebrate biomass and alter invertebrate communities. These biotic changes may affect plant species abundance and phenology. Using 24 controlled experimental units in the iDiv Ecotron, we assessed the effects of invertebrate decline on an artificial grassland community formed by 12 herbaceous plant species. More specifically, we used Malaise traps and sweep nets to collect invertebrates from a local tall oatgrass meadow and included them in our Ecotron units at two different invertebrate densities: 100% (no invertebrate decline) and 25% (invertebrate decline of 75%). Another eight EcoUnits received no fauna and served as a control. Plant species abundance and flowering phenology was observed weekly over a period of 18 weeks. Our results showed that invertebrate densities affected the abundance and phenology of plant species. We observed a distinct species abundance shift with respect to the invertebrate treatment. Notably, this shift included a reduction in the abundance of the dominant plant species,Trifolium pratense, when invertebrates were present. Additionally, we found that the species shifted their flowering phenology as a response to the different invertebrate treatments, e.g. with decreasing invertebrate biomassLotus corniculatusshowed a later peak flowering time. We demonstrated that in addition to already well-studied abiotic drivers, biotic components may also drive phenological changes in plant communities. This study clearly suggests that invertebrate decline may contribute to already observed mismatches between plants and animals, with potential negative consequences for ecosystem services like food provision and pollination success. This deterioration of ecosystem function could enhance the loss of insects and plant biodiversity.

AB Background and aims Intensification of savannah land-use is predicted to negatively influence soil biodiversity and functioning such as litter decomposition by detritivores. Loss of macrodetritivores, particularly termites, may be problematic in drier savannahs due to the capacity of macrodetritivores to sustain litter decomposition. Here we investigate how human land-use and spatiotemporal rainfall influence the contribution of macrodetritivores to plant litter decomposition. Methods We measured decomposition using globally standardized litter: labile green and recalcitrant rooibos tea litter. The contribution of macrodetritivores to litter decomposition was determined through exclusion using meshed litterbags. Litter decomposition was determined in agricultural land, pastureland and wildlife protected areas during both wet and dry seasons and in mesic and wet rainfall regions across the borders of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Results Macrodetritivores consumed recalcitrant rooibos and mainly avoided labile green tea litter. On average macrodetritivores enhanced recalcitrant litter decomposition by 22%, but litter mass loss varied across land-uses, typically being higher on agricultural and pastureland compared to wildlife protected areas, and was sustained during periods of water scarcity. However, we observed instances of higher decomposition of recalcitrant litter by macrodetritivores in wildlife protected areas. In contrast, litter decomposition by microbes and microdetritivores was more constrained by seasonal and regional water availability with a minor influence of land-use. Conclusion We found that moderate human-modification of savannahs is compatible with macrodetritivore litter decomposition. As savannahs become more intensely used by humans, raising ecological awareness among agropastoralist is required to ensure continued contribution of macrodetritivores to litter decomposition.

AB We examine deforestation processes in Apui, a deforestation hotspot in Brazil's state of Amazonas and present processes of land-use change on this Amazonian development frontier. Settlement projects attract agents whose clearing reflects land accumulation and the economic importance of deforestation. We used a mixed-method approach in the Rio Juma Settlement to examine colonization and deforestation trajectories for 35 years at three scales of analysis: the entire landscape, cohorts of settlement lots divided by occupation periods, and lots grouped by landholding size per household. All sizes of landholdings are deforesting much more than before, and current political and economic forces favoring the agribusiness sector foreshadow increasing rates of forest clearing for pasture establishment in Apui. The area cleared per year over the 2013-2018 period in Apui grew by a percentage more than twice the corresponding percentage for the Brazilian Amazon as a whole. With the national congress and presidential administration signaling impunity for illegal deforestation, wealthy actors, and groups are investing resources in land grabbing and land accumulation, with land speculation being a crucial deforestation factor. This paper is unique in providing causal explanations at the decision-maker's level on how deforestation trajectories are linked to economic and political events (period effects) at the larger scales, adding to the literature by showing that such effects were more important than aging and cohort effects as explanations for deforestation trajectories. Additional research is needed to deepen our understanding of relations between land speculation, illegal possession of public lands, and the expansion of agricultural frontiers in Amazonia.

AB Bacterial communities in biofilters can improve drinking water quality through the biodegradation of dissolved contaminants but also pose potential risks by harboring and shedding microbes into the drinking water distribution system. In this study, pilot-scale granular activated carbon (GAC)-sand and anthracite-sand pilot-scale biofilters were investigated to determine the effects of filter design and operation on the microbiome of the filter media and its relationship to the microbiome in the filter effluent water. Bacterial abundance in the biofilters was relatively stable over time. Bacterial community composition exhibited spatial variation (i.e., with bed depth) and temporal variation linked to water quality changes. Bacterial community composition was significantly affected by the media type (GAC vs anthracite) and backwashing strategy (chloraminated water vs nonchloraminated water). The biofilters reduced bacterial abundance in the water (similar to 70%) but had only a minor effect on the bacterial community composition in the filtrate. Overall, our results suggest that the bacterial communities growing on biofilters affect filtered water quality primarily through the biotransformation of pollutants and nutrients rather than by altering the microbial community composition of the water as it passes through the filter.

AB Context Habitat fragmentation is known to be one of the leading causes of species extinctions, however few studies have explored how habitat fragmentation impacts ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling, especially in wetland ecosystems. Objectives We aimed to determine how habitat fragmentation, defined by habitat area and distance from habitat edge, impacts the above-ground carbon cycling and nutrient stoichiometry of a foundation species in a coastal salt marsh. Methods We conducted our research in a salt marsh in the Mid-Atlantic United States, where the foundation grass speciesSpartina patensis being replaced by a more flood-tolerant grass, leading to highly fragmented habitat patches. We quantified decomposition rates, live biomass, and litter accumulation ofS. patensat patch edges and interiors. Additionally, we measured relevant characteristics (e.g., habitat area, elevation, microclimate) ofS. patenspatches. Results Habitat edge effects, and not habitat area effects, had distinct impacts on ecosystem functioning. Habitat edges had less litter accumulation, faster decomposition rates, a warmer and drier microclimate, and lower elevations than patch interiors. Patches with low elevation edges had the fastest decomposition rates, while interiors of patches at any elevation had the slowest decomposition rates. Notably, these impacts were not driven by changes in primary production. Conclusion Habitat fragmentation impacts the above-ground carbon cycling ofS. patensin coastal wetlands by altering litter decomposition, but not primary production, through habitat edge effects. Future research should investigate whether this pattern scales across broader landscapes and if it is observable in other wetland ecosystems.

Consequently, intense withdrawals for public supply can affect the health of lake ecosystems and increase trees' vulnerability to predicted drought intensification effects.
   This study aimed to evaluate, through a dendroecological analysis of riparian trees, the strength of the climatic and hydrological signals retained in the tree-ring widths and to detect a critical water-level threshold affecting tree resilience and growth recovery. Our study area is located within the Regional Natural Park of Bracciano-Martignano in central Italy. In recent years, the lake water-level drop observed at Bracciano after intensive water withdrawals raised concerns about the ecological impacts on the ecosystem's vulnerability.
   The main distinctive pattern in the climate-growth relations was the influence of previous years precipitation and drought conditions up to five years at Bracciano. At Martignano, where lake water withdrawals are absent, long-term climatic signals disappeared after two years. The intensive human water use at Bracciano Lake most likely induced trees to be more dependent on groundwater raising or soil water content stored from the previous rainy periods especially on an annual scale. On the other hand, tree-ring growth was strongly correlated with short-term water-level fluctuations (monthly - seasonal).
   Tree-rings of riparian species appear to be a useful tool to detect critical water levels after the intensive water withdrawals and the increase in dry conditions occurred in the past few decades. Yearly values ranging from -108 to -139 cm may be considered as potential thresholds affecting riparian species. This finding may support lake water withdrawal regulation for riparian ecosystem protection and conservation under future drought intensification.

AB Among the multiple ecological processes that determine species coexistence and community dynamics, con-specific negative density dependence (CNDD) and niche partitioning are perhaps among the most important. However, the relative strength of these mechanisms may change across life stages and depend on species ecological strategies. We used a dataset that includes information on stage-specific functional traits and a long-term, spatially explicit data of plant survival including 7971 individuals and 41 species monitored for seedling and adult life stages to examine the relative role of these mechanisms influencing individual survival across onto genetic stages in a 9-ha temperate forest plot in China. Our results showed that for seedlings, CNDD became weaker for species with larger leaf area, while for adults, the conspecific neighbors had a positive effect on survival and this effect became stronger with decreasing seed mass. Also, the results examing the effects of neighboring heterospecifics suggest a prevalence of niche partitioning at the seedling stage but a prevalence of environmental filtering or hierarchical competition for the adult stage. In particular, the strength of these processes at the adult life stage increased with higher maximum height and smaller specific leaf area. Finally, we found that the effect of traits on individual survival for seedling and adult life stages was dependent on both the prevalence of conspecifics and functional diversity of heterospecifics in the neighborhood. Overall, our results demonstrates that ecological processes tend to have a stronger diversifying effect for seedlings than for adults and these effects depend on stage-specific species traits. Considering trait variation and their interacting effects with biotic factors across life stages provides further insights into ecological mechanisms shaping plant communities and driving its dynamics.

AB Destruction of natural wetlands has warranted the creation of wetlands to mitigate the reduction of valuable ecosystem functions and services. However, the complex interactions among key drivers of wetland community structure-hydrology, nutrient availability and herbivory-makes creation of functional wetland replacements challenging. We examined interactions among these drivers, and their impacts on plant communities and soil characteristics in two created wetlands with different hydrology and land use histories: a shallow emergent marsh on a previous gravel depository and a seasonally flooded marsh on a former cattle pasture. In paired plots open to or protected from large wetland grazers we observed seasonal variation in grazing impacts on plant communities and an increase in effect size over time. At the permanently flooded marsh with high waterfowl densities and low nutrients, open plots had significantly reduced plant growth and diversity, and an increase in submerged vegetation. In contrast, grazer density was lower and nutrients were higher in the seasonally flooded marsh, where grazer access enhanced plant diversity and reduced invasive plant cover. These results suggest the possibility of long-term grazer-induced shifts in community composition and delivery of key ecosystem services in young, vulnerable created wetlands. To improve created wetland design and function, we suggest that in addition to hydrologic conditions, the impact of prior land use on present nutrient availability be considered. Further, enhanced heterogeneity of spatial and bathymetric structure can provide conditions for diverse plant communities and balanced habitat use by wetland grazers.

AB Microbial communities feature an immense diversity of species and this diversity is linked to outcomes ranging from ecosystem stability to medical prognoses. Yet the mechanisms underlying microbial diversity are under debate. While simple resource-competition models don't allow for coexistence of a large number of species, it was recently shown that metabolic trade-offs can allow unlimited diversity. Does this diversity persist with more realistic, intermittent nutrient supply? Here, we demonstrate theoretically that in serial dilution culture, metabolic trade-offs allow for high diversity. When a small amount of nutrient is supplied to each batch, the serial dilution dynamics mimic a chemostat-like steady state. If more nutrient is supplied, community diversity shifts due to an 'early-bird' effect. The interplay of this effect with different environmental factors and diversity-supporting mechanisms leads to a variety of relationships between nutrient supply and diversity, suggesting that real ecosystems may not obey a universal nutrient-diversity relationship.

AB Forest vulnerability assessment has been proven paramount from regional to global scale in order to determine the natural as well as socio-economic pressure exerted on the ecosystem. The hybrid of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Weighted Overlay Modelling (WOM) has proven to be effective and has yielded desirable results with greater accuracies. In AHP, The highest weights were assigned to forest edge (DFE) (0.27) followed by roads (DRo) (0.22), shifting cultivation (0.11) and settlements (0.11) whereas the parameters river, slope, elevation and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) were given lower priority values of 0.09, 0.08, 0.08 and 0.04, respectively. Among the total of 8856 number of grids of 1 km(2)dimension, 1126 grids (12.71%) are under very high vulnerability and the high and medium vulnerability classes share 682 (7.70%) and 3 grids (0.03%), respectively of the total geographic area of the district. The Anthropogenic Disturbance Index (ADI) ranged from 4.6 to 61.5 and 1429.57 km(2)forest area was common between the overall forest vulnerability and anthropogenically vulnerability indicating that forest vulnerability is occurring mostly due to the socio-economic activities. The causes may be attributed to the operation of two major mines and three major industries and mostly to the shifting cultivation which is one of the major socio-economic practices in the tribal dominated district. The REDD + programmes can be implemented at community levels by strengthening regional forest department and local communities for better management of forest resources through indigenous techniques without compromising the socio-economic and livelihood developments.

AB Edge effects are a common phenomenon in which an ecological variable changes with respect to distance from a habitat edge. Recreational trails may constitute a habitat edge for prairie rodents because of high human presence, high predator presence, or limited shelter compared to the prairie core. Despite the prevalence of trails in conservation parcels, their effect on wildlife distribution remains largely unstudied. We examined the impacts of recreational trails on small mammal activity in the restored prairies of the Cowling Arboretum at Carleton College. The prairies were restored from 1995 to 2008 and now comprise a contiguous prairie block of approximately 155 ha. Over 2 consecutive summers, we used infrared motion-sensing cameras to record the relative amount of time rodents spend at baited stations placed at different distances from the trail. The results varied between taxa: voles (Microtus spp.) avoided trail edges whereas mouse (Cricetidae and Dipodidae) and thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) activity was unaffected by trail proximity. Trails may therefore have species-specific effects on small mammals, with potential consequences for the connectivity and distribution of populations.

AB Understanding the effects of disturbance regimes on community assembly is an essential issue in community ecology. Yet, little is known about how water regimes drive community assembly considering functional facets in aquatic communities. We detected functional trait patterns of amphibious plant communities and checked the effects of inundations on these patterns, using null model analyses based on observational data of 20 Yangtze River floodplain lakes. Amphibious plant communities in the study lakes were dominated by perennials and a large proportion (61.2%) of communities were species-poor (species richness < 3). Null model analyses based on both incidence and biomass data showed 95.6% species-rich communities (species richness >= 3) presented randomness trait patterns. A higher proportion of randomness was found in the post-flood (98.8%) than pre-flood (89.7%) communities, and randomness tended to be more important as inundation increased. We showed for the first time the effects of periodic inundations on trait patterns of amphibious plants in floodplain lakes. Our results suggested that randomness would be common and important at a fine scale even in highly disturbed habitats. We further put forward a new conceptual framework regarding the underlying assembly mechanisms that water regimes drove aquatic plant communities in river floodplain ecosystems.

AB Understanding how biodiversity components are related under different environmental factors is a fundamental challenge for ecology studies, yet there is little knowledge of this interplay among the biotas, especially small mammals, in karst mountain areas. Here, we examine the elevation patterns of the taxonomic diversity (TD), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and functional diversity (FD) of small mammals in a karst mountain area, the Wuling Mountains, Southwest China, and compare these patterns between taxa (Rodentia and Eulipotyphla) and scales (broad- and narrow-range species). We also disentangle the impacts of the human influence index, net primary productivity (NPP), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), annual precipitation (AP), and annual mean temperature (AMT) on these three facets of biodiversity by using structural equation modeling. We recorded a total of 39 small mammal species, including 26 rodents and 13 species of the order Eulipotyphla. Our study shows that the facets of biodiversity are spatially incongruent. Net primary productivity has a positive effect on the three facets for most groups, while the effect of the NDVI is negative for TD and PD in most groups. AMT temperature and AP have negative effects on FD and PD, whereas TD is dependent on the species range scale. The human influence index effect on TD and PD also depends on the species range scale. These findings provide robust evidence that the ecological drivers of biodiversity differ among different biotas and different range scales, and future research should use multifacet approach to determine biodiversity conservation strategies.

AB The relatively poor simulation of the below-ground processes is a severe drawback for many ecosystem models, especially when predicting responses to climate change and management. For a meaningful estimation of ecosystem production and the cycling of water, energy, nutrients and carbon, the integration of soil processes and the exchanges at the surface is crucial. It is increasingly recognized that soil biota play an important role in soil organic carbon and nutrient cycling, shaping soil structure and hydrological properties through their activity, and in water and nutrient uptake by plants through mycorrhizal processes. In this article, we review the main soil biological actors (microbiota, fauna and roots) and their effects on soil functioning. We review to what extent they have been included in soil models and propose which of them could be included in ecosystem models. We show that the model representation of the soil food web, the impact of soil ecosystem engineers on soil structure and the related effects on hydrology and soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization are key issues in improving ecosystem-scale soil representation in models. Finally, we describe a new core model concept (KEYLINK) that integrates insights from SOM models, structural models and food web models to simulate the living soil at an ecosystem scale.

AB Species of Neacomys are small cricetid rodents that occur in forested habitats of Central and South America, from eastern Panama to central Bolivia and central/western Brazil. In order to assess species diversity of this poorly known genus, we obtained cytochrome b gene sequences from the most comprehensive taxonomic and geographic sampling analyzed to date. We also conducted morphological analyses on a large series of specimens housed in 15 museums, including types of 10 out of 14 nominal taxa. Our analyses of the genetic data recovered 17 lineages clustered in four distinct clades. Among these lineages, 11 correspond to species currently recognized as valid, and the remaining six are putative new species. In southeastern Amazonia-the geographical scope of this report-four undescribed species were discovered, three of which are named herein: Neacomys marajoara, sp. nov., from the Island of Marajo, Para state; Neacomys vossi, sp. nov., restricted to the Tapajos center of endemism (between the Tapajos and Xingu rivers); and Neacomys xingu, sp. nov., restricted to the Xingu center of endemism (between the Xingu and Araguaia/Tocantins rivers). The new species can be discriminated from other Neacomys species by the morphology of the nasal bones, zygomatic plate, interorbital region, subsquamosal fenestra, paraoccipital process, incisive foramina, auditory bullae, anterocone and anteroloph of the first upper molar, carotid circulation pattern, and karyotype. Our results substantially improve our understanding of the genus Neacomys by providing morphological, morphometric, and novel molecular insights about these poorly known rodents and demonstrate that the diversity of small Amazonian mammals is still poorly known, even in the relatively accessible southeastern part of the biome.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) is a major driver of forest development and a critically limited nutrient in tropical soils, especially when topsoil is removed by mining. This nutrient can be present in soils in the form of different fractions, which have direct consequences for P availability to plants and, consequently, for restoration success. Therefore, understanding how the stocks of different soil P fractions change over the restoration process can be essential for guiding restoration interventions, monitoring, and adaptive management. Here, we investigated the recovery of soil P fractions by forest restoration interventions on bauxite mine sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed the concentration of different fractions of soil organic and inorganic P at (1) a bauxite mine prepared for restoration; (2) two former bauxite mines undergoing forest restoration for 6 and 24 years; and (3) an old-growth forest remnant. Overall, restored areas recovered levels of labile organic P (P-o-NaHCO3) at 5-40 cm and of moderately labile organic P (P-o-NaOH) at different depths, exhibiting concentrations similar to those found in a conserved forest. The use of P-rich fertilizers and forest topsoil may have greatly contributed to this outcome. Some other fractions, however, recovered only after 24 years of restoration. Other inorganic P fractions did not differ among mined, restored, and conserved sites: nonlabile P-i(residual P and P-HCl), labile P-i(P-i-NaHCO3), and moderately labile P-i(P-i-NaOH). Forest restoration was able to promote efficient recovery of important soil P fractions, highlighting the value of restoration efforts to mitigate soil degradation by mining.

AB There are many gaps in our biodiversity knowledge, especially in highly diverse regions such as the Neotropics. Basic information on species occurrence and traits are scattered throughout different literature sources, which makes it difficult to access data and ultimately delays advances in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. We provide species occurrence and trait data for amphibian species in the Upper Paraguay River Basin, central South America. The compiled information is made available through two different datasets that hold (i) 17K species occurrence records and (ii) 30 species-level traits for 113 amphibian species. The first dataset includes the species occurrence records and informs specimen id, collection of housing, locality, geographical coordinates, geographic accuracy, collection date, and collector name. The second dataset covers species-level attributes on morphometry, diet, activity, habitat, and breeding strategy.

AB To determine the effect of rivers, environmental conditions, and isolation by distance on the distribution of species in Amazonia. Location: Brazilian Amazonia. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Birds, fishes, bats, ants, termites, butterflies, ferns + lycophytes, gingers and palms. We compiled a unique dataset of biotic and abiotic information from 822 plots spread over the Brazilian Amazon. We evaluated the effects of environment, geographic distance and dispersal barriers (rivers) on assemblage composition of animal and plant taxa using multivariate techniques and distance- and raw-data-based regression approaches. Environmental variables (soil/water), geographic distance, and rivers were associated with the distribution of most taxa. The wide and relatively old Amazon River tended to determine differences in community composition for most biological groups. Despite this association, environment and geographic distance were generally more important than rivers in explaining the changes in species composition. The results from multi-taxa comparisons suggest that variation in community composition in Amazonia reflects both dispersal limitation (isolation by distance or by large rivers) and the adaptation of species to local environmental conditions. Larger and older river barriers influenced the distribution of species. However, in general this effect is weaker than the effects of environmental gradients or geographical distance at broad scales in Amazonia, but the relative importance of each of these processes varies among biological groups.

AB Insect colours assist in body protection, signalling, and physiological adaptations. Colours also convey multiple channels of information. These channels are valuable for species identification, distinguishing individual quality, and revealing ecological or evolutionary aspects of animals' life. During recent years, the emerging interest in colour research has been raised in social hymenopterans such as ants, wasps, and bees. These insects provide important ecosystem services and many of those are model research organisms. Here we review benefits that various colour types give to social insects, summarize practical applications, and highlight further directions. Ants might use colours principally for camouflage, however the evolutionary function of colour in ants needs more attention; in case of melanin colouration there is evidence for its interrelation with thermoregulation and pathogen resistance. Colours in wasps and bees have confirmed linkages to thermoregulation, which is increasingly important in face of global climate change. Besides wasps use colours for various types of signalling. Colour variations of well chemically defended social insects are the mimetic model for unprotected organisms. Despite recent progress in molecular identification of species, colour variations are still widely in use for species identification. Therefore, further studies on variability is encouraged. Being closely interconnected with physiological and biochemical processes, insect colouration is a great source for finding new ecological indicators and biomarkers. Due to novel digital imaging techniques, software, and artificial intelligence there are emerging possibilities for new advances in this topic. Further colour research in social insects should consider specific features of sociality.

AB We used presence data to evaluate the role of small patches in bird conservation in the Cape Coast Metropolis of Ghana by surveying 24 forest patches. Cumulative species-area and number curves were plotted by ordering patch size from large to small and then small to large and values for cumulative area or number, richness and abundance calculated. We identified a total of 162 bird species during the study. There was no relationship between either patch area or number of patches and either species richness or abundance of birds. Therefore, we could not support the theory of passive sampling, which suggests large patches host higher species richness than small patches. Perhaps, this is, because of the following observed phenomena: 1). Edge effect, as species from nearby matrices used the patches; 2). Habitat sampling, as species sampled several different patches; and 3). Spillover, as species moved from nearby large reserves, such as Kakum Conservation Area (KCA), to the patches. The patches together occupied 2 947 ha and, compared with KCA, this is a ratio of 1:12, but the ratio in terms of species richness is 2:3, suggesting that many small patches could host more species than one large patch of comparable size. Thus, small patches are valuable for the conservation of bird species, which calls for various conservation bodies and institutions to take measures towards protecting such patches.

AB Mutualistic interactions, such as animal pollination, structure biodiversity in the Neotropics. In coastal montane garua (fog) forests of Ecuador, 2 mass-blooming plants attract up to 17 species of nectar-feeding birds, especially hummingbirds. We describe avian guilds and behavior at the 2 mass bloomers and use mist-netting capture rates to test 3 predictions: (1) capture rates of territorial hummingbirds will increase with flower abundance on the mass bloomer they defend, (2) hummingbirds known to mainly use other flowers will show no change in capture rate during mass blooms, and (3) field observations of interspecific interactions will be reflected in capture rates. We statistically modeled capture rates of bird species, species richness, and Shannon Diversity Index in response to flower abundance on the 2 mass bloomers during 16 flowering seasons (1996-2013). Capture rates of 8 nectar-feeding species increased significantly with increased abundance of white-flowered Psychotria hazenii blooms, while only one species, Speckled Hummingbird (Adelomyia melanogenys), increased significantly in response to red-flowered Stenostephanus clarkii flower abundance, and aggressively defended these flower patches. Violet-bellied Hummingbird (Damophila julie) showed the strongest capture rate response to increased abundance of P. hazenii flowers, and was the dominant territorial hummingbird around these shrubs. Endangered Esmeraldas Woodstars (Chaetocercus berlepschi) and Little Woodstars (Chaetocercus bombus) visited both mass bloomers, but had a statistically significant increase only with P. hazenii highest flower abundance suggesting that restoration to recover endangered woodstars will benefit more from plantings of P. hazenii than S. clarkii. We conclude that flower abundance and defendability structure avian pollinator networks at these mass bloomers more so than nectar quality, quantity, or secretion rates, all of which were similar.

AB Eucalypt plantations alter the physical and chemical conditions of the environment, and the value of such plantations for biodiversity conservation is controversial. Research on their potential effects on native Neotropical bird communities has focused on taxonomic diversity, while its impacts on other ecological aspects remain only partially explored. We used camera traps to compare habitat use and activity patterns of an understory bird assemblage between a native forest and an adjacent eucalypt plantation in the Colombian Andes. Six and seven understory bird species comprised the eucalypt plantation and the native forest assemblages, respectively. Habitat use of the White-throated Quail-Dove (Zentrigon frenata), Sickle-winged Guan (Chamaepetes goudotii), and antpittas was significantly lower in the plantation, whereas brushfinches used both forest types equally. Each species showed coefficients of activity that overlapped above 59%, suggesting the overall activity patterns of the understory birds were similar in both forest types. However, activity peaks of most species were slightly different between the 2 forests. Despite the fact that these areas are adjacent to one another, and that this eucalypt plantation has undergone 50 years of understory growth, our results indicate that this exotic plantation does not constitute a suitable habitat for most Andean understory birds. We found that eucalypt plantation effects on bird assemblages go beyond their taxonomic diversity and affect other ecological aspects such as their patterns of activity. Our study provides new insights on activity patterns of Andean birds and highlights the need for assessing the value of exotic plantations as a surrogate habitat for understory bird conservation.

AB Several of the first avifaunal surveys in Colombia were conducted in the lowland moist forests of the Middle Magdalena Valley, but for decades this region has been understudied. We present results of an avifaunal survey in a zone of Cantagallo, Bol ' ivar, Colombia (Jun-Jul 2019), based on the collection of voucher specimens, associated tissue samples, and observational records. We report 165 species, 77 of which are represented with 266 voucher specimens. We found that the nearest documented records for 7 species are more than 100 km away. Moreover, our collection bridges more significant gaps in temporal sampling (mean = 71 years before our survey). Our field work resulted in the first tissue samples for 10 species in Colombia and 64 species from the department of Bol ' ivar. The Middle Magdalena Valley's forests have almost vanished and the surveyed zone should be considered for protection.

AB This article is part of a series of brief commentaries to highlight papers that have resulted in important and distinctly new perspectives in crop science. Here, we outline a series of two papers by French and Schultz (F&S) on water use efficiency of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) published in 1984. The insight of F&S was not to draw a regression line across their yield-evapotranspiration data. Instead they saw an upper limit of 20 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) that, less than a decade after publication, was widely used by Australian farmers to benchmark their crops and identify causes of yield gaps. Over the last two decades, F&S-type benchmarks have been expanded beyond wheat and beyond Australia to include sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in Argentina, maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat in the United States and China, and millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] in West Africa, among others. More recently, the concept of yield gap analysis based on a upper limit of yield per unit resource uptake has been successfully extrapolated to N. The N uptake per millimeter of water required to meet the water-limited yield potential (0.65 kg N ha(-1) mm(-1) under their original conditions) is a hidden insight in the work of French and Schultz; it has been recently rediscovered in the context of crop improvement, co-limitation theory, and drought-induced N deficit. Perhaps more deeply, French and Schultz shifted farmers mindset from the mildly fatalistic idea of "drought" to the notion that many other factors were typically limiting crop yield, and the quantitative challenge of attaining a plausible benchmark.

AB The Eastern Cape Province harbours 46% of South Africa's remaining indigenous forest cover, and is one of the country's poorest and least developed provinces. Forest resources thus represent a vital component of rural livelihoods in this region. Consequently, forest management policies aim to balance the needs of resource users with the ecological integrity of forest ecosystems. In a recent study, forest bird ranges were shown to have declined in the Eastern Cape over the past 20 years, despite increases in forest cover over the same time period, indicating that habitat degradation may be driving forest bird losses. Given that harvesting of forest products represents the primary human disturbance in forests in the Eastern Cape today, insight is needed regarding the link between resource use and habitat modification. We report on effects of harvesting of three key forest products - poles, timber and medicinal bark - on habitat structure at the ground, understorey and canopy layers in indigenous forests in the province. Harvest activities had considerable impacts on habitat structure, depending on the nature and extent of harvesting. Bark and timber harvesting resulted in canopy gaps, whereas pole harvesting reduced tree density, resulting in understorey gaps. Overall, harvest activities increased the frequency of canopy disturbance, and density of understorey layer foliage. Unsustainable bark harvesting practices increased the mortality rate of canopy trees, thereby increasing dead wood availability. By providing insight into human-mediated habitat modification in forests of the Eastern Cape, this study contributes to the development of ecologically informed sustainable resource management policies.
   Significance:
   Unregulated harvesting of forest products in state-managed indigenous forests of the Eastern Cape results in habitat modification.
   The nature and extent of habitat modification is dependent on the type and intensity of resource use, indicating that resource use may be sustainably managed.
   Timber and medicinal bark harvesting activities result in canopy disturbances, thereby altering natural canopy gap dynamics, with concomitant impacts on understorey habitat structure.
   Changes in forest habitat structure associated with high levels of resource use are likely to have ramifying effects on forest biodiversity.

AB The concept of Ecosystem Services proposed in the 1970s gained wider discussion in the 1990s, mainly due to the increased engagement of member countries of the United Nations in building policies for sustainable dksevelopment that consider human needs and the preservation of natural resources, drawing to this end on efforts from various fields of science. Different sectors of academia, such as biology and geography, contributed to this interdisciplinary discussion with studies in the environmental area and other fields of science that do not effectively work with concepts like ecosystem and environment, and sometimes use these concepts incorrectly in their works to explain a given phenomenon. In order to contribute to the interdisciplinary discussion related to Ecosystem Services and Environmental Services, this article proposes a review of the concepts of ecosystem and environment, including the Payment for Services model, whether environmental or ecosystem, and of Brazilian federal legislation on the subject, contributing to the discussion on how these terms can be used in a more feasible way to address phenomena studied in different kinds of research.

AB Composed of two main forest formations, Ombrophilous Forest and Seasonal Forest, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome is constituted currently by a mosaic of forest remnants and secondary vegetation. Representatives of the Ponerinae ant genus Neoponera are observed mainly in both wet and seasonally dry forests. The aim of this study was to approach the diversity of the genus Neoponera in the north of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil (from the extreme north of its distribution to the Doce River hydrographic basin in the south), associating the occurrence of ant species with the types of vegetation. We have compiled occurrence data from the collection of the Myrmecology Laboratory of the Cocoa Research Center, on internet, or available in literature. We found information on 23 species of Neoponera, including a new record for the Atlantic Forest, Neoponera globularia (Mackay & Mackay, 2010), and a new record for Brazil, Neoponera fiebrigi Forel, 1912. The relative composition of the Neoponera assemblages was evaluated according to the types of vegetation. We found that the occurrence of the genus Neoponera is mainly related to the types of vegetation of the focus region, principally dense forests where a higher diversity was observed.

AB Around the world, urban landscapes are environments modified by man, generally related to low diversity. The efficiency of a biodiversity inventory is linked to the choice of the sampling technique since the taxonomic and ecological responses of the taxons vary between methods. Here we investigate differences in the ant's composition sampled using three different techniques in two fragments of the urban forest in the Brazilian Amazon. We also assessed whether the different techniques maintained the same ecological responses. We sampled 12 collection points at each fragment, at vegetation, and manual collection and Winkler extractor on the ground. At the same points, soil samples were collected to determine their granulometry, pH, and concentrations of organic matter, sodium, phosphorus, and potassium. We collected 115 taxa and 4720 ants. The Cururu was the richest site with more species in general, as well as in the techniques of manual collection and Winkler. We detected a complementary effect on sampling techniques, which collected different ants' assemblages. The potassium concentration positively influenced the assemblage's composition, but its effect varies according to the sampling techniques used. The studied fragments revealed diversity very similar to those registered in continuous Amazonian forests. The use of sampling techniques together improves the representation of the diversity of ants in the studied fragments. Edaphic environmental variables seem to have a predominant effect on ants, affecting their distribution in the landscape even in urban fragments. This highlights the importance of urban forest fragments and their inherent ecological processes.

AB Organic carbon and irrigation water scarcity are two major limiting factors in corn (Zea mays L.) production of Fars province which is located in the south of Iran. Soil tillage systems can affect the nitrogen and water utilization. In 2015-2017, by using the strip-split plot design and two line-source sprinkler irrigation systems, effects of 0, 90, 180, and 270 kg.ha(-1) of pure nitrogen and 6400, 7500, 8550, and 9600 m(3.)ha(-1) of irrigation water in conventional, and no-tillage systems were investigated. Results showed that conventional tillage system had high WUE and foliage yield than no-tillage systems. Based on the obtained results, in the terms of dry foliage yield, combined application of 8550 m3.ha(-1) irrigation water and 90 kg N.ha(-1) (I2N90 treatment) are introduced as the superior treatments in both of two tillage systems.

AB Nature's contributions to people (NCP) are increasingly being considered in decisions by policy-makers because of their relevance to the well-being of people. Learning the value of nature from the perception of communities can help to define priorities and to guide the development of public policies for environmental conservation. The objective of this study was to analyze the perception of the importance, benefits, and problems of NCP among residents of five rural communities, and their opinion about the protected areas of the municipality, considering their socioeconomic characteristics. The method consisted of conducting questionnaire-based, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with a sample of 214 randomly selected households in five rural communities of Parauapebas (Para, Eastern Amazon). We used appropriate statistical tests for data analysis. The main results show that the communities were highly homogeneous and that 52% of the households had low income (below a minimum wage of USD 250). A high proportion of respondents gave the highest importance to all categories of NCP (2/3 of respondents for material, 3/4 for non-material, and 4/5 for regulating NCP). The most commonly mentioned benefits of NCP referred to subsistence or livelihood and quality of life (40% of total mentions). Environmental degradation problems were the most cited (38% of total mentions). Almost all respondents stated that they had a positive opinion about the protected areas of the municipality, despite underusing them. This study is relevant because it analyses, for the first time, the perceptions of NCP among residents of rural communities in the Eastern Amazon, an essential aspect for decision-and public policy-making.

AB Bang Kachao, the largest green area in the Bangkok metropolitan area, delivers significant ecosystem services to sustain society free of charge. It is therefore difficult to achieve socially optimal services because of inefficient allocation of resources, over-consumption, and negative externalities resulting from market failures. This study's purpose is to assess consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for enhancing ecosystem services from the Bang Kachao Green Area and to investigate factors influencing the WTP of Bangkok residents. A choice experiment was applied by interviewing 200 respondents living in the Bangkok metropolitan area. The data were collected between July and September 2016 and analyzed using a conditional logit model. The results reveal that the respondents are willing to pay 42 USD per year to improve the ecosystem services in Bang Kachao. The respondents demand clean air the most, followed by food, recreation, and bird diversity. The government of Bangkok may take proactive steps to promote agroforestry and ecotourism in Bang Kachao. A Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) scheme may ensure the provision of ecosystem services in Bang Kachao.

AB Due to the scarce irrigation water supply in the Loess Plateau, efficient use of rainwater is critical for the improvement of sustainable crop production. Conservation agriculture (CA) has been regarded as an ideal field management strategy to profoundly benefit water use and therefore crop production. However, it remains unclear as to how crop production and water use respond to annual precipitation and how CA practices affect crop production through regulating water use. In this study, a meta-analysis based on field observations was conducted to investigate the relationship between water use and crop production. The results showed that annual precipitation of 300 mm yr(-1)is a threshold to ensure relatively high crop production and water use efficiency (WUE), and 600 mm yr(-1)is the most favorable rainfall level for crop production and WUE. Evapotranspiration (ET) was linearly related to annual precipitation, except that it was not the lowest when annual rainfall <300 mm yr(-1). Although straw mulching is more important than tillage reduction, tillage reduction is still necessary to combine with straw mulching to obtain a higher production of crop. Crop production, ET, and WUE kept increasing as experimental duration increased, indicating that extending CA term is essential to further improve water use and crop production. We further proposed mathematical equations to prove that the increase in transpiration plays a critical role in water use and crop production improvement. WUE is not necessarily related to the increase in yield, and, therefore, higher transpiration rather than increased WUE should be the target for crop production improvement. The results also suggest that evaporation and transpiration are not presented separately, which limits investigation of the effective use of water by identifying transpiration. Overall, annual precipitation is essential for the levels of crop production, ET, and WUE on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Reasonable CA practices, especially long-term application, could improve water use and crop production through increasing transpiration. However, a better future understanding of the relationship between crop production and water use needs more detailed information about the effective use of water at field scales.

AB Understanding of people's landscape preferences is important for decision-making about land planning, particularly in the disturbance patterns that usually occur in rural-urban gradients. However, the use of different types of images concerning the same landscape may influence social preferences and thus perceptions of landscape management and planning decisions. We evaluated landscape preferences and perceptions in four landscapes of southern Chile. We specifically: (1) compared people's perceptions related to living in, visiting, the scenic beauty, well-being, risks, and level of landscape disturbance; and (2) evaluated the influence of the type of scene (i.e., eye-level or aerial images) in these preferences and perceptions. Preferences and perceptions resulted to be better when using eye-level (4.0 +/- 1.1) than aerial (3.7 +/- 0.6) images. In general, we observed a negative association between preferences and perceptions and the landscape disturbance; however, it was consistent when using aerial images but was masked when valuing landscape through eye-level images. Implications of these results are relevant because by far, most landscape preference studies use traditional eye-level images. Different types of scenes should be considered in order to embrace the landscape preferences and perceptions of all those involved and help decision-making in landscape planning.

AB Tropical ecosystems are undergoing unprecedented rates of degradation from deforestation, fire, and drought disturbances. The collective effects of these disturbances threaten to shift large portions of tropical ecosystems such as Amazon forests into savanna-like structure via tree loss, functional changes, and the emergence of fire (savannization). Changes from forest states to a more open savanna-like structure can affect local microclimates, surface energy fluxes, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. A predominant type of ecosystem state change is the loss of tree cover and structural complexity in disturbed forest. Although important advances have been made contrasting energy fluxes between historically distinct old-growth forest and savanna systems, the emergence of secondary forests and savanna-like ecosystems necessitates a reframing to consider gradients of tree structure that span forest to savanna-like states at multiple scales. In this Innovative Viewpoint, we draw from the literature on forest-grassland continua to develop a framework to assess the consequences of tropical forest degradation on surface energy fluxes and canopy structure. We illustrate this framework for forest sites with contrasting canopy structure that ranges from simple, open, and savanna-like to complex and closed, representative of tropical wet forest, within two climatically distinct regions in the Amazon. Using a recently developed rapid field assessment approach, we quantify differences in cover, leaf area vertical profiles, surface roughness, albedo, and energy balance partitioning between adjacent sites and compare canopy structure with adjacent old-growth forest; more structurally simple forests displayed lower net radiation. To address forest-atmosphere feedback, we also consider the effects of canopy structure change on susceptibility to additional future disturbance. We illustrate a converse transition-recovery in structure following disturbance-measuring forest canopy structure 10 yr after the imposition of a 5-yr drought in the ground-breaking Seca Floresta experiment. Our approach strategically enables rapid characterization of surface properties relevant to vegetation models following degradation, and advances links between surface properties and canopy structure variables, increasingly available from remote sensing. Concluding, we hypothesize that understanding surface energy balance and microclimate change across degraded tropical forest states not only reveals critical atmospheric forcing, but also critical local-scale feedbacks from forest sensitivity to additional climate-linked disturbance.

AB Limited information on greenhouse gas emissions from tropical dry forest soils still hinders the assessment of the sources/sinks from this ecosystem and their contribution at global scales. Particularly, rewetting events after the dry season can have a significant effect on soil biogeochemical processes and associated exchange of greenhouse gases. This study evaluated the temporal variation and annual fluxes of CO2, N2O, and CH(4)from soils in a tropical dry forest successional gradient. After a prolonged drought of 5 months, large emissions pulses of CO(2)and N2O were observed at all sites following first rain events, caused by the "Birch effect," with a significant effect on the net ecosystem exchange and the annual emissions budget. Annual CO(2)emissions were greatest for the young forest (8,556 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) followed by the older forest (7,420 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) and the abandoned pasture (7,224 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)). Annual emissions of N2O were greatest for the forest sites (0.39 and 0.43 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) and least in the abandoned pasture (0.09 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)). CH(4)uptake was greatest in the older forest (-2.61 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) followed by the abandoned pasture (-0.69 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) and the young forest (-0.58 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)). Fluxes were mainly influenced by soil moisture, microbial biomass, and soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Annual CO(2)and N2O soil fluxes of tropical dry forests in this study and others from the literature were much lower than the annual fluxes in wetter tropical forests. Conversely, tropical dry forests and abandoned pastures are on average stronger sinks for CH(4)than wetter tropical forests.

AB The occurrence of species is inadequately known for Morelos, one of the smallest states at the center of Mexico. Our research documented the occurrence of ant species in the State. Specimens were collected in four conserved areas and a range of disturbed habitats. Morphological traits and molecular sequences of the Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) were used as complementary tools to identify species. We identified 164 ant species of which 48 were new records for the State. Molecular analysis helped confirm and document the identity of species in groups of ants. The study could be used as a model to assess ecosystem health across extensive geographical regions.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs have been implemented worldwide to balance human needs and ecosystem conservation. However, the effects of PES programs on economic activities and the associated effects on wildlife remain unclear. China's Grain-to-Green program (GTGP) that aims to convert cropland to forest or grassland represents one of the largest PES programs in the world. We combine household surveys with wildlife camera data to ask whether GTGP is associated with direct or indirect effects on economic activities, wildlife occupancy and wildlife species richness. We also consider how resource use and extraction, wildlife occupancy, and species richness differ between GTGP and natural forest sites. We found that farming and the amount of fuelwood extracted from forests have declined, while the collection of other forest resources remained largely unchanged. While residents engaged less in cattle grazing after GTGP implementation, goat grazing and pig forage collection remained unchanged. Paired camera trap and household survey data analyses suggest that presence of humans and dogs was positively related to resource collection, and negatively related to wildlife occupancy, which likely contributed to the lower wildlife species richness detected at GTGP forest relative to natural forest. The results suggest that while PES programs, like GTGP, may reduce some human impacts on forest ecosystems (i.e. reduced firewood collection and cattle grazing) and provide habitat for wildlife through afforestation, the persistence of other types of resource use may limit the positive benefits of PES to wildlife diversity. Our results suggest there may be opportunities for PES programs to extend the multi-benefit approach of balancing human needs and ecosystem services to increase potential benefits to wildlife and biodiversity.

AB While there is a broad understanding of upwelling impacts on the functioning of marine ecosystems, empirical data that link this process to commercial species landings have not received the attention they deserve. The aim of this study was to explore the role of coastal upwelling in determining total allowable catch (TAC) and harvests of benthic fisheries, managed through a policy which assigns Territorial User Rights to Fishers (TURFs) along the Chilean coast. We used official historical TAC (217 TURFs) and harvest data (224 TURFs) for one of the most important benthic gastropod resources ("Loco", Concholepas concholepas) of the TURF system. TAC and harvest data ranged from 2001 to 2018 and were used to explore relations with an index of seasonal coastal upwelling, derived from a spatiotemporal decomposition, of sea surface temperature along the same study areas and period. Using Bayesian generalized linear multilevel models (TURFs as group-level effect), we showed a positive and significant effect of the upwelling over TAC and harvest of Loco. Model results explained 47% of TAC and 34% of harvests. The effects of upwelling were comparatively stronger to the effects of the area (hectares) and the number of fisher members of the TURF. In addition, models estimates showed negative inter-annual trends during the study period, for TAC and harvests, and that these differed as function of upwelling variability. Understanding the role of upwelling gives objective criteria to begin addressing the differential role that social and environmental aspects play in overall TURF performance, allowing to begin hypothesizing over socially driven deviances from predicted patterns.

AB The coexistence of closely related species plays an important role in shaping local diversity. However, competition for shared resources can limit the ability of species to coexist. Many species avoid the costs of coexistence by diverging in habitat use, known as habitat partitioning. We examine patterns of habitat use in seven co-occurring species of burying beetles (genus Nicrophorus Fabricius, 1775), testing the hypothesis that Nicrophorus species partition resources by occupying distinct habitats. We surveyed Nicrophorus abundance and 54 habitat characteristics at 100 random sites spanning an environmentally diverse region of southeastern Ontario, Canada. We found that three species occupied distinct habitat types consistent with habitat partitioning. Specifically, Nicrophorus pustulatus Herschel, 1807, Nicrophorus hebes Kirby, 1837, and Nicrophorus marginatus Fabricius, 1801 appear to be specialists for forest canopy, wetlands, and open fields, respectively. In contrast, Nicrophorus orbicollis Say, 1825, Nicrophorus sayi Laporte, 1840, and Nicrophorus tomentosus Weber, 1801 appear to be generalists with wide breadths of habitat use. We were unable to identify the habitat associations of Nicrophorus defodiens Mannerheim, 1846. Our findings are consistent with habitat acting as an important resource axis along which some Nicrophorus species partition; however, divergence along other resource axes (e.g., temporal partitioning) also appears important for Nicrophorus coexistence.

AB Productivity of tropical lowland moist forests is often limited by availability and functional allocation of phosphorus (P) that drives competition among tree species and becomes a key factor in determining forestall community diversity. We used non-target(31)P-NMR metabolic profiling to study the foliar P-metabolism of trees of a French Guiana rainforest. The objective was to test the hypotheses that P-use is species-specific, and that species diversity relates to species P-use and concentrations of P-containing compounds, including inorganic phosphates, orthophosphate monoesters and diesters, phosphonates and organic polyphosphates. We found that tree species explained the 59% of variance in(31)P-NMR metabolite profiling of leaves. A principal component analysis showed that tree species were separated along PC 1 and PC 2 of detected P-containing compounds, which represented a continuum going from high concentrations of metabolites related to non-active P and P-storage, low total P concentrations and high N:P ratios, to high concentrations of P-containing metabolites related to energy and anabolic metabolism, high total P concentrations and low N:P ratios. These results highlight the species-specific use of P and the existence of species-specific P-use niches that are driven by the distinct species-specific position in a continuum in the P-allocation from P-storage compounds to P-containing molecules related to energy and anabolic metabolism.

AB Forestry plantations of Pinus radiata, managed through clearcutting method, would offer resistance to the movement of native fauna among remnants of native forest. In this study, we evaluate the possibilities of establishing connectivity corridors for native fauna in a forest landscape dominated by P. radiata, focusing on seven species with some level of specialisation in the use of different land covers and that exhibit different movement strategies. We sampled presences and abundances using several types of sampling to determine the abundance and crossing edge probabilities for the ground-dwelling beetle Ceroglossus chilensis; the mesocarnivores Conepatus chinga, Lycalopex culpaeus and Leopardus guigna; the terrestrial frogs Eupsophus septentrionalis and Pleuroderma thaul, and the understory bird Pteroptochos castaneus. We use species distribution modelling and circuit theory to calculate connectivity for each species. Finally, a spatial priorization approach was applied to obtain two scenarios of least-cost corridors. The results show that species with more specific requirements such as L. guigna, P. castaneus, P. thaul and E. septentrionalis, are unlikely to move through clear cuttings and young plantations, but their movement is possible through adult pine plantations with understory. For species that are habitat generalists such as C. chinga and L. culpaeus plantations were suitable for movement. The management of forest plantations should use multi-taxa assessments in the design of biological corridors that allow the connection of forest fragments. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB The Anthropocene presents formidable threats to freshwater ecosystems. Lakes are especially vulnerable and important at the same time. They cover only a small area worldwide but harbour high levels of biodiversity and contribute disproportionately to ecosystem services. Lakes differ with respect to their general type (e.g. land-locked, drainage, floodplain and large lakes) and position in the landscape (e.g. highlandversuslowland lakes), which contribute to the dynamics of these systems. Lakes should be generally viewed as 'meta-systems', whereby biodiversity is strongly affected by species dispersal, and ecosystem dynamics are contributed by the flow of matter and substances among locations in a broader waterscape context. Lake connectivity in the waterscape and position in the landscape determine the degree to which a lake is prone to invasion by non-native species and accumulation of harmful substances. Highly connected lakes low in the landscape accumulate nutrients and pollutants originating from ecosystems higher in the landscape. The monitoring and restoration of lake biodiversity and ecosystem services should consider the fact that a high degree of dynamism is present at local, regional and global scales. However, local and regional monitoring may be plagued by the unpredictability of ecological phenomena, hindering adaptive management of lakes. Although monitoring data are increasingly becoming available to study responses of lakes to global change, we still lack suitable integration of models for entire waterscapes. Research across disciplinary boundaries is needed to address the challenges that lakes face in the Anthropocene because they may play an increasingly important role in harbouring unique aquatic biota as well as providing ecosystem goods and services in the future.

AB Humans have been present in the Andes since about 12,000 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP), transitioning from hunter-gatherers to agropastoralist societies in the mid-Holocene. Yet, the timing and effects of this change in behavior on the ecosystem are largely unknown. Using titanium from XRF analysis, loss-on-ignition (LOI), fossil pollen, Sporormiella, and charcoal, we present a high-resolution 12,000-yr paleoecological history of Lake Llaviucu, a mid-elevation lake in the Ecuadorian Andes. For the entire period of study, humans were active in this landscape, with signs of agropastoralism being present since c. 6100 cal yr BR. Apparent ENSO activity, inferred from titanium inputs to the sediment is also heightened at c. 6100 cal yr BR. A trajectory of increasing landuse seems to have peaked in terms of maize production between c. 2900 and 800 cal yr BR. Thereafter, larger abundances of Sporormiella spores suggest that pastoralism was of increasing importance; a pattern disrupted by European arrival. Apparent peaks in El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) appears to be linked to fire and maize frequency. We investigated the relationship between the Lake Llaviucu record and that of nearby Lake Pallcacocha, which is often cited as providing a regional ENSO history. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ants are one of the most abundant and diverse taxonomic groups. Their ecological fidelity allows them to carry out indispensable roles for the adequate functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Objective: Evaluate seasonal biodiversity dynamics (richness and abundance) of ant species associated with fragments of forest and the surrounding floodplain savanna at the municipality of Arauca. Colombia. Methods: Ants were collected using three complementary techniques (pitfall, Winkler sac and direct collect), in eight forest fragments where linear transects with seven sampling points were installed. Non-parametric estimators and the complementarity index were used to describe the ant community structure. The climatic seasons (dry and rainy) and environments (floodplain, edge, and forest) were compared using species richness and abundance. The relationship of ant species by each sampling points was evaluated with a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and the forest fragment attributes were related to species richness through a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Results: We found 30 496 specimens corresponding to 104 species, 37 genera, and eight subfamilies. The best-represented genera were: Pheidole, Camponotus, Solenopsis, and Dolichoderus. The richness nonparametric estimators showed that the ant community oscillates between 107 and 119 species, no differences were detected in species richness and abundance in terms of the climatic seasons (dry and rainy). There were differences in species richness between Iloodplain with both edge and forest environments. Ant richness fragments of the forest was related by fragment variables such as area, perimeter, fractal dimension, and compactness index. Conclusions: No differences in species richness and abundance were detected between the dry and rainy seasons, which suggests that the species are permanent residents of the study area. There must be mechanisms that allow these ant species to cope with the rainy season. There was a direct relationship between different forest fragment characteristics and ant species richness. This work expands the knowledge of the ant species present in the north of the Colombian Orinoquia.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) drives many fundamental biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and soil development) in forest soil. However, the molecular-level characteristics of DOM derived from different types of tropical forest soils are poorly understood. Here, water samples at different soil depths (0, 20, and 40 cm) from tropical legume (Acacia auricuhformis, AA) and non-legume (Eucalyptus urophylla, EU) tree plantations were analyzed using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), and solution-state H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The FT-ICR MS results indicated that DOM persisted in the soil, but its molecular composition notably shifted from low-mass (150-300 Da) and more-aromatic molecules to middle- (300-450 Da) and highmass (>450 Da) and less-aromatic molecules with increasing soil depth. This was primarily mediated by consumption and mineral sorption of low-mass plant-derived DOM (e.g., low-mass carbohydrates and polyphenols) and further formation of larger microbial products (e.g., protein-like and lipid-like compounds). In addition, a higher abundance of microbial-derived molecules (e.g., protein-like and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules) was found at the legume plantation relative to the non-legume plantation, which suggests a faster microbial turnover of DOM. Also, the legume plantation had greater enrichment of middle- and high-mass and condensed aromatic-like DOM components in soils. These findings improve our understanding of the drivers that mediate the response of DOM to soil depth and tree species in tropical plantations.

AB To overcome phosphorus (P) deficiency, about 80% of plant species establish symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which in return constitute a major sink of photosynthates. Information on whether plant carbon (C) allocation towards AMF increases with declining availability of the P source is limited. We offered orthophosphate (OP), apatite (AP), or phytic acid (PA) as the only P source available to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) (Solanum lycopersicum x Rhizophagus irregularis) in a mesocosm experiment, where the fungi had exclusive access to each P source. After exposure, we determined P contents in the plant, related these to the overall C budget of the system, including the organic C (OC) contents, the respired CO2, the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) 16:1 omega 5c (extraradical mycelium), and the neutral fatty acid (NLFA) 16:1 omega 5c (energy storage) at the fungal compartment. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plants incorporated P derived from the three P sources through the mycorrhizal pathway, but did this with differing C-P trading costs. The mobilization of PA and AP by the AM plant entailed larger mycelium infrastructure and significantly larger respiratory losses of CO2, in comparison with the utilization of the readily soluble OP. Our study thus suggests that AM plants invest larger C amounts into their fungal partners at lower P availability. This larger C flux to the AM fungi might also lead to larger soil organic C contents, in the course of forming larger AM biomass under P-limiting conditions.

AB Context It is known that land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes affect plant community assembly for decades. However, both the short- and the long-term effects of contrasting LULC change pathways on this assembly are seldom explored. Objectives To assess how LULC change pathways affect woody plant community parameters (i.e. species richness, diversity and evenness) and species' presence and abundance, compared with environmental factors and neutral processes. Methods The study was performed in Mediterranean limestone scrublands in NE Spain. Cover of each woody species was recorded in 150 scrubland plots belonging to five LULC change pathways along the past century, identified using land-cover maps and fieldwork. For each plot, total woody and herbaceous vegetation cover, local environmental variables and geographical position were recorded. Effects of these pathways and factors on plant community parameters and on species presence and abundance were assessed, considering spatial effects potentially associated to neutral processes. Results Species richness and diversity were associated with LULC change pathways and elevation, while evenness was only associated with this last. Pathways and environmental variables explained similar variance in both species' presence and cover. In general, while community parameters were affected by recent-past (1956) use, species presence and abundance were associated with far-past (pre-1900) cropping. No relevant spatial effect was detected for any studied factor. Conclusions Historical LULC changes and current environmental factors drive local-scale community assembly in Mediterranean scrublands to an equal extent, while contrasting time-scale effects are found at community and species level. Neutral, dispersal-based processes are found to be non-relevant.

AB Seasonal changes in prevalence rate and number of the epizoic limpet Lottia tenuisculpta on its gastropod hosts, Omphalius nigerrimus and Reishia clavigera, were investigated in Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Monthly samplings conducted from September 2013 to September 2014 revealed that L. tenuisculpta disappeared from the host in winter and new recruits appeared in early spring. Limpets remained on their host up to a critical shell length of 7 mm on O. nigerrimus and 5 mm on R. clavigera. Capture-recapture method confirmed limpets reaching these sizes migrate onto rock surfaces. Additionally, the effects of the host sizes on their epizoic limpets were examined using a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model showed that limpet shell length decreased with the increasing number of conspecifics on both host species. The shell width of O. nigerrimus had a slightly negative effect on the shell length of limpets, whereas that of R. clavigera had a positive effect on it. Our study revealed the host utilization of epizoic limpets changed seasonally and differed between host species. We suggest that both physical and biological factors of hosts affect the growth, survival, and attachment of the epizoites.

AB Larval dispersal affects population dynamics and thus the evolution of species; therefore, understanding how far planktonic larvae can move is key for the conservation and management of marine species. The degree to which genetic connectivity is temporally stable in marine environments is still largely unknown. Here we evaluated the temporal stability of the spatial genetic structure of the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, locally called the loco. This species has a wide geographic distribution along the southeastern Pacific, from Peru to southern Chile. The pelagic larval duration (PLD) of C. concholepas is three months. By comparing samples from eight spatially isolated sites in two different years (2006 and 2011), we analyzed the temporal and spatial variation of genetic diversity using 15 microsatellite loci. The results showed high levels of genetic diversity and high genetic differentiation between and within sample sites in both years. Our results suggest that there is temporal variation in gene flow direction probably drive it by oceanographic currents in the area and consequently larval dispersal at shorter distances might be expected. The Ne estimation suggests a complex demographic history and that inter-annual variability could affect the genetic structure in C. concholepas. This study highlights the importance of integrating temporal scales in the genetic studies of marine species.

AB As attention to individual responsibility and the potential for self-realization through responsibilization grows, there is a need for better understanding of how environmental governance is also changing. In considering changes in community forestry priorities, from reversing deforestation to environmental governance, it is essential to understand how environmental responsibilities are being shifted to individuals and how people react to particular environmental conditions within such changes. In community forestry, farmers' decisions to receive and provide environmental services are guided by rational choices and market mechanisms. This study assessed how farmers value irrigation water supply services from community forests based on the economic and environmental importance of these services. The study also investigated whether responsibilization persists and reframes individual choices to pay for environmental services. Rajapani community forest user group in Rupandehi district, Nepal, was selected for the study due to its ongoing procedures to supply water for irrigation in the village. For data collection farmers were purposively selected to represent different well-being status, gender and distance of paddy field from the water source. Contingent valuation and focus group discussions were employed as research methods. The study revealed that mean willingness of the farmers to pay was USD 77.13 per ha per year for irrigation water. Distance from paddy field to water source, well-being status, education, age, gender and caste of the farmers were tested against willingness to pay (WTP). Pearson correlation tests showed distance of paddy field from water source, well-being status and gender have a substantial influence on the individual's WTP. Farmers also expressed substantial concern for the sustainability of water resources, and were exposed to responsibilizing discourses mainly because they were willing to emphasize personal action to respond to the situation and overcome potential imposed threats of climate change. The shifting forms of environmental governance have implications for responsibilizing service providers and receivers in payment for environmental services, and opens a new discourse in community forestry.

AB Fire is a natural disturbance in many ecosystems worldwide, including tropical savannas, where it drives the assembly of animal and plant communities. The effect of fire is often indirect, impacting the availability of essential resources like food and shelter. The Brazilian Cerrado is the largest tropical savanna in the world, and ants comprise a very high proportion of its animal biomass. About one-third of the Cerrado ant fauna actively forages in the canopy. These ants use trees not just in search of food but also as their main shelter resource, as most arboreal ants nest mainly in cavities produced by wood-boring beetles. While it seems clear that fire can have important direct and indirect effects on arboreal ants, the number of studies using an experimental approach focusing on such impacts is relatively few. Here, we aimed to understand the impacts of fire on arboreal ants usage of shelter resources. Moreover, we also evaluated the potential influence of different fire intensities on these resources usage. For this, we assessed the colonization rates of experimental cavities under four different burning intensities: control, low-intensity, intermediate-intensity, and high-intensity. We hypothesized that fire would have a detrimental effect on cavity occupation. This effect would be stronger in higher intensity burns, once they can dramatically decrease the availability of natural cavities and, thus, the abundance and richness of arboreal ants. We also predicted that some ant species would be indicative of different fire intensities, due to differences in heat tolerance and colony size. Our data showed that fire had a major positive effect on experimental cavity use by arboreal ants, with more ant species, more colonized trees, and higher cavity occupation under fire treatments. This effect was higher with the increase of fire intensity. Some ant species were found more commonly on distinct fire treatments, which was mainly due to their different nesting site requirements and colony sizes. Jointly, these results show that fire affects arboreal ant cavity colonization patterns, and that fire intensity is extremely critical in shaping these patterns. Altogether, our work offers important insights for a better understanding of the effects of ecological disturbances on resource use patterns of a highly abundant and diverse organism.

AB Conversion of natural landscapes into agricultural land-uses represents a major threat to global biodiversity. In lotic ecosystems, aquatic insects are among some of the most vulnerable organisms to such alterations, and thus it is important to study and evaluate how habitat integrity is affected by human activities. In this work we review the Habitat Integrity Index (HII): a measure of environmental integrity of streams. Our objective was to evaluate if this index is a reliable tool for environmental monitoring in tropical streams. We synthesize the relationship between HII and aquatic insect communities in 647 streams in Brazil. Our analysis showed a significant relationship between HII and aquatic insect communities, explaining 29% of variation in community composition and structure. Thus, the HII reflects local environmental quality, as well as wider landscape conditions, making it a good predictor for aquatic and semiaquatic organisms. Our results indicate that HII is a good alternative for aquatic biomonitoring in the Brazilian stream and in other countries that have an Amazon rainforest.

AB The Pudu deer (Pudu puda) is endemic to the temperate rainforest of Chile and Argentina and currently faces serious conservation problems related to habitat loss. However, studies undertaken on this species are not sufficient to identify suitable areas for conservation purposes across its distribution range. In order to estimate the current and future distribution of the Pudu deer in southern Chile, we modelled the potential distribution of this species, based on occurrence points taken from seven contiguous provinces of this area using the Maxent modelling method. The Pudu deer distribution covered an estimated area of 17,912 km(2) (24.1% of the area analysed), using a probability of occurrence above 0.529, according to the threshold that maximises the sum of sensitivity and specificity. In contrast to the Andes mountain range, areas with higher probabilities of occurrence were distributed mainly on the eastern and western slopes of the Coastal Mountain Range, where extensive coverage of native forest persists, as occurs in the provinces of Ranco, Osorno and Llanquihue. Projections to 2070, with global warming scenarios of 2.6 and 8.5 rcp, revealed that large areas will conserve their habitability, especially in the Coastal mountain range. Our results reveal that the Coastal mountain range has a high current and future habitability condition for the Pudu deer, a fact which may have conservation implications for this species.

AB Rainforest in protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon is at risk due to increasing economic pressures and recent weakening of environmental agencies and legislation by the federal administration. This study examines the impacts of deforestation in protected areas on dry-season precipitation in the Brazilian state of Rondonia located in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. Regional-climate model simulations indicate that clearing protected forests in Rondonia would result in substantial changes to the surface energy balance, including increased sensible and decreased latent heat flux. Consequent changes to low-level wind circulation would enhance moisture flux convergence and convection over the newly deforested areas, leading to enhanced rainfall in those areas. However, deforestation of protected areas would decrease dry season rainfall up to 30% in the existing agricultural region, with potentially important negative impacts on agricultural production. Additionally, our results indicates that following deforestation, the newly degraded areas will experience warmer and drier afternoons that could place the remaining natural vegetation under vapor deficit stress.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) could be one of the most important local-scale mechanisms shaping plant species coexistence. However, the spatial and temporal changes in the strength CNDD and the implications for the plant diversity remain unknown. We used 10 years of seedling data, in a seasonal tropical rainforest, to discover how CNDD influences tree seedling survival across habitats and seasons. We also evaluated the relation between CNDD and species diversity. We found the strength of CNDD in the valley habitat was significantly stronger than in ridge habitat in rainy season, but not significantly different in dry season. Corresponding to expectations of CNDD as mechanism of diversity maintenance, seedling species diversity was significantly higher in valley habitat than in ridge habitat and significantly correlated with CNDD. Additionally, conspecific and heterospecific seedling neighbour densities positively affected the survival of tree seedlings, but heterospecific adult neighbour density had a weak effect. Our study finds that CNDD varied significantly across habitats and was correlated with local seedling diversity. Our results highlight the importance of CNDD in driving species diversity at the local scale. Recognizing the spatial and temporal variation in the strength of CNDD will aid efforts to model and understand species coexistence.

AB Forest ecosystems play a vital role in sustaining various life forms on the earth. These ecosystems support society through the provision of goods (timber, fuelwood, etc.) and an array of ecological services (carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, etc.). However, unplanned developmental activities have been affecting the ecological integrity evident from the fragmentation of forests, barren hilltops, conversion of perennial streams to intermittent or seasonal streams, etc. During the past three decades, forests have undergone major transitions with the breaking of contiguous native forests into small parcels of land, restricting the movement of species thereby limiting the potential of species for dispersal and colonization. This paper analyzes the landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of forests fragmentation of Shimoga District, Central Western Ghats and prioritizes ecologically fragile or Ecologically Sensitive regions (ESR) at village levels based on bio-geo-climatic-social variables with the land use dynamics considering temporal remote sensing data. Results revealed that there was a net loss of 10% in forest cover from 43.83% (1973) to 34.02% (2018), primarily caused by the expansion of agriculture, horticulture, and forest plantations. Forest fragmentation has increased, evident from the decline of the interior forest to an extent of 11% from 26% (1973-2018). ESR prioritization at village level in the Shimoga district considering the ecological, geo-climatic and social variables indicate that 11% villages are ESR 1 (highest sensitivity), 30% are in ESR 2 (higher sensitivity), 36% are in ESR 3 (high sensitivity) and the remaining 23% are in ESR 4 or moderate sensitivity category. The analysis illustrates the importance of understanding spatiotemporal patterns of landscape structure for sustainable management of tropical forests.

AB Ceratozamia is a genus of cycads occurring in eastern Mexico and Central America. In this study, we describe a new species from the Pacific region of Mexico in Guerrero state. This locality represents the most northwestern Mexico distribution for the genus. We focus the comparison of this species with the most geographically proximate and phenotypically relevant lineages for this taxon. We followed an integrative taxonomy approach to evaluate the classification of these species, including geographic location, morphology, DNA barcoding and phenology as primary sources of systematic data. Within the morphological dataset, reproductive structures are described in detail and new characters are proposed for microsporophylls. The comparative morphology of these structures facilitated the elucidation of differences in forms and species for identification. The two chosen DNA barcoding markers - namely, the chloroplast genome coding region matK and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region - had low divergence, allowing only 61% of species identification, suggesting slow molecular evolutionary rates. Besides employing these three basic sources of evidence, we introduced phenology as additional information for species circumscription. In addition, this work includes a brief review of the genus at the species-level. This is therefore the most recent review for Ceratozamia across its full geographic range (latitudinal and elevational). Overall, this work further contributes to a comprehensive framework for systematic studies in Mexican cycads.

AB Hundreds of Proteaceae species in Australia and South Africa typically grow on phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils, exhibiting a carboxylate-releasing P-mobilizing strategy. In the Southwest Australian Biodiversity Hotspot, twoXylomelum(Proteaceae) species are widely distributed, but restricted within that distribution. We grewXylomelum occidentalein hydroponics at 1 mu M P. Leaves, seeds, rhizosheath and bulk soil were collected in natural habitats. Xylomelum occidentaledid not produce functional cluster roots and occupied soils that are somewhat less P-impoverished than those in typical Proteaceae habitats in the region. Based on measurements of foliar manganese concentrations (a proxy for rhizosphere carboxylate concentrations) and P fractions in bulk and rhizosheath soil, we conclude thatX. occidentaleaccesses organic P, without releasing carboxylates. Solution(31)P-NMR spectroscopy revealed which organic P formsX. occidentaleaccessed. Xylomelum occidentaleuses a strategy that differs fundamentally from that typical in Proteaceae, accessing soil organic P without carboxylates. We surmise that this novel strategy is likely expressed also in co-occurring non-Proteaceae that lack a carboxylate-exuding strategy. These co-occurring species are unlikely to benefit from mycorrhizal associations, because plant-available soil P concentrations are too low. Synthesis. Our findings show the first field evidence of effectively utilizing soil organic P byX. occidentalewithout carboxylate exudation and explain their relatively restricted distribution in an old P-impoverished landscape, contributing to a better understanding of how diverse P-acquisition strategies coexist in a megadiverse ecosystem.

AB Photodegradation of aboveground senescent plant material (plant litter) due to exposure to solar radiation has been identified as a dominant control on carbon (C) loss in semi-arid ecosystems [1], upturning traditional models of C cycling based only on available moisture and litter quality. In addition to the photochemical mineralization of organic matter [1, 2], sunlight alters the chemistry of cell walls in plant litter [3, 4], making them more susceptible to subsequent biotic degradation [5-7]. Nevertheless, the interactive effects of sunlight exposure, climate seasonality, and biotic decomposition on C turnover remain unresolved in terrestrial ecosystems. We show here that exposure to sunlight accelerated litter decomposition in a Patagonian woodland with a marked dry summer season. Controls on initial decomposition varied seasonally from direct photochemical mineralization in the dry summer to biotic degradation in the wet winter. By manipulating sunlight received by plant litter using spectral filters that attenuated ultraviolet and short-wave visible light, we demonstrate that direct photodegradation and its legacy, associated with increased microbial access to labile carbohydrates, are responsible for the acceleration of aboveground C turnover in this Mediterranean-type climate. Across plant species and over a 2-year period, litter exposed to the full solar spectrum decomposed twice as fast as litter that received attenuated sunlight. Changes in vegetation cover or biodiversity due to projected increased drought and dry season length [8] will likely exacerbate C losses from aboveground litter due to sunlight exposure, negatively impacting the C balance in ecosystems that are particularly vulnerable to global change [9].

   DEMOGRAPHY
AB Biogeographical transition zones are important areas to investigate evolutionary ecological questions, but long-term population monitoring is needed to better understand ecological processes that govern population variations in such edge environments. The southernmost Brazilian rocky reefs are the southern limit of distribution for 96% of the tropical ichthyofauna of the western Atlantic. The Arvoredo Marine Biological Reserve is the only nearshore no-take marine-protected area (MPA) located in this transition zone. The main aim was to investigate how the populations of rocky reef fish species vary in density and biomass in space and over time, inside and outside the Arvoredo MPA. This study presents results based on a 9 year (2008-2017) underwater visual census monitoring study to evaluate the density and biomass of key fish species. Variations in density and biomass were detected for most species. Factors and mechanisms that may have influenced spatial variation are habitat structural complexity and protection from fisheries. Temporal variations, otherwise, may have been influenced by species proximity to their distributional limit, in synergy with density-dependent mechanisms and stochastic winter temperature oscillations. The MPAs harbour higher density and biomass for most species. Nonetheless, a prominent temporal decline in the recruitment ofEpinephelus marginatuscalls into question the continuous effectiveness of the MPA.

AB Key message In older, unlogged rainforest of Hainan Island, China, leaves of saplings were larger, and fine root systems of saplings were thicker with fewer root tips than in historically logged areas. These results were consistent among 15 Angiosperm lineages, even though families differed widely in their leaf and root traits. Context How plant organ morphologies vary with environment is key for inferring plant functional strategies. Aims We were interested in quantifying any changes in fine root and leaf morphology of saplings with local-scale environmental variation in tropical forest, and if any variation in organ morphologies differed with plant lineage. Methods We measured functional traits of fine root systems and leaves of saplings from 15 families in historically logged and unlogged Chinese tropical forest, where soil fertility and texture slightly decreased with greater forest age. Results Root morphological traits were more conservative, while leaf morphologies were more acquisitive in primary forest than in secondary forest. From secondary to primary forests, mean root system diameter increased 0.4 mm, mean specific root length decreased 3.5 m kg(-1), and mean root system branching intensity decreased by 0.3 tips cm(-1). Similarly, from secondary to primary forests, average leaf area increased 7 cm(2)and specific leaf area decreased 0.8 m(2) kg(-1). Leaf thickness and root tissue density were not different. Among the selected plant families, root and leaf morphological differences between forest types were consistent. Conclusion Within lineage (i.e., intraspecific) root and leaf morphological variation showed contrasting patterns. Local-scale variation in soil phosphorus and base saturation affected intraspecific variation in root diameter and specific root length.

AB To measure intraspecific and interspecific interaction coefficients among tree species is the key to explore the underlying mechanisms for species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance in forests. Through the response surface experimental design, we established a long-term field experiment by planting 27,300 seedlings of four tree species (Erythrophleum fordii,Pinus massoniana,Castanopsis fissa, andCastanopsis carlesii) in 504 plots in different species combinations (six pairwise combinations of four species), abundance proportions (five abundance proportions of two species, i.e. A: B = 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 0:1), and stand densities (25, 36, 64, and 100 seedlings per plot). In this initial report, we aimed to quantify the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors on seedling survival at the early stage of growth, which is a critical period for seedling establishment. We found that plot-level seedling survival rate was determined by species combination and their abundance proportion rather than stand density. At the individual level, individual survival probability was mainly explained by species identity, initial seedling size, and soil conditions rather than neighborhood competition. Our study highlights that the seedling intrinsic properties may be the key factors in determining seedling survival rate, while neighborhood effects were not yet prominent at the seedling life stage.

AB Habitat loss is a leading cause of extinctions, which may occur even before species are recorded or formally described. On the other hand, limitations in species distribution data and sampling biases can hamper inferences about patterns of species richness that form the basis of conservation strategies. Insects, despite their crucial roles in terrestrial ecosystems, are still largely neglected when dealing with biological inventories. Among insects, ants are of unique importance because of their species richness, widespread distribution, and due to their key ecosystem functions such as seed dispersal, soil nutrient cycling, predation, and biological control. In this study, we prioritize different Brazilian biomes and ecoregions for new ant surveys based on information on the distribution of occurrence records and two estimates of habitat loss for the period between 2000 and 2016. We compiled nearly 8000 ant occurrence records, including a total of 1170 species. The Caatinga was the biome showing the greatest urgency for new inventories, whereas the Atlantic Forest had the lowest urgency. However, there were considerable differences of priority between ecoregions belonging to each biome, thus underscoring the need to pay special attention to these geographical units and their characteristic associated with ant species. The prioritization of poorly studied sites with an imminent risk of habitat loss can be a valuable starting point for filling knowledge gaps and can help in formulating new strategies of conservation. The dataset provided here may also be useful in studies on the distribution of ant diversity in Brazil.

AB Seed dispersal is a critical mechanism for escaping specialist natural enemies. Despite this, mean dispersal distances can vary by an order of magnitude among plant species in the same community. Here, we develop a theoretical model to explore how interspecific differences in seed dispersal alter the impact of specialist natural enemies, both on their own and though a trade-off between seed dispersal and enemy susceptibility. Our model suggests that species are more able to recover from rarity if they have high dispersal because (1) seedlings are more likely to escape their parent's natural enemies, (2) adults are more spread out, reducing the chance that a seed will disperse near conspecifics, and (3) seedlings compete less with kin for open gaps. Differences in dispersal do not produce stabilizing mechanisms-species with low dispersal are purely at a disadvantage and do not gain a novel niche opportunity. However, dispersal-susceptibility trade-offs will be equalizing, as species disadvantaged by low dispersal will benefit from being less susceptible to specialist natural enemies. This mechanism, unlike most mechanisms of dispersal-mediated coexistence, does not require that there is an abundance of empty space: high-dispersers gain an advantage by escaping from their enemies, not by colonizing empty habitat. Our study therefore suggests that differences in dispersal are unlikely to promote diversity on their own, but may strengthen other coexistence mechanisms.

AB The mechanisms driving species diversity in the context of Janzen-Connell model are best understood by evaluating not only conspecific distance-dependent (CDD) seedling performance, but also replacement of conspecific seedlings by heterospecific seedlings beneath adult trees. We evaluated CDD and replacement as a log response ratio of seedling performance (height, age) directly beneath and at a distance from adult plants in a temperate forest, and examined the log response ratio of that between conspecifics and heterospecifics beneath adults for five hardwood species with different ecological traits (e.g., seed size, mycorrhizal type, relative abundance). CDD was greater in three small-seeded species with arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) associations than it was in two large-seeded species with ectomycorrhizae (EM) associations. Replacement was also higher for small-seeded AM species compared to large-seeded EM species, resulting in a strong, positive relationship between CDD and replacement. The traits suggest that small-seeded AM seedlings are more likely to be replaced by heterologous seedlings beneath the adults than large-seeded EM seedlings, probably due to that the small-seeded AM species are more susceptible to attack by plant natural enemies (e.g., soil pathogens, leaf diseases). As a result, small-seeded AM species had lower relative abundances compared to large-seeded EM species. This study suggests that either seed size or associations with microorganisms play an important role in driving forest diversity by regulating replacement and CDD, although relative importance of the two traits (i.e., seed size, mycorrhizal type) remains unclear, because of the autocorrelation between the two traits for the five species studied.

AB Drought is a global threat, increasing in severity and frequency throughout tropical ecosystems. Although plants often face drought in conjunction with biotic stressors, such as herbivory or disease, experimental studies infrequently test the simultaneous effects of drought and biotic stress. Because multiple simultaneous stressors may have non-additive and complex effects on plant performance, it is difficult to predict plant responses to multiple threats from research examining one stress at a time. Using an experimental approach in the greenhouse, we investigated potential non-additivity in seedling growth and survival to simulated drought and herbivory across a phylogenetically diverse pool of ten Hawaiian plant species. Overall, seedlings showed limited tolerance, defined as similar growth and survival in stressed compared with control (non-stressed) plants, to simulated herbivory and drought, with the combined effects of both stressors to be generally additive and negative across species. Significant variation in stress tolerance was detected among species, and species variation was explained, at least in part, by functional traits such that species with larger root/shoot ratios and smaller seeds, tended to demonstrate greater herbivory and drought tolerance. Future research incorporating additional trait analysis and different stressors could shed light on mechanisms underlying seedling stress tolerance and clarify whether additivity, as detected in this study, extends across other combinations of stressors. Such work will provide needed insights into the regeneration of seedlings in tropical forests under threats of herbivory and climate change.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are leading threats to biodiversity today, and primates are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic habitat disturbance. However, few studies have examined how differential effects of variation in forest fragment characteristics on males and females in a primate population may affect demography and population persistence. We quantified the effects of variation in forest fragment characteristics on the within-fragment demography of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) in forest fragments around Palenque National Park, Mexico, and how these effects differed between adult males and females. We quantified forest loss in the landscape between 2000 and 2017, and used a redundancy analysis to examine the effects of 15 variables quantifying fragment dimensions, forest composition and physical structure, and isolation on fragment population size and density, the proportion of adult males and females in the fragment population, and the mean number of adult males and females per group in 34 fragments (N = 393 monkeys). We hypothesized that (i) population size is positively correlated with fragment area, while population density is negatively correlated, and (ii) the composition of fragment populations results from differential effects of fragment variables on adult males and females. Forest cover decreased by 23.3% from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed a significant effect of fragment variables on population demography in fragments, accounting for 0.69 of the variance in the demographic response variables. Population size increased with fragment area and connectivity, while density decreased. Larger, less isolated fragments with better connectivity, characteristics indicative of abundant secondary growth, and those with more diverse vegetation but lower Simpson's evenness indices tended to have more adult females per group and a higher proportion of adult females in the population. In contrast, fragments that were largely similar in characteristics of forest composition and structure, but that were more isolated from nearby fragments, had more adult males per group and a higher proportion of adult males. These results may stem from black howler females preferentially remaining in natal groups and fragments when possible, and dispersing shorter distances when they disperse, while males may be more likely to disperse between fragments, traveling longer distances through the matrix to more isolated fragments. These differential effects on males and females have important conservation implications: if females are more abundant in larger, less isolated fragments, while males are more abundant in more isolated fragments, then to effectively conserve this population, both landscape connectivity and fragment areas should be maintained and increased.

AB North American cambarid crayfish have been highly successful in establishing and spreading across Europe and are now over-invading earlier arrivals in many water bodies. Parthenogenetic marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis), which originated from aquarium stocks, are relatively recent invaders and have established in lakes previously invaded by spiny-cheek crayfish (Faxonius limosus). However, the feeding ecology of marbled crayfish and consequential impacts on the non-native species' coexistence are largely unexplored. By combining laboratory experiments with stable isotope analyses of field samples, we were able to (1) determine food preferences of both species under controlled conditions and (2) explore their trophic niches in three lakes where both species co-occur. In the food-choice laboratory experiments, the two species showed similar food preferences and consumption rates. Consistently, the stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) highlighted the intermediate trophic position of both species. Marbled crayfish and spiny-cheek crayfish occupied a wide range of trophic positions corresponding to a very generalist diet. However, marbled crayfish were more relying on arthropod prey than spiny-cheek crayfish which fed more on mollusks. This is the first work providing evidence for trophic plasticity of marbled crayfish in lake food webs. Our results suggest that the addition of marbled crayfish increases grazing pressure on macrophytes and macrophyte-dependent organisms and the allochthonous detritus decomposition in ecosystems already invaded by spiny-cheek crayfish. Since both species are listed as invasive alien species of EU concern, further assessments of potentially endangered food organisms are needed.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products are the most used in burned-area monitoring, on regional and global scales. This research aims to evaluate the accuracy of the MODIS burned-area and active-fire products to describe fire patterns in Brazil in the period 2001-2015. The accuracy analysis, in the year 2015, compared the MODIS products (MCD45/MCD64) and the burned areas extracted by the visual interpretation of the LANDSAT/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images from the confusion matrix. The accuracy analysis of the active-fire products (MOD14/MYD14) in the year 2015 used linear regression. We used the most accurate burned-area product (MCD64), in conjunction with environmental variables of land use and climate. The MCD45 product presented a high error of commission (>36.69%) and omission (>77.04%) for the whole country. The MCD64 product had fewer errors of omission (64.05%) compared with the MCD45 product, but increased errors of commission (45.85%). MCD64 data in 2001-2015 showed three fire domains in Brazil determined by the climatic pattern. Savanna and grassy areas in semi-humid zones are the most prone areas to fire, burning an average of 25% of their total area annually, with a fire return interval of 5-6 years.

AB Overexploitation of marine communities can lead to modifications in the structure of the food web and can force organisms like elasmobranchs to change their feeding habits. To evaluate the impact that fisheries have on food webs and on the interactions between species, it is necessary to describe and quantify the diet of the species involved and follow it through time. This study compares the diet of five skate species using the data obtained from the by-catch of the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) fishery in north and central Patagonia, Argentina. Diet composition was assessed by analysing the digestive tract contents and trophic overlapping between species of the genusBathyraja: Bathyraja albomaculata,Bathyraja brachyurops,Bathyraja macloviana,Bathyraja magellanicaandBathyraja multispinis.A total of 184 stomachs were analysed. The diets ofB. albomaculataandB. maclovianamainly comprised annelids, whereas that ofB. brachyuropsprimarily comprised fish, including hake heads discarded by the fishery. The diets ofB. magellanicaandB. multispiniswere largely based on crustaceans. Despite the morphological similarities and their shared preference for benthic habitats, no complete diet overlaps were found between the different species. These results suggest that these skate species have undergone a process of diet specialisation. This is a common feeding strategy that occurs to successfully eliminate competition when resources are limited, which corresponds to the conditions found in an environment being affected by the pressures of overfishing.

AB Network analysis is an important tool to analyze the structure of complex systems such as tropical forests. Here, we infer spatial proximity networks in tropical forests by using network science. First, we focus on tree neighborhoods to derive spatial tree networks from forest inventory data. In a second step, we construct species networks to describe the potential for interactions between species. We find remarkably similar tree and species networks among tropical forests in Panama, Sri Lanka and Taiwan. Across these sites only 32 to 51% of all possible connections between species pairs were realized in the species networks. The species networks show the common small-world property and constant node degree distributions not yet described and explained by network science. Our application of network analysis to forest ecology provides a new approach in biodiversity research to quantify spatial neighborhood structures for better understanding interactions between tree species. Our analyses show that details of tree positions and sizes have no important influence on the detected network structures. This suggests existence of simple principles underlying the complex interactions in tropical forests.

AB Aims Gevuina avellanaandLomatia dentataare Proteaceae species from evergreen temperate forests, but onlyG. avellanacan colonize nutrient deprived volcanic depositions. We hypothesized that under nutrient deprivation,G. avellanawould present higher survival, physiological performance, and adjustment regarding cluster root (CR) formation and carboxylate exudation rate thanL. dentata. Methods We evaluated relative growth rate, maximal photosynthetic rate, photochemical performance, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) leaf concentrations, specific leaf area, photosynthetic P and N use efficiency (PPUE and PNUE), CR formation and carboxylate exudation rate. Plants were grown in a greenhouse, using recent volcanic substrate and watered with different nutrient Hoagland (H) solutions: modified full Hoagland, without P, without N, or tap water. Results Both species showed high survival.G. avellanaexhibited higher growth rates (RGR), and higher CR number and biomass allocation under nutrient deprivation, but lower carboxylate exudation rates thanL. dentata. Malate, oxalate and succinate were detected in root exudates ofG. avellanabut only oxalate inL. dentata. However, PPUE and PNUE were higher inL. dentatathan inG. avellana. Conclusions Our hypothesis was not entirely accepted, CR formation was more "constitutive" inG. avellana, and composition of carboxylates was more diverse, with lower exudation rates thanL. dentata. Moreover,L. dentatashowed higher PNUE and PPUE, partly explained by thinner leaves. Different responses are related with edaphic conditions, where both species inhabit: more diverse toG. avellanaand restricted to developed soils toL. dentata.

AB Biotic invasions have become major agents of human-driven global change. One of the most virulent species for trees is the Dutch elm disease (DED) (Ophiostoma novo-ulmi). However, few are the studies that investigate its indirect impact on the fauna. In a well-preserved area of Sierra Morena (Cordoba, Spain), we report the repercussion of tree cover loss due to DED on ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae), a bioindicator group. For 10 years, before and after DED, we studied ant assemblages in different zones with a gradient of invasion. In the most affected ones, indicator species of well-preserved habitats decreased, while generalist and opportunist species increased. The forest management practices undertaken after the disease had an even more devastating effect, and thus the logging and removal of dead trees in the Bejarano stream caused that its ant assemblage became more similar to the one of a nearby meadow than to the ones of close riparian areas.

AB Accelerating deforestation rates in Earth's tropical rainforests have dramatic impacts on local public health, agricultural productivity, and global climate change. We used satellite observations to quantify the local temperature changes in deforested patches of rainforests across the tropics and found local warming larger than that predicted from more than a century of climate change under a worst-case emissions scenario. We show that the most extreme warming is typically found in large patches of deforestation; the combined effects of deforestation and climate change on tropical temperatures present a uniquely difficult challenge to the long term public health, occupational safety, and economic security of tropical populations.

TI Full stomachs at empty tides: tidal cycle affects feeding activity and

AB Olivella minuta is an abundant neogastropod on sandy beaches from Texas (USA) to southern Brazil. This study aimed to characterize and compare the feeding activity and diet of a Brazilian population of O. minuta in different tidal zones (intertidal and subtidall, and different tidal levels (high and low tides), with three combinations of tidal zone and level being studied (intertidal during low tide, intertidal during high tide and subtidal). The results showed that diet composition was generally similar among tidal conditions, with O. minuta being a generalist, feeding on 45 different food items. Feeding activity, however, was higher in the intertidal during low tide, whereas the richness and diversity of food items were higher in the intertidal during high tide. The higher feeding activity of O. minuta during low tide may be linked to a lower risk of predation; at low tide organisms may be able to feed for a longer time, arid this may be particularly true on beaches with fine sand, where water retention is higher than that on beaches with coarse sand. The higher diversity of food items consumed in the intertidal during high tide is likely related to the increased prevalence of planktonic food during high tide. Our results indicate that tidal zone and level may strongly influence the feeding activity of coastal soft-bottom species and that species may show higher feeding activity during low tide. Given the current loss of intertidal habitats due to anthropogenic activity and climate-change associated factors, our study has important implications, highlighting the importance of intertidal areas for the ecology and conservation of sandy beach species.

AB Hosts are often infested by multiple parasite species, but it is often unclear whether patterns of parasite co-occurrence are driven by parasite habitat requirements or parasite species interactions. Using data on infestation patterns of ectoparasitic arthropods (fleas, trombiculid mites, cuterebrid botflies) from deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), we analyzed species associations using joint species distribution modelling. We also experimentally removed a flea (Orchopeas leucopus) from a subset of deer mice to examine the effect on other common ectoparasite species. We found that the mite (Neotrombicula microti) and botfly (Cuterebra sp.) had a negative relationship that is likely a true biotic species interaction. The flea had a negative association with the mite and a positive association with the botfly species, both of which appeared to be influenced by host traits or parasite life-history traits. Furthermore, experimental removal of the flea did not have a significant effect on ectoparasite prevalence of another species. Overall, these findings suggest that complex parasite species associations can be present among multiple parasite taxa, and that aggregation is not always the rule for ectoparasite communities of small mammals.

AB Land-use changes can significantly affect both the ecosystem services value (ESV) and ecosystem functions. Estimating the impacts of land-use changes in ESV in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is indispensable to provide public awareness about the status of ESV, and to help in policy-making processes. To understand the spatiotemporal evolution of land-use its impact on ESV in the BRI, this study investigated the main water-resource areas of BRI. Using GLCNMO data (2003, 2008, 2013), the land-use dynamic degree, comprehensive index of land-use degree, land-use transfer matrix, and method of ESV valuation were adopted to analyze the changes in land-use and ESV. The results showed that forest and cropland area increased markedly between 2003 and 2013, whereas grassland and shrubland area notably decreased. Forest, shrubland, grassland, cropland, and bare land occupied a relatively large proportion and changed frequently. The total ESV of the study area has increased from US $74.98 million in 2003 to US $82.12 million in 2013, which was primarily caused by the transition from cropland and grassland to forest. The impacts of land-use changes on the specific ecosystem services are also tremendous. The presented results can be valuable for the government for future land-use planning activities.

AB As the global human population increases, and many bird populations in the Neotropics and the rest of the world continue to decline, the study of the intersection of humans, birds, and conservation has become more relevant than ever. The field of conservation social science is an interdisciplinary field that applies the social sciences and humanities to examine research questions that have implications for biodiversity conservation, and encompasses disciplines as diverse as psychology, economics, and political ecology. An understanding of the human dimensions of biodiversity conservation issues can be an essential element in the success or failure of a conservation initiative, policy, or practice. The purpose of this article is to provide an understanding of the growing body of conservation social science relevant to Neotropical bird conservation research and to demonstrate its importance. We discuss how this research can contribute to addressing 5 major threats to bird conservation in the Neotropics, including future research needs, and we provide 3 case studies of bird conservation social science projects, demonstrating the insights that can be gained. We close with a discussion of how conservation biologists and ornithologists can most effectively work with conservation social scientists.

AB For decades, ecologists have studied fundamental questions of how Amazonian biodiversity is maintained, and whether that diversity can persist following deforestation. The long history of avian research at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil, has helped advance this understanding in the context of a broader research program focused on rainforest fragments embedded in a dynamic matrix. By sampling birds beginning before fragments were isolated, in the late 1970s, and continuing the protocol to the present, our work has revealed community dynamics driven not just by area and isolation, but also by larger landscape patterns, particularly second growth recovery over decadal scales. Fragments permanently lose some bird species, but their communities need not follow a trajectory toward catastrophic change. Our challenge now is to determine under what conditions remnant patches and developing second growth can support not just the rich diversity of Amazonian rainforest species but also their population processes and emergent community properties.

AB Since the mid-1980s, swarms of the rhizostomeRhopilema nomadicahave been an annual phenomenon in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters during the summer months. Despite its annual prominence and the potential impact on food webs and ecosystem services, studies concerning its feeding ecology and its interactions with other biota in the marine food web have not been conducted. During summer 2015 gut contents of 41R. nomadicawere analysed as well as ambient plankton assemblages. More than 60% of the medusae diet was found to consist of microzooplankton R. nomadicaconsumed faster swimming prey while smaller medusae relied more on the slower swimming taxa. The medusan diet reflected most of the ambient plankton taxa, but no statistically significant correlations between the relative abundance in diet and ambient plankton were found. As summer progressed, there was a gradual decrease in both mean medusa bell diameter (from 42.2-16 cm) and integrity of feeding structures. These findings suggest thatR. nomadica, at least at the time of its appearance in Israeli coastal waters, may exert less predatory pressure on the plankton than we might otherwise expect.

AB Oviposition site selection directly affects biological fitness and is related to a large number of environmental factors. A conserved trait that constrains oviposition site selection in tree frogs is the laying of clutches in vegetation overhanging water bodies. Some factors that determine oviposition site selection in tree frogs are presence of predators, water temperature, desiccation risk, laying substrate, and the chemical traits of the water body. Agalychnis moreletii and A. callidryas are widespread throughout Central America, but their populations are declining due to deforestation, presence of pathogens, species smuggling, and changes in rainfall patterns caused by global warming. We studied the oviposition site selection of the aforementioned species in four sympatric sites in southern Mexico. We characterized the vegetation, pond area and depth, temperature, and precipitation of the four sites. Each site was visited three times per week for 4 mo to record clutch development and condition, the number of eggs, substrate species, distance to the pond, and sunlight incidence. We detected a total of 404 clutches of both species in all study sites. We used generalized linear models to explore the differences among sites and determine which variables most affected dutch condition. We found significant differences in vegetation structure and pond area and depth among sites. Oviposition site selection was observed at two different scales, and reproductive success was determined by precipitation, light incidence, and substrate availability. The non-random oviposition site selection suggests that both species rely on primary forest structure for a successful reproduction. This information emphasizes the prominent role of primary forest complexity in the reproductive success of these species.

AB Despite several decades of study in community ecology, the relative importance of the ecological processes that determine species co-occurrence across spatial scales remains uncertain. Some of this uncertainty may be reduced by studying the scale dependency of community assembly in the light of environmental variation. Phylogenetic information and functional trait information are often used to provide potentially valuable insights into the drivers of community assembly. Here, we combined phylogenetic and trait-based tests to gain insights into community processes at four spatial scales in a large stem-mapped subtropical forest dynamics plot in central China. We found that all of the six leaf economic traits measured in this study had weak, but significant, phylogenetic signal. Nonrandom phylogenetic and trait-based patterns associated with topographic variables indicate that deterministic processes tend to dominate community assembly in this plot. Specifically, we found that, on average, co-occurring species were more phylogenetically and functionally similar than expected throughout the plot at most spatial scales and assemblages of less similar than expected species could only be found on finer spatial scales. In sum, our results suggest that the trait-based effects on community assembly change with spatial scale in a predictable manner and the association of these patterns with topographic variables, indicates the importance of deterministic processes in community assembly relatively to random processes.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the richest biomes on the planet and also one of the most devastated; currently its distribution is summarized to isolated forest fragments and conservation units. The implementation and maintenance of ecological corridors is an alternative to mitigate negative effects caused by fragmentation. Analysis of the least cost path is a suitable technique for the correct implementation of corridors and can be improved with Fuzzy method. The objective of this work was to determine the potential forest fragments to interconnect in order to create a network of ecological corridors in Atlantic Forest, Espirito Santo State, using Fuzzy concept and least cost path analysis. First, by applying Fuzzy logic, we identified the potential forest fragments for ecological corridors implantation. Next, corridors were suggested based on the least cost path analysis, considering land use, declivity, permanent preservation areas (PPAs), and the 400 forest fragments with greatest ecological potential obtained by Fuzzy logic. A total of 33,105 forest fragments were recorded. Among these, considering combined classes "very good" and "good", only 31.5% were considered suitable for ecological corridors implantation, highlighting the largest fragments within state. Lowest cost path methodology presented 76 routes of runners, with a 335.71 km total length and 63,515.86 ha total area. Land use conflicts showed that forest fragments class predominated in the corridors area. PPAs inside corridors are in misuse, not complying with environmental legislation. Fuzzy Logic concept associated with least cost pathway methodology is an important tool for ecological network planning and implementation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The methodology proposed can be applied to other Brazilian Biomes as well other countries.

AB Temporary Mediterranean streams dry out in summer due to low precipitation and high temperatures, thus affecting biota and ecosystem functioning. The consequences of exposing leaf litter to an extreme summer drought, that is, high solar radiation, low humidity, and high temperatures, were evaluated. It was hypothesised that litter exposure to summer drought conditions in a dry streambed would change litter chemical composition, affecting decomposition and associated benthic communities after autumnal flow resumption. Recently fallen black poplar leaves were enclosed in litterbags and separated into two sets: (1) control leaves, kept air-dry in the dark, and (2) drought leaves, exposed to harsh summer conditions in a simulated dry streambed. Both sets were then immersed in a temporary Mediterranean stream in autumn, and leaf litter decomposition monitored. As expected, summer drought exposure increased nitrogen, total fibre, lignin, and cellulose content in drought leaves. After litterbag immersion, higher cellulose-degrading enzyme activity was observed in drought leaves while lignin-degrading enzyme activity was greater in the control leaves. Fungal and bacterial assemblages clearly differed between treatments. Inter-replicate variability was lower in drought leaves for most of the measured variables, suggesting that drought homogenised decomposer and detritivore communities. Despite these drought-related effects, decomposition rates did not vary, apparently due to counterbalancing effects (that is, drought treatment enhanced recalcitrant compounds and nutrient content in leaf litter) probably related to terrestrial microbial colonisation and photodegradation. Our study demonstrates that summer drought has bottom-up critical legacy effects in temporary Mediterranean streams, affecting the structure and function of decomposer communities.

AB The sapling stage is an important phase due to maintaining plant growth, stability, and survival over the life cycle of trees. However, there are limited investigations in the literature related to both growth and stability of different tree species. This study thus investigated how different tree species at the sapling stage showed different anatomical, morphological, and flexural traits despite being of similar age and growing under the same environmental conditions. The variation of sapling properties was determined in two deciduous tree species: common oak (Quercus robur L.) and Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky). The results of anatomical and morphological measurements showed that the highest average values of ray length, ray width, pith radius, pith%, bark%, and node numbers were obtained in oak saplings, whereas average ring width, number of rays, and wood% were found to be higher in beech saplings. Oak also exhibited better functional stability in its saplings. The flexural properties were almost 60% greater in oak stems than beech stems. The variations in flexural properties were explained by the morphological and anatomical traits since stability was positively correlated with pith radius, pith%, and bark% and negatively correlated with the number of rays and wood%.

AB The underlying principles influencing bacteria community assembly have long been of interest in the field of microbial ecology. Environmental heterogeneity is believed to be important in controlling the uniqueness and variability of communities. However, little is known about the influence of the host macrophytes on epiphytic bacteria assembly. In this study, we used two contrasting artificial water environments (eutrophic and oligotrophic) for reciprocal transplant experiment ofMyriophyllum spicatumto examine the colonization of epiphytic bacteria accompanied with plants growth. Comparative analysis addressed a higher species diversity in epiphytic bacteria than in bacterioplankton, and the highest microbiome richness in sediment. Our data revealed that the organization of epiphytic bacterial community was affected by both plant status (i.e. branch number, net photosynthesis rate etc.) and water bodies (i.e. total phosphate, total nitrogen, pH etc.). Moreover, plant status effected the assembly in priority to water. 16S rRNA gene sequencing further indicated that the epiphytic assemblies were motivated by functionalization and interplay with hosts as a whole. The results complemented new evidences for the 'lottery process' in the epiphytic bacteria assembly traits and shed insights into the assembly patterns referring to functional adaptation across epiphytic bacteria and macrophytes.

AB Light is one of the most critical factors controlling tree survival and growth. Limited light availability induces phenotypic plasticity, thus enabling plants to adapt to suboptimal conditions. The plastic responses are species-specific and are thought to largely depend on species' shade tolerance. This study aims to add to existing research by trying to disentangle the effects of light, species identity, and shade tolerance on growth, biomass partitioning, and morphology of seedlings of seven common European tree species. For that purpose, we set up a shading experiment where seedlings were grown under three levels of light availability (15%, 35%, and 100%). A destructive harvest was carried out for the assessment of biomass allocation and structural complexity of plant architecture after a year of exposure to limited light. The specific leaf area increased with decreasing light availability for all species. However, we found little to no changes in relative height and diameter growth, biomass allocation to aboveground tree compartments, and structural complexity along the light gradient. We argue that because trees were grown under open field conditions, both in the nursery and for the first year of the experiment, it might have resulted in a delayed response to limited light availability. Assuming the delayed reaction of less plastic plant organs, we expect that the morphological adaptations of the tree species and intra- and interspecific differences will become more pronounced, as the trees grow older.

AB Global forest loss is highest in the tropical region, an area with high biological biodiversity. As some of these forests are part of indigenous forest management, it is important to pay attention to such management, its values and practices for better conservation. This paper focuses on sacred freshwater swamp forests of the Western Ghats, India, and with it a faith-based approach to nature conservation.
   Drawing on fieldwork and focus groups, we present the rituals and rules that structure the governance of sacred swamps. We also discuss in depth the ecological, socio-cultural and economic valuation of these freshwater swamps by various local groups. In this way, we show overlaps and differences of valuation among different groups. In the context of a secular state with a diversity of faith groups and migration dynamics, we propose that faith-based governance of sacred swamps can benefit from the emphasis of faith-independent, 'accessible' ecological, socio-cultural and economic values to foster a dialogue around sacred swamps and their place for livelihoods and nature conservation.

AB Identifying the drivers of species richness is a crucial for biodiversity conservation and community ecology. In this paper, the maximum utilization efficiency of water resources available to community is determined as the assembly law in an ecologically stable community with limited water resources. A plant community diversity model that incorporates water potential impedance is established, and the optimization model of community biodiversity structure was obtained based on water niche is also derived. It is shown that this optimization model can theoretically derive a species-area function similar to the traditional island biogeography curve, and it can also verify the predicted values of the species-area relationship experimentally and validated by long-term observations of plant diversity survey data. According to the model analyses, the total number of individuals (N) and the number of species (S) are determined by the combination of the water resources factors (the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season), the individual biological factors (the water consumption per unit mass of species in unit time), the complementary factors of inter- and intra-species water niche (the difference in water potential depending on the water use efficiency of the community), and plant community function factors (the total productivity of plant community). And as the area of plant communities increases, the heterogeneity of the water environment has increased. By adaptation and coevolution, more species are able to go through environmental and biological filtration, becoming community species that can utilize more available water resources at different spatial scales. Changes in water resources resulted in the community maximizing the utilization efficiency of water resources by adjusting the number and abundance of species. The main driving force for the increasing number of species is the full utilization of available water resources.

AB Necromass is crucial to understanding both carbon and nutrient cycling throughout the forest. In this study, we assessed the carbon stock and spatial distribution of necromass components in an Atlantic rainforest, southern Brazil, one hotspot of biodiversity. Necromass comprised: standing dead trees and stumps (SWN), large-sized woody necromass (LWN), medium-sized woody necromass (MWN), and litter (LTR). Specific sample designs assessed each component, while the Payandeh index indicated spatial distribution. Mean wood densities of LWN ranged from 0.24 to 0.46 g.cm(-3), and mean carbon fraction ranged from 0.42 to 0.44 gC.g(-1) d.m. depending on decay class. The total necromass carbon stock was 12.83 MgC.ha(-1). SWN, LWN, MWN, and LTR carbon stores were 3.15, 4.24, 1.50, and 3.53 MgC.ha(-1), respectively. LWN and MWN showed a reverse J-curve skewed carbon stock distribution and clumped spatial pattern. LTR presented asymmetric distribution and a random spatial pattern. Coarse and heavy necromass is clumped near dead trees, while the wind scatters fine necromass throughout the forest. This study provides useful information to the understanding of the carbon cycle in Atlantic rainforests and may be helpful to improve the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases and the Global Forest Resource Assessment.

AB Habitat structure plays a major role in the distribution of species in a given area. Edge-core gradients may be useful for examining the effects of habitat modifications, as they represent changes in habitat structure at a small spatial scale. Here, we analyzed how scorpion assemblages were affected by variations in habitat structure along an edge-core gradient in a Brazilian Atlantic forest fragment. Scorpions were collected during 20 months (May 2007 - December 2008) in 112 pitfall traps, arranged from the fragment edge to 500 m inside the forest interior. All pitfall traps were checked in each two days with all scorpions found being collected. We also measured eight environmental variables along the edge-core gradient: canopy cover, leaf litter depth, diameter at breast height (DBH), plus the densities of fallen logs, stones, trees, shrubs, and bromeliads. We collected a total of 767 scorpions, all within the Buthidae family, and five species were identified (Ananteris mauryi,Tityus brazilae,T. neglectus,T. pusillus, andT. stigmurus). The abundance of these arachnids was positively influenced by habitat structure, with more individuals occurring in areas with trees having higher DBH values. However, species richness and composition were not affected by any of the environmental variables. Our results suggest that, at small spatial scales, scorpion assemblage (i.e. abundance) is sensitive to changes in habitat structure. Here, we have highlighted the importance of habitat structure for the maintenance of scorpion assemblages in their habitats.

AB Population dynamics and life history traits of the 'giant' limpet Scutellastra laticostata on intertidal limestone platforms at Rottnest Island, Western Australia, were recorded by interannual (January/February) monitoring of limpet density and size structure, and relocation of marked individuals, at 3 locations over periods of 13-16 yr between 1993 and 2020. Limpet densities ranged from 4 to 9 ind. m(-2) on wave-swept seaward margins of platforms at 2 locations and on a rocky notch at the landward margin of the platform at a third. Juvenile recruits (25-55 mm shell length) were present each year, usually at low densities (<1 m(-2)), but localized pulses of recruitment occurred in some years. Annual survival rates of marked limpets varied among sites and cohorts, ranging from 0.42 yr(-1) at the notch to 0.79 and 0.87 yr(-1) on the platforms. A mass mortality of limpets on the platforms occurred in 2003, likely mediated by thermal stress during daytime low tides, coincident with high air temperatures and calm seas. Juveniles grew rapidly to adult size within 2 yr. Asymptotic size (L-infinity, von Bertalanffy growth model) ranged from 89 to 97 mm, and maximum size from 100 to 113 mm, on platforms. Growth rate and maximum size were lower on the notch. Our empirical observations and simulation models suggest that these populations are relatively stable on a decadal time scale. The frequency and magnitude of recruitment pulses and high rate of adult survival provide considerable inertia, enabling persistence of these populations in the face of sporadic climatic extremes.

AB The impacts of climate change, in particular via elevated temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, cause differential photosynthetic responses between native and invasive alien plants, often resulting in varying magnitudes of plant growth and productivity. This study investigated variations in photosynthetic responses of an invasive alien Acacia species and two successional groups of tropical heath forest species: early secondary (Buchanania arborescens and Dillenia suffruticosa) and secondary (Calophyllum inophyllum and Ploiarium alternifolium) groups at elevated temperature (25 to 30 degrees C) and CO2 levels (400 to 700 ppm). Invasive A.mangium appears better adapted to higher temperature and CO2. High temperature improved CO2 assimilation of A.mangium compared to heath species, which was attributed to increased transpiration rate and stomatal conductance but decreased water-use efficiency. Photosynthetic responses showed no differences in early secondary species at elevated temperature and CO2 but invasive A.mangium and P.alternifolium were stimulated by elevated CO2. The greater maximum net photosynthesis of A.mangium coincided with lower light compensation point and electron transport rate for RuBP regeneration, to a certain extent. Findings provide insights into possible underlying ecophysiological mechanisms contributing to the invasion success of Acacias in degraded tropical heath forests in response to future climate change.

AB Establishing mixed-species tree plantings and fencing them to protect seedlings from herbivory is a valuable strategy for reconnecting forest fragments separated by agropastoral lands. However, fencing may provide exotic plants with the escape from herbivory required to invade the understory of planted communities. Here we take advantage of such a situation to ask how the identity of planted species and the resulting canopy cover influenced invasion success by the Asian swordtail fern (Nephrolepis brownii Desv. Nephrolepidaceae) in a 13-year-old tropical restoration experiment. Through a seed addition experiment, we also evaluated the effects the ferns had on recruiting seedlings. We found that the invasion was most acute in the unplanted control plots where canopy cover was consistently scarce. Frond density correlated negatively with canopy cover, though most of the variance in the model is explained by the design of our experiment (r(2)m = .161, r(2)c = .460). Between planting treatments that differed in the dispersal mode of the planted trees, the wind-dispersed treatment had higher fern density and longer fronds than the animal-dispersed treatment. The animal-dispersed treatment had the highest recruiting species richness, which was negatively correlated with fern density (r(2) = .748). The seed addition experiment confirmed that mortality rates increased where frond density was higher (F-1,F-41 = 7.159, p = .011) and germination rates were lowered for the smaller-seeded species (F-1,F-42 = 13.2, p = .002). To prevent recalcitrant understory layers from establishing in plantings in the future, we recommend: (1) establishing larger plantings or expanding existing ones to minimize edge effects (particularly light filtration), (2) supplementing young plantings with additional seedlings to prevent canopy gaps from forming, and (3) planting an assemblage of species that cover the full forest strata and have consistently full tree-canopies.

AB Although habitat loss is the predominant factor leading to biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene(1,2), exactly how this loss manifests-and at which scales-remains a central debate(3-6). The 'passive sampling' hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat(7,8), whereas the 'ecosystem decay' hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone(9,10). Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments-when controlled for sampling effort-contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.
   Analysis of 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa from fragmented habitats finds that increasing fragmentation has a disproportionately large effect on biodiversity loss, supporting the ecosystem decay hypothesis.

AB Phosphorus (P) is one of the limiting nutrients in Inner Mongolia steppe soil, which seriously affect steppe productivity. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the distribution characteristics of organic P (P-o) fractions and their influencing factors in Inner Mongolia steppe soil and to identify the contribution of P(o)fractions to soil available P (AP) to maintain the sustainable development of the Inner Mongolia steppe by improving the utilization rate of P-o. The contents of soil P(o)fractions such as H2O-extractable P-o(H2O-P-o), NaHCO3-extractable P-o(NaHCO3-P-o), HCl-extractable P-o(HCl-P-o), NaOH-extractable P-o(NaOH-P-o), and phytate P (Phyt-P) were determined in soil samples (0-15 cm) from 15 sampling sites representing three types of grassland (i.e., desert steppe, typical steppe, and meadow steppe) in Inner Mongolia. The influencing factors of the soil P(o)fractions were determined by redundancy analysis (RDA). Soil P(o)content accounted for 61.0% of the total P (TP) on average. NaOH-P(o)was the main fraction of P-o, accounting for 49.1% of P(o)on average; H2O-P(o)content accounted for the least amount of P-o(mean 1.3 mg kg(-1)). H2O-P(o)and HCl-P(o)were not significantly different among the three steppes. The contents of NaHCO3-P(o)increased in the order of desert steppe < typical steppe < meadow steppe, and the trend of NaOH-P(o)and Phyt-P contents were desert steppe < meadow steppe < typical steppe. Pearson correlation analysis showed that NaHCO3-P(o)was positively correlated with AP (r = 0.86,p < 0.01). HCl-P(o)was negatively correlated with AP (r = - 0.56,p < 0.05). NaOH-P(o)and Phyt-P were significantly positively correlated with NaHCO3-extractable inorganic P (NaHCO3-P-i); Phyt-P was also negatively correlated with HCl-extractable P-i(HCl-P-i) (r = - 0.61,p < 0.05). These correlations were mainly caused by differences in steppe types and soil properties caused by climatic conditions, as shown by the result of RDA analysis. Soil P(o)plays an indispensable role in the supply of soil P in the semi-arid steppe of Inner Mongolia, where NaHCO3-P(o)and HCl-P(o)strongly contributed to AP. In addition, NaOH-P(o)and Phyt-P as a part of stable pools are important for providing P to other P pools. P(o)fractions in steppe soils were mainly regulated by climatic conditions and are closely related to the soil organic matter and pH.

AB 1. Ants provide multiple ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling. Although most studies on nests effects on soil fertility and plant performance include species with large nests, species with less apparent nests may have a relevant effect, especially if they are widespread, abundant, and/or inhabit nutrient-poor soils. 2. We studied the effects of nests of three abundant and widespread ant species in the Patagonian steppe (the generalistDorymyrmex tener, and the seed harvestersPogonomyrmex carbonariusandPheidole spininodis) on soil properties, plant growth of two native species, and seedling recruitment. Our main hypothesis was that, despite their non-apparent nests, these species have a positive effect on soils and enhance plant growth. 3. Nest soils showed higher soil conductivity, %K and %Mg than non-nest soils. In a greenhouse experiment, individuals of the biennial forbOenothera odoratagrew bigger in nest soils ofP. carbonariusandD. tenerthan in non-nest soils. Individuals of the perennial tussock grassPappostipa speciosagrew taller and had more tillers in nest versus non-nest soils. Seedling abundance and richness were the highest inP. carbonariusnest soils and the general trends were similar to those observed in the plant growth experiment. 4. Our results show that ant species with non-apparent nests in an arid area enhance soil properties, favouring plant growth (nests ofP. carbonariusandD. tener) and seedling abundance (nests ofP. carbonarius). Due to their high abundance and widespread distribution, these two species could have a relevant role in ecosystem recovery after disturbance.

AB (edaphic filters drive Myrtaceae assemblages)Aims This study investigated whether soil chemistry act as abiotic drivers of Myrtaceae assemblages, and also investigated the occurrence of indicator species. Methods We first characterize the edaphic conditions of forest fragments occupied by Myrtaceae assemblages in Subtropical Araucaria Forest. Then, we investigated the association between soil chemistry and the structure of the assemblages. Finally, we verified which Myrtaceae species are chemical-edaphic bioindicators. Results We measured 2357 individuals belonging to 26 species from the Myrtaceae family. The Myrtaceae assemblages were predominantly composed by populations with aggregate spatial distribution pattern. This spatial behavior reflects their edaphic requirements because the soil conditions are heterogeneous even on a small scale, forming chemical-edaphic niche patches. Ecological dominance occurred in habitats characterized by restrictive environmental factors such as soils with high acidity and high availability of exchangeable aluminum.Acca sellowianaandCampomanesia xanthocarpaare indicator species of fertile soils, whileMyrceugenia regnellianais acid and low fertility soils indicative. Conclusions In this study we show that soil acidity is an effective driver of Myrtaceae assemblages in Subtropical Araucaria Forest and the use of Myrtaceae indicators can enable policymakers and environmental inspectors to more easily enact conservation in Brazilian ecosystems.

AB To explore the influence of meteorological variables on the growth of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.) plantations and provide a scientific reference for the production and management of Korean pine, three approaches to interpolate meteorological variables during the growing season (i.e., May-September) were compared in Heilongjiang Province, China. Optimized meteorological variable interpolation results were then combined with stand and individual tree variables, based on data from 56 sample plots and 2886 sample trees from Korean pine plantations in two regions of the province to develop an individual-tree diameter growth model (Model I) and an individual-tree diameter growth model with meteorological variables (Model II) using a stepwise regression method. Moreover, an individual-tree diameter growth model with regional effects (Model III) was developed using dummy variables in the regression, and the significance of introducing these dummy variables was verified with an F-test statistical analysis. The models were validated using an independent data set, and the predictive performance of the three models was assessed via the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-a(2)) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results suggest that the growth increment in tree diameter of Korean pine plantations was significantly correlated with the natural logarithm of initial diameter (ln D), stand basal area (BAS), logarithmic deformation of the stand density index (ln SDI), ratio of basal area of trees larger than the subject tree to their initial diameter at breast height (DBH) (BAL/D), and the maximum growing-season precipitation (Pgmax). The individual-tree diameter growth models of Korean pine plantations developed in this study will provide a good basis for estimating and predicting growth increments of Korean pine forests over larger areas.

AB Habitat degradation is considered a huge threat to biodiversity and could become even worse with climate change. If the current situation of Atlantic Forest is not good, then the Restinga ecosystems are even worse due to the high urbanization rate.Glaucomastix littoralis, a lizard species that is endemic and restricted to Restinga areas of Rio de Janeiro State- Brazil, has become even more threatened in the last 10 years mainly due to degradation of physical vegetation structure, since it is closely related to local vegetation. Fieldwork was carried out in the Restingas of Grussai, Jurubatiba, Marica and Marambaia. We performed two density sampling methods and analyzed the degradation index and loss of substrate in each area aiming to compare and monitor the results over a 13 year sampling period. According to method I, the population density ofG.littoralispresented smaller variation between 2013 and 2018, as did the amount of degradation elements, while method II showed an increase in population density. The Jurubatiba Restinga was considered the best area for maintaining this species, while Marambaia is the area where the species are most at risk. The density sampling methods utilized were efficient for understanding the lizards' responses to small-scale and large-scale degradation items. Monitoring the only four populations of this species and the preservation status of each Restinga where it occurs is essential for tracking the species' density variations and for preserving it.

AB Tree squirrels (Sciurinae, Sciurini) represent a diverse radiation that successfully colonized Europe, Asia and the Americas during the Miocene-Pliocene, but information on their evolutionary history remains unclear. In the Neotropics, they have been shown to exhibit the highest rate of diversification amongst all arboreal squirrels, with strikingly high species accumulation rates in the past 3 Mya. In this study, we investigated the tempo and mode of diversification of tree squirrels using a mitogenome dataset that includes 43 Sciurini species. Our results corroborate the date of origin of the tribe Sciurini around 14 Mya (13.4-15.5) but suggest that their ancestral area was most likely in North America. This is in contrast to previous findings that suggested that the ancestors of this tribe occupied Eurasia. We estimated that cladogenetic events leading to the Eurasian lineages occurred twice at 10.5 and 9.7 Mya. Current North American genera originated in a temporal window from 6.2-2.3 Mya, and the origin of the Neotropical radiation was estimated to have occurred around 6 Mya in northwestern South America, in the Pacific dominion. Remarkably, our results indicate that tree squirrels entered South America at an earlier date than previously estimated. This could have happened either through a land corridor connecting the Caribbean islands or through the Panamanian land bridge. Most cladogenetic events in Eurasia and North America appear to have occurred either late in the Miocene or in the Pleistocene, while the majority of Neotropical cladogenetic events occurred along the Pliocene-right after the South American invasion. We found a fairly constant speciation rate for tree squirrels (averaging 0.29), which contrasts with the peak of lineage accumulation observed in the Pliocene. The absence of fluctuations in the diversification rate may be the result of several extinction events that were responsible for equalizing the number of lineages maintained over time. Finally, we conclude that the South American invasion was not as recent as previously inferred, but the diversification there was indeed very fast.

AB A new behavior related to shell care was recently reported for the intertidal hermit crab Clibanarius erythropus (Latreille, 1818) in the Gulf of Cadiz (southwestern Europe). It also has been observed in other species of the diogenid genera Clibanarius Dana, 1952, and Calcinus Dana, 1951, however, it has not been described as an active behavior. In the present study, intertidal hermit crabs from different species and localities were sampled to assess if air-exposure is a shell cleaning behavior restricted to some species of intertidal hermit crabs or if it is a more generalized behavior among species inhabiting intertidal habitats. The results revealed that air-exposure is an active behavior in species of Clibanarius and Calcinus, since we observed it also in Clibanarius albidigitus Nobili, 1901, and Calcinus obscurus Stimpson, 1859, from the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, although not in other intertidal species studied by us. We found interspecific differences in tolerance to physical stress of emerged hermit crabs. This air-exposure tolerance can be interpreted as a physiological adaptation to desiccation stress and is also related to the shell type they inhabit. Also, we provide additional features and details of the air-exposure behavior, combining observations of the first description in 2015 with our new field observations.

AB Sites with high environmental suitability for species' occurrence, in terms of abiotic conditions, may hold populations with higher local abundances by increasing reproductive and survival rates and decreasing extinction rate. Interspecific competition, however, may affect this relationship. Here we tested the hypothesis that local abundance of the gray slender opossumMarmosops incanusis affected by the local richness of potential competitors and environmental suitability derived from ecological niche models (ENMs). We also discuss the ability of distinct modelling methods to predict species' abundance. We compiled occurrence records and information aboutM. incanus' relative abundance from museums and published articles. Environmental suitability was derived from five algorithms using seven environmental predictors. To assess our hypothesis, we chose the best statistical models among generalised linear models and quantile regressions, and then tested whether the effects of richness of competitors on local abundance are stronger under highly suitable conditions. We found that environmental suitability given by presence-only methods are positively related to the maximum abundance ofM. incanus. That is, species' local abundance is low when suitability is low but can be either low or high when suitability is high. The richness of competitors, in turn, explains the abundance variation within sites with high environmental suitability. We strongly recommend that the relationship between abundance and suitability must be carefully interpreted when using ENMs to predict species' distribution because biotic interactions can be the main driver of local abundance within highly suitable environments.

AB 1. Pioneer trees with fleshy fruits are typically planted in restoration projects to attract frugivores as a mean to increase dispersal and accelerate forest regeneration. However, differences in fruit traits of pioneer trees can potentially influence dispersal and their restoration outcomes.
   2. Here we investigated the effects of bird and plant traits, and distance to forest fragments, on the seed rain using a tree-planting experiment replicated in 12 deforested sites in Brazil. Factors were fruit traits of pioneer trees (wind-dispersed, bird-dispersed with lipids or with carbohydrates and controls) and distance (10, 50, 300 m) from forest fragments.
   3. We found that density and richness of birds and seeds decreased exponentially with distance from fragments, yet these effects were minor compared to the effects of fruit traits on the structure of the seed rain.
   4. Overall, plots with fleshy fruited pioneers attracted much greater bird activity and seed dispersal than plots with wind-dispersal pioneers and the controls. For instance, plots with carbohydrate-rich fruits received more than twice the average species richness and density of birds and seeds of plots with lipid-rich pioneer trees, surpassing wind-dispersed pioneers by more than 80%, and controls by over 90%. Furthermore, the fruit trait treatments resulted in morphological shifts in the average traits of visiting birds. Significant differences in bill gape and flight capacities (wing-loading) were associated with the differences in the seed rain associated with each treatment.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Understanding how trait-matching processes mediating mutualistic seed dispersal by frugivores interact with distance-dependent dispersal limitation on deforested tropical landscapes is critical for improving forest restoration efforts. This is especially relevant in the context of applied nucleation. As shown here, avian seed dispersal can thus be manipulated in restoration projects in order to increase connectivity and speed up forest recovery and the provision of the multiple ecosystem services that follow forest succession.

AB Digital accessible knowledge of biodiversity data is an increasingly important source of information in studies of biogeography and conservation. These databases can also reveal temporal, spatial and taxonomical gaps in biodiversity documentation, even in areas that have been intensively studied and from where accurate species lists are available. Therefore, revealing these gaps may help allocating collecting efforts, conservation priorities and strategies for improving database curation. Here, we evaluate potential shortfalls for flowering plants in a tropical hotspot, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, by cross-referencing two online repositories of biodiversity data (the Global Biodiversity Information Facility - GBIF - and the Brazilian Flora 2020 floristic database - BFG). We aimed to evaluate the congruence between those repositories, highlighting tendencies in current documentation for this area. We found that from the 7220 reported flowering plant species endemics to the Atlantic Forest, 1573 (22%) have no valid spatial data in GBIF, and 75% of all of the 605,951 records do not present valid spatial information. Most of the missing information is related to species known only from few and old collections with absent or inaccurately georeferenced data. This lack of information may cause a large impact in spatial studies, especially for rare and threatened species. Nevertheless, our analysis also shows that spatial information for the filtered data is highly congruent between GBIF and BFG data, indicating relatively high availability of quality data in large repositories after standard and automatized cleaning procedures. Still, good practices to decrease the impact of losing data are recommended, including more investment in field collections, targeting poorly known species and returning cleaned spatial datasets to online repositories after taxonomic revisions.

AB The construction of artificial structures, such as seawalls, is increasing globally, resulting in loss of habitat complexity and native species biodiversity. There is increasing interest in mitigating this biodiversity loss by adding topographic habitat to these structures, and/or seeding them with habitat-forming species. Settlement tile experiments, comparing colonisation of species to more and less complex habitats, have been used to inform eco-engineering interventions prior to their large-scale implementation. Most studies have focused on applying one type of intervention (either adding habitat structure or seeding with native organisms), so it is unclear whether there are greater benefits to biodiversity when multiple interventions are combined. Using a fully orthogonal experiment, we assessed the independent and interactive effects of habitat structure (flat vs. crevice/ridges) and seeding with native oysters (unseeded vs. seeded) on the biodiversity of four different functional groups (sessile and mobile taxa, cryptobenthic and pelagic fishes). Concrete tiles (flat unseeded, flat seeded, complex unseeded and complex seeded) were deployed at two sites in Sydney Harbour and monitored over 12 months, for the survival and colonisation of oysters and the species density and abundances of the four functional groups. The survival of seeded oysters was greater on the complex than flat tiles, at one of the two sites, due to the protective role of crevices. Despite this, after 12 months, the species density of sessile invertebrates and the percentage cover of seeded and colonising oysters did not differ between complex and seeded tiles each of which supported more of these variables than the flat unseeded tiles. In contrast, the species density of mobile invertebrates and cryptobenthic fishes and the MaxN of pelagic fishes, at 1 month, were only positively influenced by seeding with oysters, which provided food as well as habitat. Within the complex seeded and unseeded tiles, there was a greater species density of sessile taxa, survival and percentage cover of oysters in the crevices, which were more humid and darker at month 12, had lower high temperature extremes at months 1 and 12, than on the ridges or flat tiles. Our results suggest that eco-engineering projects which seek to maximise the biodiversity of multiple functional groups on seawalls, should apply a variety of different microhabitats and habitat-forming species, to alter the environmental conditions available to organisms.

AB Aims The soil microbial community plays a critical role in increasing phosphorus (P) availability in low-P, weathered soils by "mining" recalcitrant organic P through the production of phosphatase enzymes. However, there is a lack of data on the fungal and bacterial taxa which are directly involved in P mining, which could also serve as potential microbial bioindicators of low P availability. Methods and Results Leveraging a 5-year P enrichment experiment on low-P forest soils, high-throughput sequencing was used to profile the microbial community to determine which taxa associate closely with P availability. We hypothesized that there would be a specialized group of soil micro-organisms that could access recalcitrant P and whose presence could serve as a bioindicator of P mining. Community profiling revealed several candidate bioindicators of P mining (Russulales, Acidobacteria Subgroup 2, Acidobacteriales, Obscuribacterales and Solibacterales), whose relative abundance declined with elevated P and had a significant, positive association with phosphatase production. In addition, we identified candidate bioindicators of high P availability (Mytilinidales, Sebacinales, Chitinophagales, Cytophagales, Saccharimonadales, Opitulales and Gemmatales). Conclusions This research provides evidence that mitigating P limitation in this ecosystem may be a specialized trait and is mediated by a few microbial taxa. Significance and Impact of the Study Here, we characterize Orders of soil microbes associated with manipulated phosphorus availability in forest soils to determine bioindicator candidates for phosphorus. Likewise, we provide evidence that the microbial trait to utilize recalcitrant organic forms of P (e.g. P mining) is likely a specialized trait and not common to all members of the soil microbial community. This work further elucidates the role that a complex microbial community plays in the cycling of P in low-P soils, and provides evidence for future studies on microbial linkages to human-induced ecosystem changes.

AB Vertebrate scavenger communities vary in species composition across the globe. They include a wide array of species with diverse ecological strategies and life histories that support essential ecosystem functions, such as carrion removal. While previous studies have mostly focussed on how community aspects such as species richness and composition affect carrion consumption rates, it remains unclear whether this important function of scavengers is better explained by the dominance of key functional traits or niche complementarity as a result of a diverse functional representation. Here, we test three competitive hypotheses to assess if carrion consumption in vertebrate scavenger communities depends on: (a) the presence of key dominant traits (functional identity hypothesis), (b) functional diversity that promotes niche complementarity (functional diversity hypothesis) or (c) the accumulation of individuals and species, irrespective of their trait representation (functional equivalence). To explore these hypotheses, we used five study areas in Spain and South Africa, which represent a gradient of scavenger biodiversity, that is, ranging from communities dominated by facultative scavengers, such as generalists and meso-predators, to those including vultures and large carnivores. Within study areas, traits that characterize obligate scavengers or large carnivores (e.g. mean home range, proportion of social foragers) were positively linked to rapid carrion consumption, while the biomass of functional groups including facultative scavengers were either weakly or negatively associated with carrion consumption. When combining all study areas, higher rates of carrion consumption were related to scavenger communities dominated by species with large home ranges (e.g.Gypsvultures), which was found to be a key trait. In contrast, metrics describing functional diversity (functional dispersion) and functional equivalence (species richness and abundance) had lower predictive power in explaining carrion consumption patterns. Our data support the functional identity hypothesis as a better framework for explaining carrion consumption rates than functional diversity or equivalence. Our findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms sustaining ecosystem functioning in vertebrate communities and reinforce the role of obligate scavengers and large carnivores as keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Global monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem change can be aided by the effective use of indicators. Tree-cavity excavators, the majority of which are woodpeckers (Picidae), are known to be useful indicators of the health or naturalness of forest ecosystems and the diversity of forest birds. They are indicators of the latter due to shared associations with particular forest elements and because of their role in facilitating the occurrence of other species through the provision of nesting cavities. Here, we investigated whether these positive correlations between excavators and other forest birds are also found at broad geographical scales. We used global distribution maps to extract richness estimates of tree-cavity nesting and forest-associated birds, which we grouped by zoogeographic regions. We then created generalized least-squares models to assess the relationships between these groups of birds. We show that richness of tree-cavity excavating birds correlates positively with that of secondary cavity nesters and other forest birds (generalists and specialists) at global scales, but with variation across zoogeographic regions. As many excavators are relatively easy to detect, play keystone roles at local scales and are effective management targets, we propose that excavators are useful for biodiversity monitoring across multiple spatial scales and geographical regions, especially in the tropics.

AB Three new Amazonian species of the Myrcia splendens group from Brazil are proposed based on morphology and near - infrared spectroscopy of leaves and compared with similar taxa. Myrcia eveae resembles M. splendens and may be recognised mostly by large and oblong leaf blades that tapers abruptly at the apex and large bracts; Myrcia otocalyx also resembles M. splendens , being recognised mainly by pyriform flower buds, campanulate hypanthia that are longitudinally ridged, and sepals of different shapes that are patent on fruit; and Myrcia prismatica is similar to M. deflexa , being recognised essentially by chartaceous leaf blades, pedicels clustered at the tips of inflorescence axes, and oblong fruits with longitudinal edges. Spectral data revealed a unique pattern for each one of the new species and the putative related ones, reinforcing the morphological propositions. This is the first study to use morphology and spectroscopy of leaves combined to propose new species of Myrtaceae. Information on geographical distribution, habitat, conservation status, and an identification key are also provided.

AB In tropical rainforests, tree size and number density are influenced by disturbance history, soil, topography, climate, and biological factors that are difficult to predict without detailed and widespread forest inventory data. Here, we quantify tree size-frequency distributions over an old-growth wet tropical forest at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica by using an individual tree crown (ITC) algorithm on airborne lidar measurements. The ITC provided tree height, crown area, the number of trees >10 m height and, predicted tree diameter, and aboveground biomass from field allometry. The number density showed strong agreement with field observations at the plot- (97.4%; 3% bias) and tree-height-classes level (97.4%; 3% bias). The lidar trees size spectra of tree diameter and height closely follow the distributions measured on the ground but showed less agreement with crown area observations. The model to convert lidar-derived tree height and crown area to tree diameter produced unbiased (0.8%) estimates of plot-level basal area and with low uncertainty (6%). Predictions on basal area for tree height classes were also unbiased (1.3%) but with larger uncertainties (22%). The biomass estimates had no significant bias at the plot- and tree-height-classes level (-5.2% and 2.1%). Our ITC method provides a powerful tool for tree- to landscape-level tropical forest inventory and biomass estimation by overcoming the limitations of lidar area-based approaches that require local calibration using a large number of inventory plots.

AB Forests are among the most species rich habitats and the way they are managed influences their capacity to protect biodiversity. To fulfill increasing wood demands in the future, planted and non-planted wood production will need to expand. While biodiversity assessments usually focus on the impacts of deforestation, the effects of wood harvest are mostly not considered, especially not in a spatially explicit manner. We present here a global approach to refine the representation of forest management through allocating future wood production to planted and non-planted forests. Wood production, following wood consumption projections of three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, was allocated using likelihood maps for planted and production forests. On a global scale, plantations for wood production were projected to increase by 45-65% and harvested area in non-planted forests by 1-17%. The biodiversity impacts of changes in wood production patterns were estimated by applying two commonly used indicators: (1) changes in species richness and (2) changes in habitat-suitable ranges of single species. The impact was analyzed using forest cover changes as reference. Our results show that, although forest cover changes have the largest impact on biodiversity, changes in wood production also have a significant effect. The magnitude of impacts caused by changes of wood production substantially differs by region and taxa. Given the importance of forest production changes in net negative emission pathways, more focus should be put on assessing the effects of future changes in wood production patterns as part of overall land use change impacts.

AB Our understanding on phytoplankton diversity has largely been progressing since the publication of Hutchinson on the paradox of the plankton. In this paper, we summarise some major steps in phytoplankton ecology in the context of mechanisms underlying phytoplankton diversity. Here, we provide a framework for phytoplankton community assembly and an overview of measures on taxonomic and functional diversity. We show how ecological theories on species competition together with modelling approaches and laboratory experiments helped understand species coexistence and maintenance of diversity in phytoplankton. The non-equilibrium nature of phytoplankton and the role of disturbances in shaping diversity are also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the role of water body size, productivity of habitats and temperature on phytoplankton species richness, and how diversity may affect the functioning of lake ecosystems. At last, we give an insight into molecular tools that have emerged in the last decades and argue how it has broadened our perspective on microbial diversity. Besides historical backgrounds, some critical comments have also been made.

AB Aims Soil respiration (R-s) is a major pathway for carbon release to the atmosphere. We explored variability in dryland R(s)response to rainfall pulses at multiple levels of spatial heterogeneity: 1) along a hyper-arid to arid rainfall gradient, 2) across soil surfaces that differ in stability and composition, and 3) among different geomorphic and vegetation patch types. Methods We measured in situ R(s)responses for 48 h following simulated rainfall pulses in the Namib Desert. Working across the rainfall gradient, we compared R(s)responses on two soil surfaces. Each soil surface had two vegetation/geomorphic patch types that differed in organic matter sources and transport processes, with one characterized by depositional inputs and one characterized by erosional losses. Results Soil respiration was highly responsive to rainfall pulses, although soil surfaces and patch types often exerted more control on R(s)than did rainfall pulses. Rainfall generally had proportionally greater influence on R(s)with higher annual rainfall. Greater R(s)occurred on stable than unstable soil surfaces and in depositional than erosional patch types. Conclusions Large differences in R(s)among rainfall zones, soil surfaces, and patch types point to the need to carefully consider multiple scales of spatial heterogeneity when interpreting dryland biogeochemical fluxes.

AB Thick-headed flies (Conopidae) are a family of Diptera with species that are endoparasitoids of bees and aculeate wasps. Physoconops is represented by 64 species in the Neotropical and Andean regions and distributed in many countries. Only 3 species have been described for Chile, specifically from the northern area. In this work, a new species from the Valdivian evergreen forest, Physoconops tentenvilu n. sp., is described and a new key for the Chilean species is provided. In addition, P. tentevilu represents the southernmost record of this genus in Chile. Morphological aspects are discussed, as well as hosts and distribution gaps for the Chilean Physoconops species.

AB Based on samples from 5 discrete habitat types (Thuja occidentalis [Eastern White Cedar] stand, Eastern White Cedar fen, old field, Acadian Mixed Forest, peat bog) we report the first assessment of ant species richness for a specific locale in New Brunswick. We identified 30 ant species across 3 subfamilies and 9 genera as present in Rockwood Park, a heavily wooded, 890-ha municipal park within the city of Saint John. All ant species encountered were native. Given our estimate of a total of 85-96 ant species present in New Brunswick (based on New Brunswick Museum records and studies of ants in northeastern North America), we found similar to 35% in Rockwood Park. Major differences were evident in the assemblages of ant species among the 5 habitat types examined. While each habitat included generalist ant species shared across habitat types, ant species unique to each habitat were also present. Of the habitats studied in Rockwood Park, peat bogs and Eastern White Cedar stands supported the ant assemblages that were the most diverse, including several species that have rarely been encountered in North America. Both peat bogs and Eastern White Cedar stands in New Brunswick are widely exploited for commercial purposes. Our results suggest that environmental assessments of such habitats may need to consider the presence of rare, specialist ant species.

AB Refuge availability is an important component of snake ecology and conservation, yet we have limited understanding of the extent to which snakes use the nests of other animals for refuge. Despite their ubiquity in many forests, the use of ant nests as refuge by snakes has only been reported by a few publications. Between 15 September and 14 October 2019, we set out camera traps to assess whether snakes inhabited active ant mounds and the associated habitats engineered by Formica exsectoides (Allegheny Mound Ant) in northeastern Pennsylvania. We recorded a total of 44 snake images captured at 2 ant mounds, representing 24 individual encounters and 3 snake species. Species observed entering and emerging from mounds included Diadophis punctatus (Ring-necked Snake) and Storeria occipitomaculata (Red-bellied Snake). We observed both Ring-necked Snakes and Red-bellied Snakes briefly entering and exiting nests. The latter was also observed basking outside of a nest, and we observed both species enter a nest without resurfacing. These results suggest that active ant mounds constructed by Allegheny Mound Ants represent an underappreciated resource for these small-bodied snake species.

AB Intertidal molluscs are keystone species often used as biological indicators of human-driven perturbations. The increasing levels of harvesting pressure on these intertidal grazers, due to the expansion of human population on coastal areas, is known to affect negatively the exploited populations by altering population size-structure and decreasing abundances. A comparative study on the effect of harvest on the size-structure of Phorcus sauciatus populations was conducted according to the exploitation level, harvested and non-harvested, throughout the intertidal zone of mainland Portugal, Azores, Madeira, and the Canaries. The comparative analysis of the size-structure of 10,480 individuals of P. sauciatus showed that the largest individuals were recorded in the Azores and the smallest in Madeira. In harvested populations, P. sauciatus showed to be under greater harvesting pressure in the archipelago of Madeira, where the lowest mean size was observed. In the Canaries the harvesting is regulated whilst in the mainland Portugal the regulation is scarce. The Azores showed no harvesting pressure. Marine Protected Areas showed individuals with the highest mean sizes supporting their effectiveness in preserving the size-structure of this species, regardless the ecoregion and thus, the harvesting pressure. The present results highlight the importance of harvesting regulation of P. sauciatus in Madeira, as well as the implementation of management measures aiming at the sustainable exploitation and conservation of this species.

AB Enrichment plantings into secondary forest are an important option in restoring species diversity and ecosystem services. However, little attention has been given to environmental requirements for species performance. This study evaluated the effects of lightgaps and topographic position on the growth and survival of four native tree species (Pouteria caimito, Garcinia macrophylla, Dipteryx odorata and Cynometra bauhiniaefolia) planted into a 26-year old secondary forest originating from abandoned pastures in the central Amazon Basin. Artificial lightgaps and control plots under closed canopy were uniformly distributed on plateaus and bottomlands near water bodies. Seedlings were planted randomly into the plots and monitored for 28 months. Seedling survival rate was high (93%) and did not differ among species. Overall, lightgaps produced a 38% increase in seedling height relative to the controls. Although the four species naturally occur in mature forest, two of the four grew significantly more in lightgaps than in dosed canopy secondary forest. Overall, bottomlands facilitated greater seedling growth in height (38%) relative to plateaus, but only one species exhibited a significant increase. This study shows the importance of the environmental variability generated with canopy openings along the topographic gradient, suggesting that both the selection of species and microsite conditions of planting sites have to be considered important criteria in the recovery of degraded areas.

AB The relation between species diversity and ecosystem functioning is one of the most frequently discussed topics in ecology. Experiments often revealed an increase of productivity in species-rich ecosystems. But large variations in these relationships, both on a local scale and in comparisons of sites along environmental gradients, still challenge our understanding of the role of species (with specific traits) and their interactions in ecosystems. In this study, we explored the role of species traits for ecosystem functioning. We used an individual-based mechanistic grassland model which captures intra- and interspecific competition between plants for light and soil resources. We explored how the dynamics and productivity of grasslands are influenced by species traits and analyzed in a simulation study two species, which differ only in one particular trait. Our focus was on traits that determine how species can cope with resource limitations, for which we identified their relative importance for (1) individual plant growth, (2) monoculture dynamics, and (3) species mixture dynamics. We observed diverse relationships between species traits and different vegetation attributes for the different ecosystem levels. Most traits showed positive but saturating trends of increasing trait values but the variability in these relations increased in monocultures with intraspecific plant interactions and even more pronounced in mixtures with interspecific interactions. Using a process-based grassland model, we were able to simulate overyielding even though it was not correlated with trait values or trait differences between both species. Correlations were also not found in terms of stability of vegetation dynamics. In contrast, for some traits already small differences supported the dominance of a species in the mixture in which species dynamics generally followed trade-offs. The here presented simulation study demonstrates the use of process-based models for analyzing trait-productivity relationships in grasslands. Such models can complement previous approaches in empirical and theoretical biodiversity research and can help to move closer to understanding the mechanisms governing grassland dynamics.

AB Current landscapes have been intensively modified by humans and forest fragmentation has created substantial increases of forest edges. So far, scale-dependence between observable ecological patterns and the underlying processes affected by forest fragmentation have been widely ignored. To overcome the widespread ambiguity in selecting relevant spatial scales for studying the ecological effects of forest fragmentation, we investigated the effect of forest prevalence and edge length on carbon stocks, organic matter and plant-available nutrients (nitrate and ammonium) across varying spatial scales in a temperate mountainous grassland landscape of Romania. We calculated forest prevalence and edge length in the surroundings of 60 grassland plots with different spatial extents and quantified the effects of both factors on grassland productivity and soil biogeochemistry. We found a strong decreasing effect of forest edge length on soil carbon stock and organic matter and a contrasting increased effect on plant-available nutrients in the range of 100 m to 300 m radius, particularly for nitrate in the first 150 m (marginal r(2) =0.22 +/- 0.02, p<0.1). As the scale increased, we identified either an increasing tendency for carbon stock, organic matter and plant-available nutrients or an almost constant effect across the range of scales. Grassland above-ground biomass showed no clear trend with scale. In this study, we observed that the effect of forest prevalence and edge length on grassland soil biogeochemistry and productivity strongly varied with the spatial scale of investigation. Such profound scale-dependence of key ecosystem properties must be considered in management strategies aiming for sustainable ecosystem functioning.

AB To predict whether populations of marine animals will persist in the face of changing climate conditions, it is informative to understand how past climate conditions have shaped present-day tolerance thresholds. We examined 4 species of intertidal invertebrates (Nucella lamellosa, Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana,andBalanus glandula) inhabiting the coasts of Vancouver Island, Canada, where the east coast experiences historically warmer sea surface temperature (SST), warmer low tide (i.e., emersion) rock surface temperature (RST), and lower sea surface salinity (SSS) than the west coast. To determine if east coast populations have higher tolerance thresholds to acute stress than west coast populations, animals from 3 sites per coast were exposed to stressful temperatures and salinities in common garden experiments. Emersion temperature tolerance differed between populations only inN. lamellosaandB. glandula, tolerance thresholds being 1.4-1.5 degrees C higher on the east coast. Water temperature tolerance differed between populations only inB. glandulaandL. scutulatabut was highest on the west coast. No differences in salinity tolerance were observed within any species. Thus, there is limited evidence of divergence among east and west coast populations in tolerance of acute stress despite the substantial historical differences in extreme temperature and salinity conditions between coasts. However, based on present-day summertime SST and RST and known rates of change in these parameters, we predict present-day tolerance thresholds would be sufficient to allow adults of these populations to tolerate extreme temperatures predicted for the next several hundred years, and that even a slow rate of change in acute tolerance thresholds might suffice to keep up with future temperature extremes.

AB Although woody plant encroachment of tropical forest ecosystems has been related to altered disturbance regimes, its impacts on the nearest neighborhood structures and community phylogenetics are still poorly understood.Streblus macrophyllusis a light-demanding species during its early life stages and is shade-tolerant as a mature tree.S. macrophylluscan be found in tropical karst evergreen forests in northern Vietnam. It often regenerates at high densities in anthropogenic disturbed forest stands. To understand the structural patterns of disturbed forests encroached byS. macrophyllusat different abundance levels, three fully mapped 1-ha plots were established in Cuc Phuong National Park. Methods considering the phylogenetic community and nearest neighbor statistics were applied to identify how community structure changes duringS. macrophyllusencroachment. Results showed that phylogenetic distance, phylogenetic diversity, and mean phylogenetic distance increased when species diversity increased and the abundance ofS. macrophyllusdecreased in forest communities. Net related index values were positive, which indicates a clustered phylogenetic structure among all sampled forest communities.S. macrophyllustrees were mixed well with heterospecifics and had regular to aggregated distributions, whereas the species showed evidence of being a strong competitor with its neighbors. Competition could be a major ecological process regulating forest communities encroached byS. macrophyllus. According to the forest disturbance effects, phylogenetic community properties showed the loss of phylogenetic relatedness whenS. macrophyllusincreased in abundance. To our knowledge,S. macrophyllusencroaches tropical rain forest communities as a disturbance-adapted species.

AB Mapping plant species at the regional scale to provide information for ecologists and forest managers is a challenge for the remote sensing community. Here, we use a deep learning algorithm called U-net and very high-resolution multispectral images (0.5 m) from GeoEye satellite to identify, segment and map canopy palms over similar to 3000 km(2) of Amazonian forest. The map was used to analyse the spatial distribution of canopy palm trees and its relation to human disturbance and edaphic conditions. The overall accuracy of the map was 95.5% and the F1-score was 0.7. Canopy palm trees covered 6.4% of the forest canopy and were distributed in more than two million patches that can represent one or more individuals. The density of canopy palms is affected by human disturbance. The post-disturbance density in secondary forests seems to be related to the type of disturbance, being higher in abandoned pasture areas and lower in forests that have been cut once and abandoned. Additionally, analysis of palm trees' distribution shows that their abundance is controlled naturally by local soil water content, avoiding both flooded and waterlogged areas near rivers and dry areas on the top of the hills. They show two preferential habitats, in the low elevation above the large rivers, and in the slope directly below the hill tops. Overall, their distribution over the region indicates a relatively pristine landscape, albeit within a forest that is critically endangered because of its location between two deforestation fronts and because of illegal cutting. New tree species distribution data, such as the map of all adult canopy palms produced in this work, are urgently needed to support Amazon species inventory and to understand their distribution and diversity.

AB As a key component of terrestrial water cycle, evapotranspiration (ET), specifically over the Amazon River basin, is of high scientific significance. However, due to the sparse observation network and relatively short observational period of eddy covariance data, large uncertainties remain in the spatial-temporal characteristics of ET over the Amazon. Recently, a great number of long-term global remotely sensed ET products have been developed to fill the observation gap. However, the reliabilities of these global ET products over the Amazon are unknown. In this study, we assessed the consistency of the magnitude, trend and spatial pattern of Amazon ET among five global remotely sensed ET reconstructions. The magnitudes of these products are similar but the long-term trends from 1982 to 2011 are completely divergent. Validation from the eddy covariance data and water balance method proves a better performance of a product grounded on local measurements, highlighting the importance of local measurements in the ET reconstruction. We also examined four hypotheses dealing with the response of ET to brightening, warming, greening and deforestation, which shows that in general, these ET products respond better to warming and greening than to brightening and deforestation. This large uncertainty highlights the need for future studies focusing on ET issues over the Amazon.

AB Empirical studies of risk-induced overgrazing have been rarely reported in northern China grasslands, thus, the risk indicators that act as proximate drivers of herders stocking rate (SR) are poorly understood. This paper investigates the impact of the Chinese Grassland Eco-compensation Reward and Subsidy Policy implementation (2011-2015) in Inner Mongolia on overgrazing as a consequence of SR. We used a linear mixed-effects model to develop the relationship between SR and designated risk indicators. The best-fit models obtained were used to evaluate the role of each indicator on the tendency of herdsmen to overgraze grasslands. The major drivers of SR identified prior to the policy implementation are the area of grassland owned, living expenses, and the area of grassland rent-out. Subsequent to the policy implementation, the area of grassland owned and the area of grassland rent-in emerged as the principal factors that induce herders to use high SR on grassland, indicating the persistence of overgrazing. Our most promising finding was that the policy eliminated living expenses from the factors that compel herdsmen to use high SR on grassland. This represents a significant positive impact on herders' welfare, which is one of the objectives of the subsidy and reward policy. Therefore, to sustain the success recorded in the first phase of the policy implementation, we advocate for an improved grassland rental market that will encourage livelihood diversification, better funding, herdsmen cooperation, consideration of local ecological condition and herders' perspective in policy design, and consistent education of herders' about the merits of reducing SR on grasslands. To achieve the desired target of reducing overgrazing, we recommend an independent process of policy inspection that will strengthen effective bottom-up feedback and village level governance.

AB Global warming is leading to range shifts of marine species, threatening the structure and functioning of ecological communities and human populations that rely on them. The largest changes are seen in biogeographic transition zones, such as subtropical reef communities, where species range shifts are already causing substantial community reorganisation. This causes functional changes in communities over subtropical latitudes, though a baseline functional understanding remains elusive for many taxa. One key marine taxon are molluscs, which provide many ecosystem services, are important prey for fishes and are also fisheries targets themselves, but remain largely unstudied. Here, we examine the trait composition, functional diversity, and functional redundancy of mollusc assemblages along the tropical-to-temperate transition in Japan (25 degrees to 35 degrees Northern latitude). Specifically, we use a trait database of 88 mollusc species from 31 subtropical reefs along the Pacific coast of Japan to show that trait composition of mollusc assemblages changes continuously along the latitudinal gradient. We discover that functional diversity of mollusc assemblages decreases with increasing latitude, a pattern associated with declines in functional dispersion. Moreover, we find a clear distinction between tropical and subtropical mollusc assemblages, with substrate-attached, suspension feeding bivalves more abundant in the tropics and free-living gastropod grazers more prevalent at higher latitudes. Our trait-based evidence in this study shows a contraction and almost complete shift in the functioning of marine mollusc assemblages at biogeographic transition zones and our trait database facilitates further study. Our findings provide evidence of the changing taxonomic and functional composition of extant mollusc communities with latitude, pointing to potential pertinent changes and tropicalisation of these communities with rapid ocean warming.

AB The remarkable biodiversity of the Brazilian Amazon is poorly documented and threatened by deforestation. When undocumented areas become deforested, in addition to losing the fauna and flora, we lose the opportunity to know which unique species had occupied a habitat. Here we quantify such knowledge loss by calculating how much of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested and will likely be deforested until 2050 without having its tree flora sufficiently documented. To this end, we analysed 399 147 digital specimens of nearly 6000 tree species in relation to official deforestation statistics and future deforestation scenarios. We find that by 2017, 30% of all the localities where tree specimens had been collected were mostly deforested. Some 300 000 km(2)(12%; 485 25 x 25 km grid cells) of the Brazilian Amazon had been deforested by 2017, without having a single tree specimen recorded. An additional 250 000-900 000 km(2)of severely under-collected rainforest will likely become deforested by 2050. If future tree sampling is to cover this area, sampling effort has to increase two- to six-fold. Nearly 255 000 km(2)or 7% of rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon is easily accessible but does yet but remain under-collected. Our study highlights how progressing deforestation increases the risk of losing undocumented species of a hyper-diverse tree flora.

AB Investigation of home ranges, sex ratio and recruitment of the multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) in semi-arid areas of Tanzania was conducted in maize and fallow fields using the capture-mark-release (CMR) technique. The aim of this study was to generate useful data for the management of M. natalensis. The relative home range size of M. natalensis was significantly higher during the wet [544 m(2) +/- 25 standard error (SE)] than during the dry (447 m(2) +/- 18 SE) season, in males (521 m(2) +/- 23 SE) than in females (450 m(2) +/- 17 SE) and in adults (576 m(2) +/- 34 SE) than in juveniles (459 m(2) +/- 16 SE). However, there were no significant differences between habitats. Sex ratio was not significantly different (p = 0.44) between habitats. Recruitment was significantly higher (p = 0.000) in maize fields (mean = 0.43) than in fallow land (mean = 0.32) and differed significantly over time (p < 0.0001) with the highest recruitment recorded from April to July and the lowest from October to December. Management strategies should focus on managing rodents inhabiting maize fields using methods that affect their recruitment in order to reduce the population increase of M. natalensis.

AB Tropical cyclones are increasing in intensity and size and, thus, are poised to increase in importance as disturbance agents. Our understanding of cyclone ecology is biased towards the North Atlantic Basin, because cyclone effects do differ across oceanic basins. Cyclones have both short and long-term effects across the levels of biological organization, but we lack a scale-perspective of cyclone ecology. Effects on individual trees, such as defoliation or branch stripping and uprooting, are mechanistically linked to effects at the community and ecosystem levels, including forest productivity and stand regeneration time. Forest dwarfing via the gradual removal of taller trees by cyclones over many generations illustrates that cyclones shape forest structure through the accumulation of short-term effects over longer timescales.

AB Ecological niche models (ENMs) are widely used tools for predicting species geographic distribution as a function of environmental variables. The inclusion of biotic factors in the predictor suite can significantly increase the predictive power of such models, leading to a model closer to the realized niche for the species under investigation. In this study, we provide evidence of niche overlap between gray woolly monkeys (Lagothrix cana) and black-faced black spider monkeys (Ateles chamek) based on locality and ecological data covering their complete geographic range in the Amazon forests of Brazil, Peru and Bolivia. We also estimate the potential distribution ofL. canausing environmental predictors, and the distribution ofA. chamekas a biotic factor. Finally, we quantified current and future habitat loss and areas under legal protection. We found that only 39% of theL. canaarea of occupancy is under legal protection and that the species could potentially lose up to 58% of habitat in the next 30 years. We also show that the use of a closely-related species that has a more robust dataset can improve ENMs of poorly studied, rare and/or cryptic species. The framework developed here can be applied to a wide range of sympatric species if they share similar ecological requirements. Since our focal species are the most frugivorous primates in our study region and especially vulnerable to habitat loss, the identification of highly suitable areas for both taxa can help to protect other forest-dwelling species, reducing the rate of overall biodiversity loss.

AB Fire has been a natural force modulating the vegetation of the Brazilian Cerrado since long before the first humans arrived in this region about 12 thousand years BP. Cerrado plants are, therefore, adapted to fire and some of them depend on fire to maintain their reproduction and survival. However, after the use of fire as a tool to destroy vast extents of forests in the last centuries, Brazilians in general formed a very negative opinion about the use of fire and burning native vegetation was prohibited in the country. Although this decision was effective in protecting tropical forests, the zero-fire policy has been quite negative in the Cerrado. Fire suppression in Cerrado reserves has caused a dramatic loss of biodiversity at landscape level (homogenizing the vegetation structure), at species level (leading non-tree species to local extinction) and likely at population level (sexual reproduction impaired). Furthermore, fuel accumulation over several years without fire increases the risks of catastrophic firestorms that will inevitably occur. Such negative consequences of fire suppression in the Cerrado have not been noticed even among ecologists, including myself in early career and until recently. The biased tree-and-carbon perspective of environmental campaigns and ecological studies have reinforced the misunderstanding of fire effects in Cerrado vegetation. Both neglect that the absolute majority of Cerrado plant species, as well as associated fauna and ecosystem services, depend upon open vegetation-structures which are mostly maintained by fire.

ID NATIONAL-PARK; CERRADO; STRATEGIES; COMMUNITY
AB In 2019 Brazil recorded the highest wildland fire occurrence South America has seen for the last 15 years. Added to the Amazon, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) faces changes in fire regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed. We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50 years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident. However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in environmental management and research undermine the chances of decreasing occurrences of wildfires in this biodiversity hotspot.

AB Improving efficiency of forestry management, especially to meet demand for forest products while still considering environmental concerns, is a critical challenge in China. In this study, we constructed index system of forest ecological security and forestry management efficiency, based on 30 provinces. With the help of Super-CCR model, coupling coordination model and spatial panel models, the coupling coordination degree of forest ecological security and forestry management efficiency, and its spatiotemporal pattern characteristics and influencing factors of each province in China from 2003 to 2017 were measured and analyzed. Results showed that, first, in terms of forestry management efficiency, the number of DEA-efficiency provinces increased between 2003 and 2017, yet was still below 50% of all provinces. Efficiency values of most provinces in the Southern Forest Region increased significantly, whereas those of the Northern Forest Region decreased. In terms of forest ecological security, the index increased overall, with most high-value areas in the Northeast, Southwest, and Southern Forest Regions. Second, coupling coordination degree varied from near no coordination to intermediate coordination. Except for a decline in the Northern Region, the degree of coupling coordination in the other regions demonstrated an upward trend, with the growth from high to low in the Southern, Southwest and Northeast Forest Region. Spatially, high values appeared mainly in the Southern and Southwest Forest Regions, while low values mainly concentrated in the Northern Forest Region. Third, coupling coordination was affected by many factors, including nature, population, economy, society, and technological progress, driving temporal patterns and regional differences. This study provides a theoretical reference framework for decision making for forest management in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Andean-Amazon foothills region, shaped by Andean moist forests and Amazon forests in southwestern Colombia, Napo province in Ecuador, and Ucayali Province and Napo Basin in Peru, provides local and global ecosystem services as food, water, world climate regulation, water purification, and carbon absorption. However, it faces major problems of land-use change that are exacerbated by climate change that affects these ecosystem services. For instance, conventional agriculture contribute to deforestation, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss, which might be further aggravated by climate change-induced droughts, thus reducing staple crop production and, consequently, food security. Cassava (Manihot esculentaCrantz), maize (Zea maysL.), and plantain (Musa paradisiacaL.) are major staple crops in the region. They play a key role for food security and local farmers' income but are highly exposed to climate risks. This article aims to quantify the level of exposure to climate change (measured as climatic suitability) of these crops in the Andean-Amazon foothills by using the EcoCrop model by the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s under Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios. EcoCrop results showed that, whereas cassava will not lose climatic suitability, maize will lose more than half of its current suitable area, and plantain will gain and lose area, which would affect local food security. Globally, these results are important in highlighting adaptive and cost-effective strategies in agriculture and suggest that agricultural crop diversification may improve resilience by promoting the use of local crops varieties.

TI The breadth of the Mexican Transition Zone as defined by its flowering

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOGEOGRAPHY; AMERICA
AB Biogeographic regions are defined by taxa with similar distribution patterns. Flowering plants have been widely used to propose biogeographic regionalization schemes because of shared historical or ecological factors that determine their distribution. The Mexican Transition Zone represents the boundary between the Nearctic and Neotropical kingdoms; however, there is no general agreement about the limits and extent of this region. Despite the significance of its role in the history of Mexican biota, no study involving a set of relevant plant taxa validates the magnitude of the Mexican Transition Zone. This work attempts to determine the proportion of flowering plant families and genera that characterize the biogeographic kingdoms and the Mexican Transition Zone. Through identification of distinctive genera it is shown that the Mexican Transition Zone includes the mountains of Mexico, from Oaxaca northwards. The results provide a broad view of the distribution patterns of the flora of Mexico and allow the evaluation of relationships and floristic affinities.

AB Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) were historically hunted using dogs and are currently threatened by free-roaming dogs and their associated diseases. To better understand the spatial magnitude of this threat, we used a GIS approach to investigate edge effects of dogs on giant panda habitat. We first examined two nature reserves with contrasting free-roaming dog populations: Liziping, with many dogs (similar to 0.44/km(2)), and Daxiangling, with few dogs (similar to 0.14/km(2)). Spatial analysis indicated that giant pandas at Liziping (but not Daxiangling) showed a shift in habitat use away from populated areas consistent with a risk response to the foray distance of free-roaming dogs (10.9 km path-distance). Most giant panda locations (86%) from the 2014 census in Liziping were clustered around remote "dog-free zones." Expanding this analysis across the entire giant panda range revealed that 40% of panda habitat is within the foray distance of dogs. Our assessment will inform dog control programs including monitoring, education, veterinary care, and other measures. We recommend that reserves designated for the release of translocated pandas receive priority consideration for dog control efforts. Only by understanding and managing complex interactions between humans, domestic animals, and wild animals can we sustain natural systems in a world increasingly dominated by humans.

AB Induced responses to above-ground and below-ground herbivores may interact via systemic signalling in plants. We investigated whether the impact of above-ground herbivory on root-knot nematode-induced responses depends on the nematode's life cycle stages. Tomato plants were infected with the nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) for 5, 15 or 30 days before receiving Spodoptera exigua caterpillars above-ground. We collected root materials after 24 h of caterpillar feeding. We investigated phytohormones and alpha-tomatine levels, and the expression of defence and glycoalkaloid metabolism (GAME) marker genes in tomato roots. Nematode infection alone increased the endogenous root levels of jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), alpha-tomatine and the expression of the GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM 1 (GAME1) gene mostly at 30 days post-nematode inoculation. Caterpillar feeding alone upregulated Lipoxygenase D and downregulated Basic-beta-1-glucanase and GAME1 expression in roots. On nematode-infected plants, caterpillar feeding decreased JA levels, but it increased the expression of Leucine aminopeptidase A. The induction patterns of ABA and SA suggest that caterpillars cause cross-talk between the JA-signalling pathway and the SA and ABA pathways. Our results show that caterpillar feeding attenuated the induction of the JA pathway triggered by nematodes, mostly in the nematodes' reproduction stage. These results generate a better understanding of the molecular and chemical mechanisms underlying frequent nematode-plant-caterpillar interactions in natural and agricultural ecosystems.

AB It has recently become apparent that the diversity of microbial life extends far below the species level to the finest scales of genetic differences. Remarkably, extensive fine -scale diversity can coexist spatially. How is this diversity stable on long timescales, despite selective or ecological differences and other evolutionary processes? Most work has focused on stable coexistence or assumed ecological neutrality. We present an alternative: extensive diversity maintained by ecologically driven spatiotemporal chaos, with no assumptions about niches or other specialist differences between strains. We study generalized Lotka Volterra models with antisymmetric correlations in the interactions inspired by multiple pathogen strains infecting multiple host strains. Generally, these exhibit chaos with increasingly wild population fluctuations driving extinctions. But the simplest spatial structure, many identical islands with migration between them, stabilizes a diverse chaotic state. Some strains (subspecies) go globally extinct, but many persist for times exponentially long in the number of islands. All persistent strains have episodic local blooms to high abundance, crucial for their persistence as, for many, their average population growth rate is negative. Snapshots of the abundance distribution show a power law at intermediate abundances that is essentially indistinguishable from the neutral theory of ecology. But the dynamics of the large populations are much faster than birth death fluctuations. We argue that this spatiotemporally chaotic "phase" should exist in a wide range of models, and that even in rapidly mixed systems, longer-lived spores could similarly stabilize a diverse chaotic phase.

AB In Tunisia, several studies estimated the soil organic matter (SOM) stocks. However, little is known about SOM composition and dynamics especially in arid regions. Globally, arid soils of Tunisia are saline. This study aims to investigate the composition and stability of SOM in salt-affected soils under different vegetation covers in Southeastern Tunisia. Two depths are sampled in ten profiles from different localities. SOM composition was assessed by FTIR spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results showed that, despite the differences of studied soils, SOM contents are low (< 20 g/kg) and decrease with soil depth. The lowest content of SOM is attributed to native soils which suggest that SOM in arid saline soils is mainly controlled by available litter input. FTIR spectroscopy revealed that SOM is predominated by polysaccharides, aliphatic C, and aromatic C. Polysaccharides and aliphatic C increased with soil depth for agricultural and native soils. However, aromatic C increased with soil depth for agricultural soils, while it decreased for native soils. Agricultural soils are enriched in aliphatic C and polysaccharides compared with native soils that had higher content of aromatic C. Thus, the chemical composition of SOM in arid saline soils is strongly influenced by litter input quality and decomposition rate of SOM. GC/MS analyses which showed the predominance of mid-chain n-alkanes confirm those finding. Because of their relative recalcitrance and/or their protection by association with soil minerals, polysaccharides, mid-chain n-alkanes, aliphatic C, and aromatic C may have crucial effect on SOM stabilization in arid saline soils.

AB Although metacommunity ecology has been a major field of research in the last decades, with both conceptual and empirical outputs, the analysis of the temporal dynamics of metacommunities has only emerged recently and consists mostly of repeated static analyses. Here we propose a novel analytical framework to assess metacommunity processes using path analyses of spatial and temporal diversity turnovers. We detail the principles and practical aspects of this framework and apply it to simulated datasets to illustrate its ability to decipher the respective contributions of entangled drivers of metacommunity dynamics. We then apply it to four empirical datasets. Empirical results support the view that metacommunity dynamics may be generally shaped by multiple ecological processes acting in concert, with environmental filtering being variable across both space and time. These results reinforce our call to go beyond static analyses of metacommunities that are blind to the temporal part of environmental variability.

AB Ecosystem responses of carbon and nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry to N deposition have a high variation across sites. Phosphorus (P), which can interact strongly with N, can be the cause of some of this variation. We quantified plant N and P concentrations and estimated P stocks in aboveground foliage, and soil O-horizon P concentrations and stocks after 18 years in a long-term stand-scale (0.1 ha) N addition experiment [12.5 kg (N1) and 50 kg (N2) N ha(-1) year(-1)] in a c. 100-years-old boreal spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst] forest. Basal area growth had increased by 65% in the N2 treatment compared to control, along with a higher leaf area index, and lower litter decomposition rates. The higher tree growth occurred during the initial c. 10-years period thereafter resuming to control rates. We hypothesized that increased plant demand for P together with decreased recycling of organic matter in this initially N limited system may have decreased plant-available P, with possible consequences for longer-term biogeochemistry and ecosystem production. However, resin-extractable P did not differ between the three treatments (0.32 kg P ha(-1)), and plant NP ratios and P concentrations and O-horizon P characteristics were similar in the N1 and control treatments. The N2 treatment doubled total P in the O-horizon (100 vs. 54 kg P ha(-1)), explained by an increase in organic P The N concentration, NP ratio, and spruce needle biomass were higher in N2, while the P stock in current year needles was similar as in the control due to a lower P concentration. In addition to P dilution, increased light competition and/or premature aging may have caused the reduction of N-stimulated growth of the trees. For the dominant understory shrub [Vaccinium myrtillus (L.)] no changes in growth was apparent in N2 despite a significantly higher NP ratio compared to control (15 vs. 9, respectively). We therefore conclude that increased NP ratio of vegetation cannot be used as a sole indicator of P limitation. The vegetation and O-horizon changes in N2 were still large enough to merit further studies addressing whether such high N loads may alter ecosystem biogeochemistry toward P limitation. For the lower N addition rate, relevant from an anthropogenic N deposition perspective, we suggest it had no such effect.

AB The long-lived tree speciesEschweilera tenuifolia(O. Berg) Miers is characteristic of oligotrophic Amazonian black-water floodplain forests (igapo), seasonally inundated up to 10 months per year, often forming monodominant stands. We investigatedE. tenuifolia' growth and mortality patterns in undisturbed (Jau National Park - JNP) and disturbedigapos(Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve - USDR, downstream of the Balbina hydroelectric dam). We analysed age-diameter relationships, basal area increment (BAI) through 5-cm diameter classes, growth changes and growth ratios preceding death, BAI clustering, BAI ratio, and dated the individual year of death (C-14). Growth and mortality patterns were then related to climatic or anthropogenic disturbances. Results were similar for both populations for estimated maximum ages (JNP, 466 yr; USDR, 498 yr, except for one USDR tree with an estimated age of 820 yr) and slightly different for mean diameter increment (JNP: 2.04 mm; USDR: 2.28 mm). Living trees from JNP showed altered growth post-1975 and sparse tree mortality occurred at various times, possibly induced by extreme hydroclimatic events. In contrast with the JNP, abrupt growth changes and massive mortality occurred in the USDR after the dam construction began (1983). Even more than 30 yr after dam construction, flood-pulse alteration continues to affect both growth and mortality ofE. tenuifolia. Besides its vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances, this species is also susceptible to long-lasting dry and wet periods induced by climatic events, the combination of both processes may cause its local and regional extinction.

AB Nested scales of habitat heterogeneity may independently or synergistically influence faunal interactions. Fragmentation effects (i.e., the breaking apart of landscapes) and edge effects (i.e., ecological differences between edges and interiors of patches, nested within landscapes) are distinct yet related ecological concepts, linked mathematically by the habitat edge-to-area ratio. Our study quantified the separate and interactive effects of fragmentation and edge on predation using temperate seagrass. To assess how predation and generalized consumption were influenced by fragmentation state (i.e., continuous, fragmented), and proximity to edge (i.e., edges, interiors), we used tethering assays with two prey-items: juvenile crabs,Callinectes sapidus, and "squidpops" (dried squid mantle). We also investigated whether faunal densities (a proxy for consumption potential) and temperature (a proxy for a broad suite of seasonal changes) correlated with predation across landscapes. Results showed fragmentation state affected predation (i.e., crab) mortality, yet edge effects did not. Moreover, the directionality of fragmentation effects shifted across a temperature/seasonal gradient. Predation mortality more than doubled in continuous landscapes amidst temperature increases, surpassing initially higher mortality in fragmented landscapes, which did not systematically vary with temperature. This mortality magnitude "flip" matched spatiotemporal trends in faunal densities between continuous and fragmented meadows. Consumption rates of both prey-items increased alongside temperature and neither demonstrated edge effects. However, crabs showed fragmentation effects not seen with squidpops, suggesting differing foraging strategies used by consumers of these prey-items. We conclude that fragmentation and edge effects have dynamic influences on temperate predator-prey interactions, as faunal favorability of habitat heterogeneity can "flip" temporally.

AB In the Bromeliaceae, hybrids have been engineered for horticultural purposes; in addition, hybrids have been observed in natural habitats. We investigated the hybridization potential of three sympatric species ofTillandsiainhabiting secondary forests and shaded coffee plantations in the central mountains of Veracruz, Mexico. The studied species (T. juncea,T. polystachiaandT. variabilis) show overlap in flowering phenology and are believed to share pollinators. We compared the floral morphology of the species, performed controlled intra- and interspecific pollinations, and recorded pollen tube growth, fruit and seed set, as well as seed germination. Flower size differed among the species, but stamen and stigma heights were similar between pairs of species, which would facilitate interspecific pollen exchange. Pollen tubes reached the ovary in interspecific crosses. The three species showed interspecific cross-compatibility, as all crosses resulted in development of mature fruit and viable seeds.Tillandsia junceaachieved the highest fruit set, whereasT. variabilisshowed the highest seed set. Seed set as a result of agamospermy, autogamy, geitonogamy and interspecific cross-pollination did not differ among the species. The findings suggest that pre- and post-pollination barriers are weak among the three species ofTillandsia, which thus could potentially hybridize in natural sympatric populations.

AB Context An important part of landscape ecology is to identify relationships between landscape characteristics and ecological processes. One common approach to this is relating raster surfaces to ecological responses, assuming that the characteristics emphasized by rasters are representative of the processes determining changes in the ecological responses being assessed. Consequently, choices made in the design and assessment of rasters affect our understanding of the relationship between landscape characteristics and ecological responses. Objectives We propose a six-step framework for informing the choices made in creating and measuring rasters for landscape analyses: (i) acknowledge ecological theory and conceptual paradigms, (ii) evaluate the fit of available data, (iii) assess the three facets of scale, (iv) recognize different sampling designs, (v) use proper conceptual models, and (vi) measure meaningful raster characteristics. Conclusions We discuss how each step can benefit from a "functional" perspective, i.e., an explicit focus on the ecological processes under investigation. This is especially important for landscape analyses of habitat change, which are highly complex due to the many processes potentially involved. A functional perspective draws attention to common pitfalls in landscape ecology, while promoting more process-oriented research in the study of habitat change.

AB Lapageria roseais an emblematic species, endemic to the temperate rainforest of Chile. As a result of extensive plantation of commercial exotic pine and eucalypts, scattered individuals ofL. roseaare now encountered mainly in fragmented forest areas. Therefore,L. roseahas been declared in danger of extinction. However, the success of national conservation programs depends, in part, on the availability of stored viable pollen grains for pollinating assays, in order to sustain the genetic diversity ofL. roseaoffspring. Here we describe a simple and low-cost protocol for storing viable pollen grains for 1 year. The protocol involves oven-drying freshly collected pollen grains at 37 degrees C for 15 min, followed by storage at -13 degrees C. The stored pollen has an average of 60-65% in vitro germination after 5 months, with a reduction to 50% by the end of 1 year, a value considered highly satisfactory to ensure the success of hand-pollination trials.

AB The risk of consumption is a pervasive aspect of ecology and recent work has focused on synthesis of consumer-resource interactions (e.g., enemy-victim ecology). Despite this, theories pertaining to the timing and magnitude of defenses in animals and plants have largely developed independently. However, both animals and plants share the common dilemma of uncertainty of attack, can gather information from the environment to predict future attacks and alter their defensive investment accordingly. Here, we present a novel, unifying framework based on the way an organism's ability to defend itself during an attack can shape their pre-attack investment in defense. This framework provides a useful perspective on the nature of information use and variation in defensive investment across the sequence of attack-related events, both within and among species. It predicts that organisms with greater proportional fitness loss if attacked will gather and respond to risk information earlier in the attack sequence, while those that have lower proportional fitness loss may wait until attack is underway. This framework offers a common platform to compare and discuss consumer effects and provides novel insights into the way risk information can propagate through populations, communities, and ecosystems.

AB Understanding the factors influencing agricultural productivity is vital to food security, especially for food insecure smallholder farmers. Within agricultural landscape mosaics, the arrangement of tree cover such as forests, trees, and hedgerows can positively or negatively impact agricultural productivity in fields. In such settings, forest restoration has the potential to impact food security goals in addition to the typical restoration goals of reversing land degradation and supporting carbon storage. Here, we compare and contrast forest restoration scenarios in order to explore whether there are ideal amounts and configurations of forests that optimize benefits for food production. To do so, we explored forest restoration scenarios in an agricultural-forest landscape in southern Ethiopia where previous research showed increased wheat productivity in sections of fields adjacent to forests. We used hypothetical historically-relevant and plausible future scenarios to examine the landscape-level implications of forest restoration on total wheat production. To accomplish this, we first characterized contemporary forest cover as well as long-term trends using remote sensing. Then, trends in forests and hedgerows were used to create a series of hypothetical yet realistic scenarios to explore trade-offs among total forest cover, its configuration, and total wheat production. From 1967-2013, analysis of historical aerial photography and Landsat imagery showed a general trend of reforestation (an 8% increase in forest cover). While the abundance of primary forests remained constant from 1986-2013, mixed vegetation expanded from 16 % to occupy 26 % of the landscape, generally in the form of small forest fragments with sparse tree cover. Our hypothetical reforestation and hedgerow planting scenarios found that field productivity increases near forest edges resulted in non-linear food production benefits with hedgerow expansion. Benefits to total landscape-level wheat production were almost twice as great when transitioning from low to medium tree cover than when transitioning from medium-high to high tree cover. Furthermore, the benefits of hedgerows on agricultural production were asymptotic; productivity gains eventually levelled off with increasing hedgerows. Our results highlight potential benefits of a landscape approach for enhancing smallholder agricultural productivity in southern Ethiopia and beyond. We argue that considering a landscape perspective can help support food security goals particularly within the context of climate change and should play a more prominent role in forest conservation and restoration.

AB Herbivores play a critical role in plant invasions either by facilitating or inhibiting species establishment and spread. However, relatively few studies with invasive plant species have focused on the role of plant tolerance and how it varies geographically to influence invasion success. We conducted a common garden study using two lineages (native and invasive) of the grassPhragmites australisthat are prevalent in North American wetlands. Using 31 populations collected across a broad geographic range, we tested five predictions: 1) the invasive lineage is more tolerant to simulated folivory than the native lineage, 2) tolerance to herbivory decreases with increasing latitude of origin of the populations, 3) estimates of tolerance are correlated with putative tolerance traits and plasticity in those traits, 4) a tradeoff exists between tolerance and resistance to herbivory and 5) tolerance has a fitness cost. Response to folivory varied substantially among populations ofP. australis, ranging from intolerance to overcompensation. Our model selection procedure deemed lineage to be an important predictor of tolerance but, contrary to our prediction, the native lineage was 19% more tolerant to folivory than the invasive lineage. Tolerance for both lineages exhibited a u-shaped relationship with latitude. A tolerance-resistance tradeoff was evident within the invasive but not the native lineage. Also, tolerance was positively correlated with belowground biomass allocation, leaf silica concentrations, specific leaf area and plasticity in stem density, and negatively correlated with the relative growth rate of the population and plasticity in putative resistance traits. Lastly, although we did not detect costs of tolerance, our results highlight that fast growth rates can maintain high fitness in the presence of herbivory. Herbivory and plant defense strategies forP. australislineages in North America exhibit complex biogeographic patterns that cause substantial heterogeneity in enemy release and biotic resistance and, consequently, invasion success.

AB Social insects, i.e. ants, bees, wasps and termites, are key components of ecological communities, and are important ecosystem services (ESs) providers. Here, we review the literature in order to (i) analyse the particular traits of social insects that make them good suppliers of ESs; (ii) compile and assess management strategies that improve the services provided by social insects; and (iii) detect gaps in our knowledge about the services that social insects provide. Social insects provide at least 10 ESs; however, many of them are poorly understood or valued. Relevant traits of social insects include high biomass and numerical abundance, a diversity of mutualistic associations, the ability to build important biogenic structures, versatile production of chemical defences, the simultaneous delivery of several ESs, the presence of castes and division of labour, efficient communication and cooperation, the capacity to store food, and a long lifespan. All these characteristics enhance social insects as ES providers, highlighting their potential, constancy and efficiency as suppliers of these services. In turn, many of these traits make social insects stress tolerant and easy to manage, so increasing the ESs they provide. We emphasise the need for a conservation approach to the management of the services, as well as the potential use of social insects to help restore habitats degraded by human activities. In addition, we stress the need to evaluate both services and disservices in an integrated way, because some species of social insects are among the most problematic invasive species and native pests. Finally, we propose two areas of research that will lead to a greater and more efficient use of social insects as ES providers, and to a greater appreciation of them by producers and decision-makers.

AB The Alto Mayo region in the Peruvian department of San Martin has one of the highest levels of deforestation and fragmentation in the country. Historically, San Martin was home to at least 20 primate species, of which at least 14 persist in the Alto Mayo Valley. We surveyed primate populations in the "Jungla de Los Monos", a locally protected remnant of a naturally diverse primate community in one of the last remaining mid-elevation (800 m a.s.l.) seasonally flooded forests in the region. We recorded seven primate species, with a further two species reported to have been extirpated from the area. By far the most common species wasSaimiri macrodon. Half of the primate biomass was made up of a single species,Alouatta seniculus,withS. macrodonaccounting for another quarter. The endemicPlecturocebus oenanthewas only detected once in forest interior, but was observed in edge and riverine forest, as well as neighboring fragments. The area holds a surprisingly high diversity and density of primates considering its proximity to population centers, thanks primarily to self-imposed hunting bans and logging control by local communities.

AB This is the first comparative study of the alpha and beta diversity of crabs from soft bottom areas nearby two coastal islands (Couves and Mar Virado Islands). Crabs were captured monthly from January 1998 to December 1999. The samplings were carried out with a shrimp fishery boat provided with double-rig nets within a marine protected area in Ubatuba off the north coast of Sao Paulo. The ecological indexes of diversity (H '), equitability (J ') and beta-diversity were used to compare the variation in diversity between islands and years. In total, we captured 2221 brachyurans (570 in Couves and 1651 in Mar Virado), belonging to 42 species, 28 genera, and 13 families. Twenty species occurred in both islands, ten occurred only in Couves, and 12 were exclusive of Mar Virado. The three most abundant species were Callinectes ornatus, Hexapanopeus paulensis, and Hepatus pudibundus. There were statistical differences in equitability (between islands in the year of 1998) and abundance (among seasons in the autumn of 1999) (p < 0.05). Although the two islands are geographically close to each other, they have distinct environmental features. Couves Island, for instance, is more affected by the water masses reaching Ubatuba than Mar Virado Island. These characteristics are probably driving the community composition of these islands.

AB Many studies have tried to assess the role of both deterministic and stochastic processes in community assembly, yet a lack of consensus exists on which processes are more prevalent and at which spatial scales they operate. To shed light on this issue, we tested two nonmutually exclusive, scale-dependent hypotheses: (1) that competitive exclusion dominates at small spatial scales; and (2) that environmental filtering does so at larger ones. To accomplish this, we studied the functional patterns of tropical montane forest communities along two altitudinal gradients, in Ecuador and Peru, using floristic and functional data from 60 plots of 0.1 ha. We found no evidence of either functional overdispersion or clustering at small spatial scales, but we did find functional clustering at larger ones. The observed pattern of clustering, consistent with an environmental filtering process, was more evident when maximizing the environmental differences among any pair of plots. To strengthen the link between the observed community functional pattern and the underlying process of environmental filtering, we explored differences in the climatic preferences of the most abundant species found at lower and higher elevations and examined whether their abundances shifted along the elevation gradient. We found (1) that greater community functional differences (observed between lower and upper tropical montane forest assemblies) were mostly the result of strong climatic preferences, maintained across the Neotropics; and (2) that the abundances of such species shifted along the elevational gradient. Our findings support the conclusion that, at large spatial scales, environmental filtering is the overriding mechanism for community assembly, because the pattern of functional clustering was linked to species' similarities in their climatic preferences, which ultimately resulted in shifts in species abundances along the gradient. However, there was no evidence of competitive exclusion at more homogeneous, smaller spatial scales, where plant species effectively compete for resources.

AB Shifting cultivation is a widespread land-use in the tropics that is considered a major threat to rainforest diversity and structure. In the Philippines, a country with rich biodiversity and high rates of species endemism, shifting cultivation, locally termed as kaingin, is a major land-use and has been for centuries. Despite the potential impact of shifting cultivation on forests and its importance to many people, it is not clear how biodiversity and forest structure recover after kaingin abandonment in the country, and how well these post-kaingin secondary forests can complement the old-growth forests. We investigated parameters of forest diversity and structure along a fallow age gradient in secondary forests regenerating after kaingin abandonment in Leyte Island, the Philippines (elevation range: 445-650 m asl). We first measured the tree diversity and forest structure indices in regenerating secondary forests and old-growth forest. We then measured the recovery of tree diversity and forest structure parameters in relation to the old-growth forest. Finally, using linear mixed effect models (LMM), we assessed the effect of different environmental variables on the recovery of forest diversity and structure. We found significantly higher species density in the oldest fallow sites, while Shannon's index, species evenness, stem number, basal area, and leaf area index were higher in the old-growth forest. A homogeneous species composition was found across the sites of older fallow age. Multivariate analysis revealed patch size as a strong predictor of tree diversity and forest structure recovery after shifting cultivation. Our study suggests that, secondary forests regenerating after shifting cultivation abandonment can recover rapidly. Although recovery of forest structure was not as rapid as the tree diversity, our older fallow sites contained a similar number of species as the old-growth forest. Many of these species are also endemic to the Philippines. Novel and emerging ecosystems like tropical secondary forests are of high conservation importance and can act as a refuge for dwindling tropical forest biodiversity.

AB Studies of the effects of droughts and fires on the livelihoods of resource-dependent rural smallholders have been reported for the Brazilian Amazon, but less so for other Amazonian countries. To bridge this gap in the literature, our research analyzes how climate-related variability affects different livelihood activities involving management of natural resources in Madre de Dios in Peru, located in the southwestern Amazon. Madre de Dios fell within the epicenters of both the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts. We examine one key question: What are the effects of extreme climatic events on different livelihood activities in communities located across Madre de Dios? We apply the key concepts of livelihood vulnerability to guide our conceptual framework. This concept organized our field inquiry, which consisted of survey questionnaires applied to rural producers and workshops with diverse stakeholders. Results show that climatic variability has affected many local livelihood activities and thereby increased the vulnerability of rural communities in Madre de Dios. The greatest impacts were felt in agriculture due to increased temperatures and fires followed by high winds and heavy rains. Our findings bear implications for science communication for policy. Climate politics will advance action on climate change if the tactic is to focus on how climate change means extreme climatic events that will cause damage to people, property, and livelihoods.

AB Background The relevance of the host microbiota to host ecology and evolution is well acknowledged. However, the effect of the microbial environment on host immune function and host microbiota dynamics is understudied in terrestrial vertebrates. Using a novel experimental approach centered on the manipulation of the microbial environment of zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, we carried out a study to investigate effects of the host's microbial environment on: 1) constitutive immune function, 2) the resilience of the host cloacal microbiota; and 3) the degree to which immune function and host microbiota covary in microbial environments that differ in diversity. Results We explored immune indices (hemagglutination, hemolysis, IgY levels and haptoglobin concentration) and host-associated microbiota (diversity and composition) in birds exposed to two experimental microbial environments differing in microbial diversity. According to our expectations, exposure to experimental microbial environments led to differences related to specific antibodies: IgY levels were elevated in the high diversity treatment, whereas we found no effects for the other immune indices. Furthermore, according to predictions, we found significantly increased richness of dominant OTUs for cloacal microbiota of birds of the high diversity compared with the low diversity group. In addition, cloacal microbiota of individual females approached their baseline state sooner in the low diversity environment than females in the high diversity environment. This result supported a direct phenotypically plastic response of host microbiota, and suggests that its resilience depends on environmental microbial diversity. Finally, immune indices and cloacal microbiota composition tend to covary within treatment groups, while at the same time, individuals exhibited consistent differences of immune indices and microbiota characteristics. Conclusion We show that microbes in the surroundings of terrestrial vertebrates can influence immune function and host-associated microbiota dynamics over relatively short time scales. We suggest that covariation between immune indices and cloacal microbiota, in addition to large and consistent differences among individuals, provides potential for evolutionary adaptation. Ultimately, our study highlights that linking environmental and host microbiotas may help unravelling immunological variation within and potentially among species, and together these efforts will advance the integration of microbial ecology and ecological immunology.

AB Ecotourism involves visiting natural areas without adversely affecting biodiversity, an objective that is often not reached. Although ecotourism in El Salvador is currently under-developed, it has been proposed for the conservation of forests that remain within the territory. To this respect, National Park El Imposible is the largest natural protected area in the nation, with 23% of its extension designated for ecotourism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of ecological disturbances produced by ecotourism, using dung beetles as biological indicators in the park. Three zones differing in tourism intensity: conservation, extensive, and intensive, were evaluated. Six samplings using pitfall traps were carried out from June-November, 2013 in each zone. We recorded a significantly lower beetle abundance in the intensive-use zone, even though biomass tended to increase with ecotourism intensity due to proportional increase in large-sized species. There were differences in composition, diversity, and evenness of the dung beetle assemblage, evidencing ecological disturbances in the intensive-use zone. Ecotourism in the park has caused a negative impact on the dung beetle assemblage structure due to the loss of habitat specialists in favor of widespread generalists. Consequently, ecotourism should be regulated to minimize its effects in the site.

AB We investigated genecology and ecophysiological mechanisms of the polymorphism of leaf trichome density of Leptospermum recurvum Hook. f. (Myrtaceae) in the deglaciated summit zone above 3,000 m asl of Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. Various phenotypes with variable foliar trichome densities occurred sympatrically in the same population, and the composition of coexisting phenotypes varied substantially among populations. We conducted a common garden experiment by sowing seeds from multiple maternal trees of different leaf trichome densities. We found a significant relation between pubescence of maternal trees and offspring, which indicated that leaf trichome density had a genetic basis. Microsatellite analysis revealed that there was no barrier to gene flows among phenotypes or among populations, and very low neutral genetic differentiation among populations with high gene flows for both directions of phenotypes. The soils in the sites dominated by pubescent trees were significantly more desiccated than in the sites dominated by glabrous trees during a short drought. Glabrous trees had a significantly greater mortality rate than pubescent trees after an intensive El Nino drought (13.7 vs. 3.9%) in the same sites where both phenotypes occurred sympatrically. Pubescent individuals demonstrated a significantly greater photosynthetic water-use efficiency than glabrous individuals. El Nino droughts could cause large difference in soil moisture among sites and that a greater desiccation stress removed glabrous phenotypes as one end of divergent natural selection to form pubescent populations. These results implied that the process shaping the phenotypic polymorphisms involved strong gene flows combined with ongoing divergent selection.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) have been studied extensively over the past decade as an important policy tool for coordinating ecological protection and regional socioeconomic development. One of the greatest challenges of PES implementation is to understand where to pay, i.e., spatial targeting, which can directly impact PES effectiveness and efficiency. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of spatial targeting methods based on literature analysis using Citespace. Firstly, peer-reviewed articles related to spatial targeting of PES were selected from the Web of Science database based on keywords. Cases applying PES spatial targeting methods were then chosen and analyzed after all articles were read. In total, 70% of the chosen cases focused on improving the compensation efficiency of biodiversity or another single environmental objective, whereas the remaining cases focused on coordinating trade-offs between equity and efficiency or multiple environmental objectives. The main PES spatial targeting approaches included cost-benefit analysis, multi-objective optimization, data envelope analysis and other methods aimed at specific issues. Of these, cost-benefit analysis has been most widely applied at different scales, including county, regional and watershed scales. Significant differences among the different PES spatial targeting methods were found, including in PES spatial targeting dimensions, efficiency optimization approaches and method application conditions. The practice of PES spatial targeting requires the selection of appropriate methods based on contextual biophysical and socioeconomic conditions as well as relevant environmental issues. The combined application of PES spatial targeting methods, compensation willingness of stakeholders and dynamic implementation of PES spatial targeting should be considered in future research.

AB Deforestation and fragmentation are two of the main factors responsible for climate change. The construction of large enterprises such as hydropower plants can modify landscape dynamics, boosting the urban centers and other economic land uses. We evaluated the landscape around Governador Bento Munhoz da Rocha Netto Hydropower Plant, Parana, Brazil, aiming to identify the land use dynamics since its construction in 1980. Satellite images of the years 1976, 1984 and 2016 were obtained and landscape and patch metrics of composition, shape, core area, connectivity and isolation were calculated. The deforestation conversion profile was also evaluated. Our results showed a reduction of forest areas by 18.9%, with great replacement of forest stands. A large increase of small forest remnants was noted, indicating a high degree of landscape fragmentation and an expressive reduction of the core area. The deforestation profile revealed that the transformation rates were low, indicating gradual conversions. On the other hand, conversions of natural areas occurred in almost half the area in the initial years - which comprise the period after hydropower plant construction. Changes in the landscape may be related to the hydroelectric plant construction. However, the local economic cycle that happened naturally may have driven the forest fragmentation.

AB The regeneration niche differentiation helps to explain plant coexistence and thus biodiversity. The study of the regeneration niche has been traditionally based on sexual recruitment, while overlooking clonal growth. Root suckering offers a successful alternative for local dispersal under suboptimal conditions for sexual reproduction. For light-limited forests, we hypothesized that: 1) root suckering would increase the regeneration niche towards high-light conditions in shade-tolerant trees and towards dark conditions in light-demanding species; 2) contrasting responses of survival and growth to light availability would explain niche differentiation of both suckers and saplings; and 3) distinct responsiveness to light among species and recruit-types would reflect differences in functional traits. We tested these hypotheses with two evergreen tree species that coexist in the temperate rainforest of southern South America: Embothrium coccineum (light-demanding) and Eucryphia cordifolia (shadetolerant). We measured the light availability in two study plots above each recruit and along transects established in the understory. Niche selection, niche differentiation and changes in survival probability with light were inferred from the analysis of the light frequency distributions. We evaluated the effect of light on the relative volumetric change in stems over a 1-year period. Functional traits of leaves, stems, and crowns were measured in suckers and saplings growing under similar light conditions; these traits were then compared among size classes, recruit-types and species. Root suckering was the prevalent reproduction mode of both studied species, extending the light niche towards open microenvironments only during the earliest ontogenetic stages. The poor structural strength of the leaves and wood of small Eucryphia saplings explains its underuse of open microsites. Neither photosynthetic assimilation nor carbon subsidy can sustain Embothrium suckers at the shadiest microsites. Suckering proved to increase the persistence of Embothrium until advanced stages of forest succession, facilitating its coexistence with the late-successional Eucryphia. Our study emphasizes that clonal growth is essential to understand the dynamics of temperate rainforests.

AB Studies that provide support for the conservation of transitions between biogeographic regions should be encouraged, given the ecological and evolutionary specificities of these environments. Investigations on evolutionary history may, for example, influence the prioritization of areas for biological conservation, as they enable a better understanding of the processes that shape communities in space and time. We used the occurrence data of tree species available for 87 sites of the Cerrado-Amazon Transition from the NeoTropTree database, together with 73 environmental variables, and investigated the phylogenetic structure (overdispersed, clustered, or randomly distributed communities) and diversity in this region. We evaluated the relationship between phylogenetic metrics and environmental variables using generalized least squares models. Our results demonstrated a predominant pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion, as well as high phylogenetic diversity. Phylogenetic metrics were strongly influenced by bioclimatic variables. Our study demonstrates that the Cerrado-Amazon Transition plays a fundamental role in the conservation of the regional flora both in terms of phylogenetic structure and diversity, but the protected areas in this region harbor only a restricted portion of this high diversity. These results not only confirm that transitional environments are areas of high biological diversity, but, unprecedentedly, this observation occurs from phylogenetic analyses of communities and to a biogeographic region so widely distributed and highly impacted by anthropogenic actions. Such findings point to the urgent need to take varied dimensions of biodiversity in establishing new areas of environmental protection in transition zones into account.

AB Red wood ants are keystone species of forest ecosystems in Europe. Environmental factors and habitat characteristics affect the size of their nest mounds, an important trait being in concordance with a colony's well-being and impact on its surroundings. In this study, we investigated the effect of large-scale (latitude and altitude) and small-scale environmental factors (e.g., characteristics of the forest) on the size of nest mounds ofFormica polyctenain Central Europe. We predicted that the change in nest size is in accordance with Bergmann's rule that states that the body size of endotherm animals increases with the higher latitude and/or altitude. We found that the size of nests increased along the latitudinal gradient in accordance with Bergmann's rule. The irradiation was the most important factor responsible for the changes in nest size, but temperature and local factors, like the perimeter of the trees and their distance from the nest, were also involved. Considering our results, we can better understand the long-term effects and consequences of the fast-changing environmental factors on this ecologically important group. This knowledge can contribute to the planning of forest management tactics in concordance with the assurance of the long-term survival of red wood ants.

AB Crustaceans are a key component of the fauna living in rhodoliths, but patterns in their distribution and abundance remain largely unknown. This paper assessed spatio-temporal variability of Brachyura associated with rhodoliths. A seasonal study was conducted at three depth layers (18, 25, and 40 m), throughout two years (December 2015 to October 2017) at Gran Canaria Island (eastern Atlantic Ocean). A total of 765 crabs belonging to 10 species were collected. A larger abundance and richness of crabs at 25 m correlated with a larger biomass of epiphytic algae attached to rhodoliths. A seasonal pattern was also observed, where a higher richness of crabs occurred in the summer. The Xanthid crab,Nanocassiope melanodactylus,dominated the assemblage (83%); juveniles of this species were more abundant in deeper waters (40 m), while adults were more abundant on the shallower depth layers (18 m and 25 m). The speciesPilmunushirtelluswas restricted to 25 m. Nevertheless,Pisa carinimanaandAchaeuscranchiidid not show any spatio-temporal pattern. In summary, this study demonstrated that two conspicuous crabs,N. melanodactylusandP. hirtellus, associated with rhodolith beds are bathymetrically segregated.

AB Plants of the genus Camellia are widely cultivated throughout the world as ornamentals because of their bright and large flowers. The widely cultivated varieties are mainly derived from the mutant lines and hybrid progenies of Camellia japonica Linn. and Camellia reticulata Lindl. While their geographical distributions and environmental adaptabilities are significantly different, no systematic comparison has been conducted between these two species. To investigate differences in how these plants have adapted to their environments, we measured photosynthesis and 20 leaf functional traits of C. japonica and C. reticulata grown under the same conditions. Compared with C. japonica, C. reticulata showed higher values for light saturation point, light-saturated photosynthetic rate, leaf dry mass per unit area and stomatal area, but lower values for apparent quantum efficiency, leaf size, stomatal density and leaf nitrogen content per unit mass. Stomatal area was positively correlated with light-saturated photosynthetic rate and light saturation point, but negatively correlated with stomatal density. The differences between C. reticulata and C. japonica were mainly reflected in their adaptations to light intensity and leaf morphological traits. C. reticulata is better adapted to high light intensity than C. japonica. This difference is related to the two species' differing life forms. Thus, leaf morphological traits have played an important role in the light adaptation of C. reticulata and C. japonica, and might be first noticed and selected during the breeding process. These findings will contribute to the cultivation of camellia plants. Copyright (C) 2020 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB The importance of habitat factors in designing marine reserves and evaluating their performance over time has been regularly documented. Over three biennial sampling periods, we examined the effects of vegetated coverage and habitat diversity (i.e., patchiness) on fish density, community composition, and species-specific patterns along a gradient of protection from harvest in the shallow Spanish southern Mediterranean, including portions of the Tabarca marine reserve. With the exception of two herbivores (Sarpa salpa and Symphodus tinca), vegetated cover did not significantly affect fish densities, while habitat diversity was an influential factor across all three sampling periods. Overall, fish density was more positively associated with more continuous vegetated or unvegetated habitats, and was greatest in areas of highest protection (Tabarca II - Isla Nao site). These patterns were usually observed for four abundant fish species (Boops boops, Chromis chromis, Oblada melanura, and S. salpa). Fish community composition was distinct in the most protected portion of the Tabarca reserve, where it was also most stable. Our findings align with previous investigations of the Tabarca reserve and its surrounding areas, and demonstrate its continued effectiveness in conserving fish biomass and habitat. Together with effective management, marine reserves can facilitate greater species abundance, more stable biological communities, and resilient ecosystems.

AB Water-related forest ecosystems services (WES) are vital to the functioning of the biosphere, society, and human well-being. In Slovakia, the active support of WES is provided by economic instruments of forest policy, while the market-based solution as payments for water-related services (PWS) is lacking. Starting from this point, the objective matter of the paper is to develop the payments for WES schemes in Slovakia. The study was based on document analysis and stakeholders ' opinions towards PWS. Fifteen Slovak stakeholders from forestry, water management, and nature protection were involved in the study. These stakeholders represent potential buyers, seller, intermediaries, and knowledge providers in PWS schemes. Based on the theoretical background and the results of the survey, the authors defined key aspects of the design and implementation of PWS schemes in Slovak conditions such as potential buyers and sellers, important factors for the implementation of PWS schemes, and the role of public authorities.

AB In the Amazon basin, ants are often associated with environmental or edaphic factors. However, these associations may vary between the epigeic and hypogeic strata. Here, we investigated differences in richness and composition of epigeic and hypogeic ant assemblages along an environmental gradient in the Brazilian Amazon. The four studied sites cover different topographic and soil characteristics. We sampled 25 plots of 250 m(2) using 10 samples of epigeic pitfalls and 10 samples of hypogeic pitfalls installed at two depths (10 and 30 cm). The pitfalls remained in the field for 48 hours. In the same plots, soil clay content and terrain altitude were also measured. We collected 219 species or morphospecies, of which 14 were exclusively hypogeics. We found higher local richness in the epigeic compared to hypogeic assemblages. We also found an interaction between clay content and strata for ant species composition. Overall, the species turnover was related to clay content, but the effect depended on the strata, with hypogeic fauna being more heterogeneous, compared with epigeic fauna. Despite the relationship between clay content and ant's assemblage's composition, we did not find strong environment predictors for both strata, which suggests that other factors may structure ant assemblages in these sites. This reinforces the need for studies to define which environmental gradient determines the distribution of Amazonian epigeic and hypogeic ants.

AB In this paper, cross-spectrum analysis was used to verify the agreement of periodicity between the global LAI (leaf area index) and climate factors. The results demonstrated that the LAI of deciduous forests and permanent wetlands have high agreement with temperature, rainfall and radiation over annual cycles. A low agreement between the LAI and seasonal climate variables was observed for some of the temperate and tropical vegetation types including shrublands and evergreen broadleaf forests, possibly due to the diversity of vegetation and human activities. Across all vegetation types, the LAI demonstrated a large time lag following variation in radiation (>1 month), whereas relatively short lag periods were observed between the LAI and annual temperature (around 2 weeks)/rainfall patterns (less than 10 days), suggesting that the impact of radiation on global vegetation growth is relatively slow, which is in accord with the results of previous studies. This work can provide a benchmark of the phenological drivers in global vegetation, from the perspective of periodicity, as well as helping to parameterize and refine the DGVMs (Dynamic Global Vegetation Models) for different vegetation types.

AB Patterns of abundance and shell morphology of intertidal gastropods are typically thought to depend on environmental conditions, but ecosystem engineers such as canopy-forming seaweeds can also influence these traits. The intertidal seaweed Hormosira banksii (H. banksii) is an abundant species and important ecosystem engineer on rocky shores and estuaries in south-east Australia, where it creates thick canopies colonized by a range of invertebrates, particularly gastropods. In Tasmania (southern Australia), H. banksii shows large variability in thallus length and structure, with different algal morphologies on coasts and in estuaries. In this study, individuals of two gastropod species were sampled from different habitats (north coast, east coast and northern estuaries) to: (1) describe the spatial variability in their abundance and shell morphology, and (2) understand if any relationship exists between H. banksii morphology and gastropod shell morphology. Gastropod abundance and morphology were variable, but multivariate analysis suggested a marginal influence of H. banksii morphological traits, particularly vesicle size, on the patterns observed. As the two gastropod species use habitat differently and that different H. banksii morphs occur in different locations, our results suggest that both algal morphology and environmental conditions may affect gastropod abundance and shell morphology across the different habitats. Hence, from these results a model can be developed and tested in subsequent experimental work to tease apart the effects of seaweed morphology from environmental conditions.

AB Galliformes are one of the most threatened groups of birds in South-East Asia, with 27% of the species threatened with extinction. Long term population viability and extinction probability studies, at different levels of threat and management, are lacking due to weak life history data. This study aimed to define the long-term viability and extinction risk of two populations of the endangered Green PeafowlPavo muticus, facing different threat and protection levels, using Bayesian Population Viability Analysis (BPVA), which requires less data than traditional methods. The results showed an increasing trend in the Green Peafowl population in HuaiKhaKhaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (western Thailand), with a high protection level and low disturbance and high probability of assuring persistence for the next 100 years. By contrast, the population in YokDon National Park (south-central Vietnam), with a high habitat disturbance level and significant hunting pressure, is predicted to decline and has a high probability (99%) of extinction by 2097. Also, the BPVA showed minimum viable population (MVP) estimates of 250 and 450 calling males for the HuaiKhaKhaeng and YokDon populations respectively, assuring high probabilities of long-term persistence if the minimum numbers of males are available. The population size of 219 calling males at YokDon during the 2013 survey is lower than the MVP threshold of 450 calling males, which suggests the species has a low probability of long-term persistence in the area. Despite limited life history and population data, BPVA predicted the future of this population under site-specific conditions, and the results could be used to promote better management and population restoration.

AB We investigated the impacts of 14-year continuous N addition on activities of arylsulfatase (AS) and phosphodiesterase (PDE), which catalyze soil organic sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P), respectively. The response of AS to N addition was compared with that of C- and N-acquiring enzymes, i.e., beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG), beta-D-cellobiohydrolase (CBH), beta-1,4-Xylosidase (BX), beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminnidase (NAG), and leucine amino peptidase (LAP). We also compared the impact of N addition on PDE activity with that on phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity. The results showed that N addition clearly decreased soil AS activity, whereas activities of C- and N-acquiring enzymes did not exhibit similar changes. The inconsistent response of AS activity with the enzymes was attributed to soil acidification induced by long-term N addition, which shifts the pH condition to a more optimal condition for AS activity and accelerates the accumulation of S in soils. The ratio of PME to PDE were significantly elevated by N addition, implying that the microbial and plant resource allocation to PME relative to PDE increased after N addition at our study site. The shift in resource allocation may have occurred because (i) the types of phosphatases secreted by biota shifted toward phosphatases that require one-step reaction to obtain P (such as PME) in the more-severely P-depleted condition, or (ii) soil acidification provided a more optimal condition for PDE than PME, which resulted in lower PDE production appearing as lower enzyme activity at the same pH condition in the laboratory. Overall, our results indicated different responses of exoenzyme activities to external N input. This highlights the importance of atmospheric N deposition on microbial activity and collateral C and nutrient dynamics in tropical natural forests. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Competition has long been recognized as a central force in shaping evolution, particularly through character displacement. Yet research on character displacement is biased, as it has focused almost exclusively on pairs of interacting species while ignoring multispecies interactions. Communities are seldom so simple that only pairs of species interact, and it is not clear whether inferences from pairwise interactions are sufficient to explain patterns of phenotypes in nature. Here, we test for character displacement in a natural system of freshwater fishes in western Mexico that contains up to four congeneric species of the genus Poeciliopsis. We analyzed body shape differences between populations with different numbers of competitors while accounting for confounding environmental variables. Surprisingly, we found evidence for convergent character displacement in populations of P. prolifica, P. viriosa, and P. latidens. We also found that the convergence in body shape was not consistently in the same direction, meaning that when three or more competitors co-occurred, we did not find more extreme body shapes compared with when there were only two competitors. Instead, when three or more competitors co-occurred, body shape was intermediate between the shape found with a pair of species and the shape found with no competitor present. This intermediate shape suggests that evolution in multispecies communities likely occurs in response to several competitors rather than to simple pairwise interactions. Overall, our results suggest that competition among multiple species is more complex than simple pairwise competitive interactions.

AB Recent plant-soil feedback experiments suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species experience stronger conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) than ectomycorrhizal (EM) tree species. Yet, how these findings inform our understanding of natural systems is limited because the roles of local soil conditions, light availability and tree species abundances in influencing CNDD for AM and EM species are not clear.
   Here we examined seedling and sapling survival in two temperate old-growth forests (broad-leaved pine and spruce-fir forests) in Northeast China, to evaluate the effects of both conspecific and heterospecific neighbour density, as well as the soil and light environments, on the survival of AM- and EM-dependent trees at early life stages.
   While light availability increased the survival of EM seedlings, soil organic resources increased EM sapling survival in the spruce-fir plot. AM tree species suffered stronger CNDD than did EM tree species in both plots. In the spruce-fir plot, soil factors and light availability mediated species CNDD but their effects differed between AM and EM species, and also between seedlings and saplings. For seedlings in both plots, we found that AM species exhibited a positive relationship between species abundance and CNDD strength, whereas this relationship was negative for EM species.
   Synthesis. Our results provide one of the few tests of how fungal symbioses determine species responses to intraspecific and interspecific interactions and the direct effects of local environmental conditions on seedling and sapling survival. We show that mycorrhizal type mediates the strength of CNDD and its relationship with species abundance. These results suggest that tree mycorrhizal association can determine the strength of CNDD effect on both rare and common species, and these CNDD differences are likely to influence the community composition of temperate forests.

AB Aim Forested regions are of global importance for a multitude of ecosystem functions and services and are critical for biodiversity. Anthropogenic climate-change compounds negative effects of land-use change on forest persistence and forest-dependent biodiversity. Habitat loss and climate change have an additive effect and drive species' extinctions in similar ways, resulting in a homogenization of biodiversity. Connectivity is key in conservation planning for mitigating climate change effects and facilitating species' abilities to disperse throughout remnant habitat and track their climate niches. We used three forest-specialized and habitat-specific bird species as focal species to understand avian connectivity and conservation of each of South Africa's three threatened forest classes, as each species is range-restricted to its respective forest type.
   Location South Africa.
   Methods We created ensemble models of species' distributions and combined core home- and breeding-range patches with a hybrid of least-cost pathways and ecological circuit theory linkages to assess the success of corridors in facilitating connectivity of each of the three forest types. We then predicted the likelihood of niche persistence for each species under future climate-change scenarios, and the efficacy of our connectivity modelling to facilitate range expansion or climate-niche tracking.
   Results The projected habitat loss under climate-change scenarios impacted core-habitat patch distribution, size and connectivity, exacerbated habitat fragmentation and increased resistance and the severity of pinch points and barriers along dispersal corridors. Forest systems and associated focal species projected to experience the highest levels of habitat loss/contraction occurred at mid- to high elevations. Climate-change resilience across ecosystems, and persistence of species therein, was dependent on connectivity, facilitating species' ability to track specific climate niches.
   Main conclusions Climate-change resilience of ecosystems, and persistence of biodiversity therein, is most likely to be a product of high functional biodiversity, connectedness and the ability of species to track specific climate niches.

AB Aim Biotic interactions can determine rarity and commonness of species, however, evidence that rare and common species respond differently to biotic stress is scarce. This is because biotic interactions are notoriously context dependent and traits leading to success in one habitat might be costly or unimportant in another. We aim to identify plant characteristics that are related to biotic interactions and may drive patterns of rarity and commonness, taking environmental context into account.
   Location Switzerland.
   Methods In a multispecies experiment, we compared the response to biotic interactions of 19 rare and 21 widespread congeneric plant species in Switzerland, while also accounting for variation in environmental conditions of the species' origin.
   Results Our results restrict the long-standing hypothesis that widespread species are superior competitors to rare species to only those species originating from resource-rich habitats, in which competition is usually strong. Tolerance to herbivory and ambient herbivore damage, on the other hand, did not differ between widespread and rare species. In accordance with the resource-availability hypothesis, widespread species from resource-rich habitats where more damaged by herbivores (less defended) than widespread species from resource-poor habitats-such a growth-defence trade-off was lacking in rare species. This indicates that the evolutionary important trade-off between traits increasing competitive ability and defence is present in widespread species but may have been lost or never evolved in rare species.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that biotic interactions, above all competition, might indeed set range limits and underlines the importance of including context dependency in studies comparing traits of common and rare or invasive and non-invasive species.

AB In the past decade, concern for forest loss has spurred ambitious restoration goals for climatic, ecological, and livelihood benefits. Restoration activities typically rely on government-led or large-scale tree planting. A narrow focus on top-down initiatives could promote the recentralization of forestry activities and overlook important contributions by smallholders, especially in Africa. Smallholder tree planting activities are harder to track than institutional efforts. Here we quantify the extent of tree planting on smallholder woodlots in southern and eastern Tanzania, in comparison to large-scale plantations. In Google Earth Pro, we digitized all woodlots in randomly selected areas, and estimated woodlots' area, distribution, and expansion rate. We found that by year 2018, woodlots in the smallest size class (< 1 Ha) made up about half of the overall tree planting extent, covering an area equivalent to the government and corporate plantations. What's more, smallholder woodlots have been planted more recently: 54% of the digitized samples were planted between 2012 and 2015, a sign of woodlots' rising prominence. The vast majority of all planted trees were non-native pine and eucalyptus. Thus far, Tanzanian smallholders are planting trees in response to regional timber demand. Subsidies or incentives linked to global restoration goals could encourage more diverse planting and longer harvesting cycles. Given African countries' recent massive restoration pledges (e.g., Tanzania's 5.2 M Ha), we recommend explicit incorporation of smallholder tree planting to maximize livelihood and governance benefits.

AB Large-scale agricultural production and trade of commodities is linked to deforestation risk in the tropics. This article explores political discourses of deforestation risk in the bovine leather supply chain in Brazil. It discusses how specific interpretations and practices of transparency in the leather supply chain affect legitimacy, fairness and sustainability outcomes. The article applies a political discourse analysis to data collected in multiple localities in Brazil between May and July 2018. The data entails thirty-nine semi-structured, recorded, and transcribed interviews, in the form of both face-to-face and video call interviews. We find that the concept of sustainable supply chains is as much a political term, as it is an economic and managerial term. The results show that different discourses articulate deforestation risk of bovine leather differently and highlights how the storylines of each discourse bring attention both to what is made visible and invisible in relation to sustainability, legitimacy, and fairness. Moreover, the results emphasise the importance of the role and voice of frontier settlers, by presenting how their storylines inform a political discourse on livelihoods. We argue that a simplistic understanding of transparency may lead to negative implications for livelihoods and sustainability outcomes. Accordingly, there is a need for increased public scrutiny of supply chains, including the leather one, and for special attention to unequal power relations and the importance of meaningful inclusion of vulnerable groups and populations.

AB Land cover patterns in sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly changing. This study aims to quantify the land cover change and to identify its major determinants by using the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses (DPSIR) framework in the Ethiopian Gozamin District over a period of 32 years (1986 to 2018). Satellite images of Landsat 5 (1986), Landsat 7 (2003), and Sentinel-2 (2018) and a supervised image classification methodology were used to assess the dynamics of land cover change. Land cover maps of the three dates, focus group discussions (FGDs), interviews, and farmers' lived experiences through a household survey were applied to identify the factors for changes based on the DPSIR framework. Results of the investigations revealed that during the last three decades the study area has undergone an extensive land cover change, primarily a shift from cropland and grassland into forests and built-up areas. Thus, quantitative land cover change detection between 1986 and 2018 revealed that cropland, grassland, and bare areas declined by 10.53%, 5.7%, and 2.49%. Forest, built-up, shrub/scattered vegetation, and water bodies expanded by 13.47%, 4.02%, 0.98%, and 0.25%. Household surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) identified the population growth, the rural land tenure system, the overuse of land, the climate change, and the scarcity of grazing land as drivers of these land cover changes. Major impacts were rural to urban migration, population size change, scarcity of land, and decline in land productivity. The outputs from this study could be used to assure sustainability in resource utilization, proper land use planning, and proper decision-making by the concerned government authorities.

AB Community ecologists often assume that species-level trait differences drive habitat differentiation that promotes species coexistence. Direct empirical studies testing trait-habitat relationships in forest ecosystems are critical for understanding the functional basis of tree coexistence and predicting the effects of forest disturbance on diversity, but such studies have been rarely performed. Considering the importance of the regeneration niche in tree coexistence, here, we tested regeneration niche differentiation and species-level trait-habitat relationships by measuring nine microhabitat variables and seven functional traits of seedlings of three common tree species in a temperate mixed forest in Taibai Mountain in China. Our results showed that most tree seedlings grew in microhabitats with more light and distant neighbor than random points. The three species were separated in the microhabitat space defined by canopy cover and neighbor distance gradients and in the trait space defined by leaf economic traits, seed mass, and wood density. Leaf economic traits were mostly related to light microhabitat variables, whereas seed mass and stem wood density were mostly associated with neighbor distance. These results suggested that the heterogeneity of light availability and neighbor distance were the main ecological gradients in distinguishing different tree species in seedling microhabitats. Differences in seedling functional traits drive the differentiation of species regeneration niches, potentially facilitating the coexistence of tree species. Leaf economic traits, seed mass, and wood density could be used to predict the regeneration microhabitat of tree species.

AB Across the central and eastern U.S., decades of fire exclusion have coincided with upland oak (Quercus spp.) regeneration problems and a compositional shift toward shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive species like red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). Because oaks are fire-adapted and moderately shade-intolerant, prescribed fire is commonly used as a management tool to decrease competition, increase light, and promote oak regeneration. However, prescribed fire alone often fails to sufficiently open the canopy and improve oak competitive status, suggesting the combination of fire and canopy gaps may be necessary for oak success. To better understand the effects of single and multiple prescribed fires alone and combined with naturally-formed canopy gaps on tree regeneration, we measured tree densities (both seed and resprout origin) in five height size classes (small seedlings: <= 0.5 m, large seedlings (> 0.5-1.0 m), saplings (1.1-4.0 m), midstory (4.1-7.0 m), and poles (7.1-12 m)) within gaps and non-gap areas treated with no fire, single fire, or multiple fires (2-3) across six sites within the Knobs Region of Kentucky (U.S.A.) in 2017. Oaks were common as small and large seedlings without fire, especially within gaps, but they were largely absent from larger size classes. Instead, red maples and American beech dominated sapling and midstory size classes without fire, regardless of gap treatment. Single and multiple fires reduced both absolute and relative density of American beech saplings and red oaks (Q. velutina Lam., Q. coccinea Munchh. and Q. rubra L.) of all sizes, but single fires, both within and outside of gaps, increased red maple large seedling, sapling, and midstory dominance. Multiple fires, both within and outside of gaps, reduced red maple abundance, and this coincided with increased relative density of white (Q. alba L.) and chestnut oaks (Q. montana Willd.), but not of red oaks. Red oak small and large seedlings were the only oaks where absolute density increased in the small (similar to 300 m(2)), relatively old (20-30 yr), naturally-formed canopy gaps in this study. Our findings suggest that management techniques that include multiple prescribed fires and large canopy gaps ( > 300 m(2)) created relatively soon after fire will likely be necessary to reduce competing species, increase oak density, and allow oaks to reach sapling and midstory size classes.

AB Many insects feed on a low-nitrogen diet, and the origin of their nitrogen supply is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that some insects rely on nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) to supplement their diets. Nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs has been extensively studied and convincingly demonstrated in termites, while evidence for the occurrence and role of nitrogen fixation in the diet of other insects is less conclusive. Here, we summarize the methods to detect nitrogen fixation in insects and review the available evidence for its occurrence (focusing on insects other than termites). We distinguish between three aspects of nitrogen fixation investigations: (i) detecting the presence of potential diazotrophs; (ii) detecting the activity of the nitrogen-fixing enzyme; and (iii) detecting the assimilation of fixed nitrogen into the insect tissues. We show that although evidence from investigations of the first aspect reveals ample opportunities for interactions with potential diazotrophs in a variety of insects, demonstrations of actual biological nitrogen fixation and the assimilation of fixed nitrogen are restricted to very few insect groups, including wood-feeding beetles, fruit flies, leafcutter ants, and a wood wasp. We then discuss potential implications for the insect's fitness and for the ecosystem as a whole. We suggest that combining these multiple approaches is crucial for the study of nitrogen fixation in insects, and argue that further demonstrations are desperately needed in order to determine the relative importance of diazotrophs for insect diet and fitness, as well as to evaluate their overall impact on the ecosystem.

AB Understanding vegetation dynamics and its response to climate changes is important for revealing the mechanisms of terrestrial ecosystem behaviour, predicting future vegetation growth, and thus guiding environmental management. The Jing River Basin (JRB) and the Beiluo River Basin (BLRB), two typical ecoenvironmentally vulnerable regions on the Loess Plateau in China, were selected as case study regions. Based on long-term Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets, the time-lag relationships between NDVI and climatic factors (precipitation/temperature) as well as teleconnection factors (large-scale modes of climate variability and solar activity) were revealed. Additionally, ridge regression models were established to quantitatively explore the response of vegetation dynamics to climate change. Results indicate that: (1) NDVI in autumn showed significantly increasing trend (p < 0.01), whereas that in spring and summer was insignificant; (2) there was a time-lag of more than one month between spring/winter NDVI and precipitation/temperature behaviour, and summer NDVI exhibited no lag with temperature but a one month lag with precipitation; (3) regarding the time-lag effects, precipitation was the driving factor of NDVI variations in spring, whereas sunspots dominated NDVI variations in autumn; (4) when time-lagged teleconnection factors were considered, the explanation of the climate effect on the vegetation dynamics in three seasons all relatively increased by > 95%, which indicates that the prediction accuracy of NDVI was significantly improved; (5) in summer, time-lagged climatic and teleconnection factors explained < 20% of NDVI variations, whereas when soil moisture and base flow were considered, the explanation of NDVI changes in the JRB and BLRB relatively increased by 37.4% and 65.1%, respectively. These findings highlight that considering the time-lag effect of climatic and teleconnection factors has important significance for the accurate monitoring of underlying surface dynamics under changing environment.

AB Mediterranean drylands are particularly vulnerable to predicted increases in aridity which are expected to have negative consequences for biodiversity. To understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems, a framework for the selection of indicators based on the essential biodiversity variables (EBV) was proposed. In this framework, a functional approach has been suggested because functional traits have shown to be sensitive to smallscale environmental changes. Additionally, functional traits are also associated with ecosystem-limiting processes. In this context, we used ants as ecological indicators, as they are functionally important and respond in a measurable way to environmental changes. We identify which biodiversity-based indicators (e.g., taxonomic, single-trait and multi-trait indices) help track changes in Mediterranean drylands; for this, we used a space-for-time substitution climatic gradient in the western Mediterranean. Ants were sampled along an aridity gradient and identified to species level. Four continuous and seven categorical traits were measured or retrieved from literature. Continuous traits included Weber's length, which is indicative for body length, head length, eye length and femur length; categorical traits were diet, behavioral dominance, daily activity, nest preference, mound presence, worker polymorphism and foraging strategy. We calculated taxonomic, functional structure and single- and multi-trait functional diversity indices and correlated them with aridity. We found that ant taxonomic and multi-trait functional diversity were maintained along the aridity gradient. Despite maintenance of species and functional diversity along the gradient, ant functional structure responded to aridity with increases in mean trait values of Weber's length, eye length and femur length in the drier part of the gradient. Under wetter conditions, we found the highest proportion of ants with a seed-based diet, reflecting a potential increase in resource quantity. We observed a change in foraging strategy from group to individual as aridity increased. In conclusion, with a space-for-time substitution climatic gradient, this study shows the potential role of aridity as an environmental driver of ant trait values. These results highlight the value of ants and functional traits as indicators to track the effects of climate change on ecosystems. Finally, this study represents a starting point to monitor important species traits in the context of EBV and to use them as indicators to track the effects of aridity on Mediterranean dryland ecosystems.

AB We evaluated the effects of projected, near future ocean acidification (OA) and extreme events of temperature (warming or cooling) on the thermal tolerance of Concholepas concholepas, a coastal benthic keystone species. Three separate trials of an experiment were conducted by exposing juvenile C. concholepas for 1 month to one of two contrasting pCO(2) levels (similar to 500 and similar to 1200 mu atm). In addition, each pCO(2) level was combined with one of four temperature treatments. The control was 15 degrees C, whilst the other temperatures were 10 degrees C (Trial 1), 20 degrees C (Trial 2) and 25 degrees C (Trial 3). At the end of each trial, we assessed Critical Thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) via self-righting success, calculated partial thermal tolerance polygons, measured somatic growth, determined transcription of Heat Shock Proteins 70 (HSP70) and measured oxygen consumption rates. Regardless of pCO(2) level, HSP70 transcript levels were significantly higher in juveniles after exposure to extreme temperatures (10 degrees C and 25 degrees C) indicating physiological stress. Oxygen consumption rates increased with increasing temperature from 10 degrees C to 20 degrees C though showed a decrease at 25 degrees C. This rate was not affected by pCO(2) or the interaction between temperature and pCO(2). Juveniles exposed to present-day and near future pCO(2) levels at 20 degrees C showed similar thermal tolerance polygonal areas; whilst changes in both CTmin and CTmax at 25 degrees C and 10 degrees C caused narrower and broader areas, respectively. Temperature affected growth, oxygen consumption and HSP70 transcription in small juvenile C. concholepas. Exposure to elevated pCO(2) did not affect thermal tolerance, growth or oxygen consumption at temperatures within the thermal range normally experienced by this species in northern Chile (15-20 degrees C). At elevated pCO(2) conditions, however, exposure to warmer (25 degrees C) or colder (10 degrees C) temperatures reduced or increased the thermal area, respectively. This study demonstrates the importance of examining the thermal-tolerance edges to better understand how OA and temperature will combine to physiologically challenge inter-tidal organisms.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of succession stages of regeneration of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) on the richness, diversity, trophic guilds, and community composition of ants looking for taxonomic and functional changes in the community. The areas included an active pasture that had been created within the past six months, areas with several years of abandonment with different degrees of natural Brazilian savanna regeneration (from 2 to 15 years), and two large remnants of native forest that had been preserved for at least 40 years. Collections were carried out in 56 plots using sardine baits and an active search for a period of one hour in each plot. In addition to calculating the regeneration age, we evaluated successional stages by measuring vegetal characteristics in each plot. A total of 60 species was obtained, distributed in 28 genera and 8 subfamilies, and these demonstrated a direct association with the regeneration age of the areas, as well as their richness and diversity of ants. Areas with initial regeneration showed a greater proportion of generalist species and, as plant succession increased, generalist species decreased. A temporal threshold of 5-6 years for regeneration age was observed, when the community structure tended to stabilize. We observed that the maintenance of a minimum quantity of vegetation in areas destined for livestock can efficiently preserve ant diversity.

AB Background Categorization of topographical features into landform type is a long-standing method for understanding physiographic patterns in the environment. Differences in forest composition between landform types are driven primarily by concurrent differences in soil composition and moisture, but also disturbance regime. Many studies have focused on the interaction between fire disturbance, succession, and landforms, but the effects of hurricane disturbance on compositional differences between landforms are poorly understood. In the study presented here, we assess compositional and structural differences between landform types in the tree community of a young sub-tropical forest that is frequently subjected to hurricanes. Specifically, we ask whether the tree community (1) changed structurally over the study period, (2) experienced compositional change over the study period, (3) is compositionally different between landform types, and (4) exhibits compositional change mediated by landform type. Results The tree community experienced significant structural change over the course of our study, but compositional change was only significant for some landforms. Conclusion Despite large-scale, intense, and frequent hurricane disturbance to our study system, compositional change in the tree community was localized and only significant for some landform types.

AB Background Long-term studies of community and population dynamics indicate that abrupt disturbances often catalyse changes in vegetation and carbon stocks. These disturbances include the opening of clearings, rainfall seasonality, and drought, as well as fire and direct human disturbance. Such events may be super-imposed on longer-term trends in disturbance, such as those associated with climate change (heating, drying), as well as resources. Intact neotropical forests have recently experienced increased drought frequency and fire occurrence, on top of pervasive increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but we lack long-term records of responses to such changes especially in the critical transitional areas at the interface of forest and savanna biomes. Here, we present results from 20 years monitoring a valley forest (moist tropical forest outlier) in central Brazil. The forest has experienced multiple drought events and includes plots which have and which have not experienced fire. We focus on how forest structure (stem density and aboveground biomass carbon) and dynamics (stem and biomass mortality and recruitment) have responded to these disturbance regimes. Results Overall, the biomass carbon stock increased due to the growth of the trees already present in the forest, without any increase in the overall number of tree stems. Over time, both recruitment and especially mortality of trees tended to increase, and periods of prolonged drought in particular resulted in increased mortality rates of larger trees. This increased mortality was in turn responsible for a decline in aboveground carbon toward the end of the monitoring period. Conclusion Prolonged droughts influence the mortality of large trees, leading to a decline in aboveground carbon stocks. Here, and in other neotropical forests, recent droughts are capable of shutting down and reversing biomass carbon sinks. These new results add to evidence that anthropogenic climate changes are already adversely impacting tropical forests.

AB BackgroundUnderstanding the processes that structure species is one of the primary focuses in community ecology. Hubbell's neutral model shows stochastic processes alone can describe the two macro-ecological patterns, species richness and species-area relationship, of the community. Although Hubbell's neutral model can explain the macro-ecological patterns of the species at large scales, it paid less attention to construct the spatial structure of the community. Previous studies suggest that such spatial structures are mostly due to habitat filtering processes work at the intermediate spatial scales. Therefore, Hubbell's neutral model does not explain the full picture of the community structuring due to its fully stochastic nature.ResultsIn this study, we proposed a two-schema model that has the habitat filtering component and the stochastic component to construct the species assemblages seen in the community level. The proposed model uses one additional parameter (i.e. number of individuals in habitat) in addition to Hubbell's three-parameter neutral model (i.e. fundamental bio-diversity number (theta), dispersal limitation (m) and speciation (v)). The proposed model works at two spatial scales: habitat filtering at the intermediate scales and stochastic processes at the large and very small spatial scales. The model coupled the local community dynamics with the meta-community dynamics. The local community has a fixed area with carrying capacity that is proportional to the local community size. The number of habitats in the proposed model can vary. Individuals are placed into habitats with probabilities according to the habitat suitability. Species richness and species composition in each habitat were calculated. The model is fitted for different theta values, m values, and a different number of habitats.ConclusionsWe assume that habitat filtering plays an important role together with stochastic processes to structure species in forests. Therefore, the proposed model with only four parameters can explain a large proportion of the species structuring of the communities. We found that more species can be maintained in a heterogeneous environment than a uniform environment. Therefore, habitat conservation is highly important for maintaining species diversity in forest communities.

AB Understanding the requirements and tolerances of the seedlings of climax species is fundamental for tropical forest restoration. This study investigates how the presence and abundance of seedlings of a previously dominant, now threatened species (Dipterocapus dyeri Pierre), varies across a range of environmental conditions. Dipterocapus dyeri seedling abundance and site characteristics were recorded at 122 observation points (4 m(2)) at nine clusters from two sites. Seedling presence (p = 0.065) and abundance varied significantly (p = 0.001) between the two sites, and was strongly correlated with adult D. dyeri dominance and lower soil pH, and weakly correlated with canopy openness and total stand basal area. Dipterocarpus dyeriseedlings were also grown in shade houses with three light levels on two soils. Seedling survival was significantly lower at the lowest light level (<10% full irradiance) at 13% for the forest soil and 25% for degraded soil. At higher irradiance the seedling survival rates were greater than 99%. Moisture levels remained high at the lowest light level and many seedlings died from fungal infection. We concluded that secondary forests which contain adequate numbers of adult D. dyeri as seed sources, light availability, soil pH of < 5.0, and good drainage strongly favour survival and growth of D. dyeriseedlings. Historically, D. dyeri was dominant in moist deciduous tropical forest across south-eastern Vietnam, but today it is rare. Active management of these recovering forests is essential in order to recover this high-value, climax forest species.

AB Although the recognition of archaea as one of the three kingdoms in the tree of life has been nearly a half-century long, the comparative investigations on their ecological adaptations with bacteria have been limited. The mechanisms of their community assembly and diversity maintenance in hot springs have not been addressed. The mechanistic study is critical not only for understanding the hot-spring microbiome structure and dynamics, but also for shedding light on their evolutionary adaptations. We applied the neutral theory model and species sorting paradigm of metacommunity theory to investigate how hot-spring microbial communities were assembled, how their diversities were maintained, and how the temperature and pH influence these mechanisms. Through rigorous statistical tests based on the neutral theory and species sorting paradigm, we found (i) According to the neutral theory, archaeal and bacterial communities are assembled differently, with stochastic neutral force playing a more significant role in archaeal communities than in bacterial communities (neutrality-rate = 52.9 vs. 15.8%,p-value < 0.05). (ii) Temperature and pH account for rather limited (<10%) variations in hot-spring microbiomes based on the species sorting paradigm. The pH has more significant influences than temperature on archaeal communities, and both pH and temperature have similarly low influences on bacterial community structure. (iii) We postulate that the differences between archaea and bacteria are likely due to the longer evolutionary history and better adaptation of archaea to host spring environments.

AB The mechanisms regulating community composition and local dominance of trees in species-rich forests are poorly resolved, but the importance of interactions with soil microbes is increasingly acknowledged. Here, we show that tree seedlings that interact via root-associated fungal hyphae with soils beneath neighbouring adult trees grow faster and have greater survival than seedlings that are isolated from external fungal mycelia, but these effects are observed for species possessing ectomycorrhizas (ECM) and not arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Moreover, survival of naturally-regenerating AM seedlings over ten years is negatively related to the density of surrounding conspecific plants, while survival of ECM tree seedlings displays positive density dependence over this interval, and AM seedling roots contain greater abundance of pathogenic fungi than roots of ECM seedlings. Our findings show that neighbourhood interactions mediated by beneficial and pathogenic soil fungi regulate plant demography and community structure in hyperdiverse forests. Associations with mycorrhizal fungi can affect the outcome of plant competition in complex ways. Here the authors use a decade-long field survey and two hyphal exclusion experiments to reveal a critical role of underground fungal networks in facilitating seedling growth and fitness of ectomycorrhizal plants but not arbuscular mycorrhizal plants.

AB Understanding how assemblages are structured in space and the factors promoting their distributions is one of the main goals in Ecology, however, studies regarding the distribution of organisms at larger scales remain biased towards terrestrial groups. We attempt to understand if the structure of stream fish metacommunities across a Neotropical ecoregion (Upper Parana-drainage area of 820,000 km(2)) are affected by environmental variables, describing natural environmental gradient, anthropogenic impacts and spatial predictors. For this, we obtained 586 sampling points of fish assemblages in the ecoregion and data on environmental and spatial predictors that potentially affect fish assemblages. We calculated the local beta diversity (Local Contribution to Beta Diversity, LCBD) and alpha diversity from the species list, to be used as response variables in the partial regression models, while the anthropogenic impacts, environmental gradient and spatial factors were used as predictors. We found a high total beta diversity for the ecoregion (0.41) where the greatest values for each site sampled were located at the edges of the ecoregion, while richer communities were found more centrally. All sets of predictors explained the LCBD and alpha diversity, but the most important was dispersal variables, followed by the natural environmental gradient and anthropogenic impact. However, we found an increase in the models' prediction power through the shared effect. Results suggest that environmental filters (i.e. environmental variables such as climate, hydrology and anthropogenic impact) and dispersal limitation together shape fish assemblages of the Upper Paranaecoregion, showing the importance of using multiple sets of predictors to understand the processes structuring biodiversity distribution.

AB South African National Parks (SANParks) is implementing rehabilitation projects in parks where acquired lands have degrees of degradation. Such parks need to have empirical data to determine the degree of degradation and the success of the projects. We sampled epigeal ants at degraded and control sites in Mountain Zebra and Mokala National Parks to acquire the empirical data. With the data, our main aims were to: 1) determine the impact of degradation on the ant community; 2) determine if the rehabilitation period influences the difference between the degraded and control sites; and, 3) identify the degradation that affected the ant community the most. The majority of the degraded sites had lower abundance, species richness, Shannon-Wiener Diversity, common- and exclusive-species than their respective control sites. All the degraded sites had a lower abundance of ants compared to their respective controls. The majority of the degraded sites had lower species richness, higher Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index and higher ant species dominance than their respective controls. The rehabilitation periods differently influenced the difference between the degraded and control sites. Degraded sites that had undergone longer rehabilitation times had lower dissimilarity to their respective controls, while a degraded site with shorter rehabilitation period was very different to its control. Ploughing appears to have longer lasting degradation-impact on ant communities than herbicides applications. A site with ploughing degradation was very dissimilar to its control while sites with chemical degradation had lower disparities to their respective controls. Different degradation activities, therefor, affect ant recovery differently.
   Conservation implications: Attention should be paid to the type of degradations that are at the lands identified for expanding the conservation areas. Some of these degradations seem persistent and slow to rehabilitate. Variety of organisms (such as ants in this case) should be included when determining the degradation status of a conservation land.

AB Urbanization is one of the main drivers of environmental change and can result in drastic changes to the biodiversity and composition of plant communities. The objective of the present work was to investigate whether the structure, diversity and composition of Neotropical savanna woody plant communities differ among fragments immersed in urban, peri-urban and rural environments. The study was carried out in nine Neotropical savannas with distinct levels of urbanization in the municipality of Montes Claros, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A total of 469 woody individuals belonging to 76 species and 30 families of plants were sampled. The most specious families were the Fabaceae with seventeen species and the Vochysiaceae with eight. The most abundant species were Myracrodruon urundeuva in urban areas, Byrsonima pachyphyla in peri-urban areas and Hymenaea stigonocarpa in rural areas. The diversity (species richness, estimated species richness and Simpson diversity index) and structure (abundance, cover and height) of the plant communities under study did not vary in response to urbanization, although species composition experienced notable changes. The urban plant communities were very distinct from the rural plant communities. Furthermore, the dominant species were very different among the urban, peri-urban and rural areas. These findings demonstrate that urbanization affects Neotropical savanna species that are susceptible to anthropization. Furthermore, among the anthropogenic pressures related to urbanization, fragmentation and isolation seem to be the most influential determinants of the composition of Neotropical savanna communities.

AB Responses in taxonomic and functional composition of communities were analysed in small Amazonian streams at the small and large scale (habitat patches, river segment scale, and catchment scale). We hypothesised that similar responses in community structure to local environmental factors were a correlation between taxonomic and functional composition. To evaluate the response of taxonomic composition to environmental variables, redundancy analysis (RDA) and RLQ analysis were performed to investigate the response of community abundance (L) as a function of the environment (R) and traits (Q). The fourth-corner analysis was applied to summarize specific interactions between environmental variables and traits. Then, community taxonomic composition was associated with models at multiple scales of habitat (i.e. riparian/channel, substrates, and water variables). Likewise, the fourth-corner tests and RLQ axes showed associations between trait composition and environmental variables related to variables, such as riparian cover and channel morphology followed by variation in substrate size and composition. Unexpectedly, these results did not show specific associations between unique environmental variables and traits. At last, results showed that local conditions of stream habitat regulated community structure and functional composition of aquatic insects. Thus, these findings indicate that the local environmental filtering appears to be strongly associated with selected species traits adapted to occur in a range of habitat conditions. Despite the low number of analysed streams, these results provide important information for understanding the simultaneous variation in functional trait composition and community composition of aquatic insect assemblages.

AB Ants are a widespread group of ecologically important insects. Therefore, ants that are important predators of other ants are likely to play key roles by changing the abundance and impacts of their prey. Familiar arthropod predators, like army ants, are known for their overwhelming raids on invertebrate prey but are limited to mostly tropical systems. Thief ants (Genus: Solenopsis Westwood) are a cosmopolitan group of mostly subterranean ants found in a wide variety of ecosystem types. They are known for their extremely small sizes and their specialized predation where they stealthily tunnel into the nests of other larger ant species to capture and consume only immature ants (larvae and pupae). Predation of ant colonies by other ants, and specialized predatory behaviors of presumed top ant predators (e.g., army ants) are well known. However long-term predation effects, such as across several seasons, are still poorly understood because of a lack of experimental studies. Here we report results of a similar to 1.5-year press field experiment where thief ants were reduced in natural ant communities. Potential impacts, such as predator-release, were quantified by sampling the co-occurring ant community. Compared to control plots, overall worker abundance and biomass increased where thief ants were reduced, and effects varied among ant species. Results suggest predator release as select aboveground foraging ant species increased in abundance and that thief ants may act as significant predators. Because thief ants are abundant and widespread, similar predatory effects may occur in many ant communities, and our understanding of important predators may need to adjust to include thieving species as well as army ants. Thief ants are very abundant, tiny, specialized to consume immature life stages, equipped with powerful venom, eusocial, and subterranean. This suite of adaptive traits seems unique to eusocial predators compared to animals, where "thieving" predators are usually larger in size compared to their adult-sized prey. Future work quantifying top-down regulation of prey and cascading consumptive and non-consumptive effects will help to understand thief ant predation and potential effects on ecosystem processes.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) availability in lowland tropical rainforests influences the distribution and growth of tropical tree species. Determining the P-acquisition strategies of tropical tree species could therefore yield insight into patterns of tree beta-diversity across edaphic gradients. In particular, the synthesis of root phosphatases is likely to be of significance given that organic P represents a large pool of potentially available P in tropical forest soils. It has also been suggested that a high root phosphatase activity in putative nitrogen (N) -fixing legumes might explain their high abundance in lowland neotropical forests under low P supply. Here, we measured phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity on the first three root orders of co-occurring tropical tree species differing in their N-fixation capacity, growing on soils of contrasting P availability in Panama. Our results show that root PME activity was higher on average in P-poor than in P-rich soils, but that local variation in PME activity among co-occurring species within a site was larger than that explained by differences in soil P across sites. Legumes expressed higher PME activity than nonlegumes, but nodulated legumes (i.e., actively fixing nitrogen) did not differ from legumes without nodules, indicating that PME activity is unrelated to N fixation. Finally, PME activity declined with increasing root order, but the magnitude of the decline varied markedly among species, highlighting the importance of classifying fine roots into functional groups prior to measuring root traits. Our results support the hypothesis that low-P promotes a high root PME activity, although the high local variation in this trait among co-occurring species points toward a high functional diversity in P-acquisition strategies within an individual community.

AB The relative importance of intraspecific trait variation (rITV) for functional diversity (FD) in plant communities is increasingly apparent, but the influence of abiotic factors on the balance between intraspecific and interspecific effects in contrasting environments is uncertain. Drawing on a novel conceptual and analytic framework, we quantified rITV as the ratio of FD associated with between-population ITV (Intra_FD) and the interspecific variation (Inter_FD) due to species turnover across sites.
   We predicted that rITV would increase with environmental harshness as a result of decreasing interspecific variation and concomitant increases in between-population ITV. We empirically tested this prediction in a comparison of rITV for five traits (mature plant height, SLA, leaf dry matter content and the foliar concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus (P)) characterizing species in Tibetan alpine meadow communities from contrasting environmental regimes.
   We found that across sites: (a) rITV for all five traits increased with environmental harshness not only through decreasing Inter_FD but also through increasing Intra_FD; (b) increases in rITV were mostly attributable to declines in soil resources, especially soil P, with lower soil P significantly associated with lower Inter_FD but higher Intra_FD for most traits; and (c) although neither Intra_FD nor Inter_FD was significantly impacted by species richness for any traits, a higher rITV for SLA was significantly associated with low species richness.
   Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that the functional significance of ITV in plant communities increases with environmental harshness. Moreover, in the Tibetan alpine meadows we studied, the opposing intraspecific and interspecific responses along a gradient of P availability appear to act as a buffering mechanism stabilizing the functional structure of communities on P deficient soils. Our novel conceptual and analytical framework provides a template for evaluating the generality of this favourable mismatch between intraspecific and interspecific responses in FD along environmental gradients.

AB Ogcodes Latreille is the largest genus of Acroceridae. They exhibit a cosmopolitan distribution and parasitize several spider families. Eleven Neotropical species are currently recognized in the genus, with five of them occurring in Chile, though distribution data is limited in this group of rarely collected flies. In this work, we describe a new species, Ogcodes kunkunche sp. nov. Barahona-Segovia from the evergreen forest of Chiloe Island, provide an identification key to the Chilean species of Ogcodes, and include novel distributional data for other species of spider flies (Acrocerinae and Ogcodinae). Based in our results, we suggest that O. kunkunche sp. nov. must be incorporated in the porteri group, due to wing vein reduction. Morphological aspects within Ogcodes, and their evolutionary implications are discussed.

AB To understand how comprehensive plant defense phenotypes will respond to global change, we investigated the legacy effects of elevated CO2 on the relationships between chemical resistance (constitutive and induced via mechanical damage) and regrowth tolerance in four milkweed species (Asclepias). We quantified potential resistance and tolerance trade-offs at the physiological level following simulated mowing, which are relevant to milkweed ecology and conservation. We examined the legacy effects of elevated CO2 on four hypothesized trade-offs between the following: (a) plant growth rate and constitutive chemical resistance (foliar cardenolide concentrations), (b) plant growth rate and mechanically induced chemical resistance, (c) constitutive resistance and regrowth tolerance, and (d) regrowth tolerance and mechanically induced resistance. We observed support for one trade-off between plant regrowth tolerance and mechanically induced resistance traits that was, surprisingly, independent of CO2 exposure. Across milkweed species, mechanically induced resistance increased by 28% in those plants previously exposed to elevated CO2. In contrast, constitutive resistance and the diversity of mechanically induced chemical resistance traits declined in response to elevated CO2 in two out of four milkweed species. Finally, previous exposure to elevated CO2 uncoupled the positive relationship between plant growth rate and regrowth tolerance following damage. Our data highlight the complex and dynamic nature of plant defense phenotypes under environmental change and question the generality of physiologically based defense trade-offs.

AB Throughout the developing world, payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs are popular policy instruments that allow those who rely on such amenities as drinking water and clean air to pay the landowners who, in turn, provide and care for those services so the resources are protected and sustainably available in the future. Despite the popularity of PES programs as policy instruments, they have been proven largely ineffective in achieving their long-term goals. Specifically, they have failed to conserve the targeted ecosystem services. We examine Mexican instrument constituencies that have promoted use of a PES program, the payments for hydrological services (PHS) program. Instrument constituencies are groups of policy actors who are bound by an interest in a particular policy instrument or solution. Although the PHS program has been in existence for nearly 20 years, the evidence points to policy drift and overall policy failure. The path-dependent nature of the instrument constituency and resulting feedbacks have crowded out any chance of more effective forest or water conservation programs from being established. A case-based counterfactual analysis is employed to consider alternative program choices that could exist in the absence of a PHS instrument constituency.

AB Differential visitation of pollinators due to divergent floral traits can lead to reproductive isolation via assortative pollen flow, which may ultimately be a driving force in plant speciation, particularly in areas of overlap. We evaluate the effects of pollinator behavioral responses to variation of intraspecific floral color and nectar rewards, on reproductive isolation between two hybrid flower color morphs (fuchsia and blue) and their parental species Penstemon roseus and P. gentianoides with a mixed-pollination system. We show that pollinators (bumblebees and hummingbirds) exhibit different behavioral responses to fuchsia and blue morphs, which could result from differential attraction or deterrence. In addition to differences in color (spectral reflectance), we found that plants with fuchsia flowers produced more and larger flowers, produced more nectar and were more visited by pollinators than those with blue flowers. These differences influenced the foraging behavior and effectiveness as pollinators of both bumblebees and hummingbirds, which contributed to reproductive isolation between the two hybrid flower color morphs and parental species. This study demonstrates how differentiation of pollination traits promotes the formation of hybrid zones leading to pollinator shifts and reproductive isolation. While phenotypic traits of fuchsia and red flowers might encourage more efficient hummingbird pollination in a mixed-pollination system, the costs of bumblebee pollination on plant reproduction could be the drivers for the repeated shifts from bumblebee- to hummingbird-mediated pollination.

AB Forest loss is mainly due to the conversion of forest to agriculture, mostly in private lands. Forest restoration is a global priority, yet restoration targets are ambitious and budget-limited. Therefore, assessing the outcome of alternative decisions on land-use within private lands is paramount to perform cost-effective restoration. We present a novel framework that incorporates spatial planning for forest restoration within private lands with conservation co-benefits at the landscape scale. As a case study, we used three real landscapes of 10.000 ha with differing amounts of forest cover in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, and three hypothetical animal species with different dispersal abilities. We estimated the total amount of forest that landholders must restore to comply with the Native Vegetation Protection Law, which requires landholders to reforest 20% of their land within a 20-year time frame. We compared the costeffectiveness of five restoration strategies based on the improvement in habitat availability and restoration costs. The most cost-effective strategy depends on a landscape's initial amount of forest cover and the species of concern. We revealed that spatial planning for restoration in private lands increased habitat availability up to 12 times more than random restoration, which was always the least cost-effective strategy. Cost-effective large-scale restoration in Brazil depends on public policies that assist landholders to comply with the law and on prioritizing areas for restoration within private lands. We show that by adding habitat availability as target in spatial prioritization, benefits for biodiversity can be hastened at low additional cost, even in real world scenarios with severe spatial constraints. Despite constraints, spatially planned restoration for law compliance in Brazil increased landscape permeability by creating corridors and stepping stones. Our framework should be used to plan restoration in Brazilian private lands and can be customized for other regions worldwide. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The National Nature Reserve (NNR) network forms a central element in China's governmental strategy to conserve the country's vast biodiversity and its varied ecosystems. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the existing NNR network in protecting China's highly diverse habitats and the fauna and flora they contain has remained unclear. Here, we analyze how comprehensively the existing NNR network protects China's vegetation diversity, identifying potential gaps to inform future NNR designations. Covering similar to 15.7% of China's land area, the existing nature reserve network contains 18 main vegetation types and 26 sub-types. All main vegetation types are also contained in the National-level Nature Reserves (NNRs), but to highly differing degrees. NNRs cover similar to 24.0% of China's grasslands, but only similar to 3.3% of the country's monsoon forests. With regards to main vegetation regions, about 41.4% of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is covered by NNRs, in contrast to only similar to 4.6% of the region representing warm-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests. In five main vegetation regions, NNRs cover <10% of the area and are scattered across a highly fragmented network, leading for example to China's highly biodiverse subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests being conserved only in small, isolated NNRs. NNRs also greatly vary in the number of vegetation types they individually comprise, with only 64 NNRs (18.9%) individually containing >50% of the vegetation types in their respective region. Overall, NNR size increases and fragmentation decreases from China's south-east to its western provinces. The resulting, extremely uneven distribution of NNRs across China limits their effectiveness in protection the country's plant diversity treasure trove. The country's NNR network therefore needs significant adjustments to effectively conserve China's valuable natural resources for future generations. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Metacommunity ecology combines local (e.g., environmental filtering and biotic interactions) and regional (e.g., dispersal and heterogeneity) processes to understand patterns of species abundance, occurrence, composition, and diversity across scales of space and time. As such, it has a great potential to generalize and synthesize our understanding of many ecological problems. Here, we give an overview of how a metacommunity perspective can provide useful insights for conservation biology, which aims to understand and mitigate the effects of anthropogenic drivers that decrease population sizes, increase extinction probabilities, and threaten biodiversity. We review four general metacommunity processes-environmental filtering, biotic interactions, dispersal, and ecological drift-and discuss how key anthropogenic drivers (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, and nonnative species) can alter these processes. We next describe how the patterns of interest in metacommunities (abundance, occupancy, and diversity) map onto issues at the heart of conservation biology, and describe cases where conservation biology benefits by taking a scale-explicit metacommunity perspective. We conclude with some ways forward for including metacommunity perspectives into ideas of ecosystem functioning and services, as well as approaches to habitat management, preservation, and restoration.

AB Functional diversity is a tool for understanding biological communities and the influence of environmental filters on assembly rules. However, few studies explore the relationships of diversity metrics across contrasting ecosystems. We evaluated the effect of ecosystems (tropical dry forest and pine-oak forest) and seasons (wet and dry) on the functional diversity and community composition of amphibians in western Mexico. Our study showed that associations among metrics of diversity were not constant across contrasting ecosystems. The amphibian communities were related to changes in the environmental variables of elevation, temperature and relative humidity. We analyzed the functional diversity of the amphibian community based on 11 traits related to reproduction, trophic flow and habitat use. Seven functional groups with distinct ecological characteristics were detected, of which, four presented functional redundancy and two were represented by a single species. While the tropical dry forest during the wet season showed the highest species richness, the richness and diversity of functional groups were significantly lower than in the pine-oak forest in both seasons. These results suggest that the seasonal drought in the tropical dry forest could act as an environmental filter, promoting dominance of similar functional traits among species, while limiting similarity could be acting in the pine-oak forest, in the face of relatively stable hydric conditions, allowing a greater functional diversity. Analysis of the relationship between biological communities and ecosystem functioning is necessary to undertake conservation strategies.

AB The Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hot spot in a global context that has been undergoing deforestation and fragmentation in the last centuries. The remnant fragments are under the risk of extinction due to continuous and intense anthropic action. Therefore, many restoration projects have been proposed to recover degraded areas. In this study, we evaluated the anatomical acclimation mechanisms and growth of Guazuma ulmifolia and Ceiba speciosa under different irradiance conditions in dry and wet seasons. Both species are used in restoration projects. We found that under low irradiance, plants allocated more resources to leaves than roots and developed larger and thinner leaves with lower stomatal density. On the other hand, when exposed to high-irradiance (HI) conditions, we observed a smaller leaf area and specific leaf area, thicker leaves and increased root biomass. Both species showed better quality (higher values of Dickson quality index) at HI and dry season, presumably because soil moisture was maintained constant during the experiment. Therefore, we concluded that C. speciosa and G. ulmifolia have a better performance under high-irradiance and well-watered conditions, suggesting that both species can be used in open areas of reforestation projects.

AB Leaf litter can be retained in floodplains for several months before it enters rivers as lateral inputs. During this period, the environmental conditions on the floodplain can alter leaf litter chemistry and, consequently, affect its subsequent processing in the river. We analysed the effect of contrasting floodplain conditions on the chemical composition of leaf litter and its leachates, and how this affected their biodegradability and processing in rivers. To do so, we placed reed leaf litter (Phragmites australis) in open- and closed-canopy habitats of three floodplain sites with contrasting climates (semiarid Mediterranean, humid Mediterranean and continental) for 105 days. We then used litterbags in a river to examine the decomposition of preconditioned leaf litter in comparison with a control (non-preconditioned litter), and laboratory assays to examine the biodegradation of their leachates. Contrasting conditions on the floodplain prompted differences in the nutrient content of leaf litter among floodplain sites. Preconditioning caused a generalized decline in the C content and an increase in the lignin content of leaf litter. Even so, preconditioning did not affect litter decomposition rates in the river, although it did reduce decomposition efficiency and biodegradability of leachates. Shredder colonization of litter was variable and generally higher on preconditioned litter, but not significantly so. Different floodplain conditions had no influence on the aquatic processing of preconditioned litter. Our results demonstrate that the retention of leaf litter in terrestrial environments can affect C budgets of fluvial ecosystems and the recipient food web by reducing the input and the biodegradability of C and nutrients.

AB The Amazon forest covers 7.5 million km(2) in nine countries, hosts 25% of the global biodiversity and is a major contributor to the biogeochemical and climatic functioning of the Earth system. Despite its global importance, a regionalization of the Amazon tree flora is still lacking. Clear and data-driven delimitation of subregions is important for macroecological studies, to the identification of metacommunities and is a requisite for conservation planning.
   We aimed at identifying and mapping plant species subregions and investigated their relationships with environmental, historical and human correlates. We provide the first woody plant regionalization of the entire Amazon forest using a data-driven approach based on assemblage composition patterns.
   We compiled data on woody species composition from 301 assemblages based on species occurrences. We then used unconstrained ordination, interpolation and clustering techniques to identify and map discrete woody subregions. Hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted in order to investigate the relationships between the identified subregions. We used multinomial logistic regression model and deviance partitioning to investigate the influence of environmental, historical and human factors on subregions distribution.
   We identified 13 woody subregions in the entire Amazon forest. The hierarchical subregion classification showed a broad Andean-Cratonic east-west division. Variation in subregions was explained jointly by human factors and spatial structure followed by environmental factors and spatial structure combined.
   Synthesis. Our woody plant subregions differed from World Wildlife Fund ecoregions and physiognomic-based maps, highlighting the importance of basing regionalizations on taxon-specific groups and confirming that vegetation maps should not be used as proxies to plant diversity subregions. Our findings also confirm the need for multiple and extensive protected areas in the Amazon forest. The relevance of current climate factors in our study alerts to a profound impact that climate change could have on the spatial organization of the Amazon flora.

AB Indirect defence, the adaptive top-down control of herbivores by plant traits that enhance predation, is a central component of plant-herbivore interactions. However, the scope of interactions that comprise indirect defence and associated ecological and evolutionary processes has not been clearly defined. We argue that the range of plant traits that mediate indirect defence is much greater than previously thought, and we further organise major concepts surrounding their ecological functioning. Despite the wide range of plant traits and interacting organisms involved, indirect defences show commonalities when grouped. These categories are based on whether indirect defences boost natural enemy abundance via food or shelter resources, or, alternatively, increase natural enemy foraging efficiency via information or alteration of habitat complexity. The benefits of indirect defences to natural enemies should be further explored to establish the conditions in which indirect defence generates a plant-natural enemy mutualism. By considering the broader scope of plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions that comprise indirect defence, we can better understand plant-based food webs, as well as the evolutionary processes that have shaped them.

AB Tropical forests have been facing high rates of deforestation driven by multiple anthropogenic disturbances, with severe consequences for biodiversity. However, the understanding of such effects on functional diversity is still limited in tropical regions, especially considering different ecological groups responses. Here, we evaluated the functional responses of birds to forest loss at the threatened Brazilian Atlantic forest, considering the complete assemblage, and both forest-dependent and non-forest-dependent species. Birds were surveyed in 40 forest sites with a forest cover gradient, located in two regions showing different land use types. We tested different models to assess the responses of functional diversity indices to forest loss in these sites. Although functional diversity did not differ between regions, forest and non-forest birds showed divergent responses to forest loss. Deforested landscapes presented an increase in functional richness (SESFRic) and evenness for forest species and an increase of functional dispersion for non-forest birds. Additionally, forested landscapes harbor birds presenting lower body mass and wing length, and non-forest species with lower tarsus length. The maintenance of some functional metrics through forest loss resulted from a compensatory dynamic between forest and non-forest birds, indicating that only evaluating the complete assemblage may mask important idiosyncratic patterns of different ecological groups. Although non-forest species are relatively capable to maintain bird functional diversity in deforested landscapes, forest birds are facing a drastic ongoing collapse in these sites, representing an alarming signal for the maintenance of forest ecosystem function.

AB Protected areas are increasingly threatened by biological invasions, especially in tropical Asia where extensive areas of natural habitats have been converted to monoculture plantations. Such disturbance provides a gateway for exotic species invasions, highlighting an urgent need for cross-boundary solutions to mitigate invasion impacts.
   Agroforests, with multi-storied trees and crops resembling the complex structure of natural forest, are known to promote native species compared to monoculture plantations. Yet, our knowledge on their roles in controlling exotic species is limited to plant invaders, with effects on animal invaders still unknown. Given that protected areas are increasingly threatened by invaders from surrounding plantations, with a majority of them represented by insects, it is important to evaluate the effect of agroforestry practice, and mechanisms of associated management to control invasions.
   By using both taxonomic and functional trait-based approaches, we studied leaf litter ant communities in 12 rubber monoculture (mono-rubber), 9 rubber plantation with understory crops (agro-rubber), 16 secondary and 12 old-growth secondary forest plots in and around protected areas in Hainan, China. Sampled ants were further classified into groups based on their invasive potential (tramp vs. non-tramp) to determine the ecological values of agro-rubber.
   We found that despite mono-rubber and agro-rubber presenting similar species richness, the latter (a) supports species composition and functional diversity more similar to secondary forests and (b) reduces tramp ant species occurrence, a novel management incentive. Nonetheless, agro-rubber is not comparable to secondary forest in terms of non-tramp ant species composition.
   Synthesis and applications. Against the increasing threat of biological invasions, preserving natural forests in human-dominated landscapes is crucial. Increasing the area of agro-rubber at the periphery of protected areas as a proactive mitigation can, however, be perceived as an additional measure to reduce invasive species' establishment and spread across the landscape. Plantation-based agroforestry has emerged as a potential management avenue and incentive for transforming monoculture plantations into a less 'harmful' alternative.

AB The global expansion of tree plantations is often claimed to have positive effects for mitigating global warming, preventing soil erosion, and reducing biodiversity loss. However, questions remain unanswered about the impacts of plantations on belowground diversity and soil properties. Here, we examine how forestry plantations of exotic trees affect critical soil functions and the composition of invertebrate assemblages, by comparing invertebrate diversity and soil physico-chemical properties between non-native Pinus radiata plantations, and nearby native forests in a region of extensive plantation activity in south-central Chile. We quantified differences in diversity, abundance, and community composition of soil invertebrates, as well as fundamental soil properties such as soil water content, water infiltration, nutrient status, and pH. We show that in this landscape mosaic of native forest and plantations, both soil invertebrate communities and physical soil properties differed significantly between systems, despite similar soil origins and topographies. We found a significant loss of soil carbon and a major reduction in taxonomic and functional diversity of soil invertebrates in pine plantation sites. Soil biotic and abiotic characteristics of plantations differed significantly from native forests in plantation-dominated south-central Chile, with profound consequences for ecosystem processes and resilience to future climate change.

   UPTAKE
AB Over the last 15 years, New Zealand led research on wastewater treatment high rate algal ponds (HRAP) has focused on ways to optimise pond performance, particularly with respect to nutrient removal and resource recovery (microalgal biomass production). The primary motivation for most of this research has been the need to cost-effectively improve wastewater treatment, particularly in small towns and rural communities, where wastewater treatment would otherwise be unaffordable. The ability to recover resources (water and nutrients) helps enable a circular bio-economy, through the reuse of these recovered resources in future products. New Zealand HRAP research has focused on 10 broad categories, including improving pond performance (nutrient removal and biomass yield), environmental impacts of HRAPs, pond design and operation, microalgal and zooplankton community composition and control, algal-based products, enhancing phosphorus removal, biomass harvesting and emerging contaminants. Research has been carried out at a range of scales, including mesocosm, pilot-scale and full-scale. Simple modification to how HRAPs are operated, such as culture depth, operating ponds in series, biomass recycling and night-time CO2 addition, have been shown to improve pond performance, particularly nutrient removal, biomass productivity, species dominance maintenance or zooplankton graze control. However, despite our improved understandings over the last 15 years, there are still a number of priorities for increasing HRAP performance, including effective CO2 addition at full-scale, improving phosphorus removal and reducing potential environmental impacts of HRAPs. Uptake of HRAP technology by local government bodies and industries is low and the reasons for this are not fully clear. Cost-effective and sustainable harvesting of the microalgal/bacterial biomass, to ensure effluent discharge meets total nutrient and total suspended solids load limits, is one barrier that must be overcome to allow greater uptake of this technology.

AB California's remote Anza-Borrego Desert, like other desert landscapes across the southwest of the United States, is valued by scientists, resource managers, and tourists alike for its perceived exceptional extremity. We analyze how climate extremes shape biological, socioeconomic, and cultural life through one of the desert's most iconic ecological events: spring wildflower superblooms. Quantitative data relating wildflower superblooms and tourist visitation to interannual climate variation are at the center of our analysis, with additional literature review and qualitative ethnographic data used to lend context and engage deeply with the significance of the quantitative findings for local communities. Monthly visitation rates tracked precipitation, peaking during the end of the winter growing season when wildflowers reach peak bloom. Visitation more than doubled during the wettest years, corresponding to wildflower abundance and superbloom media coverage. Wildflower superblooms and extreme environmental events are socially and culturally significant in the desert communities. They loom large in memory, shape regular seasonal activities and attachment to place, and feature in local conflicts over resource management and planning for sustainable futures. Overall, we demonstrate how gateway communities contend with the desert's ephemeral nature, and how climate change creates new and different extremes in these iconic desert landscapes.

AB Closely related species often differ in traits that influence reproductive success, suggesting that divergent selection on such traits contribute to the maintenance of species boundaries. Gymnadenia conopsea ss. and Gymnadenia densiflora are two closely related, perennial orchid species that differ in (a) floral traits important for pollination, including flowering phenology, floral display, and spur length, and (b) dominant pollinators. If plant-pollinator interactions contribute to the maintenance of trait differences between these two taxa, we expect current divergent selection on flowering phenology and floral morphology between the two species. We quantified phenotypic selection via female fitness in one year on flowering start, three floral display traits (plant height, number of flowers, and corolla size) and spur length, in six populations of G. conopsea s.s. and in four populations of G. densiflora. There was indication of divergent selection on flowering start in the expected direction, with selection for earlier flowering in two populations of the early-flowering G. conopsea s.s. and for later flowering in one population of the late-flowering G. densiflora. No divergent selection on floral morphology was detected, and there was no significant stabilizing selection on any trait in the two species. The results suggest ongoing adaptive differentiation of flowering phenology, strengthening this premating reproductive barrier between the two species. Synthesis: This study is among the first to test whether divergent selection on floral traits contribute to the maintenance of species differences between closely related plants. Phenological isolation confers a substantial potential for reproductive isolation, and divergent selection on flowering time can thus greatly influence reproductive isolation and adaptive differentiation.

AB Tropical forests are undergoing drastic transformations, putting at risk the species that rely on them. On the island of Borneo, between 1973 and 2015, 50% of the forest was lost, much of this to oil palm and other industries. We explore the impacts of these four decades of forest loss on the functionally connected habitat of 245 forest birds and mammals. First, we map potential suitable habitat in 1973 and 2015 by refining reported ranges by elevation, forest cover and patch size. We find that, on average, these species have lost 28% of habitat within their ranges. We then use graph-theory connectivity models to calculate the functionally connected area for each species, according to their natal dispersal abilities. We find a mean loss of 35% in functionally connected area, revealing the often hidden impacts of deforestation. Losses in functionally connected habitat are largely driven by area of habitat loss, though maximum elevational range limit also explains some of the differences modeled across species, with lowland species being most affected. We present a vulnerability index of threat arising from loss of functionally connected habitat. The spatial distribution of vulnerability index values serves as a tool for setting conservation priorities for forest remnants on Borneo, given that most of the ranges of these species are not protected. We make recommendations for the use of connectivity models to prioritize resources for research and conservation on Borneo and other biodiversity hotspots.

AB In the Neotropics, coffee production occurs on a large scale in some of the planet's most biodiverse regions: tropical mountains. Coffee production systems involving shade trees are considered to have a lower impact on biodiversity than alternative sun coffee. To date, the majority of evidence for the value of shade coffee plantations has not taken into account the relative quality of this habitat compared to the native forests they replaced. We determined the suitability of shade coffee and forest as winter habitat for Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) by comparing variation in the likelihood of capturing individuals, seasonal changes in body condition, and estimates of annual survival between the 2 habitats. We also determined the effect of the strong 2015-2016 El Nino event on survival. Males were relatively more likely to be captured in forest than females and this likelihood increased during drier years. Body condition change over the winter and apparent annual survival were similar for individuals that used forest and coffee. However, condition and survival decreased in both habitats during the El Nino year. Apparent survival was also lower for individuals carrying a radiotag or geolocator. Our findings suggest that shade coffee with high canopy cover and height offers similar benefits to forest in terms of body condition and survival. Landscape conservation approaches, promoting diverse matrices of structurally complex shade coffee and forest might best ensure long-term survival in Neotropical migrants like Canada Warbler.

AB Forest fragmentation is a leading driver of biodiversity loss, yet its effects on positive species interactions remain poorly known. We examined the effects of fragmentation on mixed-species bird flocks in the Western Andes of Colombia. Using 500-m transect surveys (n = 14 transects), we sampled flocks in 8 fragments (range: 10-173 ha) and an unfragmented reference site within the same altitudinal band (1,900-2,200 m.a.s.l.) and matrix type (cattle pasture). We evaluated the relative contributions of 9 predictor variables, including patch size, distance from edge, and selective aspects of vegetation structure on the composition, size, species richness, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of flocks. We found effects of both patch size and vegetation structure on flock species richness, size, and functional diversity, but no support for edge effects. Generally, flock richness and size responded differently to fragmentation than did functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics. Both flock size and richness increased with patch size, but this variable had no effect on functional and phylogenetic diversity. Flock richness and size increased in high-canopy forests with greater foliage height diversity, whereas unlogged, old-growth primary forests with large-diameter trees had lower flock richness and size, but significantly greater functional diversity. Phylogenetic diversity was not affected by patch size, edge effects, or vegetation structure. We found differences in flock composition in response to fragmentation. Richness of Furnariidae in flocks increased with increasing distance from edge and foliage height diversity, whereas that of Thraupidae and boreal migrant species increased in early successional and forest edge flocks, respectively. All flock diversity metrics differed significantly seasonally, with smaller, less diverse flocks observed in January-March than in June-August. Flocking behavior persisted in 10-ha fragments, likely because Andean flocks are"open membership" in nature, but there was extensive species turnover as forest edge and generalist species replaced forest-interior species in smaller fragments.

AB Rock-pools are considered to be important habitats for early shore-life of intertidal limpets. We investigated recruitment patterns of three co-existing limpet species in the region of Sines (SW Portugal): the patellids Patella depressa and Patella ulyssiponensis, and the siphonariid Siphonaria pectinata. Juvenile limpets (shell length <= 10 mm for P. depressa and <= 5 mm for S. pectinata) were counted in summer 2007 and winter 2009, in a wide range of intertidal habitats, on three natural shores (one shore inside the Port of Sines and two shores outside the Port, 4 and 9 km away). Temporal and among-shore patterns of abundance of recruits (shell length < 5 mm for all species) into mid-shore rock-pools were examined over quarterly periods, from May 2005 to July 2008. Despite a widespread distribution of P. depressa and S. pectinata juveniles, significantly higher juvenile abundance was mostly found in habitats of rock-pools (maxima of 94 and 92 juveniles in 15x15 cm, respectively, both in rock-pools at mid-shore). All species were found to recruit into mid-shore rock-pools year-round. Recruitment of both patellid species followed a similar seasonal pattern, being consistently low during all summer periods (maxima of 64 recruits of P. depressa during spring 2008 and 45 recruits of P. ulyssiponensis during spring 2007, both in 15x15 cm). High inter-annual variation was found in the intensity of recruitment of S. pectinata, with the yearly highest densities of recruits during summer or autumn periods (maximum of 134 recruits in 15x15 cm during summer 2005). Recruitment of all species was highest on the farthest shore from the Port. This study suggests the primacy of rockpools as nurseries for both patellogastropod and pulmonate limpets and the value of these habitats for sustaining limpet populations on this coast, where rocky-shores have been gradually replaced by artificial structures with scarcity of rock-pools.

AB Zero-deforestation commitments seek to decouple agricultural production and forest loss to improve prospects for biodiversity. However, the effectiveness of methods designed to meet these commitments is poorly understood. In a highly fragmented tropical landscape dominated by oil palm, we tested the capacity for the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach to prioritize forest remnants that sustain mammal diversity. Patches afforded high priority by HCS protocols (100 ha core area) provided important refuges for IUCN-threatened species and megafauna. However, patch-scale HCS area recommendations conserved only 35% of the mammal community. At least 3,000 ha would be required to retain intact mammal assemblages, with nearly 10 times this area needed if hunting pressure was high. While current HCS protocols will safeguard patches capable of sustaining biodiversity, highly fragmented tropical landscapes typical of zero-deforestation pledges will require thinking beyond the patch toward strategically configured forest remnants at the landscape level and enforcing strict controls on hunting.

AB Recognition of the spatial variation in tree species composition is a necessary precondition for wise management and conservation of forests. In the Peruvian Amazonia, this goal is not yet achieved mostly because adequate species inventory data has been lacking. The recently started Peruvian national forest inventory (INFFS) is expected to change the situation. Here, we analyzed genus-level variation, summarized through non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), in a set of 157 INFFS inventory plots in lowland to low mountain rain forests (<2000 m above sea level) using Landsat satellite imagery and climatic, edaphic, and elevation data as predictor variables. Genus-level floristic patterns have earlier been found to be indicative of species-level patterns. In correlation tests, the floristic variation of tree genera was most strongly related to Landsat variables and secondly to climatic variables. We used random forest regression, under varying criteria of feature selection and cross-validation, to predict the floristic composition on the basis of Landsat and environmental data. The best model explained >60% of the variation along NMDS axes 1 and 2 and 40% of the variation along NMDS axis 3. We used this model to predict the three NMDS dimensions at a 450-m resolution over all of the Peruvian Amazonia and classified the pixels into 10 floristic classes using k-means classification. An indicator analysis identified statistically significant indicator genera for 8 out of the 10 classes. The results are congruent with earlier studies, suggesting that the approach is robust and can be applied to other tropical regions, which is useful for reducing research gaps and for identifying suitable areas for conservation.

AB Silvopasture systems enhance the use efficiency of natural resources by diversifying vegetation structure and function. However, shading from trees may affect the production and quality of herbaceous forages and, consequently, the animal performance. The objective of this research was to evaluate regrowth and development of tree legumes as well as productivity and nutritive value of signalgrass [Brachiaria decumbens (Stapf) R.D. Webster] subjected to shading from the tree legumes gliricidia [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Steud] and sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth.). Herbage responses were evaluated every 56 d. Trees were evaluated every 120 d to assess morphological responses and forage nutritive value. Response variables included in vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM), concentrations of N, and stable isotopes (delta N-15) in grass and legume leaves. Greater herbage accumulation occurred for signalgrass submitted to full sun (57 kg ha(-1) d(-1)) than under shade (27 kg ha(-1) d(-1)) (p = .0006). Morphometric measurements of tree regrowth did not show differences for total leaf mass (p = .8603) and mass of thick stems (p = .6157) between tree legume species. Gliricidia leaf IVDOM was greater (504 g kg(-1)) than sabia leaf IVDOM (315 g kg(-1)) (p < .0001). Nitrogen concentration was greater in leaves (p = .0007), fine stems (p = .0050), and thick stems (p = .0333) of gliricidia throughout the evaluated period when compared to the same fractions of sabia. Both tree species, at the densities employed in this study, affected negatively and to a similar extent the herbage accumulation of signalgrass.

AB Small mammals can be used as environmental indicators and have been intensively studied in fragmented landscapes of Atlantic Forest, with a wide range of field methods. Our aim in this study was two-fold: we tested for the effects of methods and for the effects of the main environmental variables on observed small mammal richness in fragments of Atlantic Forest. We gathered information on small mammal richness, methods and environmental variables from 122 fragments of Atlantic Forest through literature review. These data were analysed using linear models and model selection based on AIC values along with a regression tree analysis. We found that studies will record more species with bigger trapping effort, using pitfall traps and sampling all forest strata. We also confirmed two important ecological assumptions: fragments at lower latitudes and bigger fragments were the ones with higher species richness. Methodological and environmental variables were analysed together on a regression tree, where trapping effort was the most important variable, surpassing any environmental effect. Considering that a significant number of the studies on Atlantic Forest fragments did not use pitfall traps or sample all forest strata, their results on forest fragmentation were affected by sampling bias.

AB During the period of Japanese occupation (1910-1945) and the Korean War (1950-1953), extensive areas of forest were severely degraded by over-harvesting and fire in Korea. In addition, intensive use of the forest-resources to obtain fuel, organic compost, livestock feed, and so on contributed to forest degradation. As a result, the South Korean government launched large-scale tree planting projects to reforest the denuded mountains particularly in the 1960s. This study aims to evaluate the restoration effects of the pitch pine (Pinus rigidaMill.) plantations and further diagnose the invasive potential of the pitch pine. To arrive at the goals, we investigated the changes of vegetation and soil characteristics in different chronosequences in the pitch pine plantations and in native forests, which were selected as reference stands. Pitch pine plantations were usually planted on mountainous land, which is characterized by an elevation of below 300 m above sea level and a gentle slope below 20 degrees. The species composition of the pitch pine forestations was different depending on the study site but tended to resemble that of the reference stands in the years after forestation. The species diversity showed an increasing trend in response to stand age. The frequency distribution of diameter classes of dominant tree species showed a trend for pitch pine plantations to succeed to native oak stands. A change in canopy profiles depending on stand age also proved the successional trend. The establishment and development of pitch pine plantations for reforestation contributed to erosion control and improved the physic-chemical properties of the soil and thus prepared a basis for the recovery of native vegetation. Such changes in vegetation and soil confirmed that the pitch pine plantations successfully achieved the restoration goals. On the other hand, mature pitch pine stands reproduced young pitch pine stands by self-seeding on the slopes of various sorts of roads including expressways. This shows that pitch pine is successfully established in Korea and thereby the species has been naturalized. However, the natural succession of pitch pine stands in Korea suggests that it is possible to introduce some exotic species for reforestation without resulting in uncontrolled invasion.

AB Prunus padusL. (bird cherry) belongs to theRacemosagroup in subgenusPadusin the genusPrunusL. It is a hardy invasive species, which makes it valuable for securing slopes, and for eco-design. It is a good solitary park tree with early flowering of white flowers in racemes, which have a pleasant smell. However, it may be attacked by cherry-oat aphid, and the small ermine moth, which may weave giant webs over the whole tree, which demonstrates the important role ofP. padusin the food web of forest ecosystems. The species is in balance with these pests, other herbivores and diseases throughout Europe and Asia. Another threat is the competition against the invasiveP. serotina, but it seems thatP. padusis not strongly threatened, though they compete for the same habitats. Moreover, human interference of forest community ecology is probably the greatest threat. The tree is not only winter hardy; it can also survive hot summers and tolerate a wide variety of soil types. It may form dense thickets due to the regeneration of branches bent to the ground and basal shoots, and may be invasive. These characteristics are important in determining the ecological niche ofP. padus, which involves the position of the species within an ecosystem, comprising both its habitat requirements and the functional role. It is also important thatP. padushas effective dispersal of pollen and seeds. This, together with the previously noted characteristics and the fact that the tree can cope well with climate change, define it as a not threatened species. However, the ssp.borealisis threatened and national level monitoring is required.Prunus padushas been exploited by farmers and rural population, but is less used today. However, it is still used for making syrup, jam and liquor. Moreover, the wood is valuable for wood carving and making cabinets. All tissues are valuable as sources of powerful natural antioxidants. However, the interest in theP. padusfruit and other tissues is overshadowed by the interest in other wild species of edible and human health-related berries. Moreover, the tree is used in horticulture as an ornamental in gardens and parks, values that deserve a new focus.

AB Uncoordinated land development results in landscape fragmentation, which is a complex and serious environmental threat to the Czech landscape. It poses a challenge especially for (post)industrial urban agglomerations with extremely low connectivity of green-blue infrastructure. Environmental and spatial planning strategic policy documents are considered to represent long-term communicative instruments for effective environmental protection. Current experience shows that policy documents are commonly poorly integrated, and burdened by formulation inconsistencies. In this study, we (i) specified the driving factors causing landscape fragmentation, describing how the issue is understood by environmental and spatial planning strategic policy documents and (ii) identified criteria for the formulation of these documents at the national and regional governance levels. A content analysis of 12 strategic policy documents enabled the calculation of internal consistency and an assessment of their inter- and cross-sectoral integration. The results revealed formulation flaws in documents, leading to serious misunderstandings of the meaning of the landscape fragmentation between environmental (biocentric) and planning (anthropocentric) policy domains. This aspect makes the horizontal and further vertical cooperation between policy domains difficult. Guidelines for the formulation of strategic policy documents may improve their intelligibility and support smoother environmental policy integration.

AB Background and aims Ancient Amazon soils are characterised by low concentrations of soil phosphorus (P). Therefore, it is hypothesised that plants may invest a substantial proportion of their resources belowground to adjust their P-uptake strategies, including root morphological, physiological (phosphatase enzyme activities) and biotic (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations) adaptations. Since these strategies are energy demanding, we hypothesise that trade-offs between morphological traits and root phosphatase exudation and symbiotic associations would occur. Specifically, we expected that plants which invest in finer roots, and therefore have greater ability to explore large soil volumes, would have a high investment in physiological adaptations such as enhanced phosphatase production. In contrast, we expected that plants with predominantly thicker roots would invest more in symbiotic associations, in which carbon is traded for P acquired from AM fungal communities. Methods We collected absorptive roots (<2 mm diameter) from a lowland Central Amazon forest near Manaus, Brazil. We measured fine root diameter, specific root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), root tissue density (RTD), root phosphatase activity (APase) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonisation. Results Root morphological traits were related to APase activity, with higher APase activity in roots with higher SRL and SRA but lower RTD. However, the degree of AM colonisation was not related to any measured root morphological trait. Conclusions Fine absorptive roots likely benefit from having low RTD, high SRL, SRA and APase exudation to acquire P efficiently. However, because AM colonisation was not related to root morphology, we suggest that investment in multiple P-uptake strategies is required for maintaining productivity in Central Amazon forests.

AB Background and aims Amazonia comprises a mosaic of ecosystems that harbor high biodiversity. Knowledge about fungal diversity and ecology in this region remains very limited. Here, we examine soil fungal communities in forests of the Colombian Amazonia and their relationship to important edaphic variables. Methods Fungal communities were studied interra-firmeforests dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees,terra-firmeforests with the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) treePseudomonotes tropenbosii(Dipterocarpaceae), and white sand forests (WSF) with the EcM host plant generaDicymbeandAldina(Fabaceae). Fungal community composition was determined through 454-pyrosequencing of the ITS2 region of ribosomal DNA. We established the impact of the type of forest and edaphic parameters in structuring the fungal communities. Results We found a high diversity of fungi with 2,507 OTUs occurring in the soil samples studied. Carbon content and pH were the main edaphic factors contributing to structure the fungal community across all forests. Fungal community composition differs amongterra-firmeplots and WSF, while it was similar among AM and EcM-dominated areas interra-firme. Our results revealed an important EcM fungal diversity interra-firmeAM-forests, where some EcM plants such as the ones in the generaCoccolobaandNeeaoccur scattered within an AM-matrix. Conclusions This is a first approximation to understand the ecology of soil fungal communities in forests of the Colombian Amazonia. We found that fungal soil communities have a spatial variation related to forest type (terra-firmeand WSF), soil pH, and soil carbon content. Due to the strong correlation between vegetation and soil fertility in Amazonia, it is difficult to understand the effects of those factors to the fungal communities.

AB Soil erosion is a natural process that drives the formation of lowland terrains in mountainous regions. Its role in ecosystem degradation has been strongly debated, due to the significant effect it has on a range of land types. Soil arthropods have been used as indicators of several disturbance types. However, little is known about arthropods in eroded sites in South Africa. The aim of this study was to identify possible indicators of erosion in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park, South Africa, and to determine differences in soil-dwelling arthropod assemblages found in non-rehabilitated and rehabilitated sites over a 24-month period. A total of 5661 soil arthropods were sampled during the study, with the highest species richness recorded in non-rehabilitated eroded sites. A higher number of unique arthropod species were recorded from the non-rehabilitated sites compared to other site types. Overlaps in assemblage structure between site types differed, dependent on site locality. IndVal results, based on species fidelity and specificity in the given habitats, indicated a single strong indicator, the mite Speleorchestes meyerae Theron and Ryke, 1969, for the non-rehabilitated eroded sites. Linear model analyses of site richness with mineralogy identified the significance of phosphorus (in the form of P2O5) in eroded sites. Given these results, soil mineralogy in conjunction with soil arthropod richness of eroded sites could be used to investigate the effect of erosion and form a basis for future study in soil biodiversity and function.

TI DRAMATIC LOCAL CHANGES, THE METACOMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF A SEMIARID SCRUB
   REMAINS UNAFFECTED AFTER 23 YEARS

AB Background: Understanding changes in local community composition along environmental gradients is essential for studying the long-term metacommunity dynamics. The metacommunity structure depends on the distribution of species along environmental gradients in terms of their coherence (continuity in their distribution range), species turnover and grouping of their range limits. A Clementsian structure would be defined by coherent ranges, significant turnover and sharp limits between local communities. All other things equal, a Gleasonian structure is distinguished by the absence of clear boundaries between local communities.
   Questions: The structure of a scrubland/semiarid/xeric metacommunity changes 23 years after its first characterization? Do environment and spatial variables determine the metacommunity structure?
   Species studied: 104 perennial-plant species.
   Study site and dates: Zapotitlan semi-arid valley, Puebla, in 1980 and 2003.
   Methods: Metacommunity structure and its relationship to environmental (edaphic) and spatial (altitude, slope and geographical location) variables were analyzed using data from the two historic surveys.
   Results: In 1980 a Clementsian structure was determined, which remained unchanged after 23 years. The importance of environmental filters decreased from 1980 to 2003.
   Conclusions: The prediction that, due to stochastic dispersion of propagules, the metacommunity would tend toward a Gleasonian structure was not fulfilled. There was no evidence for homogenization, although local tetechera communities (with dominance of the giant columnar cactus Cephalocereus tetetzo) had been invaded and transformed into shrubland communities. Local communities and the metacommunity should be monitored continuously to understand of the long-term structuration of these systems.

AB Background: Cloud forest in central Veracruz is highly fragmented. However, different arboreal elements are still present within the agricultural matrix, including small patches of secondary forest, isolated trees and forested riparian belts. These elements could be important for cloud forest species conservation.
   Questions: What is the structure and composition of forested riparian belts within current anthropic landscapes, and what is their potential contribution as reservoirs of mountain cloud forest native plant species?
   Studied species: Vegetation community of forested riparian belts of cloud forest.
   Study site and dates: Eastern Mexico (central Veracruz), January to November 2018
   Methods: Along 14 segments of riparian belts (approximate to 400 m long), distributed across different tributary streams, six 50 x 2 m transects were placed (three per riverside) per segment. Every plant rooted within a transect and >= 1.5 m in height was identified and measured (height and DBH).
   Results: A total of 2,062 plants from 161 species, 102 genera and 55 families were recorded in the 14 sites (8,400 m 2 sampled). Structural attributes and floristic composition varied widely amongst sites. Elevation and the amount of forest cover (i.e., area) within 500 m of each sampling site were the most important factors underlying the spatial variation in species composition.
   Conclusions: Riparian belts were remarkably heterogeneous harboring a notable richness of tree and shrub species many of them native of the original cloud forest. This diversity reveals that these arboreal elements are keystone structures for biodiversity conservation and also have a high potential as propagule sources for cloud forest restoration in anthropic landscapes.

AB Agroforestry systems play fundamental roles for wildlife conservation, but are prone to disturbances from management practices aiming at increasing local productivity. This work investigates the small mammal assemblages present in cacao agroforests, which differ in shade tree density. We tested the prediction that higher tree density increases shade level, analyzed how some environmental variables important for small mammals (vegetation complexity, tree basal area, and invertebrate biomass) vary across the shade level gradient, and how the assemblages respond to these variations. We also tested the effect of the environmental variables on the abundance of the three most common species: Rhipidomys mastacalis, Hylaeamys seuanezi, and Marmosa murina. We captured 651 individuals belonging to 18 species. A positive relationship was observed between an abundance of non-forest specialists and tree basal area, while species diversity within this group showed positive association with vegetation complexity. Assemblage structure (described by a matrix of species abundance per site) was not affected by our environmental variables, but R. mastacalis was more abundant in sites with lower vegetation complexity. Higher shade levels in cacao agroforest tended to occur in sites with greater tree basal area, which was not a good predictor of small mammal diversity. This suggests that environmental management to reduce shade with the purpose of increasing cacao productivity is not necessarily negative for small mammal conservation. Species diversity was favored by structurally complex systems, a possible response to greater niche diversity.

AB Soil aggregation and its effects on soil C storage have been addressed in thousands of research articles over the last 40 years. Research has been mostly focused on the resistance of aggregates to mechanical disruption and the role of organic matter in aggregate stabilization. On the other hand, relatively little attention has been paid to identifying the microbial, plant root and macro-invertebrate actors and physical processes that continuously create and destroy aggregates. The sum and dynamics of these processes determines the ability of soils to store and conserve C. Understanding the interactions between aggregation dynamics and C transformations in soils therefore requires a precise identification of the agents that produce aggregates and knowledge of the rates of formation and persistence in the pools thus identified.
   We propose to separate macro-aggregated components of different, physicogenic and biogenic origins from non-macro-aggregated soil on a morphological basis, using a simple visual technique. The specific biological or physico-chemical agent which produced each individual macro-aggregate can then be determined using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). A general description of the distribution and quality of organic matter among the different groups of macro-aggregates can be made. Simple soil re-aggregation or dis-aggregation tests conducted in field conditions further measure the production of different macro-aggregates with time and their mean residence times in the studied soil. Respirometry measurements on each recognized category of macro-aggregates evaluate the respective C losses through respiration. The methods described here will allow the dominant pathways of C flow at a given site to be characterized and possible management options to increase C storage identified. We finally discuss the different assumptions made to build this simple model and offer ways to test the methodology under field conditions.

AB The species-area relationship (SAR) is one of the main topics debated in ecology. Amphibians are highly sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation, due to their traits and reproductive requirements. In the present study, we developed a meta-analysis to address a mean effect size to SAR regarding forest amphibians in man-made fragmented landscapes, and tested the influence of seven in-study and landscape variables that may affect this relationship globally. We conducted a search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol and calculated an effect size for each one of the 28 studies elected by our criteria. There is a positive relationship between amphibia richness and patch area, with a mean effect size of 0.68 and high heterogeneity among studies. The meta-regressions showed that only the matrix type surrounding the patches affected the variance between studies, explaining 46%. Clear cut was the matrix with the highest effect size, followed by silviculture, but both had a low representation of studies. Agriculture, grazing and urban matrices had a significant influence on patch area and the species richness relationship, but with distinct mean effects sizes and variances between-studies. The matrix type around the remnants may substantially affect results and interpretation of the SAR, possibly due to the varying capacity of amphibia species to cross and inhabit each matrix type. If possible, SAR should be compared within a context of multiple landscapes, and not only with a patch-focused and local approach.

AB Although not widely used, ecosystem engineers represent a promising and sustainable tool in nature-based ecosystem management and restoration. In grassland ecosystems, a few invertebrates that engineer soils have been identified as key species regulating soil nutrients and plant communities' diversity and dynamics. Here, we assessed the role of the harvester ant Messor barbanis, an ecological engineer, in a Mediterranean dry grassland under restoration by characterising its nest environment, particularly the soil and vegetation. We found profound differences in soil physical and chemical variables and plant community structure between nests and ant-free patches in the restored grassland. Messor barbarus has improved soil fertility, driven the seed bank towards the reference grassland and significantly increased plant biomass, species richness and micro-local-heterogeneity. As biological filters, M. barbarus has driven plant communities towards a new trajectory in the restored site. Ant patches are characterised by mesotrophic species, whereas ant-free patches are dominated by species characteristic of compacted soils. They have accelerated the ecological recovery of Mediterranean dry grassland plants by directly and indirectly facilitating their re-establishment. These results illustrate the potential key role of ants as ecological engineers for the conservation and restoration of Mediterranean grasslands.

AB Although the use of crop-associated bacteria as biological control agents of fungal diseases has gained increasing interest, the biotechnological potential of forest tree-associated microbes and their natural products has scarcely been investigated. The objective of this study was to identify bacteria or bacterial products with antagonistic activity against Fusarium solani and Fusarium kuroshium, causal agent of Fusarium dieback, by screening the rhizosphere and phyllosphere of three Lauraceae species. From 195 bacterial isolates, we identified 32 isolates that significantly reduced the growth of F. solani in vitro, which mostly belonged to bacterial taxa Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Actinobacteria. The antifungal activity of their volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was also evaluated. Bacterial strain Bacillus sp. CCeRi1-002, recovered from the rhizosphere of Aiouea effusa, showed the highest percentage of direct inhibition (62.5 %) of F. solani and produced diffusible compounds that significantly reduced its mycelial growth. HPLC-MS analyses on this strain allowed to tentatively identify bioactive compounds from three lipopeptide groups (iturin, surfactin and fengycin). Bacillus sp. CCeRi1-002 and another strain identified as Pseudomonas sp. significantly inhibited F. solani mycelial growth through the emission of VOCs. Chemical analysis of their volatile profiles indicated the likely presence of 2-nonanone, 2-undecanone, disulfide dimethyl and 1-butanol 3-methyl-, which had been previously reported with antifungal activity. In antagonism assays against F. kuroshium, Bacillus sp. CCeRi1-002 and its diffusible compounds exhibited significant antifungal activity and induced hyphal deformations. Our findings highlight the importance of considering bacteria associated with forest species and the need to include bacterial products in the search for potential antagonists of Fusarium dieback.

AB Forest loss and degradation in the Brazilian Amazon due to mining activities has been intense for many years. To reverse this situation, a range of restoration programs for deforested and degraded areas have been created and implemented. The aim of this study was to analyze the tree composition, successional stage, dispersal and pollination syndromes, conservation status of tree species, and proximity to seed sources under different forest restoration techniques (seedling planting, natural regeneration, and assisted natural regeneration or nucleation) implemented in post-mining sites in the Paragominas municipality (Para, Brazil). Sixty permanent plots with a restoration age of three years were selected for tree sampling. A total of 119 species, 83 genera and 27 botanical families were identified. Sites restored with different techniques significantly differed in tree composition. Seedling planting sites exhibited the highest abundance, species richness, and diversity values. These were dominated less by pioneer species when compared to the natural regeneration and nucleation sites. Entomophilic pollination and zoochory dispersal were highly represented in the three types of restored sites. Abundance and species richness were negatively correlated with distance from plots to seed sources, and they sharply declined in natural regeneration and nucleation plots at >250 m from seed sources. Four threatened species were identified in the restored sites. We conclude that a combination of different restoration strategies at three-year-old post-mining restoration sites in the Brazilian Amazon results in the recovery of considerable levels of local tree diversity.

AB This paper explores farmers' motivations to participate in a market mechanism to come into compliance with the forest laws in Brazil. As of July 2008, farmers with deforestation beyond what is legally permitted can choose between compensating for illegal deforestation at another property or restoring this environmental debt in situ. The study analyzes the first real case of such a compensation market in the Amazonia, started in 2014 in the municipality of Paragominas, Para. I explore the main features of the Paragominas compensation market in order to understand why farmers with forest deficits would opt for such a mechanism. In particular, the main question explored in this study is: what economic and environmental factors influence the choice to compensate rather than restore in properties with a legal reserve deficit in Paragominas? Results show that an increase in the percentage of illegal deforestation that occurred up to 2008 on a property is associated with an increase in the predicted probability of choosing compensation, when keeping agriculture as a land use, the property size, and the number of land uses in the property unchanged. The study also reveals that farmers with forest deficits may prefer to buy a forest area instead of renting for compensation if they have enough capital to invest.

AB The vast forests of Amazonia are a major focus of conservation initiatives by NGOs and governments. Nevertheless, the dynamics and geography of conservation action in this iconic region is poorly understood and, unlike scientific production, has never been systematically assessed. Here, we address this deficit through a survey of ongoing conservation NGO project sites in the Amazon region. We identified a total of 170 conservation NGOs that were implementing 378 projects at 518 sites across the breadth of the Amazon region. Project sites were associated with inhabited regions near major rivers, but away from major urban centres. In contrast to scientific research sites, there was a relatively high representation of conservation NGO project sites in the so called 'arc-of-deforestation'. As anticipated, conservation project sites were often situated within protected areas. Overall, our study shows that, as a sector, conservation NGOs have successfully implemented projects throughout the Amazon region and are seemingly well-placed to meet future conservation challenges. However, given the practical difficulties we encountered while collecting the data for this project, we strongly recommend the development of an online data platform for the entire Amazon region that would allow conservationists and scientists to share information, monitor governmental and non-governmental actions, and better coordinate conservation responses in the future.

AB As forest fragmentation continues in many parts of the tropics, the conservation value of forest remnants remains controversial. Our study aimed to assess the structure and tree species diversity of mixed dipterocarp forest remnants from the Planted Forest Zone (PFZ) located in the Bintulu Division, Sarawak, compared with a forest considered relatively undisturbed (i.e. that has experienced no recent logging activities). We also compared three plot methods (50 x 50 m, 20 x 50 m and 10 x 50 m plots) in order to evaluate which could be used for time- and cog-effective inventories of structure and tree species diversity in fragmented forests. No significant differences were found between the fragmented forests and the relatively undisturbed forest for stem density, species richness and diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson). Dissimilarities in species, genus and family composition were observed between fragmented and relatively undisturbed forest, as well as between forest remnants themselves. These dissimilarities were likely to be related to intrinsic variation in these highly diverse tropical forests. However, an unusually high abundance of pioneer species (i.e. Macaranga) was found in plots from forest remnants. The forest remnants also had significantly lower basal areas due to a lack of trees in large diameter classes, which is likely a result of impacts from past logging activities. Otherwise, our results highlight the current high conservation value of the forest remnants-although the studied communities are likely to experience time-delayed shifts in species composition and/or extinctions in the future, with the effect of fragmentation on biodiversity being currently underestimated. Finally, for further studies of fragmented forests we recommend the use of 10 x 50 m plots which are faster and easier to implement in the field while providing estimates of structure and tree species diversity that are consistent with those from larger plots.

AB Background Liriope muscari (Decne.) L.H. Bailey is a valuable horticultural and medicinal plant that grows under a range of light intensities, from high to low, in the understories of shrubs. To understand how this species adapts to these various environments, we selected two groups of lilyturf growing under poplar trees at two different spacings. Each group was divided into three types, open field, forest edge and shaded forest with high, medium and low irradiance levels, respectively, and then we examined their photosynthetic characteristics, physiology and biomasses. Results Light saturation point, light compensation point and in situ net photosynthetic rate (P-N) were highest in lilyturf growing under high light. In contrast, lilyturf growing under low light had a higher apparent quantum yield and Chl a and b contents, indicating that they adapted to low light. Although the leaves of lilyturf growing under low light were small, their root tubers were heavier. Conclusions The research demonstrates the eco-physiological basis of lilyturf's shade adaptation mechanism as indicated by photosynthetic activity, chlorophyll fluorescence, Chl a, Chl b and Car contents when grown under different irradiances. We believe that lilyturf is a shade-tolerant plant suitable for planting in undergrowth, but attention should be paid to the canopy density of the forest when interplanting. The findings presented here advance our understanding of the photosynthetic characteristics of understory plants and may assist in the optimization of irradiances in the future.

AB Fires shape the biogeochemistry and functioning of many ecosystems, and fire frequencies are changing across much of the globe. Frequent fires can change soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage by altering the quantity and chemistry of plant inputs through changes in plant biomass and composition as well as altering decomposition of soil organic matter. How decomposition rates change with shifting inputs remains uncertain because most studies focus on the effects of single fires, where transient responses may not reflect responses to decadal changes in burning frequencies. Here, we sampled seven sites exposed to different fire frequencies. In four of the sites, we intensively sampled both soils and plant communities across four ecosystems in North America and Africa spanning tropical savanna, temperate coniferous savanna, temperate broadleaf savanna, and temperate coniferous forest ecosystems. Each site contained multiple plots burned frequently for 33-61 years and nearby plots that had remained unburned over the same period replicated at the landscape scale. Across all sites, repeatedly burned plots had 25-185% lower bulk soil C and N concentrations but also 2-10-fold lower potential decomposition of organic matter compared to unburned sites. Soil C and N concentrations and extracellular enzyme activities declined with frequent fire because fire reduced both plant biomass inputs into soils and dampened the localized enrichment effect of tree canopies. Examination of soil extracellular enzyme activities revealed that fire decreased the potential turnover of organic matter in the forms of cellulose, starch, and chitin (P < 0.0001) but not polyphenol and lignin (P = 0.09), suggesting a shift in soil C and N cycling. Inclusion of delta C-13 data from three additional savanna sites (19-60 years of altered fire frequencies) showed that soil C losses were largest in sites where estimated tree inputs into soils declined the most (r(2) = 0.91, P < 0.01). In conclusion, repeated burning reduced C and N storage, consistent with previous studies, but fire also reduced potential decomposition, likely contributing to slower C and N cycling. Trees were important in shaping soil C and N responses across sites, but the magnitude of tree effects differed and depended on how tree biomass inputs into soil responded to fire.

AB Purpose This paper investigates the incentives to coffee farmers to participate in certification schemes that require improved agricultural practices. Design/methodology/approach The authors ran a choice experiment among 250 Brazilian coffee farmers in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Findings The authors' findings show that both cash and non-cash payments are likely to incentive farmers' participation in a certification scheme. Besides price premium, incentives as long-term contracts and provision of technical would encourage producers to adopt eco-certification schemes. Our results also suggest that non-cash payments may be appropriate substitutes to a price premium to some extent. Research limitations/implications The large coffee producers are over-represented in our sample compared to the population of Brazilian coffee farms. However, it seems reasonable to focus on these producers, as they are usually the ones who individually adopt strategies, since small farmers are induced by collective strategies (e.g. cooperatives). Social implications The result regarding technical assistance makes sense given that Brazilian farmers generally have poor access to rural extension services. Originality/value We contributed in the literature about adoption of sustainable agriculture practices analyzing the requirements and motivations for farmer participation in certification schemes. We also contribute private and public strategies to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices.

AB Tropical rain forests worldwide are under increasing pressure from human activities, which are altering key ecosystem processes such as plant-animal interactions. However, while the direct impact of anthropogenic disturbance on animal communities has been well studied, the consequences of such defaunation for mutualistic interactions such as seed dispersal remains chiefly understood at the plant species level. We asked whether communities of endozoochorous tree species had altered seed removal in forests affected by hunting and logging and if this could be related to modifications of the frugivore community. At two contrasting forest sites in French Guiana, Nouragues (protected) and Montagne de Kaw (hunted and partly logged), we focused on four families of animal-dispersed trees (Sapotaceae, Myristicaceae, Burseraceae, and Fabaceae), which represent 88% of all endozoochorous trees that were fruiting at the time and location of the study. We assessed the abundance of the seed dispersers and predators of these four focal families by conducting diurnal distance sampling along line transects. Densities of several key seed dispersers such as large-bodied primates were greatly reduced at Montagne de Kaw, where the specialist frugivore Ateles paniscus is probably extinct. In parallel, we estimated seed removal rates from fruit and seed counts conducted in 1-m(2) quadrats placed on the ground beneath fruiting trees. Seed removal rates dropped from 77% at Nouragues to 47 % at Montagne de Kaw, confirming that the loss of frugivores associated with human disturbance impacts seed removal at the community level. In contrast to Sapotaceae, whose seeds are dispersed by mammals only, weaker declines in seed removal for Burseraceae and Myristicaceae suggest that some compensation may occur for these bird- and mammal-dispersed families, possibly because of the high abundance of Toucans at the disturbed site. The defaunation process currently occurring across many tropical forests could dramatically reduce the diversity of entire communities of animal-dispersed trees through seed removal limitation.

TI Patterns of association of native and exotic boring polychaetes on the

AB Background. Studies of biological invasions focus on negative interactions between exotic and native biotas, emphasizing niche overlap between species and competitive exclusion. However, the effects of positive interactions and coexistence are poorly known. In this study we evaluate the importance of positive, negative, or random species associations in explaining the coexistence of native and exotic boring polychaetes inhabiting invertebrate hosts, on the southeastern Pacific coast of Chile. We assess three hypotheses to explain the observed patterns: positive species interactions, weak competitive interactions, and competitive intransitivity.
   Methodology. To assess the potential effect of competition between native and exotic polychaetes we analyzed patterns of co-occurrence of species pairs in northern and southern regions, using the metric of the probabilistic model. Since biotic interactions can affect not only native species, we also evaluated correlations between native and exotic polychaete abundance, using reduced major axis regression linear models. To assess the transitivity of competitive hierarchies we used metrics and analytical methods based on abundance matrices to estimate species competition and patch transition matrices.
   Results. On average 50% of the species pairs presented significant weak negative associations, all associated with the exotic species Polydora rickettsi; the remaining 50% had random associations, and none showed positive associations. However, the relationship of abundance between native and exotic boring polychates supports a tendency towards coexistence. At local and regional scales, we observed the presence of a transitive network competition structure, where the exotic boring polychaete, P. rickettsi was generally the dominant species.
   Conclusions. Our results support that native and exotic boring polychaete species coexist through weak competitive interactions. Nevertheless, the large number of random interactions observed indicates that species coexistence can be accounted for by stochastic processes, as proposed by neutral theory. Coexistence may be a frequent result of interactions between native and exotic species, although less apparent than competitive exclusion. Thus, the probabilistic point-of-view used here provides a statistical tool for evaluating coexistence as a result of exotic and native species' interactions, an idea which has been proposed in invasion ecology, but largely lacks empirical support and methodologies for detecting underlying mechanisms. Finally, we found evidence that P. rickettsi is a successful invader by being competitively dominant, but not excluding other species.

AB Tropical forest landscapes are undergoing rapid transition. Rural development aspirations are rising, and land use change is contributing to deforestation, degradation, and biodiversity loss, which threaten the future of tropical forests. Conservation initiatives must deal with complex social, political, and ecological decisions involving trade-offs between the extent of protected areas and quality of conservation. In Cambodia, smallholders and industrial economic land concessions drive deforestation and forest degradation. Rural economic benefits have not kept pace with development aspirations and smallholders are gradually expanding agriculture into protected forests. We examine the drivers and effects of rural forest landscape transitions in Cambodia to identify trade-offs between conservation and development. Using historical trends analysis and information gathered through key informant interviews, we describe how local communities perceive social and ecological changes, and examine the implications of local development aspirations for conservation. We explore three scenarios for the future of conservation in Cambodia, each with different conservation and community development outcomes. We contend that conservation efforts should focus on strengthening governance to meet social and environmental requirements for sustainable forest landscapes. We suggest potential entry points for governance improvements, including working with local decision-makers and fostering collaboration between stakeholders. There is a need for realistic priority setting in contested tropical forest landscapes. Prosperous rural economies are a necessary but not sufficient condition for conservation.

AB Tropical rainforests harbor a particularly high plant diversity. We hypothesize that potential causes underlying this high diversity should be linked to distinct overall functionality (defense and growth allocation, anti-stress mechanisms, reproduction) among the different sympatric taxa. In this study we tested the hypothesis of the existence of a metabolomic niche related to a species-specific differential use and allocation of metabolites. We tested this hypothesis by comparing leaf metabolomic profiles of 54 species in two rainforests of French Guiana. Species identity explained most of the variation in the metabolome, with a species-specific metabolomic profile across dry and wet seasons. In addition to this "homeostatic" species-specific metabolomic profile significantly linked to phylogenetic distances, also part of the variance (flexibility) of the metabolomic profile was explained by season within a single species. Our results support the hypothesis of the high diversity in tropical forest being related to a species-specific metabolomic niche and highlight ecometabolomics as a tool to identify this species functional diversity related and consistent with the ecological niche theory.

AB In this article I give a critical evaluation of the use and limitations of null-model-based hypothesis testing as a research strategy in the biological sciences. According to this strategy, the null model based on a randomization procedure provides an appropriate null hypothesis stating that the existence of a pattern is the result of random processes or can be expected by chance alone, and proponents of other hypotheses should first try to reject this null hypothesis in order to demonstrate their own hypotheses. Using as an example the controversy over the use of null hypotheses and null models in species co-occurrence studies, I argue that null-model-based hypothesis testing fails to work as a proper analog to traditional statistical null-hypothesis testing as used in well-controlled experimental research, and that the random process hypothesis should not be privileged as a null hypothesis. Instead, the possible use of the null model resides in its role of providing a way to challenge scientists' commonsense judgments about how a seemingly unusual pattern could have come to be. Despite this possible use, null-model-based hypothesis testing still carries certain limitations, and it should not be regarded as an obligation for biologists who are interested in explaining patterns in nature to first conduct such a test before pursuing their own hypotheses.

AB Eupsophus migueli is considered a microendemic endangered species inhabiting the temperate Nothofagus forests of the Mahuidanche Range of southern Chile. However, this categorization is based on scarce data about its distribution and natural history. In order to assess these parameters, this article reports new geographic records obtained through intensive fieldwork between 2011 and 2016. Considering this, an updated distribution map for E. migueli is proposed, and new data about natural history traits and habitat use are provided. The information obtained in this study is discussed considering the zoogeographical importance of E. migueli, and confirms the species IUCN conservation status.

AB Whereas most work to understand impacts of humans on biodiversity on coastal areas has focused on large, conspicuous organisms, we highlight effects of tourist access on the diversity of microscopic marine animals (meiofauna). We used a DNA metabarcoding approach with an iterative and phylogeny-based approach for the taxonomic assignment of meiofauna and relate diversity patterns to the numbers of tourists accessing sandy beaches on an otherwise un-impacted island National Park. Tourist frequentation, independently of differences in sediment granulometry, beach length, and other potential confounding factors, affected meiofaunal diversity in the shallow "swash" zone right at the mean water mark; the impacts declined with water depth (up to 2 m). The indicated negative effect on meiofauna may have a consequence on all the biota including the higher trophic levels. Thus, we claim that it is important to consider restricting access to beaches in touristic areas, in order to preserve biodiversity.
   Martinez et al. use DNA metabarcoding and a phylogeny-based approach to demonstrate the effects of tourist access on meiofauna diversity of beaches in Asinara National Park. Their results show that tourist frequentation decreases meiofaunal diversity at the shallow "swash" zone, and can be used to inform tourist access and management of beaches.

AB Context Climate change will cause species extinctions that will be exacerbated by human-caused landscape changes, preventing species from tracking shifting climatic niches. Although incorporating functional connectivity into prospective population models has proven challenging, the field of landscape genetics provides underutilized tools for characterizing functional connectivity. Objectives The aim of this study was to explore how genetically-derived representations of dispersal affect assessments of environmental change impacts using a spatially-explicit population modelling approach. We illustrated the utility of this approach to test hypotheses related to the effects of dispersal representation and environmental change for the IUCN-threatened Blanding's Turtle (Emydoidea blandingii). Methods We integrated existing demographic and genetic datasets into a spatially-explicit metapopulation modelling framework. We ran several sets of simulations with varying dispersal representations (distance-based, landscape resistance-based with either static or changing land cover) to explore how landscape genetic estimates of connectivity impact estimates of extinction risk. Results Models incorporating land cover-based dispersal resulted in lower patch occupancy than simulations where dispersal was only a function of interpatch distance. Furthermore, both climate change-induced declines in habitat suitability and land use change-induced declines in connectivity reduced abundance and patch occupancy. Conclusions Incorporating landscape genetics into population models revealed that choices involved in dispersal representation alter both extinction risk and path occupancy, often altering the distribution of extant patches by the end of simulations. As technological advances continue to increase access to landscape genetic datasets, we suggest that researchers carefully consider how genetic resources can be used to improve climate vulnerability assessments.

AB Background The Mexican hand tree or Canac (Chiranthodendron pentadactylon) is a temperate tree species of cloud and pine-oak forests of southern Mexico and Guatemala. Its characteristic hand-shaped flower is used in folk medicine and has constituted the iconic symbol of the Sociedad Botanica de Mexico since 1940. Here, the evolutionary history of this species was estimated through phylogeographic analyses of nuclear DNA sequences obtained through restriction site associated DNA sequencing and ecological niche modeling. Total genomic DNA was extracted from leaf samples obtained from a representative number (5 to 10 per sampling site) of individuals distributed along the species geographic range. In Mexico, population is comprised by spatially isolated individuals which may follow the trends of cloud forest fragmentation. By contrast, in Guatemala Chiranthodendron may constitute a canopy dominant species near the Acatenango volcano. The distributional range of this species encompasses geographic provinces separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The objectives of the study were to: (i) estimate its genetic structure to define whether the observed range disjunction exerted by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec translates into separate populations, (ii) link population divergence timing and demographic trends to historical climate change, and (iii) test hypotheses related to Pleistocene refugia. Results Patterns of genetic diversity indicated high levels of genetic differentiation between populations separated by the Isthmus. The western and eastern population diverged approximately 0.873 Million years ago (Ma). Demographic analyses supported a simultaneous split from an ancestral population and rapid expansion from a small stock approximately 0.2 Ma corresponding to a glacial period. The populations have remained stable since the LIG (130 Kilo years ago (Ka)). Species distribution modelling (SDM) predicted a decrease in potential distribution in the Last Interglacial (LIG) and an increase during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (22 Ka), Mid-Holocene (6 Ka) and present times. Conclusions Divergence time estimations support the hypothesis that populations represent Quaternary relict elements of a species with broader and northernmost distribution. Pleistocene climatic shifts exerted major influence on the distribution of populations allowing dispersion during episodes of suitable climatic conditions and structuring during the first interglacial with a time period length of 100 Kilo years (Kyr) and the vicariant influence of the Isthmus. Limited demographic expansion and population connectivity during the LGM supports the moist forest hypothesis model.

AB Background A number of hypotheses and theories, such as the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, have been proposed to explain the natural maintenance of biodiversity in tropical and temperate forest ecosystems. However, to date the details of the processes behind this natural maintenance are still unclear. Recently two new nearest-neighbour characteristics were proposed and in this paper we demonstrate how they can contribute to a better understanding of the ontogenesis of global forest structure from localised neighbourhoods. Methods We applied the new species and size segregation functions together with appropriate test procedures to four example woodland data sets from China at Daqingshan, Jiaohe, Jiulongshan and Xiaolongshan forest regions. In addition we quantified the morphology of the new characteristics and modelled a neighbourhood allometric coefficient linking the two functions. Results The results revealed quite different species segregation patterns with both conspecific and heterospecific attraction. We found these to be generally matched by equivalent size segregation patterns of attraction of similar and different sizes. It was straightforward to model the size segregation function from the knowledge of the species segregation function by estimating a neighbourhood allometric coefficient. Conclusions The new characteristics have helped to quantify the extent and rate of decline of neighbourhood interactions in terms of spatial species and size diversity. Through the allometric neighbourhood coefficient the analysis highlighted once more how closely related species and size segregation are, thus supporting the mingling-size hypothesis. Using both a traditional and a restricted random-labelling test has provided a valuable tool for understanding the exact nature of species-mingling and size-inequality relationships.

AB Exploitative competition implies an indirect interaction in which a resource exploited by one species is not available for another; e.g., when species share diet or habitat. It plays a key role in community structure and dynamics. Here we evaluated the niche overlap between the exotic aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) and the native Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) where the species coexist in the Iberian Peninsula, along two main dimensions, the trophic niche and the environmental niche. Then we assessed the spatial segregation of the species. We expected that if a niche overlap was high, competition could drive spatial segregation to allow co-existence. We analyzed their trophic niche overlap by using the content of stable isotopes delta N-15 and delta C-13 in the hair of both species. To establish environmental niche competition, we compared the similarity in their habitat, estimated by environmental niche models based on the fine-scale presence records of each species obtained from field surveys. To test if spatial segregation occurred, we analyzed both species' co-occurrence. Our results indicated that both species shared a similar trophic niche measured by stable isotopes, both species showed a similar distribution of suitable areas, and that both species' environmental niches were more similar than expected. Finally, a negative spatial association was found between the aoudad and Iberian ibex. These results reveal that both species are ecologically similar and suggest that fine-scale spatial segregation might have favoured their co-existence in semiarid Mediterranean mountains. Our results show that integrating information on trophic and environmental niche overlap with fine scale spatial distribution might improve the study of competitive interactions among wild ungulates.

AB Current evidence suggests that tree-fall gaps can influence forest structure and dynamics by enabling certain species guilds to persist over the long term. Here we assessed the development of local size hierarchies and asymmetric competition for light in tree-fall gaps, and the role played by these two processes for the persistence of rare light-demanding species in the Barro Colorado Island Forest Dynamics Plot (Panama). We performed spatial point pattern analysis, considering both the spatial locations (x,y) and the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all the woody plant recruits from the 1985 and 2000 censuses located in tree-fall gaps, and followed their fate up to the 1990-2010 and 2005-2010 censuses, respectively. For these two recruit cohorts, we found that, from the initial census until 5-10 yr later, close neighbors presented a larger DBH than the mean DBH of all individuals within gaps, which points to a positive growth response of recruits to the increased light levels in the gap centers. However, close neighbors of the 1985 cohort also showed larger than expected DBH differences that disappeared in subsequent censuses, indicating an enhancement of size differences between neighbors and the mortality of the smaller individuals. Finally, for both recruit cohorts, we found that 10-15 yr after gap formation, surviving individuals of rare light-demanding species had a negative impact on survival of neighboring individuals of other species. Our results indicate that gaps favor the persistence of rare light-demanding species through the development of local size hierarchies and asymmetric competition for light. The strength of this process, however, apparently depends upon gap size and the role played by the woody plants already existing at the time of gap formation in early colonization. Moreover, our findings suggest that in this forest, gaps may enhance colonization of plant species typical of nearby dry tropical areas, and that, over the coming decades, similar processes could strongly modify the structure and dynamics of moist tropical forests in the region.

AB Regulation of energy and water balance are primary components of homeostasis in all organisms. But the processes associated with such homeostasis can be costly and affect the fitness of individuals. As a result, individuals from variable environments are expected to invest more in compensatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis than individuals from stable environments. Grammostola quirogai and Grammostola anthracina are two spiders of the Theraphosidae family that live in rocky-hill habitats in the Pampas ecoregion. Both species inhabit mesic environments with moderate rainy weather but different precipitation variability. G. quirogai only exists in rocky-hill habitats surrounded by prairies, far from oceanic and estuarine coasts. These habitats are exposed to higher and more variable precipitation rates due to a stronger influence of El Nino. In contrast, G. anthracina lives in areas with less heterogeneous precipitation rates, and its populations expand up to the Atlantic coast. In this study, we used these two species to explore the impacts of water deprivation on their metabolic rate and water loss. We did not detect changes in metabolic rate or differences in water loss as a result of a water restriction treatment in any of the species. However, the mean total values of evaporative water loss for our studied species were lower than that of xeric species. These results provide evidence that the total evaporative water loss in tarantulas may not be related to environmental characteristics, as it has been widely reported among insect species.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) has been highlighted as a main driver of biodiversity maintenance. However, while there is general consensus on the scale-dependent and interacting nature of ecological processes, there is limited knowledge about the relative importance of CNDD across spatial scales and on its interaction with other processes, such as dispersal and immigration. While many studies have detected CNDD at local scales, it remains unknown whether its effects on biodiversity maintenance scale-up to landscapes and regions. Here, we use a generic dynamic and spatially-explicit simulation model to assess the interacting relative effects of local-scale CNDD and immigration from a metacommunity for biodiversity maintenance across spatial scales. For this purpose, we systematically varied immigration rates, the average strength and the variation of CNDD among species. We found that CNDD only determined species richness in strongly isolated communities with little or no interspecific variation in CNDD. In closed communities, plausible interspecific variation in CNDD led to a strong reduction in species richness. In open communities, realistic levels of immigration overwhelmed the effects of CNDD on diversity maintenance. From these results, we suggest that local CNDD is unlikely to be a main driver of biodiversity in real communities, especially at larger spatial scales. This study provides a first step towards improved integration of local-scale coexistence theory with large-scale metacommunity theory and highlights the importance of considering the interacting and scale-dependent nature of ecological processes.

AB Much of the research in biology aims to understand the origin of diversity. Naturally, ecological diversity was the first object of study, but we now have the necessary tools to probe diversity at molecular scales. The inherent differences in how we study diversity at different scales caused the disciplines of biology to be organized around these levels, from molecular biology to ecology. Here, we illustrate that there are key properties of each scale that emerge from the interactions of simpler components and that these properties are often shared across different levels of organization. This means that ideas from one level of organization can be an inspiration for novel hypotheses to study phenomena at another level. We illustrate this concept with examples of events at the molecular level that have analogs at the organismal or ecological level and vice versa. Through these examples, we illustrate that biological processes at different organization levels are governed by general rules. The study of the same phenomena at different scales could enrich our work through a multidisciplinary approach, which should be a staple in the training of future scientists.

AB The fragmentation and transformation of land cover modify the microclimate of ecosystems. These changes have the potential to modify the foraging activity of animals, but few studies have examined this topic. In this study, we investigated whether and how the foraging activity of the leaf-cutter ant Atta cephalotes is modified by microclimatic variations due to land cover change from forest to pasture. We characterized the microclimate of each habitat and identified alterations in foraging behavior in response to relative humidity (RH), air temperature, and surface temperature along ant foraging trails by synchronously assessing foraging activity (number of ants per 5 min including incoming laden and unladen and outgoing ants) and microclimatic variables (air temperature, RH, and maximum and minimum surface temperature along the foraging trail). There were climatic differences between habitats during the day but not throughout the night, and A. cephalotes was found to have a high tolerance for foraging under severe microclimatic changes. This species can forage at surface temperatures between 17 and 45 degrees C, air temperatures between 20 and 36 degrees C, and an RH between 40% and 100%. We found a positive effect of temperature on the foraging activity of A. cephalotes in the pasture, where the species displayed thermophilic behavior and the ability to forage across a wide range of temperatures and RH. These results provide a mechanism to partially explain why A. cephalotes becomes highly prolific as anthropogenic disturbances increase and why it has turned into a key player of human-modified neotropical landscapes.

AB Understanding the role of N-fixing leguminous trees for phosphorus (P) cycling in highly weathered tropical soils is relevant for the conservation of natural forests as well as the sustainable management of agroforests and forest plantations with low P input in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. We hypothesized that N-fixing leguminous trees can increase the availability of soil P by exploiting different P sources without causing a depletion of soil organic P due to efficient biogeochemical cycling, but empirical evidence remains scarce. For this purpose, P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) was used for quantifying soil P forms and the Hedley sequential extraction to determine soil P fractions. The studied sites were forestry systems with leguminous trees: mixed forest plantations with different proportions of fast-growing N-fixing leguminous trees; pure plantations, and agroforestry systems with leguminous trees The results show that all N-fixing leguminous trees and N mineral fertilization positively affected the concentrations of available soil P in relation to the control treatments. There were increases of all P fractions through cycling in all forest sites. P-31 NMR spectra clearly identified and quantified that a large amount of phosphomonoesters followed by phosphodiesters in the form of DNA, as well as high reserves of P, species (orthu-P and pyrophosphate) in the first eleven years of growth at pure plantations, mixed plantations or agroforests. The relations between both orthu-P and DNA with the resin-P-i, NaHCO3-P-i, and NaOH-P-i, fractions suggest that both analysis methods provide complementary information about the soil P transformations. Thus, the paper highlights the importance of the use of different N-fixing leguminous tree species under different environmental conditions, production systems and management practices for recovering heavily degraded areas, which may be a suitable strategy through efficient management of P in highly weathered tropical soils in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome.

AB Analyses characterizing canopy gaps are required to improve our understanding of spatial and structural variations in forest canopies and provide insight into ecosystem-level successional processes. Gap size frequency distributions (GSFD) are indicative of ecological processes and disturbance patterns. To date, GSFD in boreal forest ecosystems have not been systematically quantified over large areas using a single consistent data source. Herein we characterized GSFDs across the entirety of the Canadian boreal forest using transects of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. ALS transects were representatively sampled within eight distinct Canadian boreal ecozones. Gaps were detected and delineated from the ALS-derived canopy height model as contiguous canopy openings >= 8 m(2) with canopy heights <= 3m. Gaps were then stratified by ecozone and forest type (i.e. coniferous, broadleaf, mixedwood, wetland-treed), and combinations thereof, and GSFDs were calculated for each stratum. GSFDs were characterized by the scaling parameter of the power-law probability distribution, lambda (lambda) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirmed that GSFDs for each stratum followed a power-law distribution. Pairwise comparisons between ecozones, forest types, and combinations thereof indicated significant differences between estimates of lambda. Scaling parameters were found to be more variable by ecozone (1.96-2.31) than by forest type (2.15-2.21). These results contrast those of similar studies done in tropical forest environments, whereby lambda was found to be relatively consistent across a range of site types, geological substrates, and forest types. The geographic range considered herein is much larger than that of previous studies, and broad-scale patterns in climate, landforms, and soils that are reflected in the definition of unique ecozones, likely also influence gap characteristics.

AB Despite claims of an insect decline worldwide, our understanding of extinction risk in insects is incomplete. Using bionomic data of all odonate (603 dragonflies and damselflies) North American species, we assessed (i) regional extinction risk and whether this is related to local extirpation; (ii) whether these two patterns are similar altitudinally and latitudinally; and (iii) the areas of conservation concern. We used geographic range size as a predictor of regional extinction risk and body size, thermal limits and habitat association as predictors of local extirpation. We found that (i) greater regional extinction risk is related to narrow thermal limits, lotic habitat use and large body size (this in damselflies but not dragonflies); (ii) southern species are more climate tolerant but with more limited geographic range size than northern species; and (iii) two priority areas for odonate conservation are the cold temperate to sub-boreal northeastern USA and the transversal neo-volcanic system. Our approach can be used to estimate insect extinction risk as it compensates for the lack of abundance data.

AB Nearly 20% of tropical forests are within 100 m of a nonforest edge, a consequence of rapid deforestation for agriculture. Despite widespread conversion, roughly 1.2 billion ha of tropical forest remain, constituting the largest terrestrial component of the global carbon budget. Effects of deforestation on carbon dynamics in remnant forests, and spatial variation in underlying changes in structure and function at the plant scale, remain highly uncertain. Using airborne imaging spectroscopy and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, we mapped and quantified changes in forest structure and foliar characteristics along forest/oil palm boundaries in Malaysian Borneo to understand spatial and temporal variation in the influence of edges on aboveground carbon and associated changes in ecosystem structure and function. We uncovered declines in aboveground carbon averaging 22% along edges that extended over 100 m into the forest. Aboveground carbon losses were correlated with significant reductions in canopy height and leaf mass per area and increased foliar phosphorus, three plant traits related to light capture and growth. Carbon declines amplified with edge age. Our results indicate that carbon losses along forest edges can arise from multiple, distinct effects on canopy structure and function that vary with edge age and environmental conditions, pointing to a need for consideration of differences in ecosystem sensitivity when developing land-use and conservation strategies. Our findings reveal that, although edge effects on ecosystem structure and function vary, forests neighboring agricultural plantations are consistently vulnerable to long-lasting negative effects on fundamental ecosystem characteristics controlling primary productivity and carbon storage.

AB Traditionally, most studies have described the organization of host-parasite interaction networks by considering only few host groups at limited geographical extents. However, host-parasite relationships are merged within different taxonomic groups and factors shaping these interactions likely differ between host and parasite groups, making group-level differences important to better understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these interactive communities.
   Here we used a dataset of 629 ectoparasite species and 251 species of terrestrial mammals, comprising 10 orders distributed across the Nearctic and Neotropical regions of Mexico to assess the species-level drivers of mammalian ectoparasite faunas. Specifically, we evaluated whether body weight, geographical range size and within-range mammal species richness (i.e. diversity field) predict mammal ectoparasite species richness (i.e. degree centrality) and their closeness centrality within the mammal-ectoparasite network. In addition, we also tested if the observed patterns differ among mammal orders and if taxonomic closely related host mammals could more likely share the same set of ectoparasites.
   We found that ectoparasite species richness of small mammals (mainly rodents) with large proportional range sizes was high compared to large-bodied mammals, whereas the diversity field of mammals had no predictive value (except for bats). We also observed that taxonomic proximity was a main determinant of the probability to share ectoparasite species. Specifically, the probability to share ectoparasites in congeneric species reached up to 90% and decreased exponentially as the taxonomic distance increased.
   Further, we also detected that some ectoparasites are generalists and capable to infect mammalian species across different orders and that rodents have a remarkable role in the network structure, being closely connected to many other taxa.
   Hence, because many rodent species have synanthropic habits they could act as undesired reservoirs of disease agents for humans and urban animals. Considering the reported worldwide phenomenon of the proliferation of rodents accompanying the demographic decrease or even local extinction of large-bodied mammal species, these organisms may already be an increasing health threat in many regions of the world.

AB Miombo woodlands cover a large part of Southern Africa and contribute an important wood source for the local wood industry. The already observed and further predicted changes in climatic patterns can be expected to affect the wood properties of Miombo tree species. The diameter growth response to climatic variables related to water availability and temperature of three Miombo woodland tree species (Brachystegia spiciformis, Burkea africana and Isoberlinia angolensis) was analysed using 245 trees samples in three climatic zones in Zambia. Sites were chosen to represent the range of site conditions under which these species grow in the Miombo woodlands of Zambia. The study sites differed in moisture availability and average temperature, as indicated by De Martonne's aridity index. Tree-ring width correlated with site conditions and differed significantly between sites. A positive correlation was found between mean annual precipitation and annual ring width, as well as growth variation, while growth was almost non-responsive to temperature variations. For all three species, trees growing on the outer limits of the species' range were found to be more responsive and sensitive to variability in annual rainfall than those growing under optimal conditions. All three species showed significant variation in inter-annual ring width with environmental conditions. Water availability was found to have a much larger effect than temperature, especially on drier sites.

AB Persistent forest loss in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) is responsible for carbon emission, reduction of ecosystem services, and loss of biodiversity. Combining spatial data analysis with high spatial resolution data for forest cover and forest loss, we quantified the spatial and temporal patterns of forest dynamics in the BLA. We identified an alarming trend of increasing deforestation, with especially high rates in 2016 and 2017. Moreover, the creation of forest cover fragments is faster than ever due to decreasing size and dispersion of forest loss patches. From 2001 to 2017, the number of large forest loss patches decreased significantly, accompanied by a reduction in the size of these patches. Enforcement of field inspections and of initiatives to promote forest conservation will be required to stop this trend.

AB Ecological disturbance is an important factor that influences the abundance and distribution of species. Treefalls are a prominent source of disturbance in tropical forests, but robust characterization of community change after treefalls requires baseline data that are often not available. We capitalized on 25 yr of avian mark-recapture data from a lowland moist forest in central Panama to investigate the timescale of colonization and persistence of birds in a newly formed treefall gap. We compared bird species assemblages pre- and post-treefall to explore how the disturbance affected specific foraging guilds and overall assemblage structure (abundance and alpha diversity). We documented rapid colonization (i.e., within five months post-treefall) of the treefall gap by birds. Abundance and alpha diversity increased following the treefall, but both remained relatively constant in a nearby control plot. At the guild level, frugivores spiked in abundance and nectarivores (i.e., hummingbirds) increased in alpha diversity following the treefall. These results are in agreement with those of previous spatial studies of gap dynamics and suggest that certain tropical frugivores and nectarivores have a remarkable ability to rapidly find and exploit preferred resources and microhabitats embedded in a landscape matrix. Assemblage abundance and alpha diversity decreased back to pre-treefall levels within 1 and 4 yr of the treefall, respectively. Thus, even large gaps may provide only ephemeral benefits, highlighting the importance of periodic disturbance for landscape-level persistence of species that use gaps.

AB Understanding how fire affects the plant biota of the Cerrado is essential for formulating conservational strategies. We evaluated the effects of fires during different periods of the year on the populational structure of Anacardium humile .The research was carried out in areas of typical cerrado stricto sensu in the territory of the Kalunga, state of Goias, Brazil. These areas, which comprise the same population, were submitted to the following treatments: unburned (control), burned in May 2016 (early fire - EF), and burned in September 2016 (late fire - LF). In July 2018, we delimited two contiguous transects of 100 x 20 m, subdivided into 10 plots of 20 x 20 m, in each area. Fire stimulated the development of branches from basal regrowth in EF and LF. No differences were found in height and diameter of individuals among LF, EF, and the control area. Individuals of EF had size patterns similar to the control individuals, indicating a lesser effect of early fire. The greatest differences regarding all significant parameters were found between LF and control individuals. Early prescribed fires, depending on periodicity, may be less harmful to A. humile.

AB Trichoderma spp. are an alternative to increase plant growth and as biological control agents of diseases. Biochar added to soil and Trichoderma can result in the enhancement of crop development and can aid in preventing fertilizer run-off, improving plant health, retaining soil moisture, and helping plants through drought periods. However, a knowledge gap remains regarding the combined effect of biochar and Trichoderma on soil quality and crop growth. The objective of the present study was to evaluate this combined effect and show a new approach of biochar as a route of T aureoviride (T) inoculation. We evaluated three sources of biochar, bean husks, coffee grounds, and coffee husks, with or without T and an additional control that was devoid of biochar and T. The association of all biochar sources with T showed a significant increase in watermelon growth and soil quality. Biochar coffee grounds with T increased urease, beta-glucosidase, and total organic carbon, showing the potential of this combination in these processes. Watermelon plants cultivated in soil with coffee ground biochar and T showed plant length and shoot dry biomass increases of 129% and 192%, respectively. Thus, this study found that biochar use plays an important role in the effectiveness of T. aureoviride applications and is a new instrument for sustainable agriculture.

AB A central question of community ecology is to understand how the interplay between processes of the Neutral Theory (e.g., immigration and ecological drift) and niche-based processes (e.g., environmental filtering, intra- and interspecific density dependence) shape species diversity in competitive communities. The articulation between these two categories of mechanisms can be studied through the lens of the intermediate organizational level of "functional groups" (FGs), defined as clusters of species with similar traits. Indeed, FGs stress ecological differences among species and are thus likely to unravel non-neutral interactions within communities. Here we presented a novel approach to explore how FGs affect species coexistence by comparing species and functional diversity patterns. Our framework considers the Neutral Theory as a mechanistic null hypothesis. It assesses how much the functional diversity deviates from species diversity in communities, and compares this deviation, called the "average functional deviation," to a neutral baseline. We showed that the average functional deviation can indicate reduced negative density dependence or environmental filtering among FGs. We validated our framework using simulations illustrating the two situations. We further analyzed tropical tree communities in Western Ghats, India. Our analysis of the average functional deviation revealed environmental filtering between deciduous and evergreen FGs along a broad rainfall gradient. By contrast, we did not find clear evidence for reduced density dependence among FGs. We predict that applying our approach to new case studies where environmental gradients are milder and FGs are more clearly associated to resource partitioning should reveal the missing pattern of reduced density dependence among FGs.

AB Mandevilla manicorensis (Apocynaceae) is here described and illustrated. We also include photo plates, a distribution map, taxonomic comments, and morphological similarities with other species. It is similar to M. rugellosa, but differs by its broader bracts, longer sepals, and orange corolla lobes. A dichotomous key is provided for the species of Mandevilla group "Exothostemon" with hypocrateriform corollas and foliaceous bracts in South America.

AB The Amazon houses a large proportion of the overall biodiversity currently found on Earth. Despite that, our knowledge of Amazonian biodiversity is still limited. In this study, we reconstruct the phylogeny of Pachyptera (Bignoniaceae), a genus of neotropical lianas that is centered in the Amazon. We then use this phylogenetic framework to re-evaluate species limits and study the biogeographic history of the genus. We sampled three molecular markers (i.e. ndhF, rpl32-trnL, and PepC) and 51 individuals representing the breadth of morphological variation and geographic distribution of all species recognized in the genus. We used this information to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among individuals of Pachyptera using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. The resulting molecular phylogeny was used as a basis to test species limits within the P. kerere species complex using a cpDNA coalescent approach (GMYC). GMYC identified five potential species within the P. kerere species complex that were subsequently evaluated in the light of morphology. Morphological data supported the recognition of four of the five potential species suggested by GMYC, all of which were also supported by a multispecies coalescent model in a Bayesian framework. The phylogeny of Pachyptera was time-calibrated and used to reconstruct the biogeographical history of the genus. We identified historically important migration pathways using our comprehensive cpDNA dataset and a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) framework. Our results indicate that the genus originated in lowland Amazonia during the Middle Eocene, and subsequently occupied Central America and the Andes. Most of the diversification of Pachyptera occurred in the Miocene, a period of intense perturbations in South America.

AB Gains achieved by conservation interventions such as payments for environmental services (PES) may be lost upon termination of the program, a problem known as permanence. However, there have been few efforts to evaluate the permanence of conservation results. This article examines the permanence of land-use changes induced by a short-term PES program implemented between 2003 and 2008 in Matiguas-Rio Blanco, Nicaragua. Under this program, PES had induced substantial adoption of silvopastoral practices. To assess the long-term permanence of these changes, participants were resurveyed in 2012, 4 years after the last payment was made. We find that the land-use changes that had been induced by PES were broadly sustained in intervening years, with minor differences across specific practices and subgroups of participants. The patterns of change in the period after the PES program were completed to help us understand the reasons for the program's success and rule out alternative explanations for the program's success. Our results suggest that, at least in the case of productive land uses such as silvopastoral practices, PES programs can be effective at encouraging land owners to adopt environmentally beneficial practices and that the benefits will persist after payments cease.

AB Southwestern Brazilian Amazonia has suffered intense forest conversion in a short period of time (similar to 60 years) and deforestation is ongoing. Around 70% of the deforested area has been designated for cattle ranching. This forest clearing and pasture establishment is abruptly disrupting the functioning of the ecosystem. In this paper, we provide an overview of the effects of land conversion from forest to pasture on the soil and aquatic systems. Forest conversion to pasture has two clear effects: a) an on-site effect on the hillslope domain and 2) an off-site effect on the river system. The conversion of forest to pasture affects the soil physical-chemical properties, soil carbon content, water resources, and aquatic system. However, many of these changes are not straightforward or obvious. For example, in some conditions, the soil carbon stock increases in pasture. Despite the advances in our understanding of the effects of land conversion on environmental processes, knowledge gaps persist, and we identify some research needs.

AB Analysis of the structure, diversity, and demographic dynamics of tree assemblages in tropical forests is especially important in order to evaluate local and regional successional trajectories.
   We conducted a long-term study to investigate how the structure, species richness, and diversity of secondary tropical forests change over time. Trees (DBH >= 5 cm) in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil were sampled twice during a 10-year period (2007 and 2017) in six stands (1 ha each) that varied in age from their last disturbance (25, 60, 75, 90, and more than 100 years). We compared forest structure (abundance and basal area), species richness, alpha diversity, demographic rates (mortality, recruitment, and loss or gain in basal area), species composition, spatial beta diversity, and temporal beta diversity (based on turnover and nestedness indices) among stand ages and study years.
   Demographic rates recorded in a 10-year interval indicate a rapid and dynamic process of species substitution and structural changes. Structural recovery occurred faster than beta diversity and species composition recovery. The successional gradient showed a pattern of species trade-off over time, with less spatial dissimilarity and faster demographic rates in younger stands. As stands grow older, they show larger spatial turnover of species than younger stands, making them more stochastic in relation to species composition. Stands appear to split chronologically to some extent, but not across a straightforward linear axis, reflecting stochastic changes, providing evidence for the formation of a nonequilibrium community.
   Policy implications. These results reiterate the complexity and variability in forest succession and serve as a reference for the evaluation and monitoring of local management and conservation actions and for defining regional strategies that consider the diversity of local successional trajectories to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures in secondary forests of the Atlantic Forest biome.

AB Habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation have pervasive detrimental effects on tropical forest biodiversity, but the role of the surrounding land use (i.e., matrix) in determining the severity of these impacts remains poorly understood. We surveyed bird species across an interior-edge-matrix gradient to assess the effects of matrix type on biodiversity at 49 different sites with varying levels of landscape fragmentation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest-a highly threatened biodiversity hotspot. Both area and edge effects were more pronounced in forest patches bordering pasture matrix, whereas patches bordering Eucalyptus plantation maintained compositionally similar bird communities between the edge and the interior and exhibited reduced effects of patch size. These results suggest the type of matrix in which forest fragments are situated can explain a substantial amount of the widely reported variability in biodiversity responses to forest loss and fragmentation.

AB Less than half of the original two million square kilometers of the Cerrado vegetation remains standing, and there are still many uncertainties as to how to conserve and prioritize remaining areas effectively. A key limitation is the continuing lack of geographically-extensive evaluation of ecosystem-level properties across the biome. Here we sought to address this gap by comparing the woody vegetation of the typical cerrado of the Cerrado-Amazonia Transition with that of the core area of the Cerrado in terms of both tree diversity and vegetation biomass. We used 21 one-hectare plots in the transition and 18 in the core to compare key structural parameters (tree height, basal area, and above-ground biomass), and diversity metrics between the regions. We also evaluated the effects of temperature and precipitation on biomass, as well as explored the species diversity versus biomass relationship. We found, for the first time, both that the typical cerrado at the transition holds substantially more biomass than at the core, and that higher temperature and greater precipitation can explain this difference. By contrast, plot-level alpha diversity was almost identical in the two regions. Finally, contrary to some theoretical expectations, we found no positive relationship between species diversity and biomass for the Cerrado woody vegetation. This has implications for the development of effective conservation measures, given that areas with high biomass and importance for the compensation of greenhouse gas emissions are often not those with the greatest diversity.

AB Ants are immensely important predators in terrestrial ecosystems but surprisingly little is reported on their role in bee predation. Here, we describe the ant Pogonomyrmex subnitidus Emery, 1895 foraging at a bee nest aggregation in Utah. Many instances were observed of P. subnitidus, and another ant, Pheidole clydei Gregg, 1950, scavenging on the nests of the recently-described bee Anthophora pueblo Orr, 2016, which nests in sandstone. One worker ant of P. subnitidus was also observed taking a live bee larva back to its nest, indicating that the ants occasionally act as predators. The existence of nocturnal foraging in P. subntidus demonstrates greater temporal foraging plasticity than prior reports of bimodal foraging strategy during the day. Potential drivers of this behavior and the relation of these two new ant associates to the bees are discussed.

AB There are several factors that can determine the pattern of habitat use by species in fragmented habitats. Here we investigated the applicability of the continuum model, which predicts that habitat use varies in a continuous way and not categorically like habitat and not-habitat, for small mammal habitat use. We also investigated if habitat-related guilds of species can change their habitual pattern of habitat use in an extremely altered landscape. This study was conducted in a highly fragmented area of Atlantic Forest in Brazil, where forest fragments are immersed in a pasture matrix. We captured mammals using pitfall traps placed in six sampling sites. In each of these sites, we selected four of five different habitats that were available in the local landscape: high-elevation forests without stream, low-elevation forests with stream, forest edges, pasture matrix without stream, and pasture matrix with stream. This study revealed that the theory of the continuum model can be applied for investigating patterns of use of fragmented forests by small mammals. We also observed, in general, low tolerance of forest species to the most disturbed habitat, the pasture matrix without stream. However, a small increase in the complexity of the vegetation, as observed in riparian pasture matrices, seems to mitigate this negative effect, making the abundance, richness, and diversity of small mammals comparable to forest habitats. These results indicate that the presence of streams may facilitate the use of the pasture matrix, contributing for the maintenance of the original community in the fragmented forest.

TI What influences upland soil chemistry in the Amazon basin, Brazil?

AB Increasing land transformation in the Amazon basin, from forest to post-forest usage such as pastureland, agriculture and agroforestry, triggers significant changes in hydrology, soil fertility and regional climatology. However, relatively little is known about Amazon basin soil chemistry in general and about its possible alteration with recent land-use change.
   We present robust pedogeochemical data for 65 elements and oxides, and evidence for modification due to recent deforestation and post-forest land use on upland soils in Amazonas state, Brazil. Differences emerge in median element concentrations between these two land-cover types, and between central and southern parts of the basin. These new data, a product of the bi-national EcoRespira-Amazon (ERA) project, are based on triplicate sampling under different seasonal conditions at 29 sites, representing ca. 740,000 km(2) and average annual meteorological conditions. Mineral soil samples (TOP: 0-20 cm; BOT: 30-50 cm) characterize the active upper rhizosphere. Data were obtained with very tight quality control from sampling to analysis (following GEMAS protocols), using various overlapping analytical methods. Some major, minor and trace element concentrations deviate strongly from established world soil averages, including the recent PEGS2.
   Geological (lithological) and weathering boundary conditions define the primary soil chemical signal. This is overprinted by biogeochemical forces (ecosystem feedbacks), and recently by human intervention (change of land cover, deforestation). The general assumption of depleted tropical soils is not justified as such - a more differentiated view is needed, since carbon and macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous, albeit not always plant-available, do often occur in relatively high concentrations (median values TOP: 1.9, 0.15 and 0.02 wt%). Calcium, magnesium and potassium are truly depleted (median values TOP: 0.025, 0.095 and 0.065 wt%), albeit with noticeable variance. Trace elements, from silver to zirconium and including REE, show highly differentiated responses. Most are relatively enriched in post-forest soils; a subtle signal that is interpreted as reduced plant-soil interaction. BOT concentrations are generally higher than those in TOP soil, reflecting weathering conditions and biogeochemical cycling - with interesting exceptions (Br, Cd, Rb).

AB Decreasing landscape connectivity, due to habitat loss and agricultural expansion, is a threat for species movement and other flux-dependent ecological processes. Tree cover within the agricultural matrix provides perching sites, dispersal routes, and extra habitat for animals. Isolated trees and living fences in tropical pastures add structural complexity to actual matrices, but their role in landscape connectivity is undervalued. Our main objective was to assess the potential value of small (<= 1ha) woody patches for maintaining landscape connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes using birds as focal species. We used high-resolution images and LIDAR data to classify different tree cover types. We assess the probability of connectivity for different hypothetical dispersal distances between woody patches, using a graph-theoretic approach and simulating scenarios that differed in tree cover composition. We estimated the impacts and contribution of tree cover class removals on landscape connectivity. The connectivity index increased widely among scenarios with increasing tree cover composition. The highest connectivity value was obtained in the scenario that included all arboreal elements currently present in the matrix. Small wooded patches and isolated trees contributed from 26% to 59% to overall connectivity. The presence of small (<= 1ha) patches of tree cover greatly enhance landscape connectivity for animals with low vagility and behavioral limitations on crossing gaps. Isolated trees and living fences play a crucial role in increasing habitat reachability within rural landscapes and ensuring and enhancing connectivity for animals that perform daily-movements at short-distances. The spatial distribution of arboreal elements within landscapes could be optimized to increase connectivity and must be considered in conservation planning.

AB Soil diazotrophs have been known to be essential in biological nitrogen (N) fixation, which contributes to the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. However, there remains an inadequacy of research on the effects of different N inputs from N fertilization and from symbiotic N fixation associated with legumes on the diazotroph communities in agricultural ecosystems. Hence, we investigated the variations in diazotroph abundance and community composition as well as the soil properties with different N inputs in the Guimu-1 hybrid elephant grass cultivation on karst soils in China. We conducted six different N treatments: control, Amorpha fruticosa planting at a spacing of 1.5 x 2 m (AFD1), A. fruticosa planting at a spacing of 1 x 2 m (AFD2), N fertilization (N), A. fruticosa planting at a spacing of 1.5 x 2 m with N fertilization (AFD1N), and A. fruticosa planting at a spacing of 1 x 2 m with N fertilization (AFD2N). Our results showed that the interaction between sampling time and N fertilization significantly affected the diazotroph abundance. In July, the diazotroph abundance significantly decreased in the N fertilization treatments: N, AFD1N, and AFD2N, compared to that in the control. The richness and Chaol estimator of diazotrophs significantly increased in AFD2N and AFD1 correspondingly in December and July, relative to those in the control. Co-occurrence networks showed species-species interactions with high negative correlations that occurred more in the control than in the N input plots. The N input from N fertilization and legume planting directly increased the ammonium N and nitrate N and consequently affected the dissolved organic N and pH of the soil, thereby altering the diazotroph abundance and richness. Our findings demonstrated that both N fertilization and legumes could reduce the interspecific competition among diazotroph species by providing greater N availability in the forage grass.

AB Rich in both microbial mat biomass and species diversity, the meltwater ponds of the McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS) form important biodiversity and productivity elements in an otherwise barren landscape. These ponds are thought to be sensitive indicators of climate change-driven fluxes in pond water balance but our ability to predict such effects is confounded by our poor understanding of the inherent variability of these communities in response to the physico-chemical environment. Understanding how microbial communities are shaped across broad physico-chemical gradients may allow better predictions of the effects of climate change on the MIS wetlands. Our study found that distinct clustering of community types against environmental variables was apparent for both the diatom and cyanobacterial communities. For diatoms, conductivity was correlated with the separation of five significantly distinct communities. Significant differences in NH4-N concentrations were correlated to the three distinct cyanobacterial communities but many of the cyanobacteria morphotypes were recorded across a wide ecological range. More distinct community types suggested that diatoms were more sensitive to environmental change in these ponds than the cyanobacteria, despite the latter's overall dominance. Distinct community clusters for diatoms, and to a lesser extent cyanobacteria, suggest that changes at a functional group level may be more important than at the level of individual species. Further understanding of diatom functional groups would provide us with the opportunity to hindcast past climates and water budgets within the Antarctic region. However, the disconnect between biomass and community composition currently prevents hindcasting past productivities in relation to environmental changes.

AB Despite the impacts of economic growth uncertainty, few studies have explicitly focused on how payments for ecosystem services (PES) can account for uncertainty in their benefits and costs caused by economic growth fluctuations. The objective of our study was to identify spatial targets for county-level PES by maximizing the expected future cost efficiency of ecological benefits under two growth scenarios and compare them with counties targeted during baseline years (i.e., 2001, 2006, and 2011) without considering growth uncertainty. Results using a case study of forest-based carbon storage in the Central and Southern Appalachian region show that spatial targeting based on estimates of carbon-cost efficiency for baseline years is significantly different from spatial targeting based on expected future carbon-cost efficiency. Our county-level map of expected future carbon cost efficiencies will help conservation organizations identify a cost-efficient allocation of incentive payments that is robust to changes in economic growth fluctuations over time.

AB The Mexican highlands are areas of high biological complexity where taxa of Nearctic and Neotropical origin and different population histories are found. To gain a more detailed view of the evolution of the biota in these regions, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of historical tectonic and climate events on species. Here, we analyzed the phylogeographic structure, historical demographic processes, and the contemporary period, Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Last Interglacial (LIG) ecological niche models ofQuercus castanea, to infer the historical population dynamics of this oak distributed in the Mexican highlands. A total of 36 populations ofQ. castaneawere genotyped with seven chloroplast microsatellite loci in four recognized biogeographic provinces of Mexico: the Sierra Madre Occidental (western mountain range), the Central Plateau, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB, mountain range crossing central Mexico from west to east) and the Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS, southern mountain range). We obtained standard statistics of genetic diversity and structure and tested for signals of historical demographic expansions. A total of 90 haplotypes were identified, and 29 of these haplotypes were restricted to single populations. The within-population genetic diversity was high (meanh(S) = 0.72), and among-population genetic differentiation showed a strong phylogeographic structure (N-ST = 0.630 > G(ST) = 0.266;p < .001). Signals of demographic expansion were identified in the TMVB and the SMS. The ecological niche models suggested a considerable percentage of stable distribution area for the species during the LGM and connectivity between the TMVB and the SMS. High genetic diversity, strong phylogeographic structure, and ecological niche models suggest in situ permanence ofQ. castaneapopulations with large effective population sizes. The complex geological and climatic histories of the TMVB help to explain the origin and maintenance of a large proportion of the genetic diversity in this oak species.

AB Questions The current paradigm of plant community assembly relies on a set of processes operating at particular spatial scales. It is assumed that as the spatial scale becomes finer, environmental filtering loses its importance in favor of biotic interactions and neutral processes. Thus, at the very fine spatial scale represented by a rectangular plot of 72.25 m(2) in a Mediterranean semiarid dwarf-shrubland, we ask: (a) are the spatial distributions of individuals of the different species explained by neutral models; (b) are these distributions dependent on above-ground plant interactions with the dominant species in the community; and/or (c) are they responding to the spatial variation of different soil variables, in a kind of fine-scale environmental filtering?
   Location Central Spain.
   Methods To assess the correlates of fine-scale (i.e., from 0.05-2.00 m) spatial patterns of the species in the community, we fully mapped all perennial individuals inside the rectangular plot. For each species, we fitted one complete spatial randomness (CSR) model that does not assume spatial heterogeneity and three weighted-average inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP) models using six soil covariates, distribution patterns of the four above-ground dominant plants in the community or both types of covariates. All models were evaluated and compared to select the best-fitting weighted-average model.
   Results We recorded 7,988 individuals of 22 species. Patterns of all species were appropriately explained by IPP models. For most species the best-fitting weighted-average model included both soil and dominant plants (i.e., 15) or only soil covariates (i.e., 6). The improvement provided by the best-fitting weighted-averaging model in comparison with the CSR model was consistently high (81%).
   Conclusions Our approach suggests that species in this dwarf-shrubland are mainly structured by soil heterogeneity and modulated in some cases by the interactions established with the dominant species.

AB In plant communities, co-occurring species compete for resources such as mineral nutrients under limited supply. Here, the researchers found that a major mineral nutrient, phosphorus, was taken up by co-occurring plants in species-specific proportions of different forms, which may drive the development of community biodiversity.
   How species coexist despite competing for the same resources that are in limited supply is central to our understanding of the controls on biodiversity(1,2). Resource partitioning may facilitate coexistence, as co-occurring species use different sources of the same limiting resource(3,4). In plant communities, however, direct evidence for partitioning of the commonly limiting nutrient, phosphorus (P), has remained scarce due to the challenges of quantifying P acquisition from its different chemical forms present in soil(5). To address this, we used P-33 to directly trace P uptake from DNA, orthophosphate and calcium phosphate into monocultures and mixed communities of plants growing in grassland soil. We show that co-occurring plants acquire P from these important organic and mineral sources in different proportions, and that differences in P source use are consistent with the species' root adaptations for P acquisition. Furthermore, the net benefit arising from niche plasticity (the gain in P uptake for a species in a mixed community compared to monoculture) correlates with species abundance in the wild, suggesting that niche plasticity for P is a driver of community structure. This evidence for P resource partitioning and niche plasticity may explain the high levels of biodiversity frequently found in P-limited ecosystems worldwide(6,7).

AB Energy production systems such as nuclear reactors and coal-burning power plants produce a multitude of waste contaminants including radionuclides, trace elements, and heavy metals. Among invertebrates, much of the effort to understand the impact of these contaminants has focused in aquatic environments, while relatively less attention has been on terrestrial communities. We investigated the effects of trace element and radionuclide contamination on assemblages of beetles that are drawn to vertebrate carrion. Samples were collected from riparian sites at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina to compare trap catches (i.e., measure of relative abundance) of beetles and species diversity along a habitat gradient (0300 m) away from an aquatic habitat and between uncontaminated and contaminated sites. We collected 17,800 carrion-associated beetles representing 112 species in nine families, which were classified as either scavenger or predatory beetles. Beetle catches and species diversity were generally higher at contaminated than uncontaminated sites. These trends were likely driven by scavenger species, which showed similar patterns between sites, whereas patterns of catches and species diversity were variable between sites for predatory beetles. Species compositions of contaminated and uncontaminated sites were generally distinct, however habitat edges appeared to substantially affect beetle assemblages. Overall, our study suggests carrion beetle assemblages are sensitive to edge effects and may exhibit variable responses to the presence of anthropogenic contaminants or disturbances associated with energy production systems. Such results reflect the inherent variability among individual beetle species, populations, and communities to local environmental conditions, and underscores the need for multi-taxa approach in environmental impact assessments.

ID INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES
AB Background Vast areas of lowland neotropical forest have regenerated after initially being cleared for agricultural purposes. The ecological value of regenerating second growth to forest-dwelling birds may largely depend on the age of the forest, associated vegetative structure, and when it is capable of sustaining avian demographics similar to those found in pristine forest. Methods To determine the influence of second growth age on bird demography, we estimated the annual survival of six central Amazonian bird species residing in pristine forest, a single 100 and a single 10 ha forest fragment, taking into consideration age of the surrounding matrix (i.e. regenerating forest adjacent to each fragment) as an explanatory variable. Results Study species exhibited three responses: arboreal, flocking and ant-following insectivores (Willisornis poecilinotus, Thamnomanes ardesiacus and Pithys albifrons) showed declines in survival associated with fragmentation followed by an increase in survival after 5 years of matrix regeneration. Conversely, Percnostola rufifrons, a gap-specialist, showed elevated survival in response to fragmentation followed by a decline after 5 years of regeneration. Lastly, facultative flocking and frugivore species (Glyphorynchus spirurus and Dixiphia pipra, respectively) showed no response to adjacent clearing and subsequent regeneration. Conclusions Our results in association with previous studies confirm that the value of regenerating forest surrounding habitat patches is dependent on two factors: ecological guild of the species in question and second growth age. Given the rapid increase in survival following succession, we suggest that the ecological value of young tropical forest should not be based solely on a contemporary snapshot, but rather, on the future value of mature second growth as well.

AB Tropical tree-species richness is positively correlated with annual precipitation, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Phytopathogens promote tree-species coexistence by disproportionately afflicting seedlings of locally abundant species, generating a rare species advantage. We consider whether increased plant-pathogen interactions in humid conditions favourable for phytopathogens could drive the precipitation-richness relationship by accentuating the rare species advantage. Support for this mechanism requires that increases in disease under humid conditions disproportionately affect locally abundant species without spreading to rarer species. This criterion would be augmented by either increased phytopathogen host-specificity under humid conditions, or increased asynchronicity in germination of different tree species. Research suggests that precipitation increases the rare species advantage. Increased precipitation enhances phytopathogen transmission, making escape from specialist pathogens more difficult. Additionally, drought stress predisposes plants to disease, especially by opportunistic pathogens. As seasonality in wet forests decreases, scope for asynchronous germination among species increases, potentially concentrating disease transmission within species. Synthesis. The pathways we identify could drive the precipitation-richness relationship, but finding direct evidence for them remains a priority. Researching these pathways is especially important because decreasing precipitation due to climate change could disrupt key species coexistence mechanisms and erode tree-species richness.

AB Lianas, woody climbing plants, are increasing in many tropical forests, with cascading effects such as decreased forest productivity, carbon sequestration, and resilience. Possible causes are increasing forest fragmentation, CO2 fertilization, and drought. Determining the primary changing species and their underlying vital rates help explain the liana trends. We monitored over 17,000 liana stems for 13 yr in 20 ha of old-growth forest in the Congo Basin, and here we report changes and vital rates for the community and for the 87 most abundant species. The total liana abundance declined from 15,007 lianas in 1994 to 11,090 in 2001 to 9,978 in 2007. Over half (52%) of the evaluated species have significantly declining populations, showing that the community response is not the result of changes in a few dominant species only. Species density change (i.e., the change in number of individuals per hectare) decreased with mortality rate, tended to increase with recruitment rate, but was independent of growth rate. Species change was independent of functional characteristics important for plant responses to fragmentation, CO2, and drought, such as lifetime light requirements, climbing and dispersal mechanism, and leaf size. These results indicate that in Congo lianas do not show the reputed global liana increase, but rather a decline, and that elements of the reputed drivers underlying global liana change do not apply to this DR Congo forest. We suggest warfare in the Congo Basin to have decimated the elephant population, leading to less disturbance, forest closure, and declining liana numbers. Our results imply that, in this tropical forest, local causes (i.e., disturbance) override more global causes of liana change resulting in liana decline, which sharply contrasts with the liana increase observed elsewhere.

AB This study investigates historical fire regimes and arboreal cover variability in the Brazilian Cerrados, a large Neotropical savanna ecosystem, during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and early Holocene, and then tests whether the observed variation is linked to South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) variability. We present high-resolution pollen, XRF and charcoal records from Lagoa Feia, located in central Cerrados, and assess how they compare with other pollen records from the surrounding region to investigate regional trends of vegetation and fire regime variability. Our results show that the Pleistocene-Holocene transition was marked by a wet episode, which included moist forest expansion and rising lake levels, that correlates well with increased monsoon activity in a large area of central South America during the same period. This wet episode chronologically coincides with the Younger Dryas cold episode in the northern hemisphere. Our data revealed moisture declines in central Cerrados after 11.2 kyr BP, along with centennial-scale fluctuations from dry to wet conditions throughout the early Holocene period until around 6 kyr BP. These dry/wet oscillations are associated with weakened SASM activity and repeated shifts of its belt position during this time range. Fire activity increased in central Cerrados just after the onset of drier conditions during the early Holocene, and likely contributed to decreased arboreal cover at that time. A trend of increasing moisture in the region was observed after 6 kyr BP. Our study reveals how centennial and millennial-scale changes in monsoon activity influenced arboreal cover, diversity and fire regimes in the central Cerrados. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere from human activity continue to increase, and accordingly, strategies of biological carbon (C) sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems have been proposed. Forestation projects have garnered wide public support, and research has focused principally on how soil C storage is affected. Nevertheless, our mechanistic understanding of how forestation, particularly with exotic woody species, affects ecosystem processes is not well understood. We took advantage of a land-use change in Patagonia, Argentina, that involved the simultaneous planting of a single conifer species (Pines ponderosa) along a broad precipitation gradient [250-2200 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP)], replacing natural ecosystems from semi-arid steppe to broadleaf forest. Comparing C fluxes and stocks in five paired natural and planted forest sites during three consecutive years demonstrated that aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was consistently greater in forested areas along the gradient, while litter decomposition markedly decreased. Dramatic increases in leaf litter detritus, coupled with increased aboveground woody biomass, contributed to identical levels of C accumulation in pine plantations from 250 mm to 1350 mm MAP, without significantly detectable differences in surface soil C. The replacement of intact forest in the most humid site resulted in large decreases in vegetation C pools. The implications for ecosystem C cycling suggest that inhibition of C turnover, along with the aboveground woody growth, are key variables contributing to the observed patterns of C accumulation from exotic pine forestation along this precipitation gradient. Given the transient nature of these C stocks, vulnerable to loss as CO2 due to climatic or anthropogenic disturbances, these changes may not contribute to long-term C sequestration in these ecosystems. The conversion of natural ecosystems as a management tool for C mitigation should include a consideration of the realized sequestration potential but also the unintended consequences for changes in both C inputs and C turnover that determine the ecosystem C balance, as well as potential effects on biodiversity and long-term ecosystem functioning.

AB Railways are known to have less influence on land use than other transportation systems. However, railways also affect biodiversity, water resources, socioeconomic outcomes, and land prices. In the context of changes in land cover and land use (LCLU) classes, this study analyses the changes arising from the establishment of the Carajas Mining Project in 1984 along the more than 900-km length of the Carajas Railway (CRW) in southeastern Amazonia. LANDSAT-5 (1984) and LANDSAT-8 (2014) satellite images and human settlement layers (1990 and 2015) along CRW were used to assess LCLU changes. Satellite images were analysed with the geographic object-based image analysis method to detect changes in LCLU classes, including municipalities located less than 50 km from the CRW. The results showed that in 1984, the areas of influence of the CRW consisted of 69% forest cover, 24% nonforest cover, 3% water, and 2% cloud cover. In 2014, forest area dropped significantly to 43%, whereas the nonforest class expanded to 46%. This analysis revealed that the conversion of forests to pastures represents the major landscape degradation that occupy 51% of the study site mainly in rural human settlement areas, which are interlinked with the construction of the CRW. Only 6% of the total area exhibits a trend of restoration marked by secondary vegetation growing. The land occupation model along the CRW is characterized by rural settlements, associated with roads and extensive pasturelands. Construction of this railway in a certain way prevented the fishbone occupation type as observed in the western Amazon.

AB The expansion of forest plantations is cause for concern because of their environmental effects, and the loss of native forests and agricultural land. Our goal was to quantify the increase in pine plantation, and concomitant loss of native forests, in central Chile since ca. 1960, and to identify in which settings native forests were lost most rapidly. We analyzed aerial photographs from 1955 and 1961, Landsat images from 1975 and 1998, and Google Earth high-resolution satellite images from 2014. To ensure high classification accuracy, we visually interpreted images for a systematic 3-km grid and assigned each point as either 'pine plantation', 'native forest', 'agricultural-livestock lands', or 'other'. We also calculated latitude, longitude, slope, Euclidean distance to the nearest road and to the nearest pulp mill, and the frequency of land use surrounding each point as potential variables to explain observed land use changes. Pine plantations expansion started even before 1960, when 12% of all points were already pine plantations, was particularly rapid from 1975 (18% of sample points) to 1998 (38%), and stabilized thereafter (37% by 2014). From 1975 to 1998 alone, 40% of native forests were replaced by pine plantations, and agricultural-livestock lands declined by 0.7%, 0.9%, 1% per year before 1975, from 1975 to 1998, and after 1998 respectively. Native forests that were surrounded by pine plantations, were most likely to be converted to plantations, and from 1960 to 1975, also native forests near pulp mills. The probability of change from agricultural-livestock lands to pine plantations was mainly influenced by slope, with most agricultural-livestock lands remaining in areas with low slopes.

AB Seed survival is of great importance for the performance of plant species and it is strongly affected by post-dispersal seed removal by either different animals such as granivorous species and secondary dispersers or abiotic conditions such as wind or water. The success of post-dispersal seed removal depends on seed specific traits including seed size, the presence of coats or elaiosomes, the mode of seed dispersion, and on the habitat in which seeds happen to arrive. In the present study we asked how seed traits (dehulled vs. intact; size; dispersal mode), habitat (forest vs. grassland), and time of day (night vs. day) influence post-dispersal seed removal of the four plant species Chelidonium majus, Lotus corniculatus, Tragopogon pratensis and Helianthus annuus. Seed removal experiments were performed in three regions in Hesse, Germany. The results showed different, inconsistent influences of time of day, depending on habitat and region, but consistent variation across seed types. C. majus and dehulled H. annuus seeds had the fastest removal rates. The impact of the habitat on post-dispersal seed removal was very low, only intact H. annuus seeds were removed at significantly higher rates in grasslands than in forests. Our study demonstrates consistent differences across seed types across different habitats and time: smaller seeds and those dispersed by animals had a faster removal rate. It further highlights that experimental studies need to consider seeds in their natural form to be most realistic.

AB Persistent ecological and socio-economic impacts from the expansion of industrial monocultures in the tropics have raised land use sustainability to the top of the environmental policy agenda. As major crops such as soy continue to experience growing market demand and threaten both natural ecosystems and traditional populations, a number of multi-stakeholder governance initiatives have been established around agricultural commodity chains or key landscapes. Effectiveness in curbing unsustainable land use, however, remains limited. In this context, innovative initiatives have blurred the lines to combine both supply chain and landscape governance. We analyze such arrangements-here conceptualized as commodity-centric landscape governance (CCLG)-with an in-depth case study of the Cerrado Working Group, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by civil society and the soy agribusiness to address land use change in that savanna landscape in Brazil. The paper examines how that initiative has come about, its agenda, as well as usually underexposed political dimensions using agenda-setting theory. The research is based on extensive fieldwork in Brazil, with data collected through document analysis and 56 key-informant interviews. The findings suggest that a sustainable development agenda for the Cerrado has been substantially narrowed to become mostly one of conversion-free soy supply, serving more the interests of that agroindustry and its consumers than those of the landscape's most vulnerable stakeholders, such as local communities. While the Cerrado Working Group has importantly broadened the policy scope beyond commodity certification, its limited inclusiveness and a skewed agenda have led to instruments that target only soy farmers as beneficiaries. We conclude that, although effective for targeting conversion drivers, CCLG can crystallize and reinforce existing land use patterns by granting disproportionate power to dominant stakeholders, thus limiting the agenda to incremental changes. As a consequence, distant demand-side actors may exert greater governance authority than the landscape's own population. If embodying norms of inclusiveness and equitable participation, CCLG may serve as an entry point, but it does not per se replace inclusive land-use planning and integrated landscape governance.

AB Agricultural frontier expansion into the Amazon over the last four decades has created million hectares of fragmented forests. While many species undergo local extinctions within remaining forest patches, this may be compensated by native species from neighbouring open-habitat areas potentially invading these patches, particularly as forest habitats become increasingly degraded. Here, we examine the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation on small mammal assemblages in a southern Amazonian deforestation frontier, while accounting for species-specific degree of forest-dependency. We surveyed small mammals at three continuous forest sites and 19 forest patches of different sizes and degrees of isolation. We further sampled matrix habitats adjacent to forest patches, which allowed us to classify each species according to forest-dependency and generate a community-averaged forest-dependency index for each site. Based on 21,568 trap-nights, we recorded 970 small mammals representing 20 species: 12 forest-dependents, 5 matrix-tolerants and 3 open-habitat specialists. Across the gradient of forest patch size, small mammal assemblages failed to show the typical species-area relationship, but this relationship held true when either species abundance or composition was considered. Species composition was further mediated by community-averaged forest-dependency, so that smaller forest patches were occupied by a lower proportion of forest-dependent rodents and marsupials. Both species richness and abundance increased in less isolated fragments surrounded by structurally simplified matrix habitats (e.g. active or abandoned cattle pastures). While shorter distances between forest patches may favour small mammal abundances, forest area and matrix complexity dictated which species could persist within forest fragments according to their degree of forest-dependency. Small mammal local extinctions in small forest patches within Amazonian deforestation frontiers are therefore likely offset by the incursion of open-habitat species. To preclude the dominance of those species, and consequent losses of native species and associated ecosystem functions, management actions should limit or reduce areas dedicated to pasture, additionally maintaining more structurally complex matrix habitats across fragmented landscapes.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) have emerged as a popular conservation tool, yet evaluation among different PES programs strategies remains piecemeal. We prospectively compare cost-effectiveness of general PES, collective payments for ecosystem services (CPES) and the transition from PES to Land Purchases or Easements (LPE). We analyze the economic cost using statistics data and literature data, and analyze the transaction cost with the ordinal variable. We develop the Emergy Analysis method with the InVEST Habitat Quality model, and utilize it to analyze and map the ecological effectiveness. This paper gives an example to assessing the cost-effectiveness of different PES programs. Based on the analysis, LPE strategy led to improved ecological effectiveness, lower cost and greater cost-effectiveness. The collective PES has lower cost than general PES. However, they demonstrate equal ecological effectiveness. Based on these outcomes, we analyze the factors that influence PES programs' cost-effectiveness, including collective or group, market-based mechanism, economic incentive, transaction cost, contract scale etc. We conclude that minimal number of intermediaries, community/collective support and involvement constitute the key factors in improving the cost-effectiveness of ecological programs. However, we acknowledge the need for further studies on the subject. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for life on Earth, with an important and oftentimes unaccounted organic biogeochemical component. Current methods for the quantification of different organic P compounds in environmental samples (e.g., soils, sediments) are based on extraction techniques and often associated with incomplete P recovery or sample changes. In this study, we present a protocol for the quantification of different organic and inorganic P species in soils using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the P L-2,L-3-edge. Its accuracy and precision was evaluated by analyzing 40 standard mixtures composed of seven different inorganic and organic P compounds (with a mean of R-2 = 0.85). In addition, we quantified the P species of two soils and two agro-industrial byproducts using P L-2,L-3-edge XANES spectroscopy and the results were compared with those obtained by P K-edge XANES or P-31 NMR spectroscopy. Using the P L-2,L-3-edge, we identified different organic P species, including those not identified by the common P K-edge XANES. However, there is a consistent underestimation of organic polyphosphates. Overall, the application of P L-2,L-3-edge XANES provides a higher level of information than by P K-edge XANES, although the ubiquitous use of this novel methodology is still limited to samples with a phosphorus content above 3 mg g(-1).

AB The impact of rapid habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity is a major issue. However, we still lack an integrative understanding of how these changes influence biodiversity dynamics over time. In this study, we investigate the effects of these changes in terms of both niche-based and neutral dynamics. We hypothesize that habitat loss has delayed effects on neutral immigration-extinction dynamics, while edge effects and environmental heterogeneity in habitat patches have rapid effects on niche-based dynamics.
   We analyzed taxonomic and functional composition of 100 tree communities in a tropical dry forest landscape of New-Caledonia subject to habitat loss and fragmentation. We designed an original, process-based simulation framework, and performed Approximate Bayesian Computation to infer the influence of niche-based and neutral processes. Then, we performed partial regressions to evaluate the relationships between inferred parameter values of communities and landscape metrics (distance to edge, patch area, and habitat amount around communities), derived from either recent or past (65 yr ago) aerial photographs, while controlling for the effect of soil and topography.
   We found that landscape structure influences both environmental filtering and immigration. Immigration rate was positively related to past habitat amount surrounding communities. In contrast, environmental filtering was mostly affected by present landscape structure and mainly influenced by edge vicinity and topography.
   Our results highlight that landscape changes have contrasting spatio-temporal influences on niche-based and neutral assembly dynamics. First, landscape-level habitat loss and community isolation reduce immigration and increase demographic stochasticity, resulting in slow decline of local species diversity and extinction debt. Second, recent edge creation affects environmental filtering, incurring rapid changes in community composition by favoring species with edge-adapted strategies. Our study brings new insights about temporal impacts of landscape changes on biodiversity dynamics. We stress that landscape history critically influences these dynamics and should be taken into account in conservation policies.

AB Unprecedented species loss in diverse forests indicates the urgent need to test its consequences for ecosystem functioning. However, experimental evaluation based on realistic extinction scenarios is lacking. Using species interaction networks we introduce an approach to separate effects of node loss (reduced species number) from effects of link loss or compensation (reduced or increased interspecific interactions) on ecosystem functioning along directed extinction scenarios. By simulating random and non-random extinction scenarios in an experimental subtropical Chinese forest, we find that species loss is detrimental for stand volume in all scenarios, and that these effects strengthen with age. However, the magnitude of these effects depends on the type of attribute on which the directed species loss is based, with preferential loss of evolutionarily distinct species and those from small families having stronger effects than those that are regionally rare or have high specific leaf area. These impacts were due to both node loss and link loss or compensation. At high species richness (reductions from 16 to 8 species), strong stand-volume reduction only occurred in directed but not random extinction. Our results imply that directed species loss can severely hamper productivity in already diverse young forests.
   A biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment in a young subtropical forest shows that, at high species richness, directed but not random species loss leads to pronounced productivity decrease.

AB Wet meadows are a common focus of wetland restoration efforts, and the species within them often exist within a restricted range of water levels. Unfortunately, many restored wetlands have higher water levels and more open water than naturally occurring reference wetlands, and many are invaded and dominated by species of Typha. Most studies evaluating the optimal water level for plant species use observational methods, yet experimental methods are required to understand the breadth of a species' niche. We used experimental transplants of Carex pellita, a common wet meadow sedge used in restoration in the interior of the USA, and Typha latifolia, a species of cattail which invades many restored wetlands, to test whether higher water levels in a restored wetland were prohibitive to the target sedge species. Physiological and growth measurements were collected on both species. We found that C. pellita grew as well or better when transplanted into the ponded water levels, while T. latifolia had reduced growth when transplanted into the relatively drier meadow conditions. Interestingly, C. pellita was able to adjust its Turgor Loss Point in response to changing water levels. Only recently the assumption of a constant Turgor Loss Point for each species has been questioned. Our results provide evidence that wet meadow species have a broader hydrologic niche than previously thought, and their ability to make physiological adjustments in response to changing water levels may allow them to thrive in areas with widely varying water levels.

AB Human activities may lead to land degradation, and then influences diversity and function of ecosystems. Understanding the plant community assembly processes and diversity patterns along human activities-related gradients are an important facet of ecological research and can be used to reveal vegetation dynamics under land degradation on the Loess Plateau. In this study, we evaluated the net relatedness index, phylogenetic diversity, and species diversity along habitat (elevation, slope, aspect, residential distance, succession time) and comprehensive disturbance gradients on the Loess Plateau, China. We found that community assembly processes were mainly influenced by slope and succession time linked to human activity. Study regions with slope >20 degrees or succession time > 35 years showed no environmental filtering effect during community assembly processes, because these region usually had fewer cropland development activities. Although phylogenetic and species diversity showed a dissimilar pattern along gradients, we also summarized human activities rather than habitat factors drive diversity patterns. In summary, we demonstrate that human activities mainly influence community assembly processes and diversity patterns. With reduction of human disturbance in future, land degradation will be ameliorated on Loess Plateau.

AB In Northwestern Mexico. approximately 40 breeding species of seabirds have been reported, with several threats (e.g.. invasive species introduction and habitat loss) affecting the viability of their populations. As such, it is necessary to take action for their protection. To prioritize conservation activities, 119 reports (governamental agency monitoring programs, grey literature, and scientific literature) were analyzed for research and monitoring results from 1922-2018 (93 of 119 published after 1990) and ranked the different islands (91 sites, including archipelagos with multiple islands) based on their breeding seabird communities (35 species in 11 seabird families. including 7 endemic breeders). For the ranking exercise, three criteria were considered: conservation category, preferred habitat. and foraging guild for each species. Taking into consideration the breeding species on each island, an index to rank the islands was created. Ten islands or archipelagos have high conservation priority (index score > 10 = high priority; mean index = 4.7, median = 5.0, max = 17.9, n = 91), and the most important are: Revillagigedo and San Benito archipelagos. Coronado, San Lorenzo, and Natividad Islands. It is necessary to use new tools and techniques to determine populations' sizes and trends and to create a baseline to compare with future studies. Furthermore, many of the species breeding or feeding in the Mexican Economic Exclusive Zone migrate to other latitudes, elevating the conservation problem to an international scale.

AB 1. The control of invasive species is a central topic of both applied and theoretical research. Understanding how and which ecological theories can be used to improve invasion resistance of plant communities is essential, to design effective control strategies.
   2. The theory of limiting similarity, stating that coexistence between species is more limited by competitive exclusion when species share niche properties, is often considered by applied ecologists as a possible approach to limiting plant invasions at the local scale.
   3. The complexity of measuring ecological niche overlap between species as well as the difficulty of disentangling niche from fitness processes currently limit the demonstration and application of this theory. Limiting similarity appears to operate at a time-scale that is too long for efficient impact on invasive species' early establishment. It may also be ineffective against invasions in the long term, due to environmental changes and community instability. Finally, limiting similarity is not applicable to the most common situations, where there are multiple co-occurring invasive species or no prior identification of potential invasives.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Whether the theory of limiting similarity, predicting competitive exclusion when species display niche similarities, can be successfully applied to limit plant invasions-or not-is an important issue for practitioners facing invasive species. In practice, using limiting similarity to design invasion-resistant plant communities appears to be complex, ineffective and unsuitable for most common situations.

AB Portachuelo Pass is an open area used by a great diversity of bird species, either as residents or for seasonal or migratory movements, reporting 32 species of hummingbirds in the Trochilidae family. Due to this, our goal was evaluating the hummingbird assemblage dynamics in Portachuelo Pass, analyzing the abundance of the captures over four years of sampling and comparing these data with samples taken between 1990 and 2013. Monthly field trips were made from April 1990 to November 1994, and from June 2010 to November 2013. between 5 and 8 mist-nets were used to catch the birds. 14 685 individuals were captured. belonging to 25 species. The relative abundance per species was estimated in each of the sampling months, separating the community into four groups: A) Hummingbirds with high abundances, B) Hummingbirds with low abundances, C) Hummingbirds rare and D) Phaethornithinae. The species with the highest abundance populations were: Heliodoxa leadbeateri and Sternoclyta cyanopectus, followed by Aglaiocercus kingi, Chalybura buffoni, Chrysuronia oenone and Coeligena coeligena. For the rest of the species the densities in the mist-net captures were from low to medium. Based on the results obtained, the community of hummingbirds in the area of Portachuelo can be divided into: six highly abundant species that are observed throughout all or most of the year. seven species that use the passage during most of the year but with low densities, four species that use the area in a seasonal manner and seven rare species in the catches due to the type of sampling, or that do not present displacement movements and prefer other habitats. Statistically significant dilferences were found between the abundance of hummingbirds of sampling years, being the year with the highest abundance 1991, followed by 2013.

AB Soil removal by ants when building or adapting their nests generates ecological changes within the soil and on its surface, impacting both soil physical properties and plant growth. Ectatomma sp. 2 (E. ruidum complex) is a dominant hunting ant in numerous neotropical agricultural systems; however, its bioturbation impact on agroecosystems of economic importance, such as coffee, has not been studied. We evaluated it on coffee seedlings in Andean plantations of Colombia. Sixty colonies of this ant (30 in sun coffee, 30 in shaded coffee) were added within enclosed experimental units (EUs) containing coffee seedlings, and compared with their respective controls without ants. On average, dry soil removal by colony was 104.4 g during the two months experimental period (1.6 g day(-1) colony(-1)), 13 times higher than in controls. A conservative estimate of their global bioturbation impact was calculated at between 59.3 and 203.1 kg dry soil ha(-1), considering only two months of digging activity year(-1) colony(-1), a likely underestimation of the actual digging activity of this species. Positive effects of the presence of ants were found on several plant growth variables and on soil microporosity in shaded coffee plantations. Taking into consideration only the 14 colonies that were fully active until the end of the experiment, dry soil removal was on average 228.8 g (3.5 g day(-1) colony(-1)) during the two months experimental period and coffee seedling growth in these EUs was significantly higher than in controls, indicating that, at the global scale, our bioturbation estimate could be higher under less restricted natural conditions and higher nest densities as found in other regions. Ectatomma ruidum sp. 2 appears as a functional agent in agroecosystems due to its ubiquity and its high bioturbation impact during the nest excavation period of activity, providing support services in agroecosystems and neotropical natural systems.

AB Amazonia is under threat. Biodiversity and redundancy loss in the Amazon biome severely limits the long-term provision of key ecosystem services in diverse spatial scales (local, regional, and global). Resilience thinking attempts to understand the mechanisms that ensure a system's capacity to recover in the face of external pressures, trauma, or disturbances, as well as changes in its internal dynamics. Resilience thinking also promotes relevant transformations of system configurations considered adverse or nonsustainable, and therefore proposes the simultaneous analysis of the adaptive capacity and the transformation of a system. In this context, seven principles have been proposed, which are considered crucial for social-ecological systems to become resilient. These seven principles of resilience thinking are analyzed in terms of the land use planning and land management of the Amazonian biome. To comprehend its main conflicts, challenges, and opportunities, we reveal the key aspects of the historical process of Latin America's land management and the Amazon basin's past and current land use changes. Based on this review, the Amazon region shows two concrete challenges for resilience: (1) the natural system's fragmentation, as a consequence of land use limiting key ecological processes, and (2) the cultural and institutional fragmentation of land use projects designed and partially implemented in the region. In addition, the region presents challenges related to institutional design, the expansion and strengthening of real participation spaces, and the promotion of social learning. Finally, polycentric and adaptive governance is itself a major, urgent need for this region and its social-ecological complexity.

AB Aim: To determine the present species composition and diversity in dry temperate forest ecosystem, especially trees, shrubs, ground cover, birds, reptiles and mammals.
   Methodology: The vegetation composition and diversity of dry-temperate forest in Kumrat valley was determined through employing the 20x20 m (0.4 ha) quadrant method. In addition, fauna species were detected through direct visual observations. A total of 100 quadrant plots were randomly selected to determine the vegetation composition and diversity from July, 2017 to August, 2018.
   Results: A total of 7 tree species, 3 shrubs, and 12 grass species were identified, which were attracted into the study area. The highest tree density was determined for P wallichiana (3.375 tree ha(-1) and the lowest one for J. regia (0.300 tree ha(-1)). CAP tests indicated that the diversity indices, i.e., Shannon-Winner's Diversity Index (H-1=2.908 +/- 0.161), Margalefs Richness Index (R-1=3.26 +/- 0.112) and McIntosh Evenness Index (E=0.9746 +/- 0.0206) occured in Kumrat valley. Further, diversity indices of trees varied from species to species, e.g., the highest tree species diversity (H-1=2.248) and species richness (R-1=2.730) was recorded in Picea smithiana and the lowest one (H-1=0.297) and richness (R-1=0.4024) in Juglans regia. Taxus baccata (E=0.9763) showed even distribution in the study area as compared to other tree species. The direct observation observed a total of 11 mammal species (6 endangered, 3 data deficient, and 2 species least concern), 41 bird species (mostly least concern), and 6 reptile species (4 least concern, one data deficient, and one vulnerable) simultaneously within the same area where plant cover was determined.
   Interpretation: The results of this study demonstrated that plant cover structure and composition of dry-temperate forest is the most prominent factor that had formed a wide array of different habitats to attract the higher diversity of fauna.

AB This study takes the first step to tele-connect urban food consumption to land use at multiple spatial scales by taking beef consumption of Taiwan during 1990-2016 as a test case. The novelty of this study is to make a quantitative effort in advancing the methodological approach in urban studies and facilitates future research in the subject area. Our numerical results support the hypothesis of ULT associated with beef consumption, and suggest that the phenomena of beef-related land teleconnection are more significant in urban areas. From the time dynamic perspective, moreover, trade liberalization extends the spatial spectrum of implied land use associated with beef consumption. It allows imports towards relative land-saving origins and alleviates beef-related ULT. Finally, income growth plays a key role in driving up the implied land use of beef consumption at earlier stage of urban development. In contrast, at the later stage the increase in expenditure intensity of beef accounts for surging beef consumption in cities.

AB Overexploitation is a main driver of biodiversity loss globally. Protected areas may have a key role in reducing overexploitation, yet their actual effectiveness in maintaining high-density and viable populations of over-exploited species has rarely been evaluated. For overharvested plants, in particular, available information is extremely limited, making it unclear whether protected areas are indeed effective at protecting species. Here, we provide the first biome-wide assessment of the effectiveness of protected areas in maintaining populations of overexploited plants. We analyzed data from 50 populations of the overexploited and threatened palm Euterpe edulis, an ecologically and economically important species of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. By integrating these data with species distribution modelling and matrix population modelling, we were able to evaluate the most likely causes and possible consequences of differences in population density inside and outside protected areas. Forest sites located inside protected areas had, on average, almost three times higher adult density of E. edulis than sites located outside protected areas, and a corresponding higher frequency of viable populations (>= 60 adults/ha). Our analyses indicate that these differences are a direct consequence of the lower frequency of palm heart harvest inside protected areas, rather than differences in climatic suitability or forest cover. The matrix model showed that the higher density and lower harvest frequency inside protected areas may significantly increase long-term persistence of E. edulis populations, reducing their extinction risk. Our findings provide new and compelling evidence that terrestrial protected areas may be crucial for long-term conservation of overexploited plants.

AB Emerging infectious diseases are often the products of host shifts, where a pathogen jumps from its original host to a novel species. Viruses in particular cross species barriers frequently. Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) and deformed wing virus (DWV) are viruses described in honey bees (Apis mellifera) with broad host ranges. Ants scavenging on dead honey bees may get infected with these viruses via foodborne transmission. However, the role of black garden ants, Lasius niger and Lasius platythorax, as alternative hosts of ABPV and DWV is not known and potential impacts of these viruses have not been addressed yet. In a laboratory feeding experiment, we show that L. niger can carry DWV and ABPV. However, negative-sense strand RNA, a token of virus replication, was only detected for ABPV. Therefore, additional L. niger colonies were tested for clinical symptoms of ABPV infections. Symptoms were detected at colony (fewer emerging workers) and individual level (impaired locomotion and movement speed). In a field survey, all L. platythorax samples carried ABPV, DWV-A and -B, as well as the negative-sense strand RNA of ABPV. These results show that L. niger and L. platythorax are alternative hosts of ABPV, possibly acting as a biological vector of ABPV and as a mechanical one for DWV. This is the first study showing the impact of honey bee viruses on ants. The common virus infections of ants in the field support possible negative consequences for ecosystem functioning due to host shifts.

AB Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is among the world's worst invasive species, and there is an increasing need for effective control methods for this species. Existing chemical treatments and baits used in managing other invasive ant species may not be as effective for managing W. auropunctata. Development of effective ant control treatments and baits depends on laboratory experiments to test the potential efficacy of a large number of products and control methods prior to implementation of large-scale field studies. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that laboratory-raised W. auropunctata may respond differently than their wild counterparts to bait types, and if this is the case, laboratory trials may not accurately predict results under field conditions. Here we report on experimental research investigating whether ant colonies raised in laboratories, and those in the field, show different patterns of recruitment to non-toxic baits. Laboratory and wild colony recruitment to non-toxic Hawaii Ant Lab gel bait, pureed tuna, and 50% gelled sucrose solution was measured via multi-choice and no-choice field recruitment studies. Secondly, we discuss experiments testing whether the bait preference of laboratory-raised W. auropuncata varies with their base diet. We tested 4 base diets: (1) lipid rich, (2) protein rich, (3) carbohydrate rich, and (4) a "complete" diet with lipid, protein, and carbohydrates offered as a buffet. Overall, we found that laboratory colonies differed from wild W. auropunctata in their foraging behaviors in no-choice and multi choice experiments, particularly in their levels of recruitment to the Hawaii Ant Lab gel bait. This contrast indicates that experimental trials may give misleading indications of potential outcomes of field trials. Further research is needed on optimal laboratory diets for laboratory-reared ant colonies. However, our results suggest that behavioral differences may be mitigated if colonies are maintained on a nutritionally limited diet while conducting laboratory experiments.

AB The ongoing march toward freely available, highly pre-processed satellite imagery has given both researchers and the public unprecedented access to a vast and varied data stream teeming with potential. Among many sources, the multi-decade Landsat archive is certainly the best known, but legacy and current data from other sensors is available as well through the USGS data portals: these include CBERS, ASTER, and more. Though the particular band combinations or non-global missions have made their integration into analyses more challenging, these data, in conjunction with the entire Landsat record, are available to contribute to multi-decade surveys of land-cover change.
   With the goal of tracing forest change through time near the Roosevelt River in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, we used BULC and Google Earth Engine to fuse information from 13 space-borne imagers capturing 140 images spanning 45 years. With high accuracy, the resulting time series of classifications shows the timing and location of land-use/land-cover change-both deforestation and regrowth-at sub-annual time scales. Accuracy estimates showed that the synthesized BULC classification time series was better than nearly all of the single-day image classifications, covering the entire study area at sub-annual frequency while reducing the impact of clouds and most unwanted noise as it fused information derived from a wide array of imaging platforms. The time series improved and gradually sharpened as the density of observations increased in recent decades, when there were three or more clear, higher-resolution views of a pixel annually from any sensor combination. In addition to detailing the methodology and results of multi-source data fusion with the BULC approach, this study raises timely points about integrating information from early satellite data sources and from sensors with footprints smaller than Landsat's. There are decades of research deriving sensor-specific techniques for classifying land use and land cover from a single image in a variety of settings. The BULC approach leverages the many successes of single-sensor research and can be used as a straightforward, complementary tool for blending many good-quality mapped classifications from disparate sources into a coherent, high-quality time series.

AB Tropical forests are the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Unfortunately, they are often degraded by large enterprises that convert large areas of continuous forest into forest mosaics or into deforested areas in order to seek economic development through infrastructure construction. This study evaluates how the assemblage of nonvolant small mammals is structured after the implementation of a bauxite mining in the Saraca-Taquera National Forest, Para, Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that the clearings for bauxite mining produce an edge effect over the small mammal assemblage and that the size of the deforested area increases the impact's magnitude. Data collection took place through live traps from 2010 to 2012, totaling an effort of 56,220 trap nights in both impacted and pristine areas. Generalized Linear Models revealed that the size of the mined area was the main predictor explaining species impoverishment in impacted areas. Multivariate Permutational Analysis of Variance and Multivariate Dispersion Permutation Analysis revealed differences in species composition between impacted and nonimpacted sites and that these differences are due to species turnover. We recommended that concessions for land use should be rethought, especially in protected areas and when major areas are subjected to a new economic exploitation cycle.

AB The removal of native forest affects stream characteristics, processes, and organisms at the local scale. We compared the structure of fish assemblages between microbasins impacted by deforestation and those in pristine condition in the Amazonian Machado River basin, Brazil. Fish were collected with seine and dip nets along an 80-m stretch of 28 streams. At each site, we recorded physical, chemical, and land-water ecotone variables. We collected 6,586 specimens of 109 species, being 39 and 18 of them exclusively of forested and deforested streams, respectively. Non-significant differences were found for abundance and species richness between forested and deforested streams. A total of four main trophic groups were identified. Carnivores were more abundant in forested streams, whereas herbivores, omnivores and detritivores species were the most abundant in deforested streams. The deforested streams showed higher abundance and richness of algae and periphyton consumers, while forested streams presented higher abundance and richness of invertebrate consumers. Forested streams presented longer foodchains, higher occurrence and abundance of species that have more specialized habits and are intolerant to degraded environments, whereas generalist and tolerant species predominated in deforested streams. We conclude that species composition in Amazonian streams predictably responds to the degree of forest cover.

AB Converting forest to pasture can alter the roles of biota in ecosystem functioning, while vegetation restoration should arguably assist functional recovery. Since tests of this are scarce, this study quantifies both litter decomposition rates and their association with decomposer invertebrates, across 25 sites representing different phases of deforestation and subsequent reforestation of rain forest. Open and closed (to exclude macro-invertebrates) mesh bags containing forest leaves were exposed in the field for up to eight months, and invertebrates were extracted from separate collections of ground surface litter. Sites spanned five vegetation categories (five sites in each): reference states of both old-growth forest and grazed pasture; unassisted woody regrowth aged 20-50 years on former pasture; and assisted regeneration aged 1-3 and 5-10 years after interventions were applied to similar regrowth. Decomposition rates in open bags were about 50% slower in pasture than old-growth forest, and abundances of macro- and meso-decomposer invertebrates were 95% and 77% lower, respectively. However, in all restoration site-types, decomposition rates had recovered to 83% of old-growth values, and abundances of invertebrate decomposers were similar in old-growth forest. Decomposer community composition at a broad taxonomic level differed strongly between pasture and all other vegetation types. Exclusion of macro-invertebrates decreased decomposition rates by only about 3.1%, but decomposition rates in open bags were significantly correlated (across sites) with abundances of both macro- and meso-decomposers, most strongly so for meso-decomposers. Drawing useful generalizations across studies is impeded by differing methodologies and because few include both agricultural and forest reference sites.

AB Tropical forests, which harbor high levels of biodiversity, are being lost at an alarming speed. Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot, has lost more than half of its original forest cover. Most of the remaining forests are small fragments of primary and secondary forest with differing degrees of human impact. These forests, as well as coffee and fruit plantations, may be important in supporting the forest-dependent biodiversity in Madagascar but this has been little studied. In Madagascar, dung beetles, which offer important ecosystem services, are largely restricted to forests. We examined the ability of fragmented and degraded forests to support dung beetle diversity, compared to the large areas of primary forest in eastern Madagascar. We found a general trend of a reduction of species with a loss of forest connectivity. In contrast, a higher level of forest disturbance was associated with higher species diversity. In several sites of low-quality forest as many or more species were found as in less disturbed and primary forests. The average size of dung beetles was smaller in the lower quality localities than in the primary forests. These findings suggest that many forest dung beetles in Madagascar are better adapted to forest disturbance than earlier expected, although they require some level of connectivity to surrounding forest.

AB When limits on the exploitation of shared resources are exceeded among morphologically similar species, competitive exclusion and/or character displacement is expected. However, competition may not be sufficiently intense to engender these phenomena, but it may alter the densities of their local populations, a deterministic phenomenon known as density compensation. Hummingbirds are the most phenotypically specialized nectar-feeding birds, and trait variation within their communities may facilitate finer resource partitioning, which is ideal to test hypotheses related to coexistence. Here, we used simulation models to investigate whether hummingbird ensembles with high morphological similarity to one or several competitors display a reduction in population density as a result of competition in two contrasting habitats (pine forest and second-growth vegetation). In both habitats, four scenarios based on morphological proximity to neighbors were analyzed non-parametrically using multivariate metrics. No evidence of density compensation was found in the pine forest in any scenario. Conversely, evidence of density compensation in the second-growth habitat was found, with the relationship strongest when scenarios represented competition between more proximal neighbors. Our data suggest that the redistribution of hummingbird species between contrasting habitats leads to certain subgroups of morphologically similar species having to pay a population cost to coexist in a given habitat due to density compensation. Thus, competition may not be the leading determinant of hummingbird ensemble structures, which instead appears to be attributable to a combination of mechanisms that operate at local and regional scales, such as source-sink dynamics.

AB Intraspecific variation is increasingly recognized as an important factor in ecological interactions that can exceed the role of interspecific variation. Few studies, however, have examined how variation in intra- and interspecific resource use affect trophic interactions over time within a seasonally-dynamic food web. We compared diets with respect to predator body size and predator species identity over 3 seasons by collecting stomach contents from 2028 Reticulate Sculpin (Cottus perplexus), 479 Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii), and 107 Pacific Giant Salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) in western Oregon streams. In each season, predator body size was strongly associated with dietary composition and positively related to taxonomic breadth and the size of individual prey. Intra- and interspecific diet variation changed substantially across seasons, with much greater interspecific variation in spring than in summer and autumn. Interspecific differences in foraging mode (e.g., benthic vs drift feeding) were associated with predator-specific responses to a seasonal pulse in the availability of terrestrial thrip larvae (Thysanoptera) and contributed to temporal variation in trophic niche differentiation. These findings show that the relative magnitudes of intra- and interspecific diet differentiation can change over time in systems that receive seasonal resource pulses. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of food webs and the need to incorporate sampling over relevant temporal scales to understand species interactions.

AB Questions Do tree species in seasonally dry tropical forests differ in the timing of their secondary growth? And in their growth rates between consecutive years? If so, how are these contrasting patterns linked to seasonality in climatic variables (temperature, precipitation)? Which is the role of leaf phenology and functional traits as drivers of stem radial increment responses to climate?
   Location A Tumbesian tropical dry forest in southern Ecuador.
   Methods We used a 12-year database of stem radial increments to characterize intra- and inter-annual patterns of secondary growth in 13 co-existing dominant tree species. For each species, we adjusted an additive model to describe intra-annual increment patterns and created a mean series of annual increments to describe inter-annual changes. Adjusted increments were then correlated with monthly temperature and rainfall data over the study period, and also with the crown percentage covered by leaves. The role of functional traits (leaf area, wood density, maximum tree height, seed dry mass) was explored using average trait values per species.
   Results We observed continuous variation in the seasonality of radial increments, ranging from species that started incrementing their diameter as early as first rains occurred in the season to species that showed delayed responses. Variability in intra- and inter-annual increment patterns was explained by functional traits (leaf area and seed dry mass, and maximum height and wood density, respectively) and leaf phenology, but this variation was not clearly matched with any functional trait configuration. This, combined with the absence of homogeneous responses of annual growth rates to climate, suggests the existence of contrasting strategies that virtually vary in a species-specific fashion.
   Conclusions Co-existing tree species in seasonally dry tropical forests show different growth strategies to face intra- and inter-annual climate variations, which may increase the resilience of these forests against projected climatic variations.

AB Recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot, coastal forests in eastern Africa are currently reduced to fragments amidst human modified habitats. Managing for biodiversity depends on our understanding of how many and which species can persist in these modified areas. Aiming at clarifying how habitat structure changes affect bat assemblage composition and richness, we used ground-level mist nets at Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF) and adjacent farmlands. Habitat structure was assessed using the point-centered quarter (PCQ) method at 210 points per habitat. We captured a total of 24 bat species (ASF: 19, farmlands: 23) and 5217 individuals (ASF: 19.1%, farmlands: 82.9%). Bat diversity was higher at ASF (H', ASF: 1.48 +/- 0.2, farm: 1.33 +/- 0.1), but bat richness and abundance were higher in farmlands [Chaol, ASF: 19 (19-25), farmlands: 24 (24-32) species (95% confidence interval [CI])]. Understory vegetation and canopy cover were highest at ASF and the lower bat richness and abundance observed may be the result of the under-sampling of many clutter tolerant and high flying species. Future surveys should combine different methods of capture and acoustic surveys to comprehensively sample bats at ASF. Nonetheless, the rich bat assemblages observed in farmlands around ASF should be valued and landowners encouraged to maintain orchards on their farms.

AB The Brazilian Amazon harbours 70 % of the world's tropical forests and is essential to the country's economy because it maintains biodiversity, sustains the livelihoods of the indigenous people and local communities, and provides ecosystem services such as water production, soil stabilization, flood prevention, and climate regulation. In the last three decades, the Brazilian government has established a regional protected area (PA) network that currently covers approximately 48 % of the region. Despite their importance, some sectors of the Brazilian society have argued that the expansion of the PM across the region hampers the local economic development, because they make less area available for non-forest economic activities such as large-scale agriculture, mining, and power generation. In this study, we analysed the relationship between local economic growth and PA coverage in 516 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon from 2004 to 2014. We modelled the impact of the coverage of the three types of PM (strictly-protected, multiple-use, and indigenous lands) on the (i) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the real gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita), and (ii) real gross value added per capita (GVA per capita) of the agriculture, industry, services, and government sectors in each municipality. The models also considered the following control variables at the municipal level: area, age, per capita GPD in 2004 (or per capita GVAs in 2004), population growth rate between 2004 and 2014, education index, deforested area outside PA per capita, deforested area inside PA per capita, degraded area outside PA per capita, degraded area inside PA per capita, and presence of illegal mining within PA. We applied spatial Durbin error models (SDEM) to analyse the direct, indirect, and total impacts of the PM on the local economic growth. We did not find a statistically significant relationship between the local economic growth and PA coverage in any of the three PA groups evaluated. Only the total impact of the GVA per capita of the industry was negatively correlated with the coverage of the strictly-protected PM. Our findings do not support the arguments used by some interest groups of the Brazilian society that the social and environmental gains generated through the expansion of PM across the region constrain the overall local economic growth.

AB Humans have been part of the ecology of Southeast Asian rainforests for millennia. Understanding the hunting practices of forest-dwelling people is important for designing policies and practices aimed to protect both vulnerable wildlife populations and human communities. The Jahai people are forest-dwelling hunter-gatherers living in northern Peninsular Malaysia and believed to be direct descendants of the first anatomically modern humans that arrived to the Malay Peninsula at least 50,000 years ago. We conducted semi-structured interviews in three Jahai villages around the Royal Belum State Park, asking about their knowledge and hunting habits of 11 wild mammal species. Specifically, we asked whether they were able to identify and whether they hunted the 11 animals, their relative prey preference, perceived trends of the animals' populations, and how they hunted and handled them. Our respondents were familiar with all the species in the survey. None of the 87 respondents claimed to hunt tigers and elephants. The most preferred and commonly hunted species were medium-sized arboreal animals (gibbons and giant squirrels, hunted by >80% of respondents), whereas larger and more dangerous animals (gaur, sun bear, and tapir) were only hunted by a minority (<10%). The Jahai use traditional hunting methods, mainly blowpipes, spears, traditional snares, and fire traps (for smoking animals out of burrows). Only two respondents reported using firearms. Elephant numbers were perceived to be stable; all the other species were perceived to be declining moderately. Almost all the meat caught by the Jahai is for self-consumption, very little is traded with outsiders. The impacts of Jahai hunting on wildlife populations remain unclear, but our study provides a fundamental understanding of Jahai hunting practices for future management and conservation purposes.

AB Human activities change the biodiversity of ecological communities in at least three dimensions: ecologically, taxonomically and functionally. Gathering information on these three dimensions allows the improvement of biodiversity assessments and the increased understanding of anthropogenic impact on natural communities. In this study, we analysed the spider community associated with the tropical plant Heliconia aurantiaca in two contrasting habitat types: continuous forest and forest fragments in south-eastern Mexico. We examined the foliage, stems and bracts of H. aurantiaca individuals in both habitats. We categorized each spider species according to its behavioural and functional traits. We analysed ecological diversity using Hill numbers, taxonomic distinctness and functional diversity using the FRic index. Overall, we collected a total of 110 spiders, of which 44 individuals from 29 species were found in continuous forests, with 66 individuals from 36 species in forest fragments. We found greater ecological diversity in continuous forest than in fragments. In contrast, we found lower functional diversity in continuous forest than in fragments. Taxonomic diversity showed no significant difference between habitats. Forest fragmentation affected the biodiversity of spiders by disrupting species composition and function, which may lead to other ecological changes such as predator-prey interactions and other aspects of ecosystem functioning.

AB Aim In Amazonia, 227 of c. 16,000 tree species account for half the individual trees (termed 'hyperdominant' species), and a disproportionate number of these species are palms. Our objectives are to show how and whether palm abundance has changed through the Holocene. Here, we reconstruct a detailed fire and vegetation history from north-western Amazonia, with a focus on changes in palm abundances, and compare our results with regional data.
   Location Amacayacu, Colombia.
   Taxon Amazonian palms.
   Methods We performed charcoal and phytolith analysis on soil cores, and obtained ages of past fires using C-14 dating. We measured charcoal abundances and the relative abundances of phytoliths (silica-based microfossils) for all samples. We used these data to reconstruct changes in fire and vegetation, and compared these data with the species composition of palms in the modern forest.
   Results Seven C-14 dates from charcoal in three cores provided fire ages ranging from 1630 to 2450 calibrated years before present. Charcoal was absent from one-third of the cores. Palm phytoliths from genera such as Iriartea, Socratea, and Astrocaryum have increased through time, while genera such as Euterpe, Hyospathe, and Oenocarpus have remained relatively stable and similar to modern levels. Overall, palm abundances were negatively correlated with charcoal measurements. Decorated sphere phytoliths, produced from unknown arboreal taxa were positively correlated with charcoal presence and abundance.
   Main conclusions Palms have increased at Amacayacu and other forest plots through time, but the increases are largest in north-western Amazonia. The presence of fire, however, dampens the increase in palms through time. When compared with reconstructions from other Amazon regions, our results suggest that increases in palm abundances in the late Holocene occurred both in the presence and absence of direct pre-Columbian human influence, and that response was strongest in north-western Amazonia when human influence was minimal.

AB Most strategies for limiting global climate change invoke the use of bioenergy, but biofuel crops vary in climate mitigation potential and in the provision of other ecosystem services. The predominant biofuel in North America is ethanol produced from corn Zea mays. Corn is grown on similar to 360,000 km(2) of land in the U.S. and similar to 40 % of the yield is used for ethanol production. Despite its prevalence, corn ethanol is a poor climate change mitigator and the spread of intensive corn agriculture also leads to the loss of biodiversity and an unknown complement of associated ecosystem services. To test for effects of land use intensity on the provision of ecosystem services from biofuel crops, we compared insect communities inhabiting long-term experiments in which land use intensity varied from annual corn production to less intensive native perennial biofuel crops (switchgrass and restored prairie) and unmanaged native forests. Within the experiments we focused on ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera), including their diversity, abundance, functional traits, and predation of biofuel crop pests. Native perennial biofuel crops supported up to 185 % more ant species than corn fields and provided up to 55 % more natural pest suppression. They also contained higher functional richness by supporting social parasites and seed dispersing ants that were absent in corn. Biofuel crops did not differ in ant activity or the prevalence of introduced ants. Our results highlight tradeoffs in bioenergy production and suggest ways to maximize benefits for wildlife and people. Converting some corn fields to prairie or other native vegetation could restore landscapes while mitigating climate change and meeting energy needs.

AB We can say that studies on diversity provide knowledgeable insights into which areas with different compositions will be initially preserved or those which require more attention for government supervision. Thus, we aim to evaluate the alpha, beta and gamma diversity of the Myrtaceae assemblages as a tool for indicating priority conservation areas. Herein we explore the different levels of diversity resulting from fragments distributed along an altitudinal gradient in the Subtropical Araucaria Forest in the Santa Catarina Plateau of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In sequence, the Jaccard index and ordination by Detrended Correspondence Analysis were used for the beta-diversity analysis and floristic substitution. Finally, the spatial dependence was analyzed by the Mantel Test based on floristic and geographical distances. Our results show that Myrtaceae assemblages along the altitude gradient are characterized by heterogeneous floristic compositions (beta-diversity 0.55-0.95 variation), in which fragments above 1300 m are physiognomically marked by a predominance of the Myrceugenia and Myrcia genera. Higher altitudinal amplitude was characterized as an indicator for selecting complementary fragments due to dependence on beta-diversity (r = 0.6961; p-value = 0.001), aiming at greater conservation effectiveness. In this sense, the LGS and URI complementary fragments are strategic because they comprise high beta diversity, high richness, the presence of exclusive and endemic species, and are located in different river basins. Our results show beta diversity as an effective tool for indicating priority areas for the conservation of Myrtaceae assemblages in AF, however it is essential to consider the exclusive and endemic species together.

AB Termite mounds create nutrient hotspots that serve as key resource areas for savanna vegetation and mammalian herbivores. However, despite the key ecological roles performed by termite mounds, few studies have investigated their influence on invertebrate communities, and none have examined such effects across environmental gradients. We hypothesised that termite mounds would support greater numbers of invertebrates than the surrounding savanna matrix and that assemblages would differ in composition due to the enhanced nutritional quality of vegetation on mounds. We also predicted that the differences between on-mound and off-mound invertebrate diversity would be more pronounced in areas where the difference in nutritional value between mounds and the savanna matrix vegetation was most prominent. We tested these hypotheses in Kruger National Park, South Africa, by sampling ground- and grass-dwelling invertebrate herbivores, omnivores and detritivores on and at various distances away from termite mounds at three savanna sites of varying vegetation quality across a rainfall gradient. All invertebrate groups sampled responded to termite mounds, but mound influence varied across trophic groups (Orthoptera showed the clearest patterns), diversity measures (changes in abundance rather than species richness) and with mean annual rainfall (strongest effects at the highest rainfall site). Orthoptera were more abundant on mounds, particularly at the wettest site, and there was a positive relationship between mound size and Orthoptera species richness. Ant assemblage composition on mounds differed from that off mounds and beetle abundance was greater on mounds, possibly as a result of concentrated mammalian herbivore activity and faecal deposition on mounds. Our results suggest that termite mounds are not only important nutrient and foraging hotspots for vertebrates, but that they also introduce heterogeneity in invertebrate communities, especially in nutrient-poor savannas.

AB Biodiversity in Latin America is at risk today due to habitat loss, land conversion to agriculture and urbanization. To grow their economies the developing countries of Latin America have begun to invest heavily in new road construction. An assessment of research on the impacts of roads on wildlife in Latin America will help define science-based conservation strategies aimed at mitigating road expansion. The aim of this review was to qualitatively and quantitatively assess scientific research papers addressing road impacts on vertebrate species in Latin America. We searched for scientific papers published as early as 1990 to 2017. We reviewed a total of 197 papers. Published research showed an increasing trend in the last decade with a strong geographic bias with a majority of papers from Brazil. Mammals were the most studied taxa followed by birds, reptiles and amphibians. The majority of studies focused on road mortality and at the individual species level. Studies documented an increase in deforestation rates, in land conversion to agriculture, illegal activities (hunting, logging) and the establishment of human settlements. The effects of roads on species richness and populations abundance varied among taxa with no apparent pattern within taxa. Forest-dependent species tended to avoid crossing roads. Amphibians had the highest median road-kill rate, followed by reptiles, mammals and birds. Our results suggest that there is an urgent need for more research, particularly in Central America and to employ predictive tools for difficult-to-sample or understudied species and critical conservation areas. We recommend a two-speed approach to guide future research: one focusing on quantifying individual species responses towards roads and their implications on population viability; a second consisting of regional or continental-scale analyses and modelling of road risks to species and populations to inform road planning immediately.

AB Diverse anthropogenic pressure has led to land use change in the form of decline of vegetation and fragmented habitats. With rising anthropogenic threats, many species are restricted to fragmented and degraded habitats and declining biodiversity. The aim of the study was to understand the forest health status in Patharia Hills Reserve Forest (RF) using land use land cover (LULC) trajectories along with forest cover and fragmentation approach. Landsat TM and OLI images for three particular days of each of the year 1988, 1997 and 2016 were used to assess spatio-temporal variation in forest cover. Fragmentation model was used to examine the patterns of forest fragmentation in the Patharia Hills RF during the study period. The results indicated an overall increase in forest cover (10.52%) along with rise in human settlements and agriculture, while decrease in grasslands between 1988 and 2016. However, the fragmentation analysis revealed that the health of the RF has been deteriorating. Increasing edge effects with declining core areas were the prime indicators of disturbances on the forest. The eastern border of the RF is under tremendous influence of anthropogenic activities and most of the land use land cover change was observed in that side. Human settlements, agriculture, and developmental activities were main contributors to forest fragmentation at that side of the RF, while better protection at the international border area was the major factor to increase forested areas at the western part of the RF. Forest fragmentation has a large impact on biodiversity and increase risks for survival for many species, especially primate and the migratory elephant would suffer more in the study area. Fragmentation habitats would lead to increasing Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). To control the habitat fragmentation, proper management strategies should be prepared which include afforestation in the perforated areas, reduce anthropogenic pressures, and demarcate the RF for its better protection.

AB Understanding species' tolerance to recurrent extreme droughts is key to predict species' performance and forest dynamics under ongoing climate change. Inter-specific differences in juvenile responses can largely shape forest composition and structure. However, the vulnerability of tree species is typically evaluated in adult canopy dominant individuals. The question of whether inter-specific differences in drought tolerance vary between adult and young trees remains largely unexplored. We sampled canopy dominant trees and saplings of three co-occurring pine species with different drought tolerance (Pinus pinaster, P. nigra and P. sylvestris) in a relict forest in the Northern Iberian plateau. Using basal area increment in canopy dominant trees and shoot elongation in saplings, we reconstructed annual growth for the period 2000-2015 and calculated resilience and resistance indices to two consecutive extreme droughts (2005 and 2012). We used generalized least square models to analyze species-specific differences in resistance and resilience in adults and saplings, respectively after accounting for tree size and stand basal area effects. In addition, we recorded living and dead saplings to assess inter-specific dissimilarities after the drought events. Drought events strongly reduced the growth of both adults and saplings (40% on average), but they were more resilient to the 2005 than to the 2012 drought. Increased magnitude and frequency of drought events led to inter-specific differences in drought responses, which were revealed in saplings rather than adults after the 2012 drought. P. pinaster saplings were more resilient than P. nigra and P. sylvestris, consistently to the drought stress experienced by each species in the dry-edge of their natural ranges. Moreover, a greater recruitment and similar sapling mortality confirm P. pinaster as the most successful pine species from a demographic perspective. In addition, tree size reduced resilience whereas basal area in the tree neighborhood did not show any significant effect on pine tolerance to drought. In conclusion, we showed that increased the magnitude and frequency of drought events uncovers species-specific differences in drought resilience in saplings rather than adults. Our results suggest potential shifts in the dominance of P. pinaster as the expense of P. nigra and P. sylvestris under climate change in this relict forest. This highlights the need to include juveniles and demographic rates in models aiming to describe and predict species responses to climate change in dry-edge forests.

AB Information on reference values is one of the great demands in ecological restoration, as they enable evaluating the restoration progress and taking adaptive management measures. Here we aimed to: (i) verify whether ecological indicators are influenced by the area of reference ecosystems (mature fragments); (ii) determine reference and comparison values for comparing the restoration progress; and (iii) check how long restoration forests take to reach naturalness values that are like the reference ecosystems (and can therefore be considered restored). We used the Brazilian Atlantic Forest as an object of study and compilated information about 967 secondary, mature and restoration forests in a wide geographical extension. In total, 14 ecological indicators were assessed in a sampling area of 1,928,024 m(2). We used simple linear regression to analyze the data and descriptive statistics for creating the reference and comparison values. We found that ecological indicators were not related to the area of mature fragments. Thus, they are useful for monitoring reference ecosystems of different sizes, and more attention can be given to the degree of conservation of the ecosystems. We defined intermediate and final reference values from secondary and mature forests, respectively. We also established comparison values for several restoration stages using data of planting, assisted and unassisted restoration areas. At the same time, we applied the concept of naturalness in restoration and obtained a continuum of naturalness, which was very useful for tracking the restoration progress. With the reference and comparison values determined, restoration practitioners can evaluate their restoration areas by comparing their monitoring results with ours. Moreover, by using the naturalness concept we verified that indicators can have different restoration trajectories. Some indicators reached similar naturalness levels as references from the beginning of restoration, but others required between one and two decades to recover. This study is the first to create evaluation criteria for forest restoration based on a large data set, and we hope that similar studies can be developed in other biomes.

AB The relationship between plant traits and species relative abundance along environmental gradients can provide important insights on the determinants of community structure. Here we bring extensive data on six key traits (specific leaf area (SLA), seed mass, seed germination rate, height, leaf proline content and photosynthesis rate) to test trait-abundance relationships in a successional chronosequence of subalpine meadow plant communities. Our results show that in late-successional meadows, abundant species had higher values for seed mass, seed germination rate, and SLA, but had lower values for height, photosynthesis rate, and leaf proline content than rarer species. The opposite patterns of trait-abundance relationships were observed for early-successional meadows. Observations of strong trait convergence and divergence in these successional communities lend greater support for niche processes compared to neutral community assembly. We conclude that species' niches that determine plant growth (plant height and photosynthesis rate), carbon balance (SLA, photosynthesis rate), regeneration (seed mass and seed germination rate), and abiotic stress resistance (leaf proline content) under different environmental conditions have strong influence on species relative abundance in these sub-alpine meadow communities during succession.

TI Mapping Atlantic rainforest degradation and regeneration history with
   indicator species using convolutional network
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB The Atlantic rainforest of Brazil is one of the global terrestrial hotspots of biodiversity. Despite having undergone large scale deforestation, forest cover has shown signs of increases in the last decades. Here, to understand the degradation and regeneration history of Atlantic rainforest remnants near Sao Paulo, we combine a unique dataset of very high resolution images from Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 (0.5 and 0.3m spatial resolution, respectively), georeferenced aerial photographs from 1962 and use a deep learning method called U-net to map (i) the forest cover and changes and (ii) two pioneer tree species, Cecropia hololeuca and Tibouchina pulchra. For Tibouchina pulchra, all the individuals were mapped in February, when the trees undergo mass-flowering with purple and pink blossoms. Additionally, elevation data at 30m spatial resolution from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and annual mean climate variables (Terraclimate datasets at similar to 4km of spatial resolution) were used to analyse the forest and species distributions. We found that natural forests are currently more frequently found on south-facing slopes, likely because of geomorphology and past land use, and that Tibouchina is restricted to the wetter part of the region (southern part), which annually receives at least 1600 mm of precipitation. Tibouchina pulchra was found to clearly indicate forest regeneration as almost all individuals were found within or adjacent to forests regrown after 1962. By contrast, Cecropia hololeuca was found to indicate older disturbed forests, with all individuals almost exclusively found in forest fragments already present in 1962. At the regional scale, using the dominance maps of both species, we show that at least 4.3% of the current region's natural forests have regrown after 1962 (Tibouchina dominated, similar to 4757 ha) and that similar to 9% of the old natural forests have experienced significant disturbance (Cecropia dominated).

AB Space-use and foraging strategies are important facets to consider in regard to the ecology and conservation of primates. For this study, we documented movement, ranging, and foraging patterns of northern pigtailed macaques (Macaca leonina) for 14 months in a degraded habitat with old growth Acacia and Eucalyptus plantations at the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve in northeastern Thailand. We used hidden Markov models and characteristic hull polygons to analyze these patterns in regard to fruit availability. Macaques' home range (HR) was 599 ha and spanned through a natural dry-evergreen forest (DEF), and plantation forest. Our results showed that active foraging increased with higher fruit availability in DEF. Macaques changed to a less continuous behavioral state during periods of lower fruit availability in DEF, repeatedly moving from foraging to transiting behavior, while extending their HR further into plantation forest and surrounding edge areas. Concomitantly, macaques shifted their diet from fleshy to dry fruit such as the introduced Acacia species. Our results showed that the diet and movement ecology adaptations of northern pigtailed macaques were largely dependent on availability of native fruits, and reflected a "high-cost, high-yield" foraging strategy when fresh food was scarce and dry fruit was available in plantation forest. Conversely, wild-feeding northern pigtailed macaque populations inhabiting pristine habitat approached a "low-cost, low-yield" foraging strategy. Our results outline the effects of habitat degradation on foraging strategies and show how a flexible species can cope with its nutritional requirements.

AB High-altitude ecosystems are found in mountain chains and plateaus worldwide. These areas tend to be underrepresented in insect biodiversity assessments because of the challenges related to systematic survey at these elevations, such as extreme climatic and geographic conditions. Nonetheless, high-altitude ecosystems are of paramount importance because they have been seen to be species pumps for other geographic areas, such as adjacent locations, functioning as buffers for population declines. Moreover, these ecosystems and their biodiversity have been proposed to be fast-responding indicators of the impacts caused by global climate change. Bees have been highlighted among the insect groups that have been affected by these problems. This work used bees as a proxy to demonstrate and reinforce the importance of systematic surveys of high-altitude ecosystems. Here, field collections were undertaken and an updated review was conducted for the native bee biodiversity of the high-altitude ecosystem found at the Andes system of central Chile, including the phenological trends of these insects during the flowering season. Of the 58 species that have been described for this location, we were able to confirm the occurrence of 46 of these species as a result of our sampling. In addition, thanks to these recent collections, a new species of Xeromelissa Cockerell is described in the present work. These findings highlight the need for further high-altitude insect surveys of this biome, which include both temporal and spatial complexity in their design, to allow for accurate assessment of bee species diversity and compositional changes in these mountain regions.

AB Globally, biodiversity has declined at an unprecedented rate, challenging the viability of ecosystems, species, and ecological functions and their corresponding services. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs have been established and implemented worldwide to combat the degradation or loss of essential ecosystems and ecosystem services without sacrificing the well-being of people. With an overarching goal of reducing soil erosion, China's Grain-to-Green program (GTGP) converts cropland to forest or grassland. As one of the largest PES programs in the world, GTGP has great potential to offer biodiversity conservation co-benefits. To consider how GTGP may influence biodiversity, we measured forest structure and plant and wildlife species diversity at both GTGP forest and natural forest sites in Fangjingshan National Nature Reserve, China. We also evaluated the relationship between canopy cover and biodiversity measures to test whether forest cover, the most commonly measured and reported ecological metric of PES programs, might act as a good proxy for other biodiversity related parameters. We found that forest cover and species diversity increased after GTGP implementation as understory and overstory plant cover, and understory and midstory plant diversity at GTGP sites were similar to natural forest. Our results suggest that GTGP may also have been associated with increased habitat for protected and vulnerable wildlife species including Elliot's pheasant (Syrmaticus ellioti), hog badger (Arctonyx collaris), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Nevertheless, we identified key differences between GTGP forest and natural forest, particularly variation in forest types and heterogeneity of overstory vegetation. As a result, plant overstory diversity and wildlife species richness at GTGP forest were significantly lower than at natural forest. Our findings suggest, while forest cover may be a good proxy for some metrics of forest structure, it does not serve as a robust proxy for many biodiversity parameters. These findings highlight the need for and importance of robust and representative indicators or proxy variables for measuring ecological effects of PES programs on compositional and structural diversity. We demonstrate that PES may lead to biodiversity co-benefits, but changes in program implementation could improve the return on investment of PES programs to support conservation of biodiversity.

AB From its inception as a scientific discipline, tree-ring research has been used as a trans-disciplinary tool for dating and environmental reconstruction. Tree-ring chronologies in some regions extend back many thousands of years, opening up new potential for the study of climate, people, and ecology at annual and sub-annual resolution. As such, they are a frequently used resource for a diverse range of studies spanning the Holocene. They are also the focus of a constantly evolving array of analytical techniques and multidisciplinary approaches to research questions. This literature review discusses case studies at the cutting-edge of interdisciplinary tree-ring research, notes recent breakthroughs and limitations, and identifies key frontiers for the future of tree-ring research.

AB Context Post-fire tree mortality is a spatially structured process driven by interacting factors across multiple scales. However, empirical models of fire-caused tree mortality are generally not spatially explicit, do not differentiate among scales, and do not differentiate immediate from delayed mortality. Objectives We aimed to quantify cross-scale linkages between forest structure-including spatial patterns of trees-and the progression of mortality 1-4 years post-fire in terms of rates, causes, and underlying demography. Methods We used data from a long-term study site in the Sierra Nevada, California to build a post-fire tree mortality model predicted by lidar-measured estimates of structure. We calculated structural metrics at scales from individual trees to 90 x 90 m neighborhoods and combined them with metrics for topography, site water balance, and burn weather to predict immediate and delayed post-fire tree mortality. Results Mortality rates decreased while average diameter of newly killed trees increased each year post-fire. Burn weather predictors as well as interactive terms across scales improved model fit and parsimony. Including landscape-scale information improved finer-scale predictions but not vice versa. The amount of fuel, fuel configuration, and burning conditions predicted total mortality at broader scales while tree group-scale fuel connectivity, tree species fire tolerance, and local stresses predicted the fine-scale distribution, timing, and agents of mortality. Conclusions Landscape-scale conditions provide the template upon which finer-scale variation in post-fire tree mortality is arranged. Post-fire forest structure is associated with the etiologies of different mortality agents, and so landscape-level heterogeneity is a key part of ecosystem stability and resilience.

AB Unveiling the relationship between phylogeny and function of the microbiome is crucial to determine its contribution to ecosystem functioning. However, while there is a considerable amount of information on microbial phylogenetic diversity, our understanding of its relationship to functional diversity is still scarce. Here we predicted the total microbiome functions of bacteria and fungi on Earth using the total known functions from level 3 of KEGG Orthology by modelling the increase of functions with increasing diversity of bacteria or fungi. For bacteria and fungi, the unsaturated model described the data significantly better (for both P < 2.2e-16), suggesting the presence of two types of functions. Widespread functions ubiquitous in every living organism that make up two thirds of our current knowledge of microbiome functions are separated from rare functions from specialised enzymes present in only a few species. Given previous estimates on species richness, we predicted a global total of 35.5 million functions in bacteria and 3.2 million in fungi; of which only 0.02% and 0.14% are known today. Our approach highlights the necessity of novel and more sophisticated methods to unveil the entirety of rare functions to fully understand the involvement of the microbiome in ecosystem functioning.
   Significance: The functionality of and within a microbial community is generally inferred based on the taxonomic annotation of the organism. However, our understanding of functional diversity and how it relates to taxonomy is still limited. Here we predict the total microbiome functionality in bacteria and fungi on Earth using known and annotated protein-coding sequences in species accumulation curves. Our estimates reveal that the majority of functionality ( > 99%) could be assigned to yet unknown and rare functions, highlighting that our current knowledge is incomplete and functional inference is thus lackluster.

AB Although savannas are fire-adapted ecosystems, prescribing fire for biodiversity conservation remains controversial at least in some regions where savannas occur. Faced with uncertainty, many decision makers and even scientists are still reluctant to prescribe fire for conservation purposes in fire-prone ecosystems, invoking the precautionary principle. Knowledge gaps on the ideal fire regime, such as how and when to burn, and especially the fear of biodiversity losses, are among the main arguments against fire management applied to remnants of native savanna vegetation. To inform this debate, we assessed the impact of prescribed fires on diversity of plants (different growth forms), ants, frogs, lizards, birds, and small mammals, in savannas and grasslands of the Brazilian Cerrado. We assessed the existing species richness, composition, and abundance in areas subjected to long periods of fire suppression and compared to that observed over a short period after prescribed dry-season fires, within each group of plants and animals. Whenever possible, we carried out separate analyses for grassland and savanna. Burning did not significantly reduce species richness of any of the groups analyzed, but had a positive effect on richness of graminoids in grassland. When analyzed at the species level, abundance of most animal groups did not show consistent responses to fire, except for a decrease in some frog populations in grasslands. Forbs, graminoids, and subshrubs increased in abundance after fire in grassland areas, though in savanna areas, abundance of forbs, and subshrubs tended to decline after fire. Species composition changed little in response to fire as indicated by low levels of dissimilarity between burned and unburned areas. These results confirm the high resilience of Cerrado biota to fire, as expected for savanna ecosystems in general. Besides, we demonstrate here that the risk of biodiversity losses cannot justify the objections to the use of prescribed fire for conservation purposes in the Cerrado.

AB Microbiome research has increased dramatically in recent years, driven by advances in technology and significant reductions in the cost of analysis. Such research has unlocked a wealth of data, which has yielded tremendous insight into the nature of the microbial communities, including their interactions and effects, both within a host and in an external environment as part of an ecological community. Understanding the role of microbiota, including their dynamic interactions with their hosts and other microbes, can enable the engineering of new diagnostic techniques and interventional strategies that can be used in a diverse spectrum of fields, spanning from ecology and agriculture to medicine and from forensics to exobiology. From June 19-23 in 2017, the NIH and NSF jointly held an Innovation Lab on Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical Data Science Challenges in our Understanding of the Microbiome. This review is inspired by some of the topics that arose as priority areas from this unique, interactive workshop. The goal of this review is to summarize the Innovation Lab's findings by introducing the reader to emerging challenges, exciting potential, and current directions in microbiome research. The review is broken into five key topic areas: (1) interactions between microbes and the human body, (2) evolution and ecology of microbes, including the role played by the environment and microbe-microbe interactions, (3) analytical and mathematical methods currently used in microbiome research, (4) leveraging knowledge of microbial composition and interactions to develop engineering solutions, and (5) interventional approaches and engineered microbiota that may be enabled by selectively altering microbial composition. As such, this review seeks to arm the reader with a broad understanding of the priorities and challenges in microbiome research today and provide inspiration for future investigation and multi-disciplinary collaboration.

AB Loss of habitat area and structural heterogeneity through anthropogenic fragmentation poses a threat to the survival of wildlife, which may be exacerbated by urban pressures. Understanding the underlying ecological processes that influence species' persistence in fragmented landscapes is vital for conservation. We described the effects of forest fragmentation via measures of patch size and isolation on the taxonomic richness and functional richness of forest bird communities in five Protected Areas within the urban-forest mosaic of the Durban Metropolitan Area, South Africa. We conducted 137 fixed-radius point-count surveys across 41 distinct forest patches during the austral breeding season. We quantified the avian taxonomic, guild and functional richness and measured at each survey patch. We measured the influence of patch size, Euclidean isolation distance, patch shape and habitat configuration (i.e. habitat amount) on each diversity measure. We then conducted a series of General Linear Models to determine how fragmentation and patch configuration influenced the diversity of forest birds. The explanatory variables in the top models had a significant effect on all avian diversity measures but habitat amount did not. The amount of habitat surrounding a patch was not significant for measures of bird diversity but based on the Akaike's weight it was important for specialist species. Isolation distance did not have a significant effect on the measures of bird diversity. An increase in patch shape index increased species richness. These results show the importance of large forest fragments/patches for the conservation of forest birds and for maintaining ecosystem functioning and services of forests in increasingly urbanising landscapes, to the benefit of the environment and its human population.

AB While the drivers of primate persistence in forest fragments have been often considered at the population level, the strategies to persist in these habitats have been little investigated at the individual or group level. Considering the rapid variation of fragment characteristics over time, longitudinal data on primates living in fragmented habitats are necessary to understand the key elements for their persistence. Since translocated animals have to cope with unfamiliar areas and face unknown fluctuations in food abundance, they offer the opportunity to study the factors contributing to successful migration between fragments. Here, we illustrated the evolution of the foraging strategies of translocated collared brown lemurs (Eulemur collaris) over an 18-year period in the Mandena Conservation Zone, south-east Madagascar. Our aim was to explore the ability of these frugivorous lemurs to adjust to recently colonized fragmented forests. Although the lemurs remained mainly frugivorous throughout the study period, over the years we identified a reduction in the consumption of leaves and exotic/pioneer plant species. These adjustments were expected in frugivorous primates living in a degraded area, but we hypothesize that they may also reflect the initial need to cope with an unfamiliar environment after the translocation. Since fragmentation is often associated with the loss of large trees and native vegetation, we suggest that the availability of exotic and/or pioneer plant species can provide an easy-to-access, nonseasonal food resource and be a key factor for persistence during the initial stage of the recolonization.

AB Natural enemies of plants have the potential to influence the dynamics of plant populations and the structure of plant communities. In diverse tropical forests, research on the effects of plant enemies has largely focused on the diversity-enhancing effects of highly specialized enemies, while the community-level effects of enemies with broader diets have rarely been considered. We investigated the community of insect seed predators interacting with seven tree species in the family Lauraceae on Barro Colorado Island (Panama). We present one of the first quantitative food webs for pre-dispersal insect seed predators and their host plants, and use the information in the web to assess the potential for indirect interactions between the tree species. Our data suggest that there is high potential for indirect interactions between Lauraceae species via their shared seed predators. The strength and direction of these interactions are largely unrelated to the phylogenetic distance and trait similarity between species but are likely governed by the volume of fruit produced by each tree species.

AB Legacy phosphorus (P) in soil, accumulated over several years of fertilizer application in excess of crop demand, represents a huge and largely untapped resource. P activators can increase the availability of this P to plants by accelerating its transformation into soluble P fractions. In this study, we evaluated the potentials of four "P activators" (oxalic acid, lignin, phytase and ascorbic acid) to increase plant available P in a laboratory incubation experiment with two P-deficient calcareous soils used for wheat production. Samples were analysed for Olsen P, phosphomonoesterase and with Hedley sequential P fractionation. All four treatments had significant effects on different soil P fractions. Oxalic acid mainly enhanced inorganic P (P-i) solubility from the HCl-extractable P pool. Lignin enhanced P lability from the NaOH-, HCl- and residual-P pools. Phytase and ascorbic acid principally affected the organic P fractions (P-o). Oxalic acid and lignin showed most potential to improve P (H2O-P, NaHCO3-P-i and NaHCO3-P-o) availability, which increased by 110-419% and 4.1-122%, respectively. These findings illustrated the potential mechanisms responsible for P release associated with different P activators and reinforced the case for their use in increasing legacy P availability for agriculture in calcareous soils.

AB The "human dimension" of conservation is increasingly recognised as critical for success. Most conservation research involving people is based not on explicit "theories of change", but tacit local knowledge or folk theories guiding programme design.In this study, I propose a schematization of the local socioecological knowledge and folk theories about the "human dimension" of conservation into tacit working models, comprised of individual factors and systemic factors influencing human behaviour in conservation contexts. These are called the Persuasion, Normative, Involvement and Uniformity tacit working models. I review a set of conservation interventions and programmes, in order to assess which of the implicit working models inform their design. I argue that in order to better understand how a project may arrive at different outcomes, the underlying assumptions about human behaviour and the implicit "theory of change" that went into programme design need to be made explicit. This schema does not evaluate different approaches to conservation, but it can help point out the underlying assumptions that structure interventions and that may be more or less suited to particular situations. This can allow researchers to recognise their own assumptions and test them explicitly, leading to the formulation of more reflective and explicit theories, and improving the quality of both discourse and practice in conservation.

AB Background Over the last 25 years, the prominent forest certification system established by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has used by many companies worldwide for claiming responsible forest management. The objectives of the Russian National FSC standard to decrease the size of clearcuts and the retention of forest elements such as residual seed trees need on-site validation to proof the effectiveness of FSC. To assess the ecological impacts of harvesting practices and benefits of FSC certification, we geospatially compared logging activities with and without FSC certification. Within a sample area covering approximately 3,000 km(2) in the east of the Russian Arkhangelsk Region, we used available data on tree cover loss and satellite images to assess secondary impacts of clearcuttings on adjacent remnant forests and to quantify the logging intensity. Additionally, the size and structure as well as the density of skidding trails of ten specific clearcuttings located within the sample area were surveyed using satellite images and in the field observation to delineate the boundaries of clearcuts and forested remnants within the clearcuts. Results We found a significant increase of small-scale tree cover loss in the proximity of the clearcuts. Patchy dieback is possibly linked to the scale and intensity of logging in the surroundings. On the investigated clearcuts, FSC failed to reduce the size, to increase the retention of forest remnants including seed trees on logged areas, and to maintain larger tracts of undisturbed ground and soil compared to clearcuts that were logged before they received FSC-certification. Conclusions Trees and forest remnants remaining inside an increasingly stressed forest ecosystem matrix may not resist further harvesting-related and climate change-induced stresses and disturbances. Large-scale clearcuttings seem to have negative impacts even in adjacent forests and undermine the ecological effectiveness of FSC certification in the study area. The Russian FSC standard is not clearly setting effective guidelines that induce a change in clearcutting practices in order to reduce ecological risks.

AB Despite facilitating transport by low-volume roads for multiple purposes, these roads also open corridors to the remote pristine forests and accelerate forest dynamics with deleterious consequences to the forest functionalities and indigenous inhabitants. We assessed the spatial variations of Hyrcanian forest loss, fragmentation, and degradation resulting from the expansion of rural, logging, and mine roads between 1966 and 2016 in northeast Iran. Various data were employed to generate a precise road network; the density of road segments was weighted on the basis of their carrying capacity during 1966-1986, 1986-2000, and 2000-2016. Three dimensions of forest changes were retrieved using the Landsat time-series and object-based image analysis. The spatial patterns of high rates of forest changes were clustered using spatial autocorrelation indicators. The spatial regression models were carried out to explore relationships between forest change and road expansion. The results showed that rural roads were upgraded but forest and mine roads remarkably expanded in recent decades. The spatial variations of forest-dynamic patterns have been changing from forest loss (1966-2000) to forest fragmentation and degradation (1986-2016). The high density of rural roads was significant on the high rates of forest loss and fragmentation during 1966-2000, and the expansion of forest and mine roads significantly intensified the rates of fragmentation and degradation during 1986-2016. Our findings suggest for mitigating destructive schemes over Hyrcanian forests, developing either protected areas or joining unprotected forests to the reserved areas should be prioritized.

AB Background The eco-evolutionary processes ruling post-disturbance microbial assembly remain poorly studied, particularly in host-microbiome systems. The community recovery depends not only on the type, duration, intensity, and gradient of disturbance, but also on the initial community structure, phylogenetic composition, legacy, and habitat (soil, water, host). In this study, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) juveniles were exposed over 90 days to constant and gradual sublethal doses of cadmium chloride. Afterward, the exposure of aquaria tank system to cadmium was ceased for 60 days. The skin, gut and water tank microbiomes in control and treatment groups, were characterized before, during and after the cadmium exposure using 16s rDNA libraries and high throughput sequencing technology (Illumina, Miseq). Results Our data exhibited long-term bioaccumulation of cadmium salts in the liver even after two months since ceasing the exposure. The gradient of cadmium disturbance had differential effects on the perch microbiota recovery, including increases in evenness, taxonomic composition shifts, as well as functional and phylogenetic divergence. The perch microbiome reached an alternative stable state in the skin and nearly complete recovery trajectories in the gut communities. The recovery of skin communities showed a significant proliferation of opportunistic fish pathogens (i.e., Flavobacterium). Our findings provide evidence that neutral processes were a much more significant contributor to microbial community turnover in control treatments than in those treated with cadmium, suggesting the role of selective processes in driving community recovery. Conclusions The short-term metallic disturbance of fish development has important long-term implications for host health. The recovery of microbial communities after metallic exposure depends on the magnitude of exposure (constant, gradual), and the nature of the ecological niche (water, skin, and gut). The skin and gut microbiota of fish exposed to constant concentrations of cadmium (CC) were closer to the control negative than those exposed to the gradual concentrations (CV). Overall, our results show that the microbial assembly during the community recovery were both orchestrated by neutral and deterministic processes.

AB Negative density dependence (NDD) and niche partitioning have been proposed to explain the species coexistence in plant communities. However, the majority of previous studies have examined either only resource partitioning or NDD, or have focused only on a single life-history stage. We thus lack knowledge regarding the relative importance of biotic neighbourhood interactions and abiotic conditions on survival at the various life stages of a tree.
   Using tree and seedling demographics data, and combined with spatially explicit abiotic and biotic data, we assessed the relative importance of abiotic and biotic variables for survival from the seedling to tree stage in a temperate forest in northeastern China.
   We provide strong evidence that both biotic and abiotic neighbourhood variables affect individual survival. We also observed that their relative importance varied with the life-history stages of a tree. The strength of the effect of conspecific tree neighbours decreases along ontogeny, while the roles of the topographic and edaphic variables increase at later life stages. Heterospecific tree neighbours show consistent negative effects on individual survival at all life stages, yet had the strongest influence on survival at the seedling stage.
   We demonstrated that species vary widely in their probability of survival under different environmental conditions, as well as in response to differences in neighbour identity and density. Overall, the effects of conspecific neighbours varied more among species than the effects of heterospecific neighbour density. Wide variation among species in response to abiotic variables is a necessary requirement for niche differentiation and coexistence via resource partitioning processes. Our findings indicate that conspecific NDD and abiotic niche partitioning are major structuring mechanisms in our temperate forest in northeastern China.
   Synthesis. Both biotic and abiotic neighbourhood variables affected individual survival, but the relative importance varied with the life-history stages and among species. Our results indicated that niche partitioning may contribute to the coexistence through differential responses to abiotic factors, as well as to conspecific negative density dependence (NDD). Finally, our results demonstrated the necessity to incorporate multiple life stages and multiple influence factors when elucidating the maintenance of species diversity in temperate forests.

AB Environmental variation can play an important role in ecological competition by influencing the relative advantage between competing species. Here, we consider such effects by extending a classical, competitive Moran model to incorporate an environment that fluctuates periodically in time. We adapt methods from work on these classical models to investigate the effects of the magnitude and frequency of environmental fluctuations on two important population statistics: the probability of fixation and the mean time to fixation. In particular, we find that for small frequencies, the system behaves similar to a system with a constant fitness difference between the two species, and for large frequencies, the system behaves similar to a neutrally competitive model. Most interestingly, the system exhibits nontrivial behavior for intermediate frequencies. We conclude by showing that our results agree quite well with recent theoretical work on competitive models with a stochastically changing environment, and discuss how the methods we develop ease the mathematical analysis required to study such models.

AB Unveiling the relationship between taxonomy and function of the microbiome is crucial to determine its contribution to ecosystem functioning. However, while there is a considerable amount of information on microbial taxonomic diversity, our understanding of its relationship to functional diversity is still scarce. Here, we used a meta-analysis of completely annotated extant genomes of 377 taxonomically distinct fungal species to predict the total fungal microbiome functionality on Earth with accumulation curves (ACs) of all known functions from the level 3 of KEGG Orthology using both parametric and non-parametric estimates in an explorative data-mining approach. The unsaturated model extrapolating functional diversity as a function of species richness described the ACs significantly better than the saturated model that assumed a limited total number of functions, which suggested the presence of widespread and rare functions. Based on previous estimates of 3.8 million fungal species on Earth, we propagated the unsaturated model to predict a total of 42.4 +/- 0.5 million KEGG level 3 functions of which only 0.06% are known today. Our approach not only highlights the presence of widespread and rare functions but points toward the necessity of novel and more sophisticated methods to unveil the entirety of functions to fully understand the involvement of the fungal microbiome in ecosystem functioning.

AB The Amazonian ecosystems of Madre de Dios (MDD) region, considered Peru's "capital of biodiversity" due to its impressive species richness, are threatened by the rapid expansion of infrastructure. The paving of the Interoceanic Highway in 2010 has brought rapid population growth and environmental degradation, threatening large-scale conservation efforts such as the Vilcabamba-Amboro Conservation Corridor (VACC). To quantify the impacts of development processes and to identify critical areas where further conservation efforts should be focused, we analyzed 20 years of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, drivers, and fragmentation patterns in MDD. We mapped LULC in 1993, 2003, and 2013 using Landsat imagery and modeled the proximate drivers of change related to deforestation, forest regrowth, gold mining, agriculture, and urban expansion in two time periods (1993-2003 and 2003-2013). We characterized habitat fragmentation patterns in four regional target areas. Our results show accelerated deforestation triggered by the road network spreading, mining and agriculture expansion, and population growth. LULC changes produced two contrasting spatial landscape patterns: numerous small forest fragments in the north due to agricultural expansion along the Interoceanic Highway and large continuous forest losses caused by gold mining expansion in the south. Current unplanned development in this region is threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We suggest that further conservation efforts should focus on strengthening the legal framework of the VACC, implementing a sustainable management plan for MDD, promoting agroforestry strategies along the Interoceanic Highway, and preserving smaller corridors for animal movement.

AB The majority of terrestrial net primary production decomposes, fueling detrital food webs and converting dead plant carbon to atmospheric CO2. There is considerable interest in determining the sensitivity of this process to climate warming. A common approach has been to use spatial gradients in temperature (i.e., latitude or elevation) to estimate temperature sensitivity. However, these studies typically relate decomposition rates to average temperatures at each site along such gradients, ignoring within-site temperature variation. To evaluate the potential effects of temperature variation on estimates of temperature sensitivity, we simulated plant litter decomposition using both randomly generated and real time series of temperature. This simulation approach illustrated how temperature variation leads to higher decomposition rates at a given mean temperature than is predicted from simulations in which temperature is held constant. Increases in decomposition rate were most evident at cooler sites, where temporal variation in temperature tends to be greater than at warmer sites. This unbalanced effect of temperature variation shifted the slope of the relationships between average temperature and decomposition rate, resulting in lower estimated temperature sensitivities than were used to simulate decomposition. For example, estimates of activation energy (E-a) were as much as 0.15 eV lower than the true E-a when decomposition was simulated with the true E-a set to the canonical respiration value of 0.65 eV. We found that the estimated E-a was lower than the true E-a for surface, soil, and air temperatures, but not for stream temperatures, for which there was only a weak relationship between temperature variation and mean temperature. Our results suggest that commonly used methods may underestimate the temperature dependence of litter decomposition, particularly in terrestrial environments. We encourage publication of temperature data that include variation estimates and suggest an alternative method for calculating temperature sensitivity that accounts for variation in temperature.

AB Pan-Chelidae (Testudines, Pleurodira) is a group of side-necked turtles with a currently disjointed distribution in South America and Australasia and characterized by two morphotypes: the long-necked and the short-necked chelids. Both geographic groups include both morphotypes, but different phylogenetic signals are obtained from morphological and molecular data, suggesting the monophyly of the longnecked chelids or the independent evolution of this trait in both groups. In this paper, we addressed this conflict by compiling and editing available molecular and morphological data for Pan-Chelidae, and performing phylogenetic and dating analyses over the individual and the combined datasets. Our totalevidence phylogenetic analysis recovered the Glade Chelidae as monophyletic and as sister group of a Glade of South American extinct chelids; furthermore Chelidae retained inside the classical molecular structure with the addition of extinct taxa in both the Australasian and the South American clades. Our dating results suggest a Middle Jurassic origin for the total Glade Pan-Chelidae, an Early Cretaceous origin for Chelidae, a Late Cretaceous basal diversification of both geographic clades with the emergence of long-necked lineages, and an Eocene diversification at genera level, with the emergence of some species before the final breakup of Southern Gondwana and the remaining species after this event.

AB Forest restoration may support recovery and conservation of biodiversity. However, the response of biodiversity to forest restoration is likely to vary depending on the restoration strategy used and taxa considered. Our goal was to assess the recovery of amphibians, a highly threatened biological group, in three cloud forests under different restoration strategies. We compared different measures of species diversity in cattle pasture, 13-year-old forest under passive restoration (P13), 23-year-old forest under passive restoration (P23), 23-year-old forest under active restoration (A23) and mature cloud forest in Mexico. We sampled amphibians in 45 plots and measured landscape and habitat variables to assess their influence on amphibian recovery. We found a total of 13 amphibian species, of which 23% are in the Vulnerable (VU) category of the IUCN Red List and 15% are Critically Endangered (CR). All forests under restoration recovered amphibian species richness and composition, including that of the threatened species, but abundance differed among restoration strategies. Abundance of VU and CR species was higher in A23 than in P13 and P23, but that of CR species was highest in cloud forest. Responses to forest restoration differed among taxa; recovery of salamanders was lower than that of anurans. Proximity to water bodies, as well as high canopy and leaf litter cover, had a strong positive influence on amphibian recovery. Our results indicate that recovery of threatened biodiversity could be promoted through forest restoration, particularly active restoration, and highlight the essential role of mature forest in the maintenance and recovery of amphibian communities.

AB Maintaining heathland ecosystems in an early successional stage is a major aim of most management regimes, such as harvesting, burning or grazing. However, how these types of management affect important ecosystem engineers such as ants, are poorly understood. We registered the density of ant colonies in managed plots (harvested, burned and grazed) and plots with long succession (so forth unmanaged) across six different dry lowland heath sites. With these data, we investigated how composition and richness varied across management regimes and elucidated the direct effects of management from the indirect effects of environmental covariates. Ant species richness was significantly lower in managed plots compared to unmanaged plots. Harvest and grazing regimes were associated with the lowest richness, while intermediate richness was registered in burned plots. Smallest variation in species composition was found in the harvested, followed by grazed, burned and unmanaged heathlands. There was an overall negative association between abundances of organic mound forming species and all types of management, while non-mound forming species where negatively affected by grazing. In addition, Non- and organic mound forming species were indirectly affected through decreasing vegetation complexity. Only ants with mineral mounds benefitted from grazing and burning, but not from harvesting. To promote ant richness and abundance, we propose to downscale the frequency and intensity of management, as well as designating certain parts of the heathland area for later successional vegetation stages.

AB Aims The objectives of this study were to assess how Arachis hypogaea L. (peanut or groundnut) responds to different P supplies in terms of growth and photosynthesis, and to determine the optimum P supply and differential P stress thresholds. Methods We investigated biomass production, leaf expansion, photosynthetic parameters, relative chlorophyll concentration, P700 parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence in a climate-controlled chamber at different P supplies (0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mM). Results Both deficient and excessive exogenous P supplies significantly reduced leaf growth, relative chlorophyll concentration and dry matter production in two high-yielding peanut cultivars. The optimum P range was 0.8-1.1 mM for peanut seedlings. Through principal component analysis (PCA) and data fitting, we found that the trade-off of the normalised actual quantum yield [Y(II)] and non-regulatory quantum yield [Y(NO)] in photosystem II (PSII) under light is one of the best proxies to determine the suboptimal, supraoptimal, deficient and toxic P supplies, because they are the two key factors with major positive and negative effects of PC1, accounting for 75.5% of the variability. The suboptimal P range was 0.41-0.8 mM and the supraoptimal P range was 1.1-1.72 mM. The suboptimal P supplies corresponded with a leaf P concentration range of 4.8-8.1 mg P g(-1) DW, while the supraoptimal P supplies corresponded with a leaf P concentration range of 9.9-12.2 mg P g(-1) DW. Conclusions Both deficient and toxic P levels severely inhibited leaf growth and photosynthesis of peanut, and these unfavourable conditions were associated with significant reduction of biomass and photosynthesis, and photodamage extending beyond PSII. The trade-off of the normalised Y(II) and Y(NO) is a useful benchmark to demarcate deficient, suboptimal, supraoptimal and toxic P-fertilisations levels in A. hypogaea.

AB Aims Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi associate with the majority of terrestrial plants, influencing their growth, nutrient uptake and defence chemistry. Consequently, AM fungi can significantly impact plant-herbivore interactions, yet surprisingly few studies have investigated how AM fungi affect plant responses to root herbivores. This study aimed to investigate how AM fungi affect plant tolerance mechanisms to belowground herbivory. Methods We examined how AM fungi affect plant (Saccharum spp. hybrid) growth, nutrient dynamics and secondary chemistry (phenolics) in response to attack from a root-feeding insect (Dermolepida albohirtum). Results Root herbivory reduced root mass by almost 27%. In response, plants augmented investment in aboveground biomass by 25%, as well as increasing carbon concentrations. The AM fungi increased aboveground biomass, phosphorus and carbon. Meanwhile, root herbivory increased foliar phenolics by 31% in mycorrhizal plants, and increased arbuscular colonisation of roots by 75% overall. AM fungi also decreased herbivore performance, potentially via increasing root silicon concentrations. Conclusions Our results suggest that AM fungi may be able to augment plant tolerance to root herbivory via resource allocation aboveground and, at the same time, enhance plant root resistance by increasing root silicon. The ability of AM fungi to facilitate resource allocation aboveground in this way may be a more widespread strategy for plants to cope with belowground herbivory.

AB This study explored the underground interactions between black spruce and trembling aspen in pure and mixed stands to understand how their soil resource use help these species coexist in the boreal mixedwoods of Western Quebec. We analyzed species-specific fine root foraging strategies (root biomass and root tissue density) along three soil layers (organic, top 0-15 cm, and bottom 15-30 cm mineral soil), using 180 soil cores. We collected cores in three sites, each containing three 20 x 50 m(2) plots of pure spruce, pure aspen, and mixed spruce and aspen stands. Spruce had a shallow rooting, whereas aspen had a deep rooting in both types of stands. Compared to pure spruce stands, spruce had a lower fine root biomass (FRB) and a higher root tissue density (RTD) in the organic layer of mixed stands. Both patterns were indicative of spruce's more intensive resource use strategy and competitive advantage over aspen in that layer. Aspen FRB in the organic soil did not differ significantly between pure and mixed stands, but increased in the mineral soil of mixed stands. Since we did not observe a significant difference in the nutrient content of the mineral soil layer between pure aspen and mixed stands, we concluded that aspen may experience competitive exclusion in the organic layer by spruce. Aspen exhibited an extensive nutrient uptake strategy in the organic layer of mixed stands: higher FRB and lower RTD than spruce. In mixed stands, the differences in aspen rooting patterns between the organic and mineral layers suggested the use of contrasting nutrient uptake strategies along the soil profile. We speculate that the stronger spatial separation of the roots of spruce and aspen in mixed stands likely contribute to a higher partitioning of their nutrient uptake along the soil profile. These results indicate the competitive exclusion of aspen by spruce in boreal mixedwoods, which likely occurs in the soil organic layer.

AB Today, climate change is assumed by many researchers and scholars as a certainty and is presented as the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. It is commonly accepted that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause that is accelerating the process. Therefore, it is urgent to find solutions to mitigate climate change, mainly because the intense effects have already been felt, in many cases in the form of the occurrence of extremely violent weather events. Forests are undoubtedly one of the most effective and easiest ways to provide the function of carbon sinks. However, it is essential and convenient to analyze the permanence time of this carbon in forests, because this permanence time depends directly on the forest management model used. This article aims to analyze forest management models from the perspective of carbon residence time in temperate forests, dividing the models into three types, namely carbon conservation models, carbon storage models, and carbon substitution models, according to their ability to contribute to functioning as carbon sinks, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change.

AB A new species, Hymenaea jeaniana, is described and illustrated. The species is known from one of the best-sampled reserves of Amazon Rainforest, the Reserva Adolpho Ducke, in Manaus, and from protected areas of the municipality of Presidente Figueiredo, in Amazonas, Brazil. Previously, the species has been mistakenly assigned to the circumscription of the morphologically similar H. parvifolia, but differs in certain leaflet, inflorescence, and flower characteristics. The new species has a restricted distribution and is assessed as Endangered following IUCN Red List criteria. Based on herbarium collections and field studies, we present a full species description, an illustration, conservation status, and taxonomic comments. An identification key to the Hymenaea species of Brazil is also provided. There are six species of Hymenaea in the Amazon Basin, including the species described herein.

AB Inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and organic P (Po) occur simultaneously in field soils, and little is known about how they influence the performance of invasive plants. We conducted an experiment, in which three invasive forbs, Conyza canadensis, Eupatorium adenophora, and Solidago canadensis, were subject to 15 P treatments. Three species utilized AlPO4 as a P source; C. canadensis used seven Po sources, and E. adenophora and S. canadensis utilized nine Po sources. Al(PO3)(3), Fe-4(P2O7)(3), FePO4, and phytic acid were lethal to C. canadensis, so was Al (PO3)(3) lethal to E. adenophora. Three species produced more biomass and larger areas of roots and leaves with Po sources than Pi sources; C. canadensis and S. canadensis had similar leaf chlorophyll between Pi and Po, E. adenophora had higher chlorophyll with Po than Pi. The total biomass was positively correlated with areas of roots and leaves. These findings suggest that soil Po might favor the three invasive forbs to grow better.

AB Diversity of producers (e.g. plants) usually increases the diversity of associated organisms, but the scale (i.e. the spatial area of plant diversity considered) at which plant diversity acts on other taxa has rarely been studied. Most evidence for cross-taxon diversity relations come from above-ground consumers that directly interact with plants. Experimental tests of plant diversity effects on elusive organisms inhabiting the leaf litter layer, which are important for nutrient cycling and decomposition, are rare. Using a large tree diversity experiment, we tested whether tree diversity at the larger plot (i.e. community) or the smaller neighbourhood scale relates to the abundance, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity of leaf litter ants, which are dominant organisms in brown food webs. Contrary to our expectations of scale-independent positive tree diversity effects, ant diversity increased only with plot but not neighbourhood tree diversity. While the exact causal mechanisms are unclear, nest relocation or small-scale competition among ants may explain the stronger tree diversity effects at the plot scale. Our results indicate that even for small and less mobile organisms in the leaf litter, effects of tree diversity are stronger at relatively larger scales. The finding emphasizes the importance of diverse forest stands, in which mixing of tree species is not restricted to small patches, for supporting arthropod diversity in the leaf litter.

AB Organic phosphorus (P-o) biogeochemical cycling is known to be impacted by soil-forming factors, yet little is known about interactions among soil-forming factors on the drivers of P-o cycling, soil phosphatases. A comprehensive assessment of lithological and bioclimatic impacts on soil phosphatase activities was conducted using lithological and vegetation-constrained climatic (i.e., bioclimatic) gradients in temperate California forests. Soils (0-5, 5-15 cm depth) from twelve combinations of three lithologies (andesite, basalt, granite) and four bioclimatic zones (blue oak, ponderosa pine, red fir, white fir) encompassing a wide range of MAP (330-1400 mm) and MAT (5.0-17.0 degrees C) were analyzed for resin P (P-resin), P-o, microbial biomass P and total P (P-t), activities of three phosphatases, and soil properties (e.g., organic carbon [OC], pedogenic minerals). Across soil depths, lithology influenced phosphomonoesterase (ACP, ALP) activities more than bioclimate, whereas the opposite occurred for phosphodiesterase (PDE). Correlations of phosphatases with edaphic (e.g., pedogenic minerals, clay content) and climatic variables (MAP, MAT) varied by lithology (e.g., ACP and OC, R-basalt = 0.61, p < 0.01 and R-granite = 0.20, p = 0.28), indicating lithological dependence of bioclimatic impacts. Within bio-climates, phosphomonoesterase but not PDE activities were correlated with OC much more strongly than with pedogenic minerals, suggesting limited lithological impacts in vegetation- and climate-constrained ecosystems. This study demonstrates that the enzymes that catalyze the two distinct steps of P. mineralization, phosphomonoesterase versus phosphodiesterase, can express differential and even opposite relationships with edaphic variables depending on the combination of lithology and bioclimate. Additionally, OC, Presin, and P. may not necessarily be the best predictors of phosphatase activities as commonly proposed. Lithology type and/or pedogenic minerals that integrate lithology and bioclimate context may enable a more comprehensive assessment of phosphatases in soil P cycling sensitive to bioclimatic variability.

AB This paper presents a decision support based on spatial analysis for the evaluation of payments for forest ecosystem services (PES). A focus on the payment range for protective services for shallow landslide is described. The maximum willingness to pay by real estate owners and the minimum willingness to accept by forest owners are computed. The model quantifies the economic risk of real estate depending on the loss probability due to landslide and the presence and protection efficiency of forest. The potential compensation to forest managers considers the difference of the forest expected value from current practices (business as usual - BAU - scenario) to the intervention optimized for PES. A geostatistical approach is applied to quantify the uncertainty of the output. The results indicate relevant differences from BAU to PES in term of an increased protection efficiency and reduced uncertainty. The suitability of protective forest for PES activation is approximately 46 % of the total surface in the study area (Municipality Union of Sieve and Arno Valleys, Tuscany - central Italy). The output also highlights the strong influence of the tree species composition on the value of the PES scenario and indicates that Turkey oak and mixed broadleaved forests are more likely to fall under a PES scheme. Spatial analysis is useful for determining the influence of site-specific characteristics.

AB Despite advances in understanding the ecology and consequences of pine invasions, information on the patterns of structure, dynamics, and growth needed to manage these invasive populations are still poorly known. Here we used tree ring analysis to elucidate growth dynamics, age distribution and fire effects, by sampling three populations of slash pine invading Cerrado vegetation in southeastern Brazil. We found that the invasion occurred in waves, every 5-7 years. These pulses are likely related to the time needed by founder trees to reach maturity, and to climatic events. We found distinct growth patterns among the three study areas. Individual trees in the open sites, under low competition for light, showed an increasing trend of diameter and of the basal area growth rates with age. In the dense stands, however, the diameter increment rates gradually decreased with age, as the competition for light was intensified, and the basal area growth rate increased at lower rates. Growth rates were markedly reduced after fire, likely due to fire impact on the canopies, reducing photosynthesis. Fire scars in the wood allowed us to confirm that the formation of the tree rings occurs annually. When competition for light intensifies as the canopy of the stand closes, the invasive populations experience reduced individual growth of adult trees and constraints to the recruitment of young individuals. We did not find, however, evidence of self-thinning due to competition that could reduce the population of adult trees, open gaps and allow colonization by shade-tolerant native species. Therefore, a monodominant pine stand-the "pine desert" feature of the invaded sites-tends to be persistent over time.

AB Dichrostachys cinerea and Senegalia mellifera trees are the most widespread invasive encroacher species in Namibia. Understanding their growth performance under arid conditions is key to understanding and managing the arid ecosystems of Namibia. To determine their utility in dendrochronology, we analyzed the formation of growth rings for two species from three sites in Namibia. We applied cross-dating techniques to 69 tree discs, the analysis of which confirmed the formation of annual growth rings. The rings are characterised by alternating layers of low and high vessel density and are separated by bands of marginal parenchyma. D. cinerea shows a well-defined pattern of growth rings, whereas the ring patterns of S. mellifera are more complex. Because aging trees tend to display narrower rings toward the outside of the stem, we applied both ring-width index and basal area increment methods in developing ring-width chronologies for the two species. Descriptive statistics for the chronologies indicate that the average ring chronologies are of good quality and that the trees are responding to common environmental signals. The basal area increment methodology produced better statistics than the ring-width index for these two species. Furthermore, statistical characteristics of the chronologies indicate that D. cinerea has a higher mean sensitivity (MS), expressed population signal (EPS), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than S. mellifera. Thus, we find that both species are suitable for dendrochronological study, with D. cinerea being better than S. mellifera.

AB In the Horn of Africa, little is known about temporal changes in hydroclimate owing to the influence of multiple weather systems, the complex terrain, and the sparse instrumental records. Absolutely dated tree-ring records offer the potential to extend our understanding of climate into the pre-instrumental era, but tree-ring studies in this region, and indeed all of tropical Africa, have been rare largely due to lack of an annual climate cycle that reliably produces annual tree-rings. In this study, 40 cores were obtained from 31 Juniperus procera trees growing in the grounds of Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo churches in the Gonder region of Ethiopia. The samples were cross-dated using a re-iterative process involving identifying anatomical features from high-resolution images. The tentative ring-width chronologies were revised after the determination of bomb-peak accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates. Individual series were significantly correlated to the respective master chronologies (r > 0.55; P < 0.05), and expressed population signal values ranged from 0.55 to 0.92. Historical drought years were successfully traced in the chronologies by pointer year analysis. This study confirms that Juniperus procera growing in areas of unimodal precipitation exhibits annual tree-rings and offers the potential as an indirect measure of past climate.

AB The importance of large reserves has been long maintained in the scientific literature, often leading to dismissal of the conservation potential of small reserves. However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.

We built richness maps based on climate and landscape models and analysed them separately to understand their contribution to the pattern of richness distribution. Then, we combined both models to build a consensus map. Finally, we designed specific conservation strategies based on richness categories distributed on the consensus map. Results The regions with high-predicted species richness for both climate and landscape models supported the main endemism locations described for other AF taxa in previous studies. Both models predicted intermediate values of species richness for most regions, but the patterns of richness distribution were not fully congruent. High species richness based on landscape metrics was frequently concentrated in the south. Furthermore, locations suitable for high species richness according to climate are near to the endemism centres, but also to dense urban centres, highlighting the potential impacts of the landscape modification on butterfly species richness. Main conclusions The distribution of fruit-feeding butterfly species richness and endemism reflect the classic division of AF in different sub-regions according to the endemism centres proposed by previous authors for other taxa. The availability of forested habitats seems to be a determining factor for the maintenance of high species richness in AF. Therefore, the loss of natural forest remnants due to landscape modification is the primary threat to butterfly diversity.

AB Flower and leaf herbivory might cause relevant and negative impacts on plant fitness. While flower removal or damage by florivores produces direct negative effects on plant fitness, folivores affect plant fitness by reducing resource allocation to reproduction. In this study, we examine the effects of both flower and leaf herbivory by leaf-cutting ants on the reproductive success of the shrub species Miconia nervosa (Smith) Triana (Family Melastomataceae) in a fragment of Atlantic Forest in Northeast Brazil. We conducted a randomized block-designed field experiment with nine replicates (blocks), in which three plants per block were assigned to one of the three following treatments: undamaged plants (ant exclusion), leaf-damaged plants (ant exclusion from reproductive organs, but not from leaves), and flower + leaf-damaged plants (no exclusion of ants). We then measured flower production, fruit set, and fruit production. Our results showed that flower + leaf-damaged plants reduced flower production nearly twofold in relation to undamaged plants, while flower set in leaf-damaged plants remained constant. The number of flowers that turned into fruits (i.e., fruit set), however, increased by 15% in flower + leaf-damaged plants, while it slightly decreased in leaf-damaged compared to undamaged plants. Contrastingly, fruit production was similar between all treatments. Taken together, our results suggest a prominent role of ant floral herbivory across different stages of the reproductive cycle in M. nervosa, with no consequences on final fruit production. The tolerance of M. nervosa to leaf-cutting ant herbivory might explain its high abundance in human-modified landscapes where leaf-cutting ants are hyper-abundant.

AB The inter-regional payments for ecosystem services (PES) is an important policy to promote regional ecological and environmental cooperation. However, the existing inter-regional PES standard in China may underestimate the value of ecosystem services and omit the value of transferred pollutants due to inter-regional trade. A reasonable framework of inter-regional PES standards is necessary for the policymakers, especially in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region with the most serious environmental problem in China. This paper employed the method of environmental impact evaluation and multi-regional input-output model (MRIO) to build a framework of inter-regional PES estimation, which both contained the regional spillover value of ecosystem services and the regional transfer value of pollutants. Finally, we estimate the amount of inter-regional payment for ecosystem services within BTH region. The results indicated that the PES standards within BTH region were 13.8 billion yuan and 19.2 billion yuan from Beijing, Tianjin to Hebei province in 2012, which accounted for 0.77 % and 1.49 % of their GDP in 2012. These PES standards are effective for regional ecological and environmental cooperation within BTH region and a multi-dimensional marketization mechanism should be implemented to reinforce inter-regional payment for ecosystem services, which may pave the way for other regions or countries.

AB Aggregate extraction is an activity that has increased considerably in recent years in Patagonia, providing raw material for road paving and construction industry. This activity deeply impacts soil composition and the biota. Ants are among the most important inhabitants of soils, and are useful indicators of the impact of human activities on ecosystems. This study determines the effect of aggregate extraction activities on a community of ants in a semiarid area of Argentinean Patagonia. In two abandoned quarries, disturbed and nearby control areas were delimited; ants were sampled using pitfall traps and different environmental variables were measured. Our analysis show that many environmental variables were altered in disturbed sites, with a reduction in vegetation cover, modification of percentage of fine grain and soil humidity, and an increase in soil pH and temperature. Thirteen ant species were identified. The Opportunists predominated in disturbed sites, in particular the species Dotymyrtnex tener. The results reveal for the first time the behaviour of the ant community of this semiarid region in the face of a disturbance that directly impacts the soil. The focus on stress-tolerant species for restoration purposes deserves further study.

AB Habitat fragmentation is an increasingly serious issue affecting primates in most regions where they are found today. Populations of Lemur catta (ring-tailed lemur) in Madagascar's south-central region are increasingly restricted to small, isolated forest fragments, surrounded by grasslands or small-scale agriculture. Our aim was to evaluate the potential for population viability of L. catta in nine forest fragments of varying sizes (2-46 ha, population range: 6-210 animals) in south-central Madagascar, using a set of comparative, quantitative ecological measures. We used Poisson regression models with a log link function to examine the effects of fragment size, within-fragment food availability, and abundance of matrix resources (food and water sources) on L. catta population sizes and juvenile recruitment. We found a strong association between overall population size and (a) fragment size and (b) abundance of key food resources Melia azedarach and Ficus spp. (per 100 m along transect lines). Juvenile recruitment was also associated with fragment size and abundance of the two above-mentioned food resources. When the largest population, an outlier, was removed from the analysis, again, the model containing fragment size and abundance of M. azedarach and Ficus spp. was the best fitting, but the model that best predicted juvenile recruitment contained only fragment size. While our results are useful for predicting population presence and possible persistence in these fragments, both the potential for male dispersal and the extent of human disturbance within most fragments play crucial roles regarding the likelihood of long-term L. catta survival. While seven of the nine fragments were reasonably protected from human disturbance, only three offered the strong potential for male dispersal, thus the long-term viability of many of these populations is highly uncertain.

AB Numerous studies have documented the importance of individual variation (IV) in determining the outcome of competition between species. However, little is known about how the interplay between IV and habitat heterogeneity (i.e. variation and spatial autocorrelation in habitat quality) affects species coexistence at the landscape scale. Here, we incorporate habitat heterogeneity into a competition model with IV, in order to explore the mechanism of spatial species coexistence. We find that individual-level variation and habitat heterogeneity interact to promote species coexistence, more obviously at lower dispersal rates. This is in stark contrast to early non-spatial models, which predicted that IV reinforces competitive hierarchies and therefore speeds up species exclusion. In essence, increasing variation in patch quality and/or spatial habitat autocorrelation moderates differences in the competitive ability of species, thereby allowing species to coexist both locally and globally. Overall, our theoretical study offers a mechanistic explanation for emerging empirical evidence that both habitat heterogeneity and IV promote species coexistence and therefore biodiversity maintenance.

AB Monitoring trends in the extinction risk of species is important for tracking conservation effectiveness. The Red List index (RLI) reflects changes in aggregate extinction risk for sets of species over time (a value of zero means that all species are extinct, a value of one means that all species are categorized as Least Concern). We calculated the first national RLI for birds in Colombia for the period 2002-2016, and disaggregated indices by ecosystems, regions, and species groups. Overall, the status of birds in Colombia has moderately deteriorated during 2002-2016, declining by 0.0000714% per year (the global RLI for birds declined by 0.0297% per year). High Andean forest, paramo, and freshwater are the ecosystems in worst condition. The two regions with the greatest avian diversity contrasted: the Andes has the lowest RLI, and the Amazon the highest. Among species groups, gamebirds, parrots, large frugivores, and forest raptors are the most threatened. Habitat loss from expansion of illicit crops and population declines from hunting were the most important threats. Agricultural expansion, invasive alien animal species, illegal logging and illegal mining are significant threats for some species. Tracking species' extinction risk is important in a country with the highest bird species richness in the world, dynamic spatial patterns of habitat loss, and high levels of endemism. Recent developments provide reasons for both hope and despair. In 2016, a peace agreement ended 50 years of armed conflict. New opportunities for biodiversity conservation, local development based on bird-watching tourism, and advancement in scientific knowledge of birds now occur alongside dramatic increases in deforestation. These new conservation opportunities and challenges provide strong motivation to take advantage of the fact that the overall risk of extinction of birds in Colombia is still relatively low and stable. Effective action is urgently needed while there still is the opportunity to prevent extinctions and safeguard species, particularly those in higher risk categories.

AB Many adult Lepidoptera nectar at flowers of plant species on which they also deposit their eggs. As a consequence, the same partner may act as both a pollinator and herbivore. How high are the costs associated with such herbivorous pollinators, relative to the potential benefits they confer? We addressed this question in the association between Datura wrightii (Solanaceae) and Manduca sexta (Sphingidae), which in southern Arizona, USA is both the plant's most important pollinator (as adults) and most significant herbivore (as larvae). We manually inflicted two biologically relevant levels of artificial folivory (33% and 66% leaf removal) at two points during the growing season, to nearly 200 D. wrightii plants established in a common-garden outdoor plot. We recorded plant survival, growth, and several components of reproduction (bud, flower, and fruit production). We found no detectable effect of damage on plant growth rate, fruit set in the same or the following growing season, or plant volume or survival in the same or the following three seasons. These results suggest that D. wrightii may be highly tolerant of leaf consumption by the herbivorous offspring of its specialized, nectar-feeding pollinators. We argue that this mechanism would likely foster persistence of the pollination mutualism more effectively than would resistance to, or deterrence of, herbivores. Tolerance to the costs of mutualism is an underexplored phenomenon that could contribute to the stability of these interactions.

AB Environmental stewardship (ES) is an established area of research in numerous fields of study, whereas community geography (CG) is a more recent and growing subfield of geography that aims to build capacity and affect change in communities through university-community partnerships. As such, CG demonstrates a shift in geographic research trends that provide benefits not only to the university but also to the students and community/ies as well. I argue that ES and CG research agendas are characterized by a meaningful overlap and attempts to synthesize them will add value to both bodies of knowledge. This paper overviews both of these research agendas, identifies major challenges and gaps in the extant literature in ES, and suggests how CG can help move the ES research agenda forward. I conclude with the notion that incorporating a CG research approach can (a) better develop the ES literature and (b) provide important benefits for universities, communities, and students who are looking for hands-on civic engagement experiences.

AB Limpets are one of the most successful intertidal algal grazers in the north-eastern Atlantic. They provide valuable ecosystem services, playing a pivotal role in maintaining rocky shore ecological balance and have an important economic value, being subject to high levels of exploitation in several oceanic archipelagos. Limpets represent one of the most profitable economic activities of small-scale fisheries in the Madeira archipelago. However, limpets are extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts, such as overharvesting, habitat fragmentation, and pollution. The protection effects and the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) on the population dynamics of two historically highly exploited limpet species, Patella aspera and Patella candei, were analysed through a comparative study of size, reproduction, and biomass in the Madeira archipelago. The effects of protection from MPAs on limpet populations resulted in a differential increase on size at first maturity, shell size, and capture per unit effort according to the degree of protection. Old and enforced MPAs showed the best-preserved limpet populations in the study area, and both variables (age and enforcement) best explained the observed variability among the MPAs studied. A thorough and multidisciplinary study is necessary to obtain a reliable picture of commercial stocks of the two targeted species (P. aspera and P. candei). Genetic analysis and studies on the food source of limpets may shed light to develop integrative conservation strategies.

AB Street trees planted in urban areas are one of the smallest urban green habitats; however, their role as a valuable refuge for local biota is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate urban street trees as habitat for ants. We found ants on 195 (92%) of 211 street trees studied. Seventeen ant species were collected from five tree species. The two most common ant species were Tetramorium tsushimae (on 112 trees) and Lasius japonicus (on 93 trees). The number of ant species found per tree ranged from 0 to 5, with a mean of 1.55 +/- 0.92. The species composition differed significantly among tree species. Nine ant species (Camponotus vitiosus, Lasius alienus, L. japonicus, Nylanderia flavipes, Crematogaster matsumurai, Crematogaster vagula, Monomorium intrudens, T. tsushimae, and Brachyponera chinensis) nested on the trees, mostly in the root zone. Nests were found on 150 trees but were relatively rare on trees with diameter at breast height of less than 40 cm.

AB In this paper we used a co-citation network analysis to quantify and illustrate the dynamic patterns of research in ecology and evolution over 40 years (1975-2014). We addressed questions about the historical patterns of development of these two fields. Have ecology and evolution always formed a coherent body of literature? What dominant ideas have motivated research activity in these two fields? How long have these ideas attracted the attention of researchers? Contrary to what was expected, we did not observe any trend towards a stronger integration of ecology and evolution into one big cluster that would suggest the existence of a single community. Three main bodies of literature have stayed relatively stable over time: population/community ecology, evolutionary ecology, and population/quantitative genetics. Other fields have disappeared, emerged or mutated over time. Besides, research organization has shifted from a taxon-oriented structure to a concept-oriented one over the years, with researchers working on the same topics but on different taxa showing more interactions.

AB Background Coexistence is enabled by ecological differentiation of the co-occurring species. One possible mechanism thereby is resource partitioning, where each species utilizes a distinct subset of the most limited resource. This resource partitioning is difficult to investigate using empirical research in nature, as only few species are primarily limited by solely one resource, rather than a combination of multiple factors. One exception are the shell-dwelling hermit crabs, which are known to be limited under natural conditions and in suitable habitats primarily by the availability of gastropod shells. In the present study, we used two co-occurring terrestrial hermit crab species, Coenobita rugosus and C. perlatus, to investigate how resource partitioning is realized in nature and whether it could be a driver of coexistence. Results Field sampling of eleven separated hermit crab populations showed that the two co-occurring hermit crab species inhabit the same beach habitat but utilize a distinct subset of the shell resource. Preference experiments and principal component analysis of the shell morphometric data thereby revealed that the observed utilization patterns arise out of different intrinsic preferences towards two distinct shell shapes. While C. rugosus displayed a preference towards a short and globose shell morphology, C. perlatus showed preferences towards an elongated shell morphology with narrow aperture. Conclusion The two terrestrial hermit crab species occur in the same habitat but have evolved different preferences towards distinct subsets of the limiting shell resource. Resource partitioning might therefore be the main driver of their ecological differentiation, which ultimately allowed these co-occurring species to coexist in their environment. As the preferred shell morphology of C. rugosus maximizes reproductive output at the expense of protection, while the preferred shell morphology of C. perlatus maximizes protection against predation at the expense of reproductive output, shell resource partitioning might reflect different strategies to respond to the same set of selective pressures occurring in beach habitats. This work offers empirical support for the competitive exclusion principle-hypothesis and demonstrates that hermit crabs are an ideal model organism to investigate resource partitioning in natural populations.

AB We demonstrate the efficacy of power-law models in the analysis of tree branch growth. The models can be interpreted as allometric equations, which incorporate multiple driving variables in a single scaling relationship to predict the amount of growth within a branch. We first used model selection criteria to identify the variables that most influenced (1) the length of individual elongating annual shoots and (2) the total length of all elongating annual shoots in the individual branches of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth). We then applied the two resulting power-law equations as dynamic models to predict the trajectories of crown profile development and accumulation of branch biomass during tree growth, using total branch length as a proxy for biomass. In spite of the wide size range and geographical distribution of the study trees, the models successfully reproduced the dynamic characteristics of crown development and branch biomass accumulation. Applying the model to predict long-term growth of a single branch that was initiated at the crown top generated a realistic crown profile and produced a final basal branch size that was well within the range of field observations. The models also predicted a set of more subtle and non-trivial features of crown formation, including the increased rate of growth towards the tree apex, decrease in growth towards the lowest branches, the effect of branching order on the amount of elongation, and the higher vigour of thick branches when the effect of branch height was controlled. In contrast, a simple allometric model of the form Y = aX(b) was incapable of capturing all the variability in growth of individual branches and of predicting the features of crown shape and branch size that are associated with the slowing-down of growth towards the crown base. We conclude that power-law models where the parameter a is refined to include spatial information on branch features shows good potential for identifying and incorporating actual crown construction processes in dynamic models that utilize the structural features of tree crowns.

AB Lianas are important and yet understudied components of tropical forests. Recent studies have shown that lianas are increasing in abundance and biomass in neotropical forests. However, aboveground biomass estimates of lianas are highly uncertain when calculated from allometric relations. This is mainly because of the limited sample size, especially for large lianas, used to construct the allometric models. Furthermore, the allometry of lianas can be weakly constrained mechanically throughout its development from sapling to mature form. In this study, we propose to extract liana stem biomass from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data of tropical forests. We show good agreement with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.94 between the TLS-derived volume to reference volume from eleven synthetic lianas. We also compare the TLS-derived biomass for ten real lianas in Nouragues, French Guiana, with the biomass derived from all existing allometric equations for lianas. Our results show relatively low CCC values for all the allometric models with the most commonly used pantropical model overestimating the total biomass by up to 133% compared to the TLS-derived biomass. Our study not only facilitates the testing of allometric equations but also enables non-destructive estimation of liana stem biomass. Since lianas are disturbance-adapted plants, liana abundance is likely to increase with increased forest disturbance. Our method will facilitate the long-term monitoring of liana biomass change in regenerating forests after disturbance, which is critical for developing effective forest management strategies.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) is an effective policy in conserving ecosystem services and is increasingly applied globally. The concept of PES was firstly defined in 2005, researches with various terminologies, concepts, and practices emerged since then. This paper analyzed the research patterns of PES studies through bibliometric methods, with a special focus on the trends of terminology, location (geographical research hotspot), types of PES, and PES effectiveness evaluation based on author keywords analysis. The results showed that PES started to receive considerable academic attentions from 2005, and the number of PES publications have relatively kept an increasing trend since then. The most influential journal, country, research organization, and author were Ecological Economics, USA, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, China), and Dr. Wunder. Further analysis revealed that there were various terminologies in PES studies, notably "ecological compensation" and "eco-compensation" (EC) were primarily adapted by Chinese research community. China was the geographical research hotspot and developing countries (Vietnam, Mexico, and Brazil) have received growing academic interests in last decade. "Forest and Carbon" PES was the most concerned types of PES in last five years. There were 125 articles evaluated the effectiveness of empirical PES initiatives, and the majority focused on the social aspect. We proposed two suggestions for future research: (1) adapting EC as an alternative term for PES studies because of its inclusiveness and representation of empirical practices; (2) enhancing integrated evaluation of PES programs to achieve multiple benefits.

AB Land-use change in tropical forests can reduce biodiversity and ecosystem carbon (C) storage, but although changes in aboveground biomass C in human-modified tropical forests are well-documented, patterns in the dynamics and storage of C belowground are less well characterised. To address this, we used a reciprocal litter transplant experiment to assess litter decomposition and soil respiration under distinct litter types in forested or converted habitats in Panama, Central America, and in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The converted habitats comprised a large clearing on the Panama Canal and oil palm plantation in Borneo; forested habitats comprised a 60-year old secondary forest in Panama and a disturbed forest in Borneo that was selectively logged until 2008. In each habitat, we installed mesocosms and litterbags with litter collected from old-growth forest, secondary forest or an introduced species: Elaeis guineensis in Borneo and Saccharum spontaneum in Panama. We measured litter mass loss, soil respiration, and soil microbial biomass during nine months at each site. Decomposition differed markedly between habitat types and between forest vs. introduced litter, but the decay rates and properties of old-growth and secondary forest litters in the forest habitats were remarkably similar, even across continents. Slower decomposition of all litter types in the converted habitats was largely explained by microclimate, but the faster decay of introduced litter was linked to lower lignin content compared to the forest litter. Despite marked differences in litter properties and decomposition, there was no effect of litter type on soil respiration or microbial biomass. However, regardless of location, litter type, and differences in soil characteristics, we measured a similar decline in microbial activity and biomass in the absence of litter inputs. Interestingly, whereas microbial biomass and soil respiration increased substantially in response to litter inputs in the forested habitats and the converted habitat in Panama, there was little or no corresponding increase in the converted habitat in Borneo, indicating that soil recovery capacity had declined substantially in oil palm plantations. Overall, our results suggest that litter inputs are essential to preserve key soil processes, but litter diversity may be less important, especially in highly disturbed habitats.

AB The classification of tree species can significantly benefit from high spatial and spectral information acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) associated with advanced classification methods. This study investigated the following topics concerning the classification of 16 tree species in two subtropical forest fragments of Southern Brazil: i) the potential integration of UAV-borne hyperspectral images with 3D information derived from their photogrammetric point cloud (PPC); ii) the performance of two machine learning methods (support vector machine - SVM and random forest - RF) when employing different datasets at a pixel and individual tree crown (ITC) levels; iii) the potential of two methods for dealing with the imbalanced sample set problem: a new weighted SVM (wSVM) approach, which attributes different weights to each sample and class, and a deep learning classifier (convolutional neural network - CNN), associated with a previous step to balance the sample set; and finally, iv) the potential of this last classifier for tree species classification as compared to the above mentioned machine learning methods. Results showed that the inclusion of the PPC features to the hyperspectral data provided a great accuracy increase in tree species classification results when conventional machine learning methods were applied, between 13 and 17% depending on the classifier and the study area characteristics. When using the PPC features and the canopy height model (CHM), associated with the majority vote (MV) rule, the SVM, wSVM and RF classifiers reached accuracies similar to the CNN, which outperformed these classifiers for both areas when considering the pixel-based classifications (overall accuracy of 84.4% in Area 1, and 74.95% in Area 2). The CNN was between 22% and 26% more accurate than the SVM and RF when only the hyperspectral bands were employed. The wSVM provided a slight increase in accuracy not only for some lesser represented classes, but also some major classes in Area 2. While conventional machine learning methods are faster, they demonstrated to be less stable to changes in datasets, depending on prior segmentation and hand-engineered features to reach similar accuracies to those attained by the CNN. To date, CNNs have been barely explored for the classification of tree species, and CNN-based classifications in the literature have not dealt with hyperspectral data specifically focusing on tropical environments. This paper thus presents innovative strategies for classifying tree species in subtropical forest areas at a refined legend level, integrating UAV-borne 2D hyperspectral and 3D photogrammetric data and relying on both deep and conventional machine learning approaches.

AB Aim Despite longstanding investigation, the gradients of species richness remain unknown for most taxa because of shortfalls in knowledge regarding the quantity and distribution of species. Here, we explore the ability of a geostatistical interpolation model, regression-kriging, to recover geographical gradients of species richness. We examined the technique with an in silico gradient of species richness and evaluated the effect of different configurations of knowledge shortfalls. We also took the same approach for empirical data with large knowledge gaps, the infraorder Furnariides of suboscine birds. Innovation Regression-kriging builds upon two cornerstones of geographical gradients of biodiversity, the spatial autocorrelation of species richness and the conspicuous association of species with environmental factors. With this technique, we recovered a simulated gradient of richness using < 0.01% of sampling sites across the region. The accuracy of the regression-kriging is higher when input samples are more evenly distributed throughout the geographical space rather than the environmental space of the target region. Moreover, the accuracy of this method is more sensitive to the sufficiency of sampling effort within cells than to the quantity of sampled localities. For Furnariides birds, regression-kriging provided a geographical gradient of species richness that resembles purported patterns of other groups and illustrated ubiquitous shortfalls of knowledge about bird diversity. Main conclusions Geostatistical interpolation, such as regression-kriging, might be a useful tool to overcome shortfalls in knowledge that plague our understanding of geographical gradients of biodiversity, with many applications in ecology, palaeoecology and conservation.

AB The lack of implementation of well-designed public policies aimed at the conservation of natural ecosystems has resulted, at a global level, in the decline of ecosystem functioning and, consequently, of the contributions they make to people. The poor enforcement of important environmental legislation in Brazil - for instance, the "Atlantic Forest Law" (Law n.11.428/2006) and the "Forest Code" (Law n.12.651/2012) - could compromise the overall maintenance of ecosystems and the services they provide. To explore the implications of different levels of federal laws' enforcement within the Cantareira System Protected Area (PA) - a PA in southeastern Brazil that provides fresh water for 47% of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area -, we developed a conceptual framework to identify indirect and direct drives of biodiversity and ecosystem changes. We also projected four land-use scenarios to 2050 to test the effects of deforestation control and forest restoration practices on biodiversity and ecosystem services maintenance: the "business-as-usual" scenario (BAU), which assumes that all trends in land-use cover changes observed in the past will continue in the future, and three alternative exploratory scenarios considering the Atlantic Forest Law implementation, the partial implementation of the Forest Code and the full implementation of the Forest Code. Using the land-use maps generated for each scenario, we assessed the impacts of land-use changes on biodiversity conservation and soil retention. Our results revealed all alternative scenarios could increase biodiversity conservation (by 7%; 12%; and 12%, respectively), reduce soil loss (by 24.70%; 34.70%; and 38.12%, respectively) and sediment exportation to water (by 27.47%; 55.06%; and 59.28%, respectively), when compared to the BAU scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of restoring and conserving native vegetation for the maintenance and improvement of biodiversity conservation and for the provision of ecosystem services.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the influence of canopy openness on the survival and growth of Bertholletia excelsa seedlings, through experimental plantings in tree-fall gaps and forest understory in Madre de Dios, Peru. Sixty-four seedlings were planted within the experimental design, with eight repetitions each with four seedlings in two treatments of canopy openness. Basal diameter, height, and incidences of seedlings mortality and regrowth were evaluated for twelve months. Survivorship, and the annual increase in height and diameter were significantly higher in gaps than in the understory (p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed a direct and highly significant relation between canopy openness and diameter increment (r(2) = 0.61), and between canopy openness and height increment (r(2) = 0.34). Due to the greater performance and high survival rate of Brazil-nut seedlings in the tree-fall gaps, we recommend enrichment planting in the clearings of natural forests in Madre de Dios.

AB Aim of study: Seed removal may be a determining filter for regeneration. Factors such as leaf litter, tree cover and seed density affect seed removal. This aims to assess three aspects involving on post dispersal seed removal of four woody species (Lithraea caustica, Maytenus boaria, Quillaja saponaria and Retanilla ephedra) of a sclerophyll forest.
   Area of study: Andean Mediterranean sclerophyll forest of Quillaja saponaria and Lithraea caustica located in the Rio de Los Cipreses National Reserve, Chile.
   Material and methods: Seven experimental plots were set up, in which seeds were offered in an experiment with variations in leaf litter, tree cover and seed density. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used for the statistical analysis. Camera traps were installed to identify the seed removers.
   Main results: Q. saponaria seeds were more removed than the seeds of the other species (0.84, observed mean). Whereas that M. boaria and R. ephedra did not show significant differences on the removal of their seeds (0.77 and 0.67 respectively), both were more removed than L. caustica (0.59). The removal of M. boaria, Q. saponaria and R. ephedra seeds was lower in the presence of leaf litter. No factor influenced the removal of L. caustica seeds. Seed removers were identified as invasive alien species such as Rattus sp. and Oryctolagus cuniculus and native species such as Lycalopex culpaeus.
   Research highlights: Three woody species of this forest suffer severe seed removal by invasive alien fauna with major implications for the resilience of these forests. The coverage of leaf litter is key to hide away the seeds, increasing survival and could promote germination.

A total of 18 ant species belonging to four subfamilies, eight tribes and 15 genera was collected. Myrmicinae was the highest in species number (eight species) followed by Formicinae (five species), Dolichoderinae (three species) and Ponerinae (two species). All ant species were different between two plantations except Monomorium florica (Jerdon, 1851) which was collected for both. Carebara cf. pygmaeus Emery, 1887 was the highest in the number of individuals which was found at Wheat site. Six functional group of ants were detected from all species collected.

AB Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are abundant insects that are essential in the functioning of an ecosystem. They are one of the most ecologically significant and diverse organisms in the world. A total of 16 ant species belonging to 12 genera were recorded from various ecological habitats (Such as field side, road side, town side, and gardens side) from October 2015 to March 2016 at Serampore, Hooghly, West Bengal, India. There were 5 species of 4 genera in both subfamily Formicinae and Myrmicinae, 4 species in 2 genera of subfamily Ponerinae and 1 species of each subfamily Dolichoderinae and Pseudomyrmicinae respectively. The specie number was very low in December and January.

AB Flavonoids are a large class of plant polyphenols with various adaptation functions to environmental factors. The biosynthesis of flavonoids is characterized by a high plasticity of their synthesis and multiple species differences. The HPLC spectra of flavonoid chromatograms from the populations of Juniperus sabina,Glycirrhiza korshinskyi, Achillea millefolia of the South Trans-urals and pulations of Oxycoccus palustris, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Andromeda polifolia oligotrophic bogs in Western Siberia were studied Each chromatograms of all species differed in the number of peaks, peak areas, and peak release times (compounds).
   It was shown that the system of flavonoid biosynthesis is fractal in nature. The species groups of flavonoids have properties of strange attractors. Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) clear differences between species and groups of species in contrasting ecosystems is shown. Thus, species-specific populations of flavonoids and compounds with similar physicochemical properties are a distinct regional product. In this regard, along with the search and selection of individual plant species based on the content of one compound, it seems appropriate to search for effective regional complexes of flavonoids.

AB We evaluate the efficacy of artificial shade shelters in promoting seedling growth and ecophysiological traits in degraded tropical forest land. Seedlings of Dyera costulata were planted in an open control plot and two open-top shade shelters (2 and 3 m in height). Leaf traits, including nitrogen content, the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm), and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) were assessed in the nursery prior to planting, and again at 2, 7, 12, and 16 months after planting. Seedling height, diameter, biomass, and leaf number were also assessed. Shade shelters reduced light intensity to approximately 70 % and maximum temperature by up to 3.1 degrees C. Minimum daily air humidity was up to 12 % higher in the shelters relative to the open control. Seedling growth was better under both shelters relative to the open control, but particularly for the 2 m shelter. Seedlings planted in the open lost roughly half their leaves immediately after planting due to environmental stress, whereas leaves were retained by seedlings under the shelters. A decrease in the Fv/Fm ratio was observed in the open control both 2 and 7 months after planting, indicating photoinhibition. The maximum photosynthetic rate decreased in all conditions immediately after planting, but seedlings under the shelters recovered faster, especially in the 2 m shelter. Decreases in leaf number and photosynthetic capability in the initial stages following planting may limit seedling growth in open conditions. The improved growth and ecophysiological parameters under the shelters persisted for up to 16 months after planting, indicating that shelters may be valuable tools for reforestation and rehabilitation in degraded tropical forests.

ID HISTORY; FOREST
AB Forest fires do not only destroy the forests, it endangers public health, disrupt socioeconomic activities, and contribute to greenhouse gas emission but do more harm than good to the ecosystem. A greater percent of forest fires occurring in the world, especially developing countries have been identified to have human causes. Land use was identified as number one cause while others like conflicts and human errors follow as reasons for which people burn the forest. Governments and cooperate bodies have invested much in solutions that largely control these fires rather than preventing them. This approach has yielded results that do not match the investments. It is in view of this worrying situation that this review was carried out to reassess the prospects of Community Based Fire Management (CBFiM) system as a critical component for achieving an effective integrated forest fire management. The work is structured into four sections, section one introduces forest fires and discusses general causes, and prevailing management tactics, section two discusses CBFiM and its potentials, section three follows up with case-studies from USA, Vietnam, and Ghana, the fourth section concludes with ways of enhancing the CBFiM system to make it more effective.

AB Tropical forests play a crucial component of the terrestrial carbon pool and estimate of above-ground biomass (AGB) with high accuracy is important in quantifying tropical forest carbon stocks. There are several allometries available for estimating tropical forest tree AGB using field measurements, the choice of allometric equation is a decisive factor that can influence the AGB estimation accuracy. This study examined the use of allometric equations to accurately estimate AGB using airborne LiDAR data. The LiDAR data of Ulu Padas area was acquired using Optech Orion C200. 56 field plots were established to collect data on diameter at breast height, tree height and tree species. Field AGB was calculated from allometric equations of Yamakura et al. (1986), Basuki et al. (2009), Chave et al. (2005) and Chave et al. (2014). All LiDAR-derived height metrics and variables were correlated with field AGB (R: 0.30-0.88). Based on stepwise multiple regression analysis, Chave et al. (2014) allometry had highest model R-2, explaining 81% of the variance of the field AGB. In short, allometry that includes wood density should be used in LiDAR applications on tropical forest AGB estimation.

AB Evolution has been viewed as occurring primarily through selection among individuals. We present a framework based on multilevel selection for evaluating evolutionary change from individuals to communities, with supporting empirical evidence. Essential to this evaluation is the role that interspecific indirect genetic effects play in shaping community organization, in generating variation among community phenotypes, and in creating community heritability. If communities vary in phenotype, and those phenotypes are heritable and subject to selection at multiple levels, then a community view of evolution must be merged with mainstream evolutionary theory. Rapid environmental change during the Anthropocene will require a better understanding of these evolutionary processes, especially selection acting at the community level, which has the potential to eliminate whole communities while favoring others.

AB Pair-living is a common social system found across animal taxa, and the relationship between pair-living and reproduction varies greatly among species. Siphonaria gigas, hermaphroditic pulmonate gastropods, often live in pairs in the rocky intertidal zone of the tropical Eastern Pacific. Combining genetic parentage analysis using four polymorphic microsatellite loci with behavioral observations from a 10-week field study, we provide the first description of the mating system of a Siphonaria species incorporating genetic data. S. gigas mated both within-pair and extra-pair and three out of four paired S. gigas individuals produced egg masses with extra-pair paternity. Multiple paternity was detected, but at a relatively low frequency (19% of egg masses) compared to other marine gastropods. Behavioral data indicate one potential advantage of pair-living: paired S. gigas produced almost twice as many egg masses as their solitary counterparts over four reproductive cycles. These observations, together with constraints on the movement of S. gigas, suggest that pairing may ensure mate access and increase reproductive success.

AB The ground vegetation layer is the most diverse plant community in forest ecosystems. We have shown the role of spatial variables, soil properties and overstorey structure in spatial variation of the herb-layer community in a riparian mixed forest. The research was conducted in the "Dnipro-Orils'kiy" Nature Reserve (Ukraine). The research polygon was located in the forest in the floodplain of the River Protich, which is a left tributary of the River Dnipro. Plant abundance was quantified by measuring cover within an experimental polygon. The experimental polygon consisted of 7 transects, each comprising 15 test points. The distance between the rows in the site was 3 m. At the site we established a plot of 45 x 21 m, with 105 subplots of 3 x 3 m organized in a regular grid. A list of vascular plant species was composed for each 3 x 3 m subplot along with visual estimates of species cover projection. The plant community was represented by 43 species, of which 18.6% were phanerophytes, 39.5% were hemicryptophytes, 9.3% were therophytes, 7.0% were geophytes. An overall test of random labelling revealed the total nonrandom distribution of the tree stems within the site. The species-specific test of random labelling showed the nonrandom segregated distribution of Acer tataricum, Pyrus communis, Quercus robur, and Ulmus laevis. Crataegus monogyna and Euonymus europaeus were distributed randomly. The nearest neighbour of Acer tataricum was less likely to be Ulmus laevis. There was no direct spatial connection between Acer tataricum and other trees. Crataegus monogyna, Pyrus communis, Quercus robur and Euonymus europaeus were not segregated from all other species. The nearest neighbour of Ulmus laevis was less likely to be Acer tataricum. Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA) was applied as ordination approach. The forward selection procedure allowed us to select 6 soil variables which explain 28.3% of the herb-layer community variability. The list of the important soil variables includes soil mechanical impedance (at the depth 0-5, 30-35, 75-80, and 95-10 cm), soil moisture, and soil bulk density. The variation explained by pure spatial variables accounted for 11.0 %. The majority of the tree-distance structured variation in plant community composition was broad-scaled. The spatial scalograms were left-skewed asymmetric. Significant relationship was found between the pure spatial component of the community variation and a number of phytoindicator estimations, most important of which were the variability of damping and humidity. Tree stand was obseerved to be a considerable factor structuring both the herb-layer community and spatial variation of the physical properties of soil.

AB The challenge of searching for patterns of species turnover dynamics in communities of living organisms is directly related to solving problems of stability and functioning of ecosystems. Avian communities are an essential structural and functional component of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems which are highly diverse and play an important role in a wide range of ecosystem functions. The issue of changes in the dynamics of amphibiotic landscape complexes, where terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems conjugate, is practically not solved. In this connection, a study was carried out within a landscape system, which presents terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that were in different degrees of anthropogenic transformation. The dynamics of bird communities was considered in the context of recent global climate change. The investigation was conducted in the landscapes of the south and south-east of Ukraine in the nesting seasons 1988-2018. Within the landscape system associated with the Molochny estuary, the ten most important types of ecosystems were distinguished, which included : agricultural lands, artificial forest belts, meadows, islands and spits, reed beds, urban areas, solonchaks, steppe, cliffs, artificial forests. The temporal turnover of the bird communities was decomposed into two parts: the first term (D1) related to the amount of change in community composition, and the second term (D2) being dependent only on the amount of change in community size sensu its abundance. The contribution ratio of the species and of the environment variable were calculated to identify drivers that influence the turnover measure. The average annual temperature and the sum of annual temperatures were considered as environment variables. The bird metacommunity of the studied landscape system was represented by 132 species from 86 genera, 42 families and 13 orders. During the research period the average annual temperature varied from 9.5 to 12.5 degrees C. and the temperature dynamics were subject to the linear trend. An oscillatory component was also present in the temperature dynamics. The annual rainfall ranged 220-761 mm. A coherent change in precipitation and temperature was observed in the period until 2011. After that, the temperature growth stabilized and the amount of precipitation began to fall sharply. The steppe bird community was represented by an extremely small number of species, but demonstrated the ability to maintain a stable structure for a long time. The main fluctuations of the community were quantitative changes in abundance, while the turnover of species was practically absent. Species of the community replace each other cyclically, but there were no targeted changes in community structure. Temperature and precipitation were the main drivers of the bird community in the steppe. The bird communities on salt marshes were characterized by a stable abundance, but a constant directed turnover of species. Reduced water levels and the disappearance of islands in the salt marshes increased the risk of threats from predators, which could lead to a decrease in the abundance of some species. The islands and spits were characterized by high species turnover with quasi-cyclical population dynamics. The main feature of the community dynamics was a decrease in the role of precipitation and an increase in the role of the time factor. The role of temperature remained stably low. The species richness of bird communities in agrarian lands was higher than in steppe communities.
   The turnover measure was significant because of the increased abundance of Alauda arvensis. Over time, the role of precipitation in the community dynamics has been decreasing and the role of time has been increasing. The value of temperature varied, but was at a stationary level. The turnover of species was compensated by an increase in the abundance of bird communities. The obtained results are in line with findings indicating that despite more stable land use intensities in recent years, climate change has not overtaken land use intensities as the main driver of bird population dynamics.

AB Understanding factors that regulate ecosystem responses to disturbances is a long-standing ecological goal and has been useful in predicting the effects of global change. The response of an ecosystem to a single perturbation does not necessarily predict its response to repeated perturbations-highlighting the 'pulse' vs. 'press' framework to predict ecosystem responses to single or recurring perturbations, respectively. This framework can help guide hypotheses around how ecosystems may, or may not, respond to changes in disturbance regimes. Here we apply the pulse-press framework to understand fire effects on soils and plant communities. Specifically, we combine a quantitative meta-analysis on the response of soil carbon and nutrients with a literature review of the response of microbial and plant communities. We argue that fire is a cumulative disturbance driving a 'press' response and can be both coupled and decoupled from the 'pulse' response to a single burn depending on whether the response variable is regulated by the direct effects of heating or the indirect effects of changing plant and microbial communities. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that carbon and nutrient content in mineral soils responded differently because carbon and nitrogen, which are volatilized to the atmosphere in a fire and turn over relatively slowly in soil, are regulated by the long-term losses of plant biomass inputs more so than heating-induced volatilization, and thus change relatively little in a single fire. Contrastingly, the elements calcium, potassium, and phosphorus, which are enriched in ash because of their resistance to volatilization, are regulated by the intermittent pulses into the soil following a fire. A literature review suggests microbial biomass and decomposition activity tended to decline after a single fire because of heat-induced mortality, which was consistent with the effects of repeated burning, likely due to combined effects of repeated heat-induced mortality and lower soil organic matter. Another important 'press' response was how nutrient losses shape the nutrient use strategies of plants (tissue stoichiometry and nutrient acquisition strategy) and how changes in plant strategies influence soil responses. Past studies have generally found that species with low nutrient concentrations in biomass, high nutrient recycling before tissue senescence, and a greater reliance on mycorrhizal symbioses tend to increase in abundance with frequent burning. Many of these traits likely lead to slower decomposition and nutrient availability, but few studies have rigorously linked fire-driven shifts in traits with carbon and nitrogen cycling. The processes we have identified are likely to be especially important in tropical ecosystems, where disturbance by fire is shifting rapidly, attributable to changes in land use and climate. Tropical savannas are some of the most responsive landscapes to altered fire regimes, with large changes in soil carbon and nutrients, suggesting that shifts in fire regimes may change the carbon balance of these ecosystems substantially. We propose that more fire-manipulation experiments are needed in tropical forests, especially in moist forests where plants are not as well adapted to fire.

AB The crucial role of tropical forests in the global carbon balance is underpinned by their extraordinarily high biomass and productivity, even though the majority of tropical forests grow on nutrient-poor soils. Nutrient cycling by litterfall has long been considered essential for maintaining high primary productivity in lowland tropical forests but few studies have tested this assumption experimentally. We review and synthesise findings from the Gigante Litter Manipulation Project (GLiMP), a long-term experiment in lowland tropical forest in Panama, Central America, in which litter has been removed from or added to large-scale plots for 15 years. We assessed changes in soil and litter nutrient concentrations in response to the experimental treatments and estimated nutrient return and nutrient use efficiency to indicate changes in nutrient cycling. The soil concentrations of most nutrients increased with litter addition and declined with litter removal. Litter removal altered nitrogen, potassium, manganese and zinc cycling, demonstrating the importance of litter inputs for maintaining the availability of these elements to plants. By contrast, litter addition only altered nitrogen cycling and, despite low concentrations of available soil phosphorus, the effects of litter manipulation on phosphorus cycling were inconsistent. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying the observed changes, and we emphasise the importance of decomposition processes in the forest floor for retaining nutrient elements, which partially decouples nutrient cycling from the mineral soil. Finally, by synthesising GLiMP studies conducted during 15 years of litter manipulation, we highlight key knowledge gaps and avenues for future research into tropical forest nutrient cycling.

AB This paper contributes insights to discussions of adaptive governance in marine socio-ecological systems by elucidating the conditions which limit or enable the transition from co-management to polycentric governance at the local scale. I offer a comparative study of two coastal communities, Carelmapu and Ancud, which are both bound by the same political structures governing marine resources and are home to multiple fishing unions governed by Chile's co-management policy, Territorial User Rights in Fisheries (TURFs). However, each community has experienced different outcomes in their abilities to transform to polycentric governance at the local scale in the Lakes Region of southern Chile. I suggest that the legislative structures which govern new ocean uses have brought new stakeholders to the table of environmental governance and have shifted power dynamics, creating both opportunities and limitations for the transition of polycentric governance. In Carelmapu, fishing unions have been unable to organize to transform environmental governance because they refuse to work with the Indigenous Communities, who are seeking to form an Indigenous marine protected area. In Ancud on the island of Chiloe, fishing unions have initiated the beginnings of polycentric governance by uniting and collaborating with government officials to form a new institution to govern resources. I first explore how the legislative structures which govern new ocean uses have caused conflict in Carelmapu between fishers and the Indigenous Community, with attention to how conflict and exclusion constrain the formation of polycentric governance. I then examine the conditions under which fishing unions in Ancud facilitated the beginnings of polycentric governance through new management plans.

AB Microbial communities have a preponderant role in the life support processes of our common home planet Earth. These extremely diverse communities drive global biogeochemical cycles, and develop intimate relationships with most multicellular organisms, with a significant impact on their fitness. Our understanding of their composition and function has enjoyed a significant thrust during the last decade thanks to the rise of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Intriguingly, the diversity patterns observed in nature point to the possible existence of fundamental community assembly rules. Unfortunately, these rules are still poorly understood, despite the fact that their knowledge could spur a scientific, technological, and economic revolution, impacting, for instance, agricultural, environmental, and health-related practices. In this minireview, I recapitulate the most important wet lab techniques and computational approaches currently employed in the study of microbial community assembly, and briefly discuss various experimental designs. Most of these approaches and considerations are also relevant to the study of microbial microevolution, as it has been shown that it can occur in ecological relevant timescales. Moreover, I provide a succinct review of various recent studies, chosen based on the diversity of ecological concepts addressed, experimental designs, and choice of wet lab and computational techniques. This piece aims to serve as a primer to those new to the field, as well as a source of new ideas to the more experienced researchers. (C) 2020 The Author.

AB The Munim River basin is one of the main river drainages of the Hydrological unit Maranhao, but there are few published studies which focus on ichthyological surveys and taxonomic work within this basin. The present study aims to provide a fish species inventory of the Mata da Itamacaoca, one of the few urban protected areas from the upper Munim River basin, comparing the ichthyofauna with other lists by conducted at the upper Munim River basin. A total of 42 collection expeditions were conducted, the sampling was conducted at five collecting sites distributed within the boundaries of Mata de Itamacaoca, upper Munim River basin. Diversity indices were calculated and generalised linear models (GLMs) were employed to assess differences in species richness, diversity and evenness depending on season and location in relation to the reservoir dam wall. In order to visualize fish community differences, non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and a one-way PERMANOVA was used to understand whether factors of site, season and location to the dam wall had an effect on fish community compositions. A total of six orders, 13 families, and 23 fish species were found, and the order with the highest species richness, considering all reaches, was Characiformes followed by Cichliformes. The most abundant species was Nannostomus beckfordi, while Pimelodella parnahybae and Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus were the rarer species sampled. There were no alien invasive species collected within the study area. Species richness was significantly higher below the dam wall, but there were no other significant differences in diversity indices with regards to season or location. Fish community composition was significantly different above and below the dam wall and was significantly affected by sampling site. Season did not have an effect on fish community. This study corroborates other studies conducted in the Unidade Hidrologica Maranhao sensu Hubbert and Renno (2006), that the ichthyofaunal composition and taxonomy of species within this region face major data deficits, anthropogenic impacts, this study may be a baseline for comparing similar environments throughout the region.

AB Understanding the territorial dynamics of land use and occupation and the administrative political implications in the decision-making process on the climate issue in the state of Mato Grosso - Brazil is the objective of this study. The authors, in bibliographic research and field studies conducted an investigation on governmental decisions in recent environmental issues in the state and how the trajectories of various sectors influence this construction. In the first part of the text there is a brief reconstruction of the occupational process of Mato Grosso, its territorial dynamics due to the expansion of agribusiness and the phenomenon of deforestation that has already consumed considerable part of the forests of the territory of the State. In the second part, the authors focus on interviews with political managers, aiming to understand the connection of the informant with the environmental theme, their perception of the environmental agenda Mato Grosso in the period from 2004 to 2015, as these perceived the Political interference in the environmental agenda and its contradictions and, finally, an exploratory approach to the different initiatives underway in the state's environmental agenda. It follows from the study a reading that dialogues with the approach of political sociology in recognizing an enlarged range of institutions and actors in the process of governmental decisions, but which is in the interests of the agribusiness sector, which dominates the local policy. As much as there is an attempt by non-governmental organizations and mixed instances to involve the environmental agenda in the Mato Grosso development, the ambiguities are still greatly emphasized by the informants.

AB This study intended to analyze the dynamics of deforestation and land use in the region of Tailandia-PA, Brazil, between the years 1985 to 2015, focusing on the dynamics of the palm oil's implantation. Supervised classification and Landsat imagery acquired between 1985 and 2015 were used in this analysis, with the Maximum Likelihood algorithm use. The classes forest, secondary forest, exposed soil, farming, natural fields, oil palm and water were considered. The results show an old dynamic of deforestation, with greater or lesser intensity in the different historical periods identified, but persistent over time, even extending to the present. There was a 45% reduction in the forested area and the conversion of forests into, mainly, agricultural and livestock. The oil palm area increased by 904% in the period studied, being greater after 2009. It was proven that Thailand followed the Amazon traditional model of occupation, related to logging followed by cattle ranching, which persists, despite the decrease in deforestation. It should be noted that the scenario in 2015 was better, from an environmental point of view, than the scenarios observed in previous decades; however, oil palm needs periodic sustainability analysis mechanisms. Although no new deforestation has been observed for the direct implantation of palm oil from 2008, deforestation still occurs in areas of oil palm expansion and consolidation, which leads us to conjecture that oil palm could also indirectly foment deforestation.

AB We investigated the spatial variation of molluscan assemblages with different habitat-forming species and bare rock habitat in a rocky intertidal zone in northeastern Brazil. The high intertidal zone substrate was covered predominantly of barnacles [Chthamalus bisinuatus (Pilsbry, 1916)], the mid-intertidal of mussels [Brachidontes exustus (Linnaeus, 1758)] and the low intertidal of macroalgae chlorophytes [Gayralia oxysperma (Kutzing) K. L. Vinogradova ex Scagel et al., 1989 and Ulva lactuca Linnaeus, 1753], phaeophytes [Sargassum vulgare C. Agardh] and rhodophytes [Pahsada flagelhfera (J.Agardh) K. W. Nam, 2007]. A total of 3,861 mollusks were recorded, belonging to the classes Gastropoda (9 species; 3,800 individuals), Bivalvia (3 spp.; 54 ind.), and Polyplacophora (1 sp.; 7 ind.). Functional diversity was accessed through the trophic structure, in which we identified food guilds: suspension feeders, grazers, herbivores, and carnivores. The analysis revealed significant differences in mollusk abundance, species richness, diversity indices, and trophic diversity among barnacle belts, mussel beds, algae habitat, and bare rock habitats. The highest species richness and trophic diversity were detected in algae habitat and mussel beds, which showed low abundance. In contrast, barnacle belts registered low species richness and trophic diversity and a high number of individuals. Bare rock recorded low values in all surveyed indices. This result points to the effect of environmental modification caused by habitat-forming species in this system. These species increase environmental complexity and enable the establishment of organisms through facilitation processes. The various food guilds found in this study reaffirm the role of habitat-forming species in providing niches that support different occupation patterns.

AB Extensive use of chemical fertilizers to increase yields of crops grown in rain-sheltered houses may impair the physicochemical and biological properties of the soil. Organic liquid fertilizer based on vinasse produced by sugarcane fermentation is increasingly being used as an alternative to chemical fertilizers. The objectives of this study were to analyze the growth characteristics, yields, and nutrient utilization efficiency and measure the effect of soil microbial enzymatic activity when using organic liquid fertilizer based on condensed molasses soluble with red pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) under protected cultivation. Four different fertilizer treatments were applied: no fertilizer (CON), chemical fertilizer (CF), chemical liquid fertilizer (CL), and organic liquid fertilizer (OL). Soil and plant nutrient contents, plant nutrient use efficiency, and soil enzyme activity were analyzed in each treatment. The fresh and dry weights of red peppers treated with organic liquid fertilizer increased, and fruit dry weight was similar between CF and OL. The P and K use efficiency of red peppers treated with organic liquid fertilizer increased, and the organic matter and available P2O5, K, and Ca contents of soil in organic liquid fertilizer treatment increased compared to chemical fertilizer treatment. In addition, the urease and beta-glucosidase activity in organic liquid fertilizer treatment increased significantly, which may stimulate nitrogen and carbon circulation in soil. In this study, it is shown that the use of organic liquid fertilizer based on vinasse of soluble condensed molasses improves red pepper production similar to chemical fertilizers in addition to improving the soil chemical properties and microbial activity.

ID BIOSYNTHESIS
AB Flavonoids are physiologically active substances that regulate many functions in plants and animals. Despite many years of research, interest in these substances continues unabated, and the market for flavonoids in the health industry keeps growing.
   In South Trans-Urals, the research team behind this paper discovered a significant fluctuation in the accumulation of flavonoids in many local plants. Significant differences were later discovered in the accumulation of physically and chemically similar flavonoids and organic substances; differences were observed between specific compounds within local coenopopulations as well as between spatially isolated populations. This research applied high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to identify the significant differences between single chromatograms in terms of the following features: (1) the number of identifiable substances (chromatographic peaks); (2) peak elution times; (3) peak areas indicative of the substance-specific concentrations in the extract. The diversity of specimens and groups was described in terms of the fingerprint concept to underline the strong "specificity" of chromatograms. However, the accumulation of flavonoids and the concentration of copper, zinc, and other metal salts in the soil were in an unstable correlation. In other words, descriptive statistics failed to identify any environmental factors that clearly regulated the accumulation of flavonoids in the field.

AB Economic approaches to combat environmental degradation and deforestation have resulted in development initiatives such as the Payment for Environmental Services program (PES). This study deals with the effects of PES on women's livelihoods in Thuong Lo commune, Central Vietnam. Employing a feminist political ecology perspective and adopting a qualitative approach, we analyze the gendered roles, responsibilities and effects of PES on local livelihoods. We found that the women in our study portrayed different preferences and knowledge in relation to PES, forest management and livelihoods. Women are often excluded in PES projects due to a range of various socio-cultural factors.

AB The BrazilianAtlantic Forest is one of the world's most biodiverse biomes, with large numbers of endemic and threatened species. However, this biome has suffered extensive deforestation and habitat fragmentation, with a drastic reduction of its original vegetation cover. The compilation of data on the occurrence patterns of anurans and their natural history is important for the development of effective conservation strategies. Here, we present the results of a survey of the anuran fauna of Parque Estadual do Papagaio Charao (PEPC) in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil, providing information on species endemism, conservation status, and reproductive modes. We collected data on the local anurans between March 2018 and February 2019 using active searches and pitfall traps. We recorded 26 anuran species distributed in seven families, with eight different reproductive modes. The largest number of species (20) was found at the forest edge, followed by the interior of the forest and open area, each with 16 species. The most abundant species were Leptodactylus plaumanni (41.7% of records), Physalaemus cuvieri (27.1%), and P. carrizorum (16.5%). Greater species richness and abundance were recorded during the rainier months, while temperature influenced only the abundance of the anurans. Rhinella henseli, Rhinella icterica, Vitreorana uranoscopa, Aplastodiscus perviridis, Boana curupi, Boana leptolineata and Proceratophrys brauni are all endemic to the Atlantic Forest. Melanophryniscus devincenzii is classified as Endangered by the IUCN, and Proceratophrys bigibbosa as Near Threatened. Boana curupi is considered to be Endangered in Rio Grande do Sul state, and Vulnerable in Brazil, while V. uranoscopa is Near Threatened in Rio Grande do Sul. Our findings emphasize the importance of protected areas, such as the PEPC, for the maintenance of anuran populations and communities in the Mixed Rainforest formations of southern Brazil.

AB In this paper, I summarize the plant foods used by four sympatric Paradoxurinae civet species, based on data collected between May 2010 and June 2018, and consider their possible coexistence mechanisms on Borneo. I recorded the plants eaten by them, both by direct observation and fecal analysis, at four sites in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. In total, I recorded 27, 27, 18, and 4 plant food items for common palm civets Paradoxurus hermaphrodites, binturongs Aretictis binturong, small-toothed palm civets Arctogalidia trivirgata, and masked palm civets Paguma larvata, respectively during the study period. The food plant species used by these species studied showed a large degree of overlap, especially among common palm civets, binturongs, and small-toothed palm civets. Based on the results of this study, differences among them in their degree of use of pioneer plant fruits and Ficus, and the acceptance of immature and unripe fruits, could enable these civets to coexist, even in a small area. However, there is no clear evidence for how they are able to coexist. This eight-year record is not enough to fully determine dietary similarities and dissimilarities or the coexistence mechanism of the four sympatric Paradoxurinae species on Borneo. More field observations with mechanical and chemical techniques are needed, not only to elucidate this mechanism but also to consider conservation of these animals and their habitats in a changing environment on Borneo.

AB Integrity and productivity of ecosystem goods and services from rangelands are critical to the livelihoods of over a billion people worldwide. Pastoralists play a key role in the conservation and sustainable management of these important life-support systems. Yet, an increasing number of environmental, socio-economic, and political threats have jeopardized the integrity of rangelands and the security of this livelihood type, and hence stewardship of global natural rangeland systems. Sustainable pastoralism can synergistically link several sustainable development goals (SDG) as they are critical to achieving food security, resilient local and regional economies, cultural diversity, conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, carbon sequestration, land and water rehabilitation. Pastoralism has a cross-cutting role for stewardship of drylands and natural rangelands while also achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We show how single-sector economic development approaches of the past have led to loss of livelihoods, increased inequality and land degradation for many pastoral communities in developing countries. How can the SDGs help induce more integrated approaches, and what are the challenges and barriers to doing so? We also highlight recent tools and approaches that can help, including the benefits of developing integrated indicators for monitoring and measuring progress towards sustainable pastoralism.

AB Light is an important environmental factor in the establishment of vegetation. The knowledge of the behavior of the species in response to light demand for survival and growth in the field becomes essential. Thus, the present study aimed at evaluating the survival and initial growth of Myrocarpus frondosus seedlings under different levels of shade in the field. The treatments used were: 0 % (full sun); 18 %; 50 % and 70 % shading in a randomized block design. The survival of seedlings was evaluated 30 and 540 days after planting (d.a.p.) and the morphological attributes height (H), stem diameter (DC) and H / DC ratio every 90 days. Leaf area, leaf thy matter, thy matter of stem and branches and thy matter of shoot were obtained 540 d.a.p. The analyses of the physiological attributes fluorescence of chlorophyll a and photosynthetic pigments were performed 180, 360 and 540 d.a.p. The use of shading in the planting of Mymcarpus frondosus influences the survival and the morphological and physiological attributes of the species. The morphological and physiological attributes of Mymcarpus frondosus plants show that the species requires shading of 50 to 70 % in its initial growth phase in the field (540 d.a.p.). It is recommended to use the species in sub-forest enrichment plantations and in consortium with other species more demanding in light.

AB The Heteroptera is a group of animals associated with the vegetation cover. The conducted analysis indicates that groups of heteropterans in the urban environment have a pattern of reaction to the environmental factors, determined using the phytoindication method. In the study, we considered the following hypotheses: 1) phytoindicational assessments of ecological factors may explain the patterns of variation of the groups of heteropterans; 2) among Heteroptera species, comparatively homogenous ecological groups could be distinguished which are characterized by similar character of response to the effect of certain environmental factors; 3) these groups could be used for bioindication of the conditions of environment in urban ecosystems. Stationary collection of heteropterans was performed during three years from May to October of 2017-2019 on six plots in Kharkiv. The article describes factors which affect the structure of groups of Heteroptera within the ecosystem of the large city and assess the bioindication possibilities. The data presented in the article, as well as the conclusions drawn, are to a large extent associated with stenotopic species, most of which could be used as bioindicators of the condition of one or another biocenosis. According to the results of a taxonomical survey in the territory of Kharkiv, 180 species of Heteroptera were found, belonging to 120 genera and 17 families. The highest species diversity was seen for the family Miridae, accounting for 50 species (27.0% of the total number of counted species). Fewer species were identified as the representatives of families Lygaeidae - 46 species (24.9%) and Pentatomidae - 23 (12.4%). Family Rhopalidae was represented by 11 species (5.9%). Nabidae and Tingidae - 10 species each (5.4%). Families Coreidae - 8 (4.3%), Cydnidae and Scutelleridae - 4 species each (22%), Anthocoridae - 3 (1.6%). The families Berytidae, Piesmatidae, Pyrrhocoridae and Reduviidae were represented by only 2 species each (1.1%). Families Acanthosomatidae, Alydidae and Aradidae were represented by 1 species each, in total accounting for 1.5%. The reasonably high level of species and ecological diversities of Heteroptera in the tenitory of the city allows them to be used in bioindication studies. We determined comparatively homogenous ecological groups of heteropterans which have a similar pattern of response to the impact of certain environmental factors. The study demonstrates that phytoindicatory assessments of the ecological factors can explain the patterns of variation in groups of heteropterans, We determined the factors which have effects on the structure of the group of heteropterans within the metropolitan ecosystem. The level of their effect on groups of heteropterans within the city is different. The most influential were light and humidity. Comparison of potential and realized projections of ecological space allows us, to a certain extent, to generate hypotheses about the orientations of transformation of the group heteropterans.

AB Growth Simulation, an analytical modeling technique, has been increasingly used in ecological studies and practical forestry applications where dendrochronology is not applicable. The technique uses randomly sampled diameter increments from tagged trees over a known time interval to assemble a statistical sample of lifetime growth trajectories. We carried out a validation of Growth Simulation using a temperate species in order to compare indirect model outputs with direct tree ring analysis. Rings were measured on sample disks cut from 55 pine branches ranging in age from 8-36 years. Assessments included lifetime growth rates, growth rate with respect to diameter and age, periodic annual increment (PAI), cross-referencing of rings by date, and autocorrelation of growth over successive periods. Tree ring analysis and Growth Simulation showed close correspondence for all parameters tested (maximum, median, and minimum growth rates; longevity estimates). Growth Simulation is found to be a robust and informative technique for studies of tropical tree growth, and is especially useful where analysis of tree rings is not feasible or when bootstrapping analysis of ring data is of interest.

AB Several Cerrado tree species have traits and structures that protect from fires. The effectiveness of a trait depends on the fire regime, especially the frequency. We usedVochysia elliptica, a common Cerrado tree, as a model to test whether different fire frequencies alter crown architecture and flower, fruit and seed production. We analysed the effect of fire on the production of inflorescences, fruits and seeds, as well as seed germination and tree architecture of 20 trees in each of three plots of a long-term ecological experiment managed with different fire regimes: burned every 2 years (B), burned every 4 years (Q) in mid-dry season and an area protected from fire (C). We found a large negative effect of fire frequency on crown architecture and on flower and fruit production. Trees in C and Q had significantly more main branches and a larger crown area than trees in B. At its peak, a tree in C was expected to produce 2.4 times more inflorescences than Q, and 15.5 times more than B, with similar magnitudes for fruits. Sixty per cent of trees in B and 10% in Q produced no fruits. The differences in architecture might explain the reduction in sexual reproduction due to a smaller physical space to produce flowers at the branch apices. Resource limitation due to plant investment to replace burned vegetative parts may also decrease sexual reproduction. Our results indicate potentially severe consequences of high fire frequencies for population dynamics and species persistence in Cerrado communities.

AB Length-weight relationships (LWRs) provide valuable information about growth and individual fitness on the population. LWRs are commonly used in studies on life history, population dynamics, ecosystem modelling and stock assessment. A comparative study on the effect of harvesting in the relative growth ofPatella asperabetween Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and exploited areas was conducted in the archipelago of Madeira (NE Atlantic Ocean). The results showed that populations from the exploited areas exhibited a negative allometric growth whilst the populations from the MPAs showed predominantly isometric and positive allometric growth. The effects of protection from MPAs on the populations ofP. asperawere not only restricted to an increase in mean size but also in a more balanced growth. This study highlight the importance of MPAs in the preservation ofP. asperapopulations in Madeira archipelago. Hence, these results should be used to corroborate the positive effects of MPAs in safeguarding the exploited resources, especially in oceanic islands were species are more prone to over-exploitation.

AB This study evaluates the potential of fauna attractiveness according to brushwood transposition in an abandoned mining area under restoration in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Sixteen areas of brushwood measuring 2 m(2) area and 1 m high were installed. The occurrence of fauna groups under and around the brushwood piles was then observed with use of bi-monthly surveys. Data were collected using a non-destructive method and the animals were identified by order and separated by taxonomic units. Twenty-three fauna orders were found, with the most frequent being Anura, Araneae, Hymenoptera and Isoptera. There was an increase in the number of taxonomic units found in each survey, with a significant difference after ten months of installation. The results indicate that the brushwood was attractive to the fauna and provided new habitats and coexistence between different fauna groups during the monitored period.

AB We used climate models to assess the effects of 2 distinct anthropogenic forcings on the water budget in the Amazon basin: (1) increasing global greenhouse gases under the RCP8.5 scenario, and (2) land cover change caused by deforestation. The Eta regional climate model, driven by the Brazilian Earth System Model version 2.5 (BESM 2.5), was used to simulate the climate response under the RCP8.5 scenario and due to deforestation throughout the 21st century. Changes in energy and water budgets led to an increase in temperature that reached 5 degrees C throughout the basin. In the RCP8.5 scenario, moisture convergence, precipitation and evapotranspiration all decreased. In this scenario, the positive feedback mechanism was predominant, as the reductions in evapotranspiration and moisture convergence acted in the same direction to reduce precipitation. In the future deforestation scenarios, reductions in precipitation were even stronger. In this case, the negative feedback mechanism predominated, in which the relative reduction in evapotranspiration was greater than the reduction in precipitation, leading to an increase in moisture convergence over the region. Changes in temperature and the water cycle were intensified in the future deforestation scenarios. These results show that the 2 anthropogenic factors can change the water budget and cause an imbalance in the climate-biome system in the Amazon basin, highlighting the need for public conservation policies to halt the increase in environmental degradation in the Amazon basin and to reduce greenhouse gases emissions due the burning of fossil fuels.

AB Two dimensions of the ecological niche (diet and habitat) of a snake assemblage from an endemic rich area in east-central Argentina, the Sierras de Ventania mountain chain, were analyzed. Field data collection was performed in 15-week study periods between 2010 and 2014. Snakes were hand-captured using transect surveys. Field observations on diet were analyzed together with stomach content data from museum specimens. Our results supported the partitioning of the snake assemblage by both habitat use and diet into at least three functional groups: species restricted to microhabitats under rocks and with a diet composed exclusively of ants (Epictia australis); species found mostly in stream microhabitats and feeding mainly upon anurans (Erythrolamprus poecilogyrus and Lygophis elegantissimus); and species found mostly in grassland microhabitats, with specialized diets of terrestrial prey items (Philochyas patagoniensis and Bothrops alternatus). Consistent with previous work, diet was more important than habitat in explaining ecological niche partitioning of this snake assemblage. Our results showed that high overlap values of microhabitat use were compensated by low overlap values of the trophic niche dimension, thus matching the traditional complementary niches hypothesis.

AB We studied species the composition and structure in two sites of the subdeciduous tropical forest in Hobomo, Campeche, Mexico. We analyzed 10 plots of 10 m(2) x 10 m(2) (1000 m(2)), in each site, where all individuals with a diameter >= 1 cm were measured. Vegetation structure was characterized using the importance values of the species, and species diversity was estimated with the Shannon-Wiener (H') Index. A total of 79 species, representing 67 genera and 30 families, was recorded. The most diverse families were Fabaceae and Rubiaceae at the two sites. The most diverse genus was Diopyros, followed by Coccoloba and Guettarda. The diversity of woody species in the study sites were 3.68 and 3.59 in site one and site two, respectively, while their corresponding evenness values (according to Pielou' s index) were 0.88 and 0.87, respectively. The mean densities of the woody species encountered in the sites one and two were 6610 ind/ha and 8670 ind/ha, respectively. The three species with the greatest density were Malpighia glabra, Guettarda combsii and Lonchocellpus xuul in site one, and Machaonia lindeniana, Coccoloba cozumelensis and Malpighia glabra in site two. The highest values of importance value index were Bursera simaruba, Lonchocarpus xuul, Guettarda combsii, Platymisium yucatanum and Malpighia glabra in site one and Lysiloma latisiliquum, Bursera simaruba, Vitex gaumeri, Lonchocarpus xuul y Machaonia lindeniana in site two. These species are the most important in the structure and physiognomy of the community. We can conclude that the richness of the tree species of the two sites studied its similar (site 1 with 63 spp. and site two with 62 spp.). The scarcity or abundance of the species is related to human activity (wood extraction), which affects the structure and floristic composition.

AB Classical approaches to analyzing dynamical systems, including bifurcation analysis, can provide invaluable insights into the underlying structure of a mathematical model and the spectrum of all possible dynamical behaviors. However, these models frequently fail to take into account population heterogeneity. While heterogeneity is critically important to understanding and predicting the behavior of any evolving system, this characteristic is commonly omitted when analyzing many mathematical models of ecological systems. Attempts to include population heterogeneity frequently result in expanding system dimensionality, effectively preventing qualitative analysis. However, Reduction theorem, or hidden keystone variable (HKV) method, allows incorporating population heterogeneity while still permitting the use of classical bifurcation analysis. A combination of these methods allows visualization of evolutionary trajectories and permits making meaningful predictions about dynamics over time of evolving populations.

AB Aim of study: To assess responses of the shade-tolerant species Theobroma subincanum in relation to canopy gaps created by reduced impact logging (RIL).
   Materials and methods: A managed forest in the municipality of Moju, Path state, Brazil, harvested in 1997 through RIL was monitored during 12 years (1998-2010). Nine logging gaps were selected and classified in small, medium, and large. Four 10 m x 50 m strips starting from the gap's border towards the forest and following the directions of cardinal points were installed. Each strip was divided in five 10 m x 10 m plots. Density, diameter distribution (DBH >= 5 cm with intervals = 5 cm), and diameter growth were measured.
   Main results: No significant changes in seedling density of T, subincanum were found, and its diameter distribution followed the reverse "J" shape during all monitoring time. T. suhincanum presented diameter growth of 0.15 cm year(-1) with highest Periodic Annual Increment in diameter up to three years, and stabilization in nine years after RIL. The species responded to a growth gradient inversely proportional to the gap's border distance (p = 0.001) but not to gap size and plots direction in cardinal points around the gap.
   Research highlights: Shade-tolerant species such as T. subincanum have sensible and positive growth responses to disturbances caused by RIL even when seedlings received low amounts of indirect sunlight. These positive responses should be considered in the management of production forests.

AB The spatial structure reflects the pattern of arrangement of trees on the ground and is a basic element to understand the dynamics of forest ecosystems. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the bivariate stnictural characteristics of five different associations of Pinus durangensis forests, identifying the similarities and differences in the bivariate distribution of uniformity of angles, dominance and mingling. The data comes from five quadrate sites with an area of 2500 m(2), each established in different forests of P. durangensis in the Sierra Madre Occidental. For each site, the average height, average diameter and crown coverage were determined, as well as the species mingling index, angle uniformity and dominance indexes. The indices were combined two to two to obtain three bivariate distributions. The pure forest of P. durangensis presented individuals with higher height, while the largest diameter was found in the association with P. teocote. The mingling index (Mi) indicates that only in the pure forest there is a low species mingling. The uniformity angle index (Wi) shows that trees generally present a random distribution. The values of dominance (Ui) show that in all the sites there are all the social classes represented in an equitable way. The indexes and their combinations adequately describe the spatial distribution of the trees and their relationship with their closest neighbors. The information obtained from the combination of the structural variables contribute to improve the understanding of the spatial structure of the forest, and in addition to contributing to the regulation of cutting intensity and ensuring sustainable management.

AB The diversity of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) is affected by urbanization, habitat fragmentation and disappearance of native mammals, which result in changes in the quality and availability of food, and resources for nesting. We evaluated the diversity, distribution of species in different trophic guilds and foraging strategies, and temporal variation in abundance of dung beetles in an urban fragment of Cerrado in a Federal District of Brazil. This study was conducted at the Experimental Station of Biology (EEB) of the University of Brasilia (UnB), Federal District, Brazil. Fortnightly, between October 2012 and September 2013, Scarabaeinae were collected using baited (human faeces, pig meat, or banana) and unbaited pitfall traps. Aspects of the dung beetle assemblage were evaluated, including species richness and abundance, feeding habits and foraging strategies. A total of 614 individuals were collected, which included eight species belonging to seven genera and four tribes. Dichotomius carbonarius (Mannerheim, 1829), a generalist species, dominated the assemblage, indicating that it is adapted to living in fragmented and urbanized areas. As regards feeding habits, Eurystemus caribaeus (Jablonsky & Herbst, 1789) was considered to be strictly coprophagous, Coprophanaeus cyanescens (d'Olsoufieff, 1924) copronecrophagous and D. carbonarius a generalist. Most species were classified as paracoprids, which accounted for 75% of the species collected. Regarding the attractiveness of the bait, the highest numbers of individuals and species were recorded in pitfall traps baited with human faeces. A high abundance of Scarabaeinae was recorded in the first half of the rainy season (October-December) with 98.2% of the individuals collected in this period. The urban area studied harboured a low number of species with high abundance of a few species.

AB 1. Determining whether pollination occurs competitively or rather facilitatively among co-flowering plants is a central question in plant reproductive ecology. Kobayashi [2018; Journal of Ecology 107: 1433-1438] theoretically investigated the scenario in which intraspecific pollen tube competition (male-male competition) can lead to regulation of population growth due to reduced female success.
   2. Kobayashi (2018) showed that evolutionary dynamics in intraspecific pollen tube competition can reduce female success and consequently generate negative density-dependence of population growth, which allows for numerous species to coexist in a spatially subdivided metacommunity. Kobayashi (2018) hypothesized that trait evolution driven by sexual selection may maintain biodiversity.
   3. However, the models proposed by Kobayashi (2018) allow for the assumptions to be relaxed; he assumed: (i) fully global seed dispersal (instead of limited dispersal, albeit the spatial subdivision), (ii) fully local pollination (i.e., pollination occurred exclusively within patches), (iii) selfing rate was exactly proportionate (i.e., pollen grains distributed equally among all individuals within a patch, irrespective of their parental origins), (iv) haploid mode of inheritance, and most importantly, (v) each individual was mutually competitive, rather than facilitative for pollination.
   4. Here, I extend the models of Kobayashi (2018) and show that when I relax assumptions (i)-(v), facilitativeness, as opposed to competitiveness, is more likely to be favoured by selection. The present results are attributed to kin selection in gametopythic competition among relatives in spatially subdivided populations.
   5. If facilitativeness for pollination is favoured by kin selection, then the premise that the evolution of pollen traits can generate negative density-dependence does not necessarily follow. I also discuss the potential mechanisms by which pollen phenotypes can either strengthen or attenuate intraspecific and interspecific competition.

AB Ecological restoration through conventional plantation techniques can create forests with low biodiversity. As such, one way to overcome possible shortcomings of the restoration process is to use nucleation techniques, such as artificial perches. These structures attract the avifauna and increase the deposition of seeds associated with feces or bird regurgitation. Seed rain and seedlings regeneration were monitored under artificial perches and control areas in a degraded area of Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. In this study, 46 morphospecies of seeds were identified. Under the perches, greater abundance and richness of seeds were found with certain ecological and functional traits that support the role of artificial perches as a biological diversity core. Seedling establishment was low under the perches and control areas. This suggests that integrated actions to improve soil conditions should be applied to enhance seedling establishment.

AB Forest community composition is the outcome of multiple forces, including those that increase taxonomic and functional divergence and those that promote convergence in traits. The mechanisms underlying these forces may not operate homogenously within communities; individuals of different species are never perfectly mixed, and thus, species tend to be surrounded and interact with different subsets of species. In fact, taxonomic and functional composition of neighborhoods of different focal species can be highly variable. Here, we examine whether mechanisms driving species-level neighborhoods relate to intrinsic characteristics of focal species such as differences in life-history and resource-uptake strategies and in turn relate to species survival. We focus on two key characteristics: (1) seed mass, which defines a dominant axis of life-history strategies related to stress tolerance, and (2) understory light preferences that sort species from light-demanding pioneers to shade-tolerant. We monitored seedling communities over 10 yr in Puerto Rico and calculated neighborhood trait dispersion in species-level neighborhoods using seven functional traits. We examined whether species-level characteristics, seed mass and preferred light conditions, influence patterns of functional dispersion in seedling neighborhoods using linear models. Then, we examined how species-level functional neighborhoods impact seedling survival. We found that small- and large-seeded species diverge in the type of functional neighborhoods they associate with. Large-seeded species associate with neighbors that are more similar than expected in leaf economic traits, but more different than expected in seed mass and leaf area traits, while the opposite was found for small-seeded species. This variation in species functional neighborhood was important in determining seedling survival. In sum, our results suggest that divergent and convergent forces do not operate homogenously over entire communities. Their relative role changes in space, and on a species-by-species basis, probably with a deterministic foundation linked to traits such as seed mass.

AB Plants pollinated by vertebrates are often visited by native and exotic insects foraging for pollen and nectar. We compared flower visitation rates, foraging behaviour, and the contribution to reproduction of nectar-feeding birds and the introduced honeybee Apis mellifera in four populations of the bird-pollinated Anigozanthos manglesii (Haemodoraceae). The behaviour of floral visitors was quantified with direct observations and motion-triggered and hand-held cameras. Pollinator access to flowers was manipulated by enclosure in netting to either exclude all visitors or to exclude vertebrate visitors only. Apis mellifera was the only insect observed visiting flowers, and the most frequent flower visitor, but primarily acted as a pollen thief. Although birds visited A. manglesii plants only once per week on average, they were 3.5 times more likely to contact the anther or stigma as foraging honeybees. Exclusion of birds resulted in 67% fewer fruits and 81% fewer seeds than flowers left open and unmanipulated. Unnetted flowers that were open to bird and insect pollinators showed pollen-limitation and a large variation in reproductive output within and between sites. Although honeybees have been shown to pollinate other Australian plants, compared to birds, they are highly inefficient pollinators of A. manglesii.

AB Mechanical stability against buckling and water transport resistance through xylem vary with increasing tree height. To explore interspecific allometry based on morphological and physiological traits can play a crucial role in revealing their ecological adaptation. Four architectural traits (tree height, diameter at the breast height (DBH), crown width and crown depth) and seven functional traits (specific leaf area (SLA), leaf total carbon concentration (TC), midday leaf water potential, leaf delta C-13 and delta O-18, wood density and xylem water transport efficiency) were measured in Schima superba, Acacia auriculiformis and Eucalyptus citriodora plantations in the subtropical region of China. The mechanical stability declined in the order of S. superba > A. auriculiformis > E. citriodora. Taller species at a given DBH had slender stems and narrower crowns. Smaller leaf delta O-18 and more efficient xylem water transport were observed in two taller tree species, A. auriculiformis and E. citriodora. Smaller SLA, higher leaf TC and larger leaf area indicated more carbon allocation to leaves of S. superba. The variations in architectural and functional traits with tree allometry among tree species may provide a more complete understanding of species-specific growth strategies in this subtropical region.

AB Deforestation has an important impact on ecosystems, altering their capacity for providing environmental services, affecting particularly semiarid areas. The Parque Estatal Canon de Fernandez is located on the lower section of Nazas river, with 24936,6 ha and constitutes an important national and international natural protected area, because it supplies water to several cities in the north of Mexico and is recognized as a highly important habitat for aquatic birds. Nevertheless, the necessity of satisfying agricultural activities and a growing population has promoted land use and cover changes in the region. The aim of this research was to evaluate land cover and land use changes on the lower basin of Rio Nazas between 1990 and 2016. Based on visual interpretation of Landsat Tm and ETM images we generated digital data bases for land cover and land use. On 2016 the natural vegetation was composed by xeric shrub and riparian forest. In twenty six years deforestation affected 32.1% of the total area. There is a necessity to develop public policies for improving water sustainable use to preserve this xeric ecosystem.

AB In transformed landscapes, many populations of grassland specialist plant and animal species live outside the few protected areas and are often preserved on 'small natural features' (SNFs) such as road verges, field margins and rocky outcrops. In the steppe and forest steppe zones of Eurasia ancient burial mounds (kurgans) are widespread SNFs providing refuge for grassland species. Based on a large-scale botanical and zoological survey of 138 kurgans in Hungary, we compared the management regimes, the presence of threatening factors and the conservation potential of kurgans embedded in non-protected transformed landscapes and in protected areas. We found that kurgans extend the borders of the protected areas by maintaining populations of grassland specialist plants and arthropods (ants, orthopterans, true bugs and rove beetles) even in transformed landscapes. We revealed that the lack of proper management, the presence of anthropogenic disturbances and encroachment of woody species are the most considerable threats to the long-term maintenance of biodiversity on kurgans located outside the protected areas. For their effective conservation a new approach is needed, which can cope with the small area and dispersed localities of the kurgans and can integrate them into the network of other SNFs on a landscape-level. As the ecological importance of kurgans is disproportionate to their size conservation actions focusing on their protection offers a greater rate of return of the efforts than can be expected in case of larger continuous sites.

AB Tropical forests in Central Africa host unique biodiversity threatened by human degradation of habitats and defaunation. Forests allocated to conservation, production and community management are expected to have different conservation values. Here, we aimed to identify the determinants of the conservation value of tropical forests in southeastern Cameroon, by disentangling the effects of forest allocations, proximity to human settlements, and local habitat. We inventoried two taxonomical groups: mammal species with camera traps (3464 independent detection events) and dung beetle species with pitfall traps (4475 individuals). We used an integrated analytical approach, examining both species richness and composition. For both mammals and dung beetles, species richness decreased from the protected area to the community forests, and the logging concession showed intermediate richness. Species richness of both groups was negatively correlated to the proximity to human settlements and disturbance, with a decreasing gradient of body mass and the loss of the most threatened species. The replacement (i.e., spatial turnover) of both mammal and dung beetle species among forest allocations suggest an integration of conservation initiatives to a large number of different sites, with a priority on protected and remote areas of high biodiversity. These results confirm the high conservation value of protected areas and their essential role in conservation strategies, ecologically connected with well-managed production forests with variable conservation value mainly depending on accessibility. Community forests located close to villages are much more degraded but not totally defaunated and still provide bushmeat to local populations.

AB Recent studies suggest that habitat amount is the main determinant of species richness, whereas habitat fragmentation has weak and mostly positive effects. Here, we challenge these ideas using a multi-taxa database including 2230 estimates of forest-dependent species richness from 1097 sampling sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We used a structural equation modeling approach, accounting not only for direct effects of habitat loss, but also for its indirect effects (via habitat fragmentation), on the richness of forest-dependent species. We reveal that in addition to the effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation has negative impacts on animal species richness at intermediate (30-60%) levels of habitat amount, and on richness of plants at high ( > 60%) levels of habitat amount, both of which are mediated by edge effects. Based on these results, we argue that dismissing habitat fragmentation as a powerful force driving species extinction in tropical forest landscapes is premature and unsafe.

AB In Nature, species coexistence is much more frequent than what the classical competition model predicts, so that scientists look for mechanisms that explain such a coexistence. We revisit the classical competition model assuming that individuals invest time in competing individuals of the other species. This assumption extends the classical competition model (that becomes a particular case of the model presented) under the form of a Holling type II term, that we call competitive response to interfering time. The resulting model expands the outcomes allowed by the classical model by (i) enlarging the range of parameter values that allow coexistence scenarios and (ii) displaying dynamical scenarios not allowed by the classical model: namely, bi-stable conditional coexistence in favour of i (either species coexist or species i wins) or tri-stable conditional coexistence (either species coexist or any of them goes extinct), being exclusion in both cases due to priority effects.

AB Ecological transitions usually represent vulnerable ecosystems and high biodiversity. Investigating their drivers is important from both biogeographic and conservationist perspectives. One of these transitions is situated between the two largest biogeographic domains of South America - the Amazon and the Cerrado. We evaluated variation in tree floristic composition throughout this transition and assessed which factors explain this variation. We used 17,240 records of occurrences of 2,530 tree species from the NeotropTree database. We investigated variation in floristic composition using UPGMA cluster analysis with bootstrap resampling and NMDS ordination, and modeled the distribution of species in relation to environmental and spatial predictors by means of transformation-based Redundancy Canonical Analysis (tb-RDA) and variance partitioning. We found four general floristic groups: 1) flooded forests; 2) white sand dwarf-forests; 3) savannic and dwarf forests; and 4) non-flooded forest types. Floristic variation along the transition was influenced by the environment, especially variables related to fire and soil moisture, and by space, especially variables acting on broader scales. Correspondence between the environmental heterogeneity found throughout the transition and our results demonstrates once again the importance of conserving biogeographical transition zones in general, and the most comprehensive of South America in particular.

AB In this overview (introductory article to a special issue including 14 papers), we consider all main types of natural and artificial inland freshwater habitas (fwh). For each type, we identify the main biodiversity patterns and ecological features, human impacts on the system and environmental issues, and discuss ways to use this information to improve stewardship. Examples of selected key biodiversity/ecological features (habitat type): narrow endemics, sensitive (groundwater and GDEs); crenobionts, LIHRes (springs); unidirectional flow, nutrient spiraling (streams); naturally turbid, floodplains, large-bodied species (large rivers); depth-variation in benthic communities (lakes); endemism and diversity (ancient lakes); threatened, sensitive species (oxbow lakes, SWE); diverse, reduced littoral (reservoirs); cold-adapted species (Boreal and Arctic fwh); endemism, depauperate (Antarctic fwh); flood pulse, intermittent wetlands, biggest river basins (tropical fwh); variable hydrologic regime-periods of drying, flash floods (arid-climate fwh). Selected impacts: eutrophication and other pollution, hydrologic modifications, overexploitation, habitat destruction, invasive species, salinization. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and it is important to quantify resistance, resilience, and recovery to assess the strategic role of the different types of freshwater ecosystems and their value for biodiversity conservation. Effective conservation solutions are dependent on an understanding of connectivity between different freshwater ecosystems (including related terrestrial, coastal and marine systems).

AB Accurate acquisition of the spatiotemporal distribution of urban forests and fragmentation (e.g., interior and intact regions) is of great significance to contributing to the mitigation of climate change and the conservation of habitat biodiversity. However, the spatiotemporal pattern of urban forest cover changes related with the dynamics of interior and intact forests from the present to the future have rarely been characterized. We investigated fragmentation of urban forest cover using satellite observations and simulation models in the Nanjing Laoshan Region of Jiangbei New Area, Jiangsu, China, during 2002-2023. Object-oriented classification-based land cover maps were created to simulate land cover changes using the cellular automation-Markov chain (CA-Markov) model and the state transition simulation modeling. We then quantified the forest cover change by the morphological change detection algorithm and estimated the forest area density-based fragmentation patterns. Their relationships were built through the spatial analysis and statistical methods. Results showed that the overall accuracies of actual land cover maps were approximately 83.75-92.25% (2012-2017). The usefulness of a CA-Markov model for simulating land cover maps was demonstrated. The greatest proportion of forest with a low level of fragmentation was captured along with the decreasing percentage of fragmented area from 81.1% to 64.1% based on high spatial resolution data with the window size of 27 pixels x 27 pixels. The greatest increase in fragmentation (3% from 2016 to 2023) among the changes between intact and fragmented forest was reported. However, intact forest was modeled to have recovered in 2023 and restored to 2002 fragmentation levels. Moreover, we found 58.07 km(2) and 0.35 km(2) of interior and intact forests have been removed from forest area losses and added from forest area gains. The loss rate of forest interior and intact area exceeded the rate of total forest area loss. However, their approximate ratio (1) implying the loss of forest interior and intact area would have slight fragmentation effects on the remaining forests. This analysis illustrates the achievement of protecting and restoring forest interior; more importantly, excessive human activities in the surrounding area had been avoided. This study provides strategies for future forest conservation and management in large urban regions.

AB Wild and domestic animals and their by-products are important ingredients in the preparation of medicines traditionally used in folk medicine, present in various human cultures since antiquity. However, the decline in the number of species in neotropical regions as a result of hunting for various purposes, including food, medicine and magico-religious use, has placed some species - especially endemic species - at risk of extinction. In this context, the present study aimed to identify the wild vertebrate species used in folk medicine in five communities in the region surrounding the Serra do Conduru State Park (PESC), Bahia, Brazil. Forty-five hunter-farmers were interviewed, citing 23 species, from which 17 raw materials are extracted for prevention and/or treatment of 19 illnesses. Mammals were the most cited taxon followed by birds and reptiles. Among the species mentioned, Cuniculus paca is the most used for zootherapy purposes, followed by Salvator merianae and Sphiggurus insidiosus. There was dissimilarity between the communities in relation to the diversity of species used for zootherapy. Ten categories of body systems were classified for which the therapeutic resources are recommended. Disorders related to the middle and inner ear were the most cited. Some of the species mentioned are endangered, such as Bradypus torquatus and Lachesis muta. This research demonstrated that zootherapy is a traditional practice embedded in these communities. Further studies are needed to broaden knowledge of other species that may have important cultural value for these families, as well as to evaluate the potential implications of the uncontrolled use of these species in traditional medicine in an ecological context, since the practice of zootherapy can excerpt pressure on critical animal populations and threaten biodiversity.

AB The dramatic increase in soil degradation in the last few decades has led to the need to identify methods to define not only soil quality but also, in a holistic approach, soil health. In the past twenty years, indices based on living communities have been proposed alongside the already proven physical-chemical methods. Among them, some soil invertebrates have been included in monitoring programs as bioindicators of soil quality. Being an important portion of soil fauna, soil arthropods are involved in many soil processes such as organic matter decomposition and translocation, nutrient cycling, microflora activity regulation and bioturbation. Many studies have reported the use of soil arthropods to define soil quality; among taxa, some have been explored more in depth, typically Acari and Collembola, while generally less abundant groups, such as Palpigradi or Embioptera, have not been investigated much. This paper aims to evaluate and compare the use of different soil microarthropod taxa in soil degradation/quality studies to highlight which groups are the most reported for soil monitoring and which are the most sensitive to soil degradation. We have decided not to include the two most present and abundant taxa, Acari and Collembola, in this paper in consideration of the vast amount of existing literature and focus the discussion on the other microarthropod groups. We reported some studies for each taxon highlighting the use of the group as soil quality indicator. A brief section reporting some indices based on soil microarthropods is proposed at the end of this specific discussion. This paper can be considered as a reference point in the use of soil arthropods to estimate soil quality and health.

AB Due to the large extent of the Amazon rainforest, research has historically focused on easily accessible locations. Thus, much of this region has little information available about its richness and plant distribution. Located south of the Madeira river, Municipality of Manicore has a high number of phytophysiognomies, which may indicate the existence of a greater diversity of plant species. Therefore, from the compilation of previously collected records and based on botanical expeditions, this study evaluated the diversity and richness of angiosperms in Manicore. We found 801 species, 409 genera and 106 families. Our data record 47 new occurrences for Amazonas State. Of these new occurrences, 12 are also the first record for the northern region. In addition, we have identified a new vine species of the genus Mandevilla Lindl. Given the well-known sample deficiency of the Amazon region, and considering the countless anthropogenic pressures that cities south of the Madeira river have been facing, knowledge of flora becomes increasingly urgent.

AB Forest-to-agriculture conversion has been identified as a major threat to soil biodiversity and soil processes resilience, although the consequences of long-term land use change to microbial community assembly and ecological processes have been often neglected. Here, we combined metagenomic approach with a large environmental dataset, to (i) identify the microbial assembly patterns and, (ii) to evaluate the ecological processes governing microbial assembly, in bulk soil and soybean rhizosphere, along a long-term forest-to-agriculture conversion chronosequence, in Eastern Amazon. We hypothesized that (i) microbial communities in bulk soil and rhizosphere have different assembly patterns and (ii) the weight of the four ecological processes governing assembly differs between bulk soil and rhizosphere and along the chronosequence in the same fraction. Community assembly in bulk soil fitted most the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM) neutral-based model, regardless of time. Low to intermediate dispersal was observed. Decreasing influence of abiotic factors was counterbalanced by increasing influence of biotic factors, as the chronosequence advanced. Undominated ecological processes of dispersal limitation and variable selection governing community assembly were observed in this soil fraction. For soybean rhizosphere, community assembly fitted most the lognormal niche-based model in all chronosequence areas. High dispersal and an increasing influence of abiotic factors coupled with a decreasing influence of biotic factors were found along the chronosequence. Thus, we found a dominant role of dispersal process governing microbial assembly with a secondary effect of homogeneous selection process, mainly driven by decreasing aluminum and increased cations saturation in soil solution, due to long-term no-till cropping. Together, our results indicate that long-term no-till lead community abundances in bulk soil to be in a transient and conditional state, while for soybean rhizosphere, community abundances reach a periodic and permanent distribution state. Dominant dispersal process in rhizosphere, coupled with homogeneous selection, brings evidences that soybean root system selects microbial taxa via trade-offs in order to keep functional resilience of soil processes.

AB Ruil (Nothofagus alessandrii) is an endangered keystone species from the Mediterranean climate zone of Chile. Ruil's fragile state of conservation urges development of restoration programs, but specific protocols for nursery production and field establishment that ensure plant survival are largely unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect on nitrogen (N) fertilization and container size during nursery production in combination with the use of mesh shelters after outplanting on survival and growth during the first growing season in the field. First year outplanting survival of nursery-grown container seedlings was enhanced when seedlings were given nitrogen (N) during nursery production and deployed with mesh tree shelters in the field. The volume of the container had no effect on outplanting survival and growth. Increasing N from zero to 200 mg N L-1 provided sufficient N levels, resulting in increased seedling height, root-collar diameter, shoot biomass, and total seedling N and phosphorous concentrations. Additional N provided by the 400 and 600 mg N L-1 treatments underwent luxury consumption by the seedlings with no further benefits in field performance. Improved growth in the nursery, along with the use of mesh tree shelters after outplanting, especially during the typical summer drought, may be responsible for increased survival during the first growing season. Increasing the performance of nursery-grown ruil seedlings is essential to restoring this endangered, vulnerable, and foundation species within the highly biodiverse, yet seriously threatened endemic Maulino Costero Forest of the Mediterranean climate of central Chile.

AB Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is experiencing increased drought stress resulting from climate change together with increases in damage by forest tent caterpillar and other defoliators. Coupled with effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition this could result in an overall decrease in survival and growth. In order to improve our understanding of the key limiting factors affecting trembling aspen we investigated survival probability and tree growth using data from an extensive network of permanent sample plots in Alberta (Canada). We developed mixed-effect non-linear models which included: tree size, competition, climate, pest incidence and time elapsed between consecutive measurements as predictor variables. Tree data from 1144 Permanent Sample Plots representing 39,394 trees for a total of 52,522 growth interval observations were used to develop these models. Annual data on aspen defoliation were available for the period 1990-2010, and the average Climate Moisture Index (CMI) was calculated for each measured interval by location. Intraspecific competition and competition from conifer species (i.e. spruce/fir and pine), had a strong negative effect on survival and growth. Aspen defoliators such as the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hbn.), the large aspen tortrix (Choristoneura conflictana) and the Bruce spanworm (Operophtera bruceata) had a negative impact on survival, but a strong positive effect on growth of surviving trembling aspen (i.e. compensatory growth). Increasing levels of CMI, which are associated with relatively cooler and wetter conditions, had a positive effect on survival and growth. Model validation results indicated good performance for survival and tree growth predictions. This study indicates that trembling aspen is very sensitive to competition, insect damage, and climate (i.e. drought); respectively, and this behavior will likely intensify as climate warms. The models developed in this study enhance our understanding of trembling aspen survival and growth in boreal North America and could be used to improve the predictive ability of existing growth and yield models.

AB The biomass of plant communities in the high mountains of the Andes (paramo) is a key factor controlling the carbon retention and freshwater supply, which are important environmental services for the human population. Using d-sep tests, we examined four causal path models that show how the aboveground biomass of a series of small plots in undisturbed paramo vegetation in southern Colombia was explained by the abiotic environment (elevation, and five soil variables: pH, exchangeable Al, available P, carbon, and bulk density), vascular species composition (as extracted four axes of a Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling ordination) and trait information related to plant productivity (community weighted means of specific leaf area (SLA) and maximum plant height). Causality could not be rejected for most path models. Nearly 50% of the aboveground plant biomass was explained by path models in which trait information together with soil variables and species composition had a direct influence on aboveground plant biomass. Community weighted means of SLA were negatively related with aboveground biomass and those of maximum plant height positively. Soil acidity and to a lesser degree soil bulk density acted as key soil variables driving the aboveground biomass. Species composition most strongly affected the variation in the aboveground biomass.

AB Models associating the responses of the plankton community with the metacommunity structure have expanded our understanding of the frequency with which dispersal-related mechanisms are associated with these responses, which depend on the local characteristics of the habitat and the degree of connectivity between habitats. Our study patterns in the phytoplankton community structure of freshwater rock pools in dryland ecosystems of northeast Brazil. We hypothesized that depending on the degree of isolation between rock pools, functional groups would be better indicators of the isolation gradients than would species, with a decrease in the similarity between communities with increasing distance. We sampled 20 rock pools across a region with rainfall < 300 mm/yr (Paraiba, Brazil), and identified 55 taxa in 13 functional groups. Cyanobacteria dominated in 10 of the 20 rock pools, which were shallow (<= 1.5 m) and slightly acidic to alkaline (pH 5.8-10.3). The Jaccard similarity index showed no correlation with the distance between rock pools, suggesting that isolation did not influence the species composition, although a highly stochastic distribution was observed. A synergy among local structuring factors (size, depth, light limitation) and spatial (dispersal) factors appears to best explain distribution and structure of the phytoplankton communities in these freshwater rock pools.

AB The temperate forests of Mexico are under strong pressure both by biological processes and by anthropic exploitation, even if they belong to Protected Natural Areas (PNA). For the evaluation of these ecosystems and their deterioration processes, there are no control mechanisms that guarantee an improvement in their internal dynamics; therefore, land occupation studies are essential to understand these processes, particularly in the arboreal stratum, and their role in carbon capture and storage (C). The biomass and the C content per hectare of predominant forest species (Pinus hartwegii, Abies religiosa, Quercus laurina and Alnus jorullensis) were calculated from representative data from 30 land plots. The carbon stock assessment of each forest area was estimated from data of tree density per hectare, species dominance, basic wood density and biomass expansion factors. Carbon stock maps were superimposed (2000 and 2013) to obtain the areas presenting carbon stock variation processes. The forests with the highest loss of carbon (C) are those were Pinus hartwegii and Abies religiosa are the predominant species.

AB Preferred temperature (Tpref) has been measured in over 100 species of aquatic and 300 species of terrestrial ectotherms as a metric for assessing behavioural thermoregulation in variable environments and, as such, has been linked to ecological processes ranging from individual behaviour to population and community dynamics. Due to the asymmetric shape of performance curves, Tpref is typically lower than the optimal temperature (Topt, where physiological performance is at its peak), and the degree of this mismatch increases with variability in Tb. Intertidal ectotherms experience huge variability in Tb on a daily basis and therefore provide a good system to test whether the relationship between Tpref and variation in Tb holds in more extreme environments. A review of the literature, however, only revealed comparisons between Tpref and Topt for five intertidal species and measurements of Tpref for 23 species. An analysis of this limited literature for intertidal ectotherms showed a positive relationship between acclimation temperature and Tpref. There was, however, great variation in the methodologies employed to make these assessments. Factors contributing to behavioural thermoregulation in intertidal ectotherms including small body size; low mobility; interactions among individuals; endogenous clocks; metabolic effects; thermal sensitivity; sampling of the thermal environment and recent acclimation history were considered to varying degrees when measuring Tpref, confounding comparisons between species. The methodologies used to measure Tpref in intertidal ectotherms were reviewed in light of each of these factors, and methodologies proposed to standardize approaches. Given the theoretical predictions about the relationships between Tpref and variability in Tb, the spatial and temporal thermal variability experienced by intertidal ectotherms provides numerous opportunities to test these expectations if assessed in a standardized manner, and can potentially provide insights into the value of behavioural thermoregulation in the more thermally variable environments predicted to occur in the near future.

AB The Atlantic Forest is the second most diverse forest system in South America, and only a fraction of its original distribution remains. In this study, we aim to use robust datasets of small mammals along the entire forest system to disentangle the main drivers for diversity along this gradient. More specifically, we aim to disentangle whether deforestation (recent), biogeographical variables, including 19 bioclimatic variables (historic), or historical trapping bias best describe patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversities using small mammal assembles, from northeastern Brazil to eastern Paraguay. For that, we applied regression tree analyses to determine what environmental variables best describe each of the dimensions of diversity. Additionally, we implemented polynomial regression to test nonlinear relationships between biodiversity metrics and patch size. We found that patterns of overall taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversities; rodent taxonomic diversity; and marsupial functional diversity were better explained by temperature variables. Meanwhile, marsupial taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities, and rodent functional and phylogenetic diversities were best explained by precipitation variables. Furthermore, patch area, trapping, and latitude were never the best descriptors for any of the diversity dimensions. Although all dimensions of biodiversity are correlated, they have unique information and should be considered individually to better understand biodiversity and inform conservation strategies. We found that fragmentation is impactful at a local scale and becomes less important at a biogeographical scale. Therefore, climatic variables drove biogeographical faunal patterns for all clades, probably reflecting important historical assembly process at large spatial scales.

AB Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forest (TESF) is one of the most valuable conservation sites in Ivory Coast. It harbours an exceptional biodiversity with numerous endangered plants and animals. Indeed, several recent studies have been carried out in TESF to consolidate judgment of its importance for conservation in Ivory Coast. These investigations have mentioned the presence of threatened monkeys and frogs. Currently, small mammals of the TESF remain unknown despite the consensus around their importance in natural biotopes. Yet small terrestrial mammals are known to be good indicators of the conservation status of many tropical ecosystems. This study is a preliminary exploration of terrestrial small mammal communities in the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forest. It aims to determine species composition and reveal their implication in the conservation of the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forest. Thus, the three main habitat types (dryland forests, swamp forests and raphials (Raphia-dominated community)) were sampled using conventional Sherman and Victor wooden snap traps. With a trapping effort of 8400 trap nights, 294 individuals, representing nine species of rodents and four species of shrews were collected. The rodent community was dominated by Hylomyscus simus (n = 135), followed by Praomys rostratus (n = 65) and Malacomys edwardsi (n = 18). Crocidura buettikoferi (n = 22) was the most abundant shrew. The species richness and diversity index were higher in drylands than in swamp forests and raphials. Swamp forests showed the highest number of trapped animals (n = 126), followed by the dryland forests (n = 107) and the raphials with 63 individuals. One-way ANOVA test revealed significant differences (p <= 0.05) between the abundance of terrestrial small mammals of the three sampled habitat types. Similarity indices showed that dryland and swamp forests were largely colonised by the same species. Three species are listed as threatened according to the criteria of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Those are one rodent, Hylomyscus baeri, listed as Endangered (EN), and two shrews, Crocidura buettikoferi and Crocidura grandiceps, which are both Near Threatened (NT). This study reinforces the importance of TESF for fauna conservation in Ivory Coast.

AB The widespread introduction of the Pacific oyster, Magallana gigas, has raised concerns regarding its potential impact on the functioning of invaded ecosystems. Concurrently, populations of the European oyster, Ostrea edulis, are in decline. We quantified the functional role of the native oyster, O. edulis, in terms of nutrient cycling and associated infaunal biodiversity and compared it directly to that of the invading oyster, M. gigas. The presence and density of both species were manipulated in the field and we tested for differences in concentration of ammonium, phosphate, total oxidised nitrogen and silicate in pore-water; total organic nitrogen and carbon in sediment; microbial activity; chlorophyll concentration; and the assemblage structure and richness of associated benthic taxa. No differences in nutrient cycling rates or associated benthic assemblages were identified between both oyster species. Nutrient concentrations were mostly affected by differences in oyster density and their significance varied among sampling events. Our findings suggest that M. gigas could compensate for the loss of ecosystem functions performed by O. edulis in areas where native oysters have been extirpated.

AB The terrestrial arthropod fauna of wetlands has been largely ignored by scientists compared to other ecological elements, yet these organisms are among the most important influences on the ecology of these systems, with the vast majority of the biodiversity in wetlands found among the terrestrial arthropods. Wetlands present a range of habitat for terrestrial arthropods, with unique faunas being associated with soils and ground litter, living plant substrates, and peatlands. Myriapoda, Araneae, Collembola, Carabidae, Formicidae, and assorted herbivorous Coleoptera and Lepidoptera are the terrestrial arthropod groups that most influence the ecology of wetlands. Despite their success, most terrestrial arthropods possess fairly rudimentary adaptations for life in wetlands, with most simply moving to higher ground or up vegetation during floods, although some species can tolerate immersion. Many terrestrial arthropods are environmentally sensitive and show considerable promise as bioindicators of wetland ecological conditions.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiatives, which provide financial incentives for management practices thought to increase the production of environmental benefits, have expanded across the global South since the late 1990s. These initiatives have thus far been conceptualized rather narrowly; by their early proponents as a novel economic instrument for more 'rational', effective and efficient environmental policy or by their critics as an exogenously imposed conduit of hegemonic neoliberalism. This introductory article to the special issue that follows advocates for and demonstrates a more grounded and historically situated approach for understanding the conformation and outcomes of PES in actual practice. It proposes a framework for examining individual PES initiatives as shaped by dynamic interactions between imposed structure and the development pathways and situated agency of actors in the territories in which they are implemented. It finds that certain ubiquitous components of this approach - the valuation of nature, the creation of institutions and the negotiations that inevitably surround the distribution of benefits - provide potential openings for articulation and engagement that can allow these initiatives to be contested, adapted, hybridized or more fully co-opted and captured. This framework opens a pathway for more inclusive, nuanced and grounded research on PES and on market-based environment and development policies more broadly.

ID MULTICULTURALISM; EVOLUTION; PROGRAM; LAND
AB This article shows the two-way relation between global norms and local conditions as they shape Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) theory and practice, through a case study of a water fund in Valle del Cauca, Colombia, the heartland of the country's sugarcane industry. Drawing on interviews, survey data and historical research, the article argues that the water fund should be understood in the context of the history of infrastructure for the sugarcane industry in the region, and that this infrastructural perspective provides a more nuanced insight into the fund's political life than the traditional PES framing. Furthermore, the article shows how the norms embedded in this locally grown programme circulated through international networks to influence PES theory and design. This case offers one example of the need to attend to the multiple and geographically specific histories of actually existing PES in order to understand its diversity in the present.

AB The concept of 'opportunity costs' has been important in theoretical discussions of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). It focuses attention on economic trade-offs of individual landholders and can make providing ecosystem services, such as tropical forest carbon sequestration, appear to be a cost-effective way to reduce near-term carbon emissions. Yet in practice, the concept may be less useful. This article examines how a programme in the Amazonian state of Acre, Brazil, has moved away from the concept of opportunity costs, challenging its theoretical importance. Instead of payments, the Acre programme offers 'incentives' intended to make rural people produce more whilst deforesting less. It resonates with the neoliberal commodification of carbon and the dominant valorization of intensive agriculture. Yet it also enlists lessons from Acre's history of rubber production and its rubber tapper-led social movement, namely that the living forest can be monetarily valuable and that its use can facilitate its protection. This article shows how local history and culture can be used to reshape PES.

AB We found the ear mite parasite (Otodectes cynotis; Acari: Psoroptidae) in two distant insular endangered fox populations in Chile. We identified O. cynotis in both the Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex fulvipes) from Chiloe and the Fuegian culpeo (Pseudalopex culpaeus lycoides) in Tierra del Fuego. These populations are approximately 2,000 km apart. Infestation rates were high for both endemic foxes: 76% (19/25) of Darwin's foxes were affected, and 73% (11/15) of Fuegian culpeos had ear mites. Two Darwin's foxes had abundant ear discharge, and one of these also exhibited secondary infections of Morganella morganii and Geotrichum sp. fungi. Mites were characterized molecularly as Otodectes spp. for the Fuegian culpeo samples. Genetic analyses of two mites found the O. cynotis genotype I, as well as what appeared to be a new allele sequence for O. cynotis. These results confirmed the hypothesis of a worldwide distribution species of ear mite. Introduced chilla foxes (Pseudalopex griseus; n=11) on Tierra del Fuego Island and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris; n=379) from both islands were also sampled, but they showed no signs of infection. Our findings provided insight into the genetic diversity, the origins, and the possible impact of this globally distributed mite on endemic free-ranging populations of foxes.

AB Predation risk affects prey species' behavior, even in the absence of a direct threat, but human-induced environmental change may disturb ecologically significant predator-prey interactions. Here, we propose various ways in which knowledge of antipredator tactics, behavioral risk effects, and primate-predator interactions could assist in identifying human-caused disruption to natural systems. Using behavior to evaluate primate responses to the ongoing environmental change should be a potentially effective way to make species conservation more predictive by identifying issues before a more dramatic population declines. A key challenge here is that studies of predation on primates often use data collected via direct observations of habituated animals and human presence can deter carnivores and influence subjects' perception of risk. Hence, we also review various indirect data collection methods to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying where environmental change threatens wild species, while also minimizing observer bias.

AB The urban growth has several effects in the environment and society. To promote a rational development in cities, the maintenance of green infrastructure is primordial. In this study, we propose a framework to evaluated changes in the environmental quality of forest fragments using open-access satellite data. The environmental quality of forest fragments was obtained using landscape ecology analysis and the prediction of future scenarios by Markov Chain Analysis and Celular Automata. We demonstrate this Framework using a location that comprises an environmental preservation area, the Jundiai-Mirim river basin, containing the remnants of Atlantic forest near the So Paulo state capital, southeast of Brazil. The results showed a constant trend of deterioration in the environmental quality of natural vegetation, attributed to the intense occupation process of urbanization in the watershed. The proposed methodology showed great potential to prevent the deterioration of urban forests, allowing the understanding of driving factors and disturbance dynamic in forest Fragments. The locations of very low environmental quality proved to be the most vulnerable to the occupation process, highlighting the need of actions to preserve the Atlantic Forest in Jundiai-Mirim river basin.

AB Background and Aims: In order to update the checklist of Meliaceae that occur in the state of Tabasco under the current classification system, a taxonomic review of the family was conducted, contributing to the "Flora de Tabasco" project.
   Methods: A revision of specimens belonging to Meliaceae was performed in both state and national herbaria. Field work was carried out between 2015 and 2017 sampling a wide array of of natural and secondary vegetation types in Tabasco. The collected material was identified with the use of taxonomic keys and compared with reliably identified herbarium material. Type specimens available in JSTOR Global Plants were also consulted. We provide an identification key for the species of the family in Tabasco. We also performed an analysis of the distribution of the species based on vegetation type and ecological data. Finally, we provide a list of common names and images of several species.
   Key results: The Meliaceae are represented by 11 species and four native genera; there are also two alien genera (each represented by a single species). Two species constitute new records for the flora of Tabasco. Trichilia is represented by seven species, whereas Guarea has two. The municipalities with the highest number of species are Centro and Teapa with eight species each and Balancan with seven species.
   Conclusions: The Meliaceae species reported for the study area represent 45.83% of the 24 native species of this family known in Mexico. They are mostly distributed in areas of secondary vegetation and remnants of tropical rain forest close to the borders with Chiapas and Guatemala.

AB The progressive expansion of human activities is causing unprecedented changes to marine ecosystems. In some cases, the extent of these changes may be so large as to generate ecosystems in which structure and functioning have no historical analogs (i.e. novel ecosystems). Here, we review the main abiotic and biotic drivers of change in the marine realm and provide a critical assessment of ecosystems for which there is empirical evidence of human-induced shifts into novel states. Our review indicates that there is evidence for human agency of changes, no-analog species composition and threshold crossing for a variety of marine ecosystems, including intertidal rocky shores, temperate and tropical reefs, estuaries and pelagic systems, while there is no definitive proof of irreversibility of changes. We discuss how a more thorough recognition of the novel ecosystem concept may help initiate conservation and restoration efforts in each of these systems.

AB Australia has one of the highest rates of biodiversity loss globally. Both a lack of long-term monitoring and inefficient management have been identified as major contributing factors. Reviewing national and international reports, perspectives and scientific studies on Australia's biodiversity management, I propose five steps to promote more effective management and monitoring of protected biodiversity assets by utilising available resources more efficiently. These steps involve: (1) better promotion of existing legislative instruments to protect biodiversity on private land; (2) creating strategic buffer zones around Australia's World Heritage Areas (WHAs) - such buffer zones would provide opportunities to reduce threats to the biological assets of WHAs that emanate from adjacent areas; (3) better engagement with stakeholders of the buffer zones in managing WHAs through their participation in evidence-based monitoring and early-threat detection (e.g. as 'Buffer-based Heritage Watch'); (4) targeted and coordinated restoration of native habitats adjacent to WHAs that are supported by effective carbon sequestration schemes; and (5) periodic integration of private protected areas within buffer zones into adjacent WHAs in accordance with the guidelines for extensions of WHAs by the World Heritage Committee. I demonstrate and justify the proposed steps using a spatial analysis of protected areas in Far North Queensland, but the proposed steps have relevance to protected areas in other Australian jurisdictions. The proposed steps would make current efforts of biodiversity protection and monitoring more efficient and would thus contribute to Australia's response to its current loss of biodiversity.

AB The Brazilian Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil, and its natural landscapes have undergone transformations, due in large part to anthropic activities. However, little is known about the effects of these activities on the natural regeneration of Cerrado vegetation. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of woody biomass in an area of a Cerrado sensu stricto that was monitored for 27 years after the implementation of six silvicultural systems.
   A period of 17 years was sufficient for the woody community of the Cerrado sensu stricto to naturally recover its original stock of aerial biomass after the application of silvicultural systems. A Few woody species contribute to the total aerial biomass accumulated over time, and such contribution is variable with time and with the type of silvicultural system.
   At 27 years after cutting, the largest fraction of biomass accumulated in the area were represented by the species Miconia leucocarpa, Blepharocalyx salicifolius, Schefflera macroccupa, Qualea grandiflora, Dalbergia Miscolobium, Eriotheca pubescens, Qualea parviflora and Caryocar Brasiliense, which also demonstrated higher fire resistance.
   A period of 17 years after the implementation of silvicultural systems is considered sufficient for an area to recover naturally to the original stock of woody biomass at the community level. This result causes a greater reduction in the biomass of fire-sensitive species and transforms a Cerrado from a carbon sink into a source of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.

AB The remaining large patches of lowland forest in Tanintharyi, southern Myanmar, are the last global stronghold for the Endangered Gurney's pitta Hydrornis gurneyi. Except for a few individuals, the remaining population is now restricted to this forest, below 150 m altitude, mostly within the Nga Wun, Lenya, and Parchan Reserved Forests. However, as in much of South-east Asia, Tanintharyi has been subjected to extensive deforestation, particularly for oil palm cultivation. The aim of this research was to determine the extent of remaining habitat suitable for Gurney's pitta. During January-October 2016 we revisited 142 locations (of 147) where the species was detected during 2003-2012, and found it in only 41 of those locations (29%); in all other locations the forest had been cleared. We measured the decline of suitable habitat since 1999 by examining all available intact forest in areas with elevations < 150 m and slope < 10 degrees. In less than 2 decades suitable habitat has declined from 3,225 to 656 km(2) (80%). Protection of remaining lowland forest is now critical. Although the expansion of oil palm cultivation has slowed since its peak in the early 2000s, two national parks proposed by the Myanmar government in 2002, which would potentially offer legal protection for most of the remaining Gurney's pitta habitat, remain on hold because of political uncertainties. We recommend an alternative conservation approach for this species, based on an Indigenous Community Conserved Area model, and further research to improve knowledge of the species and to determine how it could be saved from extinction.

AB Volunteer-led surveys are increasingly used to collect ecological information and may represent a means for obtaining the tree measurement datasets necessary to calculate carbon stocks in tropical forests in order to justify funding like REDD+. However, the accuracy of tree measurements collected by volunteers remains unassessed. Here, we examine how tree measurements collected by student volunteers vary compared to measurements collected by trained ecologists using identical methods. Measurements by both teams were collected at 11 habitat plots on Buton Island, Indonesia. Both teams counted similar numbers of trees per plot and obtained positively correlated circumference-at-breast-height measurement values at plot and individual tree scales of aggregation. Volunteer and ecologist-generated median carbon stock estimates differed by just 1.1%. We therefore suggest that with sufficient training and supervision volunteers can be used to obtain accurate tree measurement data for carbon stock calculations.

AB Several studies have characterized and delimited subterranean ant assemblages. Soil extraction, one of the methods employed to access this fauna, employs the removal of monoliths. One of the most widely used methods for the extraction of soil sampling is called TSBF (developed by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme). This method provides relevant data about the species associated with the soil. In the present study we characterized assemblages of subterranean ants using the TSBF method in different subtropical areas of the Neotropics. We considered two sampling designs in different localities. The first design resulted in 315 TSBF samples obtained from layers at distinct depths. The second design resulted in 270 TSBF samples and 270 epigaeic pitfall trap samples. This material was used to delimit the species that occur exclusively in the subterranean stratum (TSBF) and that are not found on the soil surface. A total of 281 species were recorded. Of these, 57 can be considered subterranean, based on their occurrence in subterranean strata. We also verified that the highest occurrence of ants was in the first 10 cm of soil depth. Due to the importance of using methods that efficiently extract the subterranean ant fauna in studies, we suggest the TSBF method should be used to sample ants or to associate this method with epigaeic pitfall traps to delimit strictly subterranean assemblages in specific community stratification studies.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Loss of habitat, specifically deforestation, is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Species-area relationship (SAR) models traditionally have been used for estimating species richness, species loss as a function of habitat loss, and extrapolation of richness for given areas. Sampling-species relationships (SSRs) are interrelated yet separate drivers for species richness estimates. Traditionally, however, SAR and SSR models have been used independently and not incorporated into a single approach. We developed and compared predictive models that incorporate sampling effort species-area relationships (SESARS) along the entire Atlantic Forest of South America, and then applied the best-fit model to estimate richness in forest remnants of Interior Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay. This framework was applied to non-volant small mammal assemblages that reflect different tolerances to forest loss and fragmentation. In order to account for differences in functionality we estimated small mammal richness of 1) the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, including introduced species; 2) the native species forest assemblage; and 3) the forest-specialist assemblage, with the latter two assemblages being subsets of the entire assemblage. Finally, we geospatially modeled species richness for each of the three assemblages throughout eastern Paraguay to identify remnants with high species richness. We found that multiple regression power-law interaction-term models that only included area and the interactions of area and sampling as predictors, worked best for predicting species richness for the entire assemblage and the native species forest assemblage, while several traditional SAR models (logistic, power, exponential, and ratio) best described forest-specialist richness. Species richness was significantly different between assemblages. We identified obvious remnants with high species richness in eastern Paraguay, and these remnants often were geographically isolated. We also found relatively high predicted species richness (in relation to the entire range of predicted richness values) in several geographically-isolated, medium-size forest remnants that likely have not been considered as possible priority areas for conservation. These findings highlight the importance of using an empirical dataset, created using sources representing diverse sampling efforts, to develop robust predictive models. This approach is particularly important in geographic locations where field sampling is limited yet the geographic area is experiencing rapid and dramatic land cover changes. When combined, area and sampling are powerful modeling predictors for questions of biogeography, ecology, and conservation, especially when addressing habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB Despite growing interest in the use of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) for both social and ecological benefits, few studies have investigated the feedback and interaction between poverty alleviation and ecosystem protection outcomes. In this study, the poverty reduction effects of PES policies and their subsequent influence on environmental protection outcomes are investigated. To address these questions, 222 local rural households who were involved in PES programs from the Habahu National Nature Reserve in western China were interviewed. The results showed that the social and ecological outcomes of PES policies are neither two separate entities nor a trade-off. While rural households are the key participants in PES programs, the social and ecological outcomes of PES policies are closely related to each other. In addition, poverty reduction results could greatly influence ecosystem conservation effects. Livelihood assets, as well as the attitudes of rural households, play important roles in both of the outcomes. This research provides a new perspective that considers the social and ecological benefits of PES policies, and it also calls for an integrated consideration of social and ecological components in the design of PES policies to achieve enhanced results both for poverty alleviation and ecosystem conservation.

AB Current predictions about the responses of species to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on their distributions. In this study, we investigated the effects of future climate change scenarios on the potential distribution of 10 species of scorpions in north-eastern Brazil in the context of their degree of specialisation to closed (Atlantic and Amazon Forests) and open (Caatinga and Cerrado) habitats. Scorpion species were classified as habitat specialists or generalists according to the IndVal index, and present and future species distribution models were prepared using minimum volume ellipsoids. According to IndVal, four species were classified as closed-forest specialists (Ananteris mauryi, Tityus brazilae, Tityus pusillus and Tityus neglectus), four as open-forest specialists (Jaguajir agamemnon, Jaguajir rochae, Physoctonus debilis and Bothriurus rochai), and two as generalists (Tityus stigmurus and Bothriurus asper). All species presented a drastic reduction in potential distribution, ranging from 44% to 72%, when compared with their current distribution. In addition, we found a reduction in scorpion species richness under future climate change scenarios. This finding has implications for scorpion conservation. Further, the results show that climate change may impact the composition of scorpion assemblages in north-eastern Brazil, revealing important implications for human-scorpion interactions.

AB This study was conducted in the Caiman forest on Mahe in the Seychelles - an important water catchment area that suffers from different land use activities and also from invasive species. The aim of this research was threefold: (i) to identify and document plant species in the Caiman forest, (ii) to assess the diversity of plant species, and (iii) based on available saplings, to make inference on future potential for regeneration. Considering the rugged terrain, existing paths were used as transects having first established that the species composition along paths was similar to that in the forest as a whole. Adult plants and saplings were inventoried across 8 sub-transects giving a total length of 1260 m. Twenty-six plant species belonging to 18 families were recorded in the study area, the majority belonging to the plant family Arcecaceae and Moraceae. Exotic species recorded a relatively higher diversity compared to native species across the three different altitude and dominated even on glacis habitats mostly located on steep slopes in Seychelles. Phoenicophorium borsigianum recorded the highest prominent value for both adult and sapling while species such as Swietenia macrophylla, Artocarpus heterphyllus, Pinus carbaea, Dillenia ferruginae, Ficus reflexa and Terminalia catappa had no identifiable saplings. In term of their potential for future regeneration, our study found out that exotic species have relatively higher potential for regeneration compared to native species in the Caiman forests. Without eradication programs and monitoring, the future composition of the Caiman forest is likely to be dominated by exotic species.

AB The Gorumara National Park (GNP) is an important conservation area located in the northern region of West Bengal State, India, as it provides habitat for three megaherbivores: Indian One-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and Gaurs (Bos gaurus). It harbours one of the last population of the one-horned rhino. In the present study, landscape change and configuration were investigated by comparing three Landsat images, from 1998, 2008 and 2018. The images were classified into six different landcover classes following standard methodology. The present study also involves evaluation of landscape and anthropogenic predictors influence on the megaherbivores of GNP, followed by future landcover simulation for the year 2028. The result shows a significant decrease in the grassland cover from 18.87 km(2) to 8.27 km(2) from 1998 to 2018, whereas the woodland cover has increased from 50.14 km(2) to 62.09 km(2) between 1998 and 2018. The landscape configuration indices such as Number of Patches (NP), Patch Density (PD), Interspersion and Juxtaposition (IJI), Aggregation Index (AI) and Mean Shape Index (SHAPE AM) indicated that the landscapes has lost complexity in the spatial placement of patches of different Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes. Also, the landscape over the three decades has become uniform in terms of diversity of patches, because of earlier plantation activities by the forest managers. Result also indicated that grassland, along with its class metrics are the top predictors contributing 43.6% in explaining the spatial distribution of megaherbivores in GNP. Results from the simulated landcover of 2028 suggest a possible decline in overall grassland by 6.23% and a subsequent upsurge in woodland by 6.09% from 2018. The present result will be useful in guiding the forest management in developing habitat improvement strategies for the long-term viability of megaherbivore populations of rhino, gaur and elephant in the GNP.

AB Logging, pervasive across the lowland tropics, affects millions of hectares of forest, yet its influence on nutrient cycling remains poorly understood. One hypothesis is that logging influences phosphorus (P) cycling, because this scarce nutrient is removed in extracted timber and eroded soil, leading to shifts in ecosystem functioning and community composition. However, testing this is challenging because P varies within landscapes as a function of geology, topography and climate. Superimposed upon these trends are compositional changes in logged forests, with species with more acquisitive traits, characterized by higher foliar P concentrations, more dominant. It is difficult to resolve these patterns using traditional field approaches alone. Here, we use airborne light detection and ranging-guided hyperspectral imagery to map foliar nutrient (i.e. P, nitrogen [N]) concentrations, calibrated using field measured traits, over 400 km(2) of northeastern Borneo, including a landscape-level disturbance gradient spanning old-growth to repeatedly logged forests. The maps reveal that canopy foliar P and N concentrations decrease with elevation. These relationships were not identified using traditional field measurements of leaf and soil nutrients. After controlling for topography, canopy foliar nutrient concentrations were lower in logged forest than in old-growth areas, reflecting decreased nutrient availability. However, foliar nutrient concentrations and specific leaf area were greatest in relatively short patches in logged areas, reflecting a shift in composition to pioneer species with acquisitive traits. N:P ratio increased in logged forest, suggesting reduced soil P availability through disturbance. Through the first landscape scale assessment of how functional leaf traits change in response to logging, we find that differences from old-growth forest become more pronounced as logged forests increase in stature over time, suggesting exacerbated phosphorus limitation as forests recover.

AB Seedlings in moist tropical forests must cope with deep shade and seasonal drought. However, the interspecific relationship between seedling performance in shade and drought remains unsettled. We quantified spatiotemporal variation in shade and drought in the seasonal moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, and estimated responses of naturally regenerating seedlings as the slope of the relationship between performance and shade or drought intensity. Our performance metrics were relative height growth and first-year survival. We investigated the relationship between shade and drought responses for up to 63 species. There was an interspecific trade-off in species responses to shade versus species responses to dry season intensity; species that performed worse in the shade did not suffer during severe dry seasons and vice versa. This trade-off emerged in part from the absence of species that performed particularly well or poorly in both drought and shade. If drought stress in tropical forests increases with climate change and as solar radiation is higher during droughts, the trade-off may reinforce a shift towards species that resist drought but perform poorly in the shade by releasing them from deep shade.

AB Drought can increase nitrogen (N) loss due to enhanced asynchronicity between N release through mineralization and plant N uptake. Organic amendments of N could potentially mitigate this loss where the N is more slowly released and made available at times when plants need it. Drought (ambient vs. reduced precipitation implemented with rainout shelters) and fertilizer addition (compost vs. mineral fertilizer) were used to examine the changes in mineralization, plant uptake, and loss of N during dry and wet periods in a grassland of Australia. Both gross N mineralization (GNM) and plant N uptake were high in wet summers and low in dry summers, while in the winter the relatively high GNM was not matched with similarly high plant N uptake. Drought conditions combined with mineral fertilizer addition resulted in the highest plant delta N-15 values, reflecting a more open N cycle (high N loss). In contrast, under drought conditions, compost released N more slowly and showed greater synchronicity with plant N demand. Because drought has become increasingly more intense and frequent, compost addition to grasslands could be a beneficial management strategy to improve soil health and increase plant productivity, and most importantly to reduce N loss compared to mineral fertilizers.

AB This study investigated ant seed removal of Piper sancti-felicis, an early successional Neotropical shrub. Neotropical Piper are a classic example of bat-dispersed plants, but we suggest that ants are underappreciated dispersal agents. We identified eleven ant species from the genera Aphaenogaster, Ectatomma, Paratrechina, Pheidole, Trachymyrmex, and Wasmannia recruiting to and harvesting P. sancti-felicis seeds in forest edge and secondary forest sites at La Selva, Costa Rica. We also tested for differences in ant recruitment to five states in which ants can commonly encounter seeds: unripe fruit, ripe fruit, overripe fruit, bat feces, and cleaned seeds. Overall, ants harvested more seeds from ripe and overripe fruits than other states, but this varied among species. To better understand the mechanisms behind ant preferences for ripe/overripe fruit, we also studied how alkenylphenols, secondary metabolites found in high concentrations in P. sancti-felicis fruits, affected foraging behavior in one genus of potential ant dispersers, Ectatomma. We found no effects of alkenylphenols on recruitment of Ectatomma to fruits, and thus, these compounds are unlikely to explain differences in ant recruitment among fruits of different maturity. Considering that P. sancti-felicis seeds have no apparent adaptations for ant dispersal, and few ants removed seeds that were cleaned of pulp, we hypothesize that most ants are harvesting its seeds for the nutritional rewards in the attached pulp. This study emphasizes the importance of ants as important additional dispersers of P. sancti-felicis and suggests that other non-myrmecochorous, vertebrate-dispersed plants may similarly benefit from the recruitment to fruit by ants.

AB Question Land-use change and intensification are currently the most pervasive threats to tropical biodiversity. Yet, their effects on biodiversity change with elevation are unknown. Here, we examine how tree diversity and community composition vary with elevation and how the effects of forest use intensity on tree diversity and community composition change within elevations. Location Eastern slopes of the Cofre de Perote mountain, state of Veracruz, Mexico. Methods We assessed tree diversity and composition using a sampling design in which elevation was crossed with three levels of forest use intensity: old-growth, degraded, and secondary forests. We established 120 20 m x 20 m forest plots, located at eight sites between 0 m and 3,545 m. At each site, five replicate plots were inventoried for each level of forest use intensity. Results Our analyses revealed an interactive effect between elevation and forest use intensity affecting tree diversity and community composition along the elevational gradient. Contrasting effects of forest use intensity within elevation resulted in tree diversity following a low-plateau pattern for old-growth and a bimodal pattern for degraded and secondary forests. Along the entire elevational gradient, there were 217 tree species distributed within 154 genera and 80 families. Species accumulation curves revealed that forests at 0 m and 1,500 m elevation showed differences in species richness among forest use intensities. In contrast, species richness did not differ between old-growth forest and the other forest use intensities in five of the eight studied elevations. In terms of community composition, secondary forests differed from old-growth and degraded forests. Conclusion Our results suggest that the interactive effects of elevation and forest use intensity change tree diversity patterns and community composition along a tropical elevational gradient. Degraded forests were similar to old-growth forests in terms of species diversity and composition, suggesting that they may act as a safeguard of tree diversity in human-dominated tropical landscapes.

AB Sand and gravel are widely applied for filtering pre- or primary-treated wastewater in small-scale wastewater treatment (SWT) systems. However, ecological materials continue to attract increasing interest in use as retrofits for achieving better performance in removing dissolved contaminants and recovering nutrients from wastewater. In this study, we assessed the plant availability and leachability of phosphorus (P) from sand (Sa) and gas concrete (GC) media previously fortified with biochar (BC) and used for phosphorus (P) removal in laboratory-scale packed bed reactors and field-scale constructed filter beds. Batch and leaching experiments were conducted, with distilled water and ammonium lactate (AL) solutions (1:20 solid?liquid (w/v) ratio) applied as extractants. In the findings, reference (Sa) and fortified (Sa-BC) sand filters leached 11.2 and 20.5?mg?P?kg(?1) respectively, to percolating water while the P seemed less likely to leach from GC systems. Extraction with AL showed that P retained in GC was plant-available and that GC could release up to 90?mg?kg(?1) of the bound mass. These findings highlight the need to evaluate risks of nutrient leaching from filter media for SWT systems especially where groundwater and surface water are final recipients of such effluents. For greater sustainability of use of the media, the weakly bound P in media such as Sa and BC and strongly bound in media such as GC types of materials may be recovered by recycling the spent material to agriculture. However, this may require re-design of the treatment system especially with respect to particle size to make recycling technically feasible.

TI Relationship between land surface temperature and fraction of

SO PLOS ONE

ID ENERGY BALANCE ALGORITHM; CLIMATE
AB There is growing evidence that modification of tropical forests to pasture or other anthropic uses (anthropization) leads to land surface warming at local and regional scales; however, the degree of this effect is unknown given the dependence on physiographic and atmospheric conditions. We investigated the dependence of satellite land surface temperature (LST) on the fraction of anthropized area index, defined as the fraction of non-forested percentual area within 120m square boxes, sampled over a large tropical forest dominated ecosystem spatial domain in the Atlantic Forest biome, southeastern Brazil. The LST estimated at a 30 m resolution, showed a significant dependence on elevation and topographic aspect, which controlled the average thermal regime by 2 similar to 4 degrees C and 1 similar to 2 degrees C, respectively. The correction of LST by these topographic factors allowed to detect a dependence of LST on the fraction of non-forested area. Accordingly, the relationship between LST and the fraction of non-forested area showed a positive linear relationship (R-2 = 0.63), whereby each 25% increase of non-forest area resulted in increased 1 degrees C. As such, increase of the maximum temperature (similar to 4 degrees C) would occur in the case of 100% increase of non-forested area. We conclude that our study area, composed to Atlantic forest, appears to show regulatory characteristics of temperature attenuation as a local climatic ecosystem service, which may have mitigation effects on the accelerated global warming.

AB Animal-mediated pollination is essential for the maintenance of plant reproduction, especially in tropical ecosystems, where pollination networks have been thought to have highly generalized structures. However, accumulating evidence suggests that not all floral visitors provide equally effective pollination services, potentially reducing the number of realized pollinators and increasing the cryptic specialization of pollination networks. Thus, there is a need to understand how different functional groups of pollinators influence pollination success. Here, we examined whether patterns of contemporary pollen-mediated gene flow in Heliconia tortuosa are consistent with the foraging strategy of its territorial or traplining hummingbird pollinators. Territorial hummingbirds defend clumps of flowers and are expected to transfer pollen locally. In contrast, traplining hummingbirds forage across longer distances, thereby increasing pollen flow among forest fragments, and are thought to repeatedly visit particular plants. If trapliners indeed visit the same plants repeatedly along their regular routes, this could lead to a situation where neighboring plants sample genetically distinct pollen pools. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 720 seeds and 71 mother plants from 18 forest fragments at 11 microsatellite loci. We performed TwoGener analysis to test pollen pool differentiation within sites (among neighboring plants within the same forest fragment: Phi(SC)) and between sites (among forest fragments: Phi(CT)). We found strong, statistically significant pollen pool differentiation among neighboring mother plants (Phi(SC) = 0.0506), and weaker, statistically significant differentiation among sites (Phi(CT) = 0.0285). We interpret this pattern of hierarchical pollen pool differentiation as the landscape genetic signature of the foraging strategy of traplining hummingbirds, where repeatable, long-distance, and high-fidelity routes transfer pollen among particular plants. Although H. tortuosa is also visited by territorial hummingbirds, our results suggest that these pollinators do not contribute substantially to successful pollination, highlighting differences in realized pollination efficiency. This cryptic reduction in the number of realized pollinators potentially increases the vulnerability of pollination success to the decline of populations of traplining hummingbirds, which have been shown to be sensitive to forest fragmentation. We conclude that maintaining habitat connectivity to sustain the foraging routes of trapliners may be essential for the maintenance of pollen-mediated gene flow in human-modified landscapes.

AB Long-term studies to understand biodiversity changes remain scarce-especially so for tropical mountains. We examined changes from 1911 to 2016 in the bird community of the cloud forest of San Antonio, a mountain ridge in the Colombian Andes. We evaluated the effects of past land-use change and assessed species vulnerability to climate disruption. Forest cover decreased from 95% to 50% by 1959, and 33 forest species were extirpated. From 1959 to 1990, forest cover remained stable, and an additional 15 species were lost-a total of 29% of the forest bird community. Thereafter, forest cover increased by 26% and 17 species recolonized the area. The main cause of extirpations was the loss of connections to adjacent forests. Of the 31 (19%) extirpated birds, 25 have ranges peripheral to San Antonio, mostly in the lowlands. Most still occurred regionally, but broken forest connections limited their recolonization. Other causes of extirpation were hunting, wildlife trade, and water diversion. Bird community changes included a shift from predominantly common species to rare species; forest generalists replaced forest specialists that require old growth, and functional groups, such as large-body frugivores and nectarivores, declined disproportionally. All water-dependent birds were extirpated. Of the remaining 122 forest species, 19 are vulnerable to climate disruption, 10 have declined in abundance, and 4 are threatened. Our results show unequivocal species losses and changes in community structure and abundance at the local scale. We found species were extirpated after habitat loss and fragmentation, but forest recovery stopped extirpations and helped species repopulate. Land-use changes increased species vulnerability to climate change, and we suggest reversing landscape transformation may restore biodiversity and improve resistance to future threats.

AB Mexico ranks fourth worldwide for its number of species of vascular plants; however, insufficient area has been marked for conservation as Protected Natural Areas (PNAs); 176 PNAs represent 12% of the total surface and encompass only a small portion of the Mexican endemic species. Strategies for setting up conservation zones are often based on identifying biodiversity hotspots to preserve the maximum number of species with the most efficient use of funds. Here we used the richness analysis by grid method based on herbarium specimens to locate zones with a high richness of Cosmos taxa (species and their varieties). Because this approach can lead to omission error, we also obtained an Ecological Niche Model (ENM) for each Cosmos taxon to perform a richness analysis by grid and locate sites with suitable conditions for supporting the most Cosmos taxa. We conducted a panbiogeographic analysis to locate biogeographical nodes, sites of great geobiotic complexity. Western Mexico was thus identified as the highest priority for Cosmos conservation; it has the greatest richness and most suitable conditions for Cosmos and has great biotic complexity. Although one of the largest Mexican PNAs is located in this region, some species with restricted distribution do not occur within this Protected Natural Area (PNA); therefore, a southwest extension of this PNA is proposed.

AB Mapping forest types and tree species at regional scales to provide information for ecologists and forest managers is a new challenge for the remote sensing community. Here, we assess the potential of a U-net convolutional network, a recent deep learning algorithm, to identify and segment (1) natural forests and eucalyptus plantations, and (2) an indicator of forest disturbance, the tree species Cecropia hololeuca, in very high resolution images (0.3 m) from the WorldView-3 satellite in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest region. The networks for forest types and Cecropia trees were trained with 7611 and 1568 red-green-blue (RGB) images, respectively, and their dense labeled masks. Eighty per cent of the images were used for training and 20% for validation. The U-net network segmented forest types with an overall accuracy >95% and an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.96. For C. hololeuca, the overall accuracy was 97% and the IoU was 0.86. The predictions were produced over a 1600 km(2) region using WorldView-3 RGB bands pan-sharpened at 0.3 m. Natural and eucalyptus forests compose 79 and 21% of the region's total forest cover (82 250 ha). Cecropia crowns covered 1% of the natural forest canopy. An index to describe the level of disturbance of the natural forest fragments based on the spatial distribution of Cecropia trees was developed. Our work demonstrates how a deep learning algorithm can support applications such as vegetation, tree species distributions and disturbance mapping on a regional scale.

AB Fire causes disturbance of wetland ecosystems and has a major influence on soil microbial communities, plant growth and ecosystem function. However, the impact of fire disturbance on soil microbial metabolism and its relationship with plant growth remains poorly understood. Burned zones, unburned zones and transition zones with low intensity fire were surveyed in an area dominated by Carex brevicuspis communities. Results show a significant difference in soil properties, microbial biomasses, microbial carbon utilization pattern and plant growth in different zones. The lowest average value of soil carbon content, nitrogen content and moisture occurred in burned zones, while the highest occurred in unburned zones. Furthermore, soil microbes under burned zones had the highest biomasses, average well color development value and richness index. Plant growth decreased in the following order: burned > transition > unburned zones. Redundancy analysis indicated that this variation can be explained mostly by the difference of carbon utilization patterns of soil microbes. Correlation and regression analyses show that soil microbial metabolism had a significant correlation with the plant growth variables tested in this study. Overall, our results suggest that fire changes the soil microenvironment and further changes the soil microbial metabolic patterns and plant growth in the Lake Poyang wetland.

AB Introduction: The biogeographic Choco presents an exuberant diversity of arboreal species; however, it is unknown if soils determine this diversity. Objective: Evaluate how edaphic conditions explain the diversity and arboreal dominance in tropical pluvial forests at a local scale. Methods: Seven permanent research plots were established in the forests of Opogodo, Pacurita and Salero. In these plots, tree diversity and dominance were measured, and edaphic conditions such as organic matter (OM), acidity, nutrients and texture were determined. Results: It was found that the diversity was much greater in Salero and Pacurita; hut the dominance was greater in Opogodo. The diversity was positively related to phosphorus, aluminum, silt and clay; while, with pH, OM, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sand, the relationship was negative. On the other hand, dominance was negatively related to P and Al; while, the relationship was positive with pH, OM, Ca and sand. Conclusions: It was corroborated that the arboreal diversity is negatively related to some variables (Ca, Mg, K) of edaphic fertility. Apparently, edaphic infertility, acidity and aluminum toxicity, determine tree dynamics and diversity.

AB Key message Cloud forest tree seedlings of higher leaf mass to area ratio and leaf dry matter content displayed higher survival along an elevation gradient in the forest understorey. Phenotypic plasticity in leaf functional traits was not related to seedling survival.
   Context Understanding the relationship between seedling survival and phenotypic plasticity of leaf functional traits is of great importance for predicting tree species responses to climate change.
   Aims We analysed whether phenotypic plasticity and mean values of leaf functional traits could serve as predictors of cloud forest tree seedling survival along an elevation gradient.
   Methods We measured survival, leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in planted tree seedlings of 13 shade-tolerant tropical cloud forest species in nine forest understorey sites along an elevation gradient in southern Mexico. Phenotypic plasticity in LMA and LDMC was calculated based on inter-individual phenotypic variation to different elevations.
   Results Intraspecific differences inLMA and LDMCoccurred with elevation. Across the elevation range, seedlings with higher mean LMA and LDMC had higher survival. Plasticity in leaf traits was small and was not related to survival.
   Conclusion Our results support that mean LMA, and to a lesser extent mean LDMC, could be good predictors of cloud forest tree seedling survival along elevation gradients. The small leaf trait plasticity found does not affect the survival of seedlings in the forest understorey along the elevation gradient.

AB There is growing realization that intraspecific variation in seed dispersal can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, we do not have a good understanding of the drivers or causes of intraspecific variation in dispersal, how strong an effect these drivers have, and how widespread they are across dispersal modes. As a first step to developing a better understanding, we present a broad, but not exhaustive, review of what is known about the drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal, and what remains uncertain. We start by decomposing 'drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal' into intrinsic drivers (i.e. variation in traits of individual plants) and extrinsic drivers (i.e. variation in ecological context). For intrinsic traits, we further decompose intraspecific variation into variation among individuals and variation of trait values within individuals. We then review our understanding of the major intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal, with an emphasis on variation among individuals. Crop size is the best-supported and best-understood intrinsic driver of variation across dispersal modes; overall, more seeds are dispersed as more seeds are produced, even in cases where per seed dispersal rates decline. Fruit/seed size is the second most widely studied intrinsic driver, and is also relevant to a broad range of seed dispersal modes. Remaining intrinsic drivers are poorly understood, and range from effects that are probably widespread, such as plant height, to drivers that are most likely sporadic, such as fruit or seed colour polymorphism. Primary extrinsic drivers of variation in seed dispersal include local environmental conditions and habitat structure. Finally, we present a selection of outstanding questions as a starting point to advance our understanding of individual variation in seed dispersal.

AB Aggregating diverse plant species into a few functional groups based on functional traits provides new insights for promoting landscape planning and conserving biodiversity in species-diverse regions. Ecophysiological traits are the basis of the functioning of an ecosystem. However, studies related to the identification of functional groups based on plant ecophysiological traits in tropical forests are still scarce because of the inherent difficulties in measuring them. In this study, we measured five ecophysiological traits: net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), maximum stomatal conductance (g(max)), water use efficiency (WUE), transpiration rate (Trmmol), and specific leaf areas (SLA) for 87 plant species dominant in a chronosequence of secondary succession, using four time periods (5 year-primary, 15 year-early, and 40 year-middle successional stages after clear cutting and old growth) in the tropical montane rainforest on Hainan Island, China. These species were grouped using hierarchical cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Finally, the changes in the composition of functional groups and species richness along the chronosequence were analyzed. Results showed that the plant species in the tropical montane rainforest could be classified into eight distinct functional groups. The richness of functional groups was low during the initial early stage and increased as the early and middle stages progressed, and then declined in the late successional stage. The dominant functional groups in the primary stages had the highest A(max), g(max), Trmmol, and SLA, as well as the lowest WUE, while those in the early and middle successional stages had functional traits at a moderate level, and at the late stage they had the lowest A(max), g(max), Trmmol, and SLA, and highest WUE. Our study showed that the diverse plant species in the tropical montane rainforest could be grouped into a few functional groups according to major ecophysiological traits, and the composition and relative abundance of different groups changed with the successional dynamics of the forest ecosystem.

AB Because cropping systems can greatly affect the establishment and spread of alien species populations, the design of cropping systems to control invasive weeds is an important approach for invasive species management in agro-ecosystems to avoid excessive increases in other control measures such as herbicides. The annual weed Phalaris minor Retz. (P. minor) is one of the most troublesome invasive weed species of winter crops in Yunnan Province, China, but the development of cropping systems for ecological control of this weed have received limited research attention. Here, we studied seed dormancy, germination characteristics and reproductive responses of P. minor to various cropping systems to show how cropping systems could be better designed to control P. minor in China. Our research showed that cropping systems significantly affected seed dormancy in submerged paddy fields. Phalaris minor seed remained dormant and the germination rates (less than 10%) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in maize fields and dry, bare soil conditions. Wheat, faba bean and rapeseed crops had no significant influence (p < 0.05) on the seed germination rate of P. minor, but increasing soil depth significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the germination rate and germination index of this weed. Total biomass, spike biomass, spike number and seed number of P. minor were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with increasing proportions of the three crops (wheat, faba bean and rapeseed), with rapeseed having the strongest inhibition effects among the three crops. The reproductive allocation and reproductive investment of P. minor were also significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in mixed culture with wheat and rapeseed. With increasing proportions of wheat or rapeseed, the specific leaf area of P. minor significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the reverse was true for leaf area and specific leaf weight. Moreover, the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate for P. minor also decreased significantly (p < 0.05) when grown with wheat or rapeseed. These results suggest that optimal cropping systems design could involve planting rapeseed in conjunction with deep plowing and planting rice (continuous submergence underwater) in summer. Such a system could reduce the field populations and seed bank of P. minor, thus providing a sustainable and environmentally friendly means of suppressing P. minor.

AB Although decades of research have typically demonstrated a positive correlation between biodiversity of primary producers and associated trophic levels, the ecological drivers of this association are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that the plant microbiome, or the fungi and bacteria found on and inside plant hosts, may be cryptic yet important drivers of important processes, including primary production and trophic interactions. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we characterized foliar fungal community diversity, composition, and function from 15 broadleaved tree species (N = 545) in a recently established, large-scale temperate tree diversity experiment using over 17,000 seedlings. Specifically, we tested whether increases in tree richness and phylogenetic diversity would increase fungal endophyte diversity (the "Diversity Begets Diversity" hypothesis), as well as alter community composition (the "Tree Diversity-Endophyte Community" hypothesis) and function (the "Tree Diversity-Endophyte Function" hypothesis) at different spatial scales. We demonstrated that increasing tree richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased fungal species and functional guild richness and diversity, including pathogens, saprotrophs, and parasites, within the first three years of a forest diversity experiment. These patterns were consistent at the neighborhood and tree plot scale. Our results suggest that fungal endophytes, unlike other trophic levels (e.g., herbivores as well as epiphytic bacteria), respond negatively to increasing plant diversity.

AB Available research is inconclusive on how circatidal habitat use and cross-shore distribution of aquatic epibenthic predators may affect the vertical zonation of infauna in muddy, soft-bottom substrates in estuaries. We placed fyke traps at different heights on the intertidal mudflat to assess the circatidal density of epibenthic predators. Infauna was sampled across the same tidal gradient. The abundance of epibenthic predators in the fykes decreased with elevation (decreasing inundation time), yet for the shrimp Palaemon longirostris abundance did not change with elevation in autumn. When corrected for inundation time, predator density was equal over the tidal range or higher on the high mudflat in some instances, indicating that predators evenly distributed over the mudflat or moved to the highest part during a high tide. The density of epibenthic predators did not correlate with the density of infauna, whereas the latter did show a close relationship with sediment characteristics. Our data suggest epibenthic predator density does not shape the present distribution of infauna across the tidal gradient on the oligohaline mudflats in the Scheldt.

AB Aims
   Different plant functional groups display diverging responses to the same environmental gradients. Here, we assess the effects of environmental and spatial predictors on species turnover of three functional groups of Brazilian savannas (Cerrado) plants-trees, palms and lianas-across the transition zone between the Cerrado and Amazon biomes in central Brazil.
   Methods
   We used edaphic, climatic and plant composition data from nine one-hectare plots to assess the effects of the environment and space on species turnover using a Redundancy Analysis and Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM), associated with variance partitioning.
   Important Findings
   We recorded 167 tree species, 5 palms and 4 liana species. Environmental variation was most important in explaining species turnover, relative to geographic distance, but the best predictors differed between functional groups: geographic distance and silt for lianas; silt for palms; geographic distance, temperature and elevation for trees. Geographic distances alone exerted little influence over species turnover for the three functional groups. The pure environmental variation explained most of the liana and palm turnover, while tree turnover was largely explained by the shared spatial and environmental contribution. The effects of geographic distance upon species turnover leveled off at about 300 km for trees, and 200 km for lianas, whereas they were unimportant for palm species turnover. Our results indicate that environmental factors that determine floristic composition and species turnover differ substantially between plant functional groups in savannas. Therefore, we recommend that studies that aim to investigate the role of environmental conditions in determining plant species turnover should examine plant functional groups separately.

AB This study investigated the diet of longnose stingray Hypanus guttatus in the tropical waters of north-eastern Brazil. Samples were obtained from monthly sampling of artisanal fisheries from August 2007 to July 2008. A total of 258 specimens were examined, 127 females and 131 males, and stomach contents analysis suggested H. guttatus to be a generalist and opportunistic predator feeding on the most available prey in the environment. There was no significant difference in the diet composition of males and females, or between seasons. However, an ontogenetic dietary shift was observed with larger individuals having an increased proportion of molluscs in the diet, whilst smaller individuals predated primarily on small crustaceans.

AB We review the applications of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods in energy sector and in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), finding a gap on the non-use of specific methods that deal with divergent opinions, such as a group MCDA method. This way we suggest the application of a group MCDA method to demonstrate how it may be used for aiding group decision-making in public sector. Aiming at analyzing the aforementioned problem, we simulate the choosing of the construction alternatives of Belo Monte Dam. The power plant project was marked by several conflicts among stakeholders due to the generation of diversified environmental, social and economic impacts. The results show that a group MCDA method may be used to aid public sector in the analysis of complex problems, by dividing them into several parts, allowing, therefore, a transparent decision-making process, as well as to solve gaps in the EIA methods.

AB Patch size (area) and isolation (inverse distance to source) are key variables of island biogeography, but their application in conservation planning has recently come under scrutiny. Based on animal distribution data in fragmented landscapes from around the world it was postulated that occupancy was poorly predicted by patch size and isolation. Do these findings also apply to arid areas and to plants?
   This question was investigated in four inselberg landscapes in the Namib Desert stretching over a 770 km climatic north-south gradient. Inselbergs (isolated mountains) are special habitats and can be considered 'islands' of more mesic conditions in an arid matrix. Species richness of inselberg specialists was used as an indicator and regressed against area, distance to nearest habitat and distance to 'mainland' (or source pool, which are proxies for level of isolation). Additionally, the influence of landscape geographic position, land use and rock types were studied. Responses of different life forms and individual plant species as well as possible dispersal limitations were also investigated.
   Whether patch size is more important than isolation in determining species richness on arid inselbergs could not be answered at a landscape level. However, when investigated on a functional and species level, isolation was of greater importance than patch size for trees and also for selected species such as Commiphora saxicola and Heliotropium steudneri. The effect of distance to source in this study is likely a function of spatial distance as well as a coast-inland moisture gradient. Inselberg specialist-richness was not affected by land use or the bioclimatic position. Yet rock type, which is a reflection of soil physical and chemical properties did affect species richness with granites and basalts supporting more species. Life forms of inselberg specialists were influenced by the investigated environmental variables, but dispersal limitations were not. Despite inconclusive results at a landscape level, functional groups and individual species provided more conclusive results. This points towards the necessity of additional investigations at a finer scale to gain an understanding of the factors driving species distributions. In future more detail regarding the 'matrix' surrounding 'patches', as well as evolutionary and vegetation historic factors should be explored. Phylogenetic studies would be one tool to help unravelling some of the presently unknown factors affecting species distributions on Namib inselbergs. This study also highlighted the importance of inselbergs in arid landscapes as 'hotspots' of species richness and species of conservation importance. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The mineralization of soil organic phosphorus (P) is catalysed by extracellular phosphatases that hydrolyse different non-phytate phosphomonoesters (e.g., sugar phosphates and nucleotides), inositol phosphates (e.g., phytic acids), and phosphodiesters (e.g., nucleic acids, phospholipids). The availabilities of both the organic P compound and the respective phosphatase enzyme jointly determine whether the hydrolysis reaction is substrate limited (enzyme availability > substrate availability) or enzyme limited (enzyme availability < substrate availability), with potential consequences for overall organic P composition and accumulation in soil. Our objective was to evaluate whether the hydrolysis of various organic P compounds in soil is limited by availability of substrate or enzyme. To this end, we combined the principles of enzyme activity assays and enzyme addition assays. Ten soils with contrasting properties and origins received either model organic P substrate, specific phosphatases or a combination of both, added either to a soil:water suspension or a soil:water filtrate. Soil indigenous activity of phosphatases was low in all filtrates, confirming that enzymes were mostly associated with the solid fraction of the soil. In soil suspensions, the rapid hydrolysis of added non-phytate phosphomonoester substrate by soil indigenous enzymes indicated high availability of non-phytase phosphomonoesterase enzymes. In combination with the low availability of non-phytate phosphomonoester substrate in soil suspensions, determined by adding enzymes to the suspensions, this indicated a substrate limitation for the hydrolysis of non-phytate phosphomonoesters in soil. In contrast, enzyme-limitation was found for phytate and phosphodiesters. A review of the available literature on the production, stabilisation and hydrolytic activity of each of the three analysed organic P substrates and the respective enzymes supported our findings. We therefore suggest that not only the production and stabilisation but also differences in available phosphatase enzymes strongly determine the occurrence of specific organic P compounds in soil.

AB We studied species composition and seasonal co-existence of coprophagous Scarabaeoidea from two study sites in karst meadows in sub-Mediterranean Slovenia. Each site consisted of three habitat patches with different impact of grazing (S1, the active part of the pasture; S2, the overgrown part of the pasture, mainly spiny shrubs; S3, a meadow with some overgrown patches of shrubs outside the fenced pasture). Four pitfall trapping events per month were conducted from March until November to test for temporal, spatial and habitat-related segregation of species. Primary results show a high level of temporal segregation of species within and between the guilds (Aphodiidae - dwellers, Geotrupidae - tunnelers, Scarabaeidae - tunnelers, Scarabaeidae - rollers). Temporal segregation of monthly samples was evident between Aphodiidae - dwellers (most active at the beginning and end of the season, with a month of complete inactivity during hot summer) and Scarabaeidae - tunnelers (present all the time, but with least species and specimens at the beginning and end of season). Intraguild competition was most prominent for Aphodiidac - dwellers and Geotrupidae - tunnelers, where species show high rate of temporal avoidance to minimize interspecies competition for the same food source. Finally, geographical (site-related) and habitat-related (S1, S2, S3) differences were found in species composition, species richness and abundance, however for the latter two parameters only at habitat level (more species at S1, but higher abundances at S2 and S3). The results imply that the pronounced temporal and spatial segregation facilitate higher biodiversity in space and time, and allow more species to co-exist at the same sites over time.

AB Volcanic CO2 vents are useful environments for investigating the biological responses of marine organisms to changing ocean conditions (Ocean acidification, OA). Marine shelled molluscs are highly sensitive to changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. In this study, we investigated the effects of reduced pH on the intertidal gastropod, Phorcus sauciatus, in a volcanic CO2 vent off La Palma Island (Canary Islands, North East Atlantic Ocean), a location with a natural pH gradient ranging from 7.0 to 8.2 over the tidal cycles. Density and size-frequency distribution, shell morphology, shell integrity, fracture resistance, and desiccation tolerance were evaluated between populations from control and CO2 vent sites. We found no effects of reduced pH on population parameters or desiccation tolerance across the pH gradient, but significant differences in shell morphology, shell integrity, and fracture resistance were detected. Individuals from the CO2 vent site exhibited a higher shell aspect ratio, greater percentages of shell dissolution and break, and compromised shell strength than those from the control site. Our results highlight that long-term exposure to high pCO(2) can negatively affect the shell features of P. sauciatus but may not have a significant effect on population performance. Moreover, we suggest that loss of shell properties could lead to changes in predator-prey interactions.

AB The replacement of natural by anthropogenic habitat changes biological communities in any biome. Variations in environmental conditions along the chronosequence of tree plantations may act as a gradient of environmental filtering where the gain or loss of species occurs. It is expected that environmental filtering increases with the decrease in environmental similarity between the plantations and the natural habitat. Young tree plantations are structurally more similar to grasslands than to mature plantations, which in turn are structurally more similar to subtropical forest than young plantations. This study compares patterns of beta diversity across exotic pine plantation chronosequences in contrasting biomes. We predict that taxonomic and functional beta diversity between plantation and the natural habitat assemblages increase with plantation age in grasslands and decrease in the subtropical forest. We sampled epigean ants and measured environmental variables at 54 plantations of different ages and natural habitats in grassland and forest biomes in Argentina. Taxonomic and functional beta diversity between natural habitat and pine plantations were estimated through dissimilarity indexes of turnover and nestedness. To assess the response of beta diversity estimators to plantation age we performed general linear and non-linear models. Results revealed opposite beta diversity patterns between biomes along the plantation cycle. Turnover increased and nestedness decreased with declining environmental similarity between pine plantations and the natural habitats; changes in the identity of the species were coupled to changes in their functional characteristics. Thus, a given environmental gradient may produce different diversity patterns depending on the regional species pool. Forestry practices that generate environmental conditions similar to natural environments could help to conserve species from the natural habitat. (C) 2019 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB The fragmentation of natural environments is one of the most important threats to biodiversity and involves changes in landscape configuration and habitat quality. The Atlantic Forest of South America has been highly fragmented, which creates concern for the conservation of its biodiversity. We evaluated the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on the terrestrial mammal assemblage of the Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina. The area still contains large fragments and a forest cover >50%. We evaluated the effect of the configuration of the fragments (area, isolation) and the quality of the environment surrounding them (% of forest, land uses, poaching). We sampled mammal assemblages with camera-traps. We used generalized linear models, with the number of species in smaller forest fragments (49 stations) and the difference in their composition to that of the largest forest fragment (control situation; 53 stations) as response variables. Species richness in the fragments increased with the proportion of forest in their surroundings and decreased with the distance to population sources. The dissimilarity of the assemblages of smaller fragments to those of the largest fragment increased with forest disturbance and by the contrast of the land uses (e.g., annual crops) surrounding the fragments. We modeled and mapped these effects, which can be used as spatially explicit planning tools for the conservation of the mammal assemblage in this landscape. The effect of fragmentation on the mammal assemblage is mediated by both anthropic effects that affect the quality of the environment and by the spatial configuration of fragments in the landscape.

AB Windstorms, known as blowdowns, create large canopy gaps in the tropical rainforest. Despite the occurrence of blowdowns in Central Amazonia, no studies have yet investigated the seed bank in areas altered by blowdown in the Amazon rainforest. The seed bank plays an important role in the regeneration of larger natural gaps, and changes in, or partial loss of, seed bank can modify the successional dynamics locally. In the present study, we compared the density, richness and floristic composition of a seed bank in a post-blowdown secondary forest with approximately six years old and a continuous forest. The seed bank was characterized by collecting 160 soil samples systematically distributed in each forest type at two different times. Samples were collected at a minimum distance of 30 m from each other, sampling the superficial soil 5 cm in depth and 20 cm in diameter. At each sampling point, the slope and canopy openness was also measured. The density and floristic composition of the seed bank was estimated using counts of seedlings that had emerged in a nursery of the collected soil samples. The post-blowdown secondary forest exhibited seed banks 30% denser and 20% richer, on average, than continuous forest. The floristic composition also differed between forest types, with a predominance of Melastomataceae, Urticaceae, and Araceae in the secondary forest, followed by Cyperaceae and Moraceae; however, these did not differ between forest types. In contrast, for other families, greater richness and density were observed in the continuous forest. Higher density and richness of trees, shrubs, epiphytes, and hemiepiphytes were observed in the secondary forest, except for the richness of epiphytes. In general, terrain slope was unrelated to density, richness and floristic composition of the seed bank. Under a disturbance of great magnitude, such as a blowdown, the density and richness of the seed bank were not reduced; on the contrary, its potential for local regeneration was maintained. Despite the limited contribution of the seed bank to the regeneration of climax species, the seed bank was shown to be diverse in species, including different life forms, and may contribute to the regeneration of forest strata, even after severe disturbances.

AB Human-induced wildfires are one of the greatest threats to tropical forest and are predicted to increase in importance due to altered regimes associated with climate change. Wildfires promote high tree mortality, thus modifying forest structure and composition, and lead to habitat loss and fragmentation. Wildfires may also have effects on the adjacent unbumt areas due to edge influence; conversely, proximity to unburnt forest stands may favor regeneration in the burnt areas. We evaluated wildfire effects on the forest structure of Brazilian Atlantic forest remnants. We established 244 plots along eight 360 m-long transects distributed among three burnt patches, where we measured structural attributes of overstory, understory, and deadwood. The wildfire promoted very high mortality of trees, saplings, and lianas, changing substantially the forest structure. Our analyses showed clear differences between the burnt and unburnt areas but no clear gradients, highlighting the incipient stage of edge influence-related processes. The Neotropical bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum was dominant in the burnt areas, which can possibly arrest secondary succession. Our results highlight the importance of wildfires as a menace to Brazilian Atlantic Forests remnants, as well as to tropical rainforests elsewhere - an ever-rising concern in a future of increased fire frequency.

AB Conspecific negative distance dependent seedling mortality and negative density-dependent seedling survival (CNDD) are among the most important mechanisms of species diversity maintenance. Recent research has demonstrated that CNDD is greater for species with abundant seeds, due mainly to attack by density-dependent pathogens. If seed number were correlated negatively with seed size, species with smaller seeds would exhibit much greater negative CNDD. We explored whether CNDD is affected by seed size. We evaluated the strength of CNDD as a log response ratio of the probability of mortality among seedlings at conspecific and heterospecific sites and at high and low densities as functions of distance and density, respectively, in a seed-sowing experiment using eight hardwood species in a temperate forest in northern Japan. As a function of distance, CNDD attributable to pathogens was correlated positively with seed mass at low density, but not at high density, whereas seed mass was not correlated with CNDD attributable to invertebrate or vertebrate herbivores. As a function of density, seed mass was not correlated with CNDD attributable to pathogens or invertebrate or vertebrate herbivores. The ability of large-seeded species to better tolerate CNDD suggests a novel mechanism through which seed size may contribute to CNDD variation and promote species coexistence due to distance-dependent attack by pathogens, particularly those bearing leaf diseases.

AB Purpose The biosphere is progressively subjected to a variety of pressures resulting from anthropogenic activities. Habitat conversion, resulting from anthropogenic land use, is considered the dominant factor driving terrestrial biodiversity loss. Hence, adequate modelling of land use impacts on biodiversity in decision-support tools, like life cycle assessment (LCA), is a priority. State-of-the-art life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) characterisation models for land use impacts on biodiversity translate natural habitat transformation and occupation into biodiversity impacts. However, the currently available models predominantly focus on total habitat loss and ignore the spatial configuration of the landscape. That is, habitat fragmentation effects are ignored in current LCIAs with the exception of one recently developed method. Methods Here, we review how habitat fragmentation may affect biodiversity. In addition, we investigate how land use impacts on biodiversity are currently modelled in LCIA and how missing fragmentation impacts can influence the LCIA model results. Finally, we discuss fragmentation literature to evaluate possible methods to include habitat fragmentation into advanced characterisation models. Results and discussion We found support in available ecological literature for the notion that habitat fragmentation is a relevant factor when assessing biodiversity loss. Moreover, there are models that capture fragmentation effects on biodiversity that have the potential to be incorporated into current LCIA characterisation models. Conclusions and recommendations To enhance the credibility of LCA biodiversity assessments, we suggest that available fragmentation models are adapted, expanded and subsequently incorporated into advanced LCIA characterisation models and promote further efforts to capture the remaining fragmentation effects in LCIA characterisation models.

AB The change registered in water temperature over recent years has represented a considerable challenge for the culture of salmonid fishes in terms of thermal stress. However, previous trials with Australian, Japanese, and Argentinean rainbow trout lines suggested that improvements in thermal performance might be possible. The aim of this work was to explore performance, i.e., the survival, malformations, food intake, growth, feed conversion efficiency, condition factor, thermal tolerance, and preferred temperature of a number of F1 families (wild thermal resistant malexfarmed female) in order to formulate proposals for future work. The performances evaluated showed significant differences between F1 and control families, but no major heterogeneity within F1 families. The incidence of complex malformations, lower in F1 families than in controls, could indicate an advantage due to lower homozygosity. Thermal tolerance varied within F1 families but preferred temperature did not. Survival data suggested that chronic exposure to 20.5 degrees C had a lethal effect on control families. However, F1 families acclimated to 20.5 degrees C over a long period of time (ca. 109 days) preferred a mean temperature of 20.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C, a final temperature preference substantially higher than those observed for other populations and strains of the species. Although growth differences between control and F1 families should be considered with caution, since no family was selected by growth in this work, it appears that simple selection by growth could be all that is necessary before beginning the process of introducing these families into farmed lines.

AB The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is crucial for understanding land use impact on carbon budget. The spatial estimation and accurate mapping of SOCD in plains remain challenging, partly due to the relatively invariant topography and the lack of consideration of landscape patterns. Here, we propose a novel landscape metric-based regression Kriging (LMRK) for the spatial estimation of SOCD in plains. Using 242 topsoil samples collected in the Jianghan Plain, China, we (i) investigate the scale-dependent relationship between SOCD and 24 landscape metrics and (ii) develop LMRK models with multi-scale buffers (100-1000 m) for SOCD estimation and compare their performance with ordinary Kriging (OK) and regression Kriging (RK) that integrates land use types. Results showed that LMRK outperformed other models. The relationships between SOCD and landscape metrics were found to be scale-dependent, and the buffer of 300 m exhibited the optimal scale in our case. The LMRK also revealed that a highly connected and water-sufficient landscape was conducive to the accumulation of soil organic carbon in farmlands. These results indicated that landscape metrics serve as good predictors, and the proposed LMRK method is effective for SOCD mapping in plains. Our findings highlight the scale-dependent relationship between landscape metrics and SOCD and provide a new perspective for soil mapping in plains.

AB Spatial variation in tree-regeneration density is attributed to the specialization of tree species to light availability for germination and growth. Light availability, in turn, varies across the gap-understorey mosaic. Canopy gaps provide an important habitat for the regeneration of tree species that would otherwise be suppressed in the understory. In subtropical forests, there is still a knowledge-gap relating to how canopy disturbances influence tree-regeneration patterns at local scale, and if they disproportionately favor regeneration of certain species. We aim to analyze whether canopy gaps promote tree regeneration, and tree species are specialized to gaps or understory for germination and growth. We sampled vegetation in 128 plots (0.01 ha), equally distributed in gaps and below canopy, in two subtropical Shorea robusta Gaertn. (Sal) forests in Nepal, recording the number of tree seedlings and saplings in each plot. We compared the regeneration density of seedlings and saplings separately between gaps and the understorey. The mean densities of seedlings and saplings were higher in the gaps at both sites; although there was no difference in the seedling density of the majority of the species between the habitats. No species were confined to either gap or understorey at the seedling stage. We conclude that gaps are not critical for the germination of tree species in Sal forests but these are an important habitat for enabling seedlings to survive into saplings. The classification of trees into regeneration guilds mainly based on germination does not apply to the majority of tree species in subtropical Sal forests. Our results reaffirm that gap creation promotes tree regeneration by favouring seedling survival and growth and can influence forest management for conservation, as well as for plantations.

AB Forest gaps are important small-scale disturbances that initiate forest succession. However, natural regeneration patterns within gaps remain unclear, especially in temperate secondary forests. In this study, three-dimensional graphic systems were established to show the whole regeneration patterns of woody species with different shade tolerance in natural gaps. Furthermore, all gaps were classified into three size classes, and each gap was divided into two parts, canopy gaps (CGs) and gap peripheries (GPs). A total of 34 woody species were found in the 41 surveyed gaps, but almost no tree species had a high importance value index (>= 0.100). Total plant density decreased from the small gaps to the large gaps, showing a density trend similar to that of shade-tolerant species. Total species richness peaked in the medium gaps, which indicated that medium gaps could provide moderate environments for most woody species. Both the species richness and plant density of shade-tolerant species were lower in CGs than in GPs, regardless of gap sizes. In contrast, both the species richness and plant density of shade-intolerant species were higher in CGs than in GPs. Interestingly, intermediate shade-tolerant species exhibited a "doughnut" regeneration pattern in the large gaps, which indicated that they could neither compete with shade-intolerant species in CGs nor invade GPs occupied by shade-tolerant species. Our findings suggest that gap formation could benefit woody species regeneration, but subsequent treatments based on gap silviculture are needed to eliminate low-value species and manage target tree species, which would help accelerate the restoration of secondary forests.

AB We investigated whether thermal tolerance is useful in predicting the responses of tropical snails to heat-waves - unusually warm periods of weather. Studying four sympatric high-rocky-shore species, we assessed thermal tolerance from the lethal limit following a constant rate of acute warming, as well as from an ecologically-relevant heat tolerance measure accounting for midday thermal exposure times. These thermal tolerance assessments were then compared with the survival of snails under three laboratory-simulated heat-wave treatments, each constituting four days of cycling temperatures but varying in daily maximum temperature (45, 48 and 50 degrees C). Additionally, water loss of individual snails was measured daily to assess the effect of desiccation due to heat-wave exposure. We found that responses to heat-wave exposure are complex and are not always predictable from thermal tolerance traits. This arises from a mismatch in thermal tolerance and desiccation tolerance, such that variation in daily thermal maximum and duration of the heat-waves produced different survival responses for each species. This study highlights the need to consider both thermal and desiccation tolerance traits when building frameworks to predicting heat-wave vulnerability in benthic intertidal ectotherms.

AB Solving scientific and applied problems in restoration ecology requires the use of methodologies that can unravel the relationship between different plant species and the distribution of relevant soil resources. This study proposes a new method to accurately quantify the relationship between plants and soil resource patterns by integrating geostatistics, point pattern analysis, and spatial comparison (IGPS). IGPS was used to analyze the relationship between different shrub species and soil resources in an arid area near Wuhai City in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region of China. The relationships between several dominant species and soil resources have been evaluated, thus providing a reference point for the selection of suitable species for ecological restoration in this particular region. The results indicate that IGPS can identify the main plant species that affect the distribution of soil resources, determine which patterns in the distribution of soil resources are caused by plants, determine the number of plants that directly affect soil patches, and quantify the spatial relationship between plants and soil resources. This method is useful for both theoretical research and practical applications and is suitable for use in ecosystems all over the world.

AB There is growing use of economic incentives such as Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to encourage sustainable land management. An important critique is that such approaches may unintentionally disrupt environmental and social values, 'crowding out' pre-existing motivations to conserve. Some scholars suggest that the use of in-kind payments and norm-based framing, rather than financial transfers and a market framing, can mitigate these risks. There are calls to use more robust methods for impact evaluation in environmental policy. We use one of the only Randomized Controlled Trials of a conservation incentive scheme to evaluate its impact on self-stated environmental and social values and beliefs. Data from before and after the intervention, from households in villages randomly selected to receive the program or not, demonstrate that the program increased prioritization of environmental values (evidence of crowding-in as opposed to crowding out) and altered social beliefs related to inequality and the role of government. The findings demonstrate that this conservation program had a positive impact on environmental values and increased the belief that government involvement is appropriate. The scheme, with its use of in-kind payments and reciprocity framing, offers lessons to those seeking to develop effective schemes to incentivize positive environmental stewardship.

AB The family Tephritidae, known as fruit flies, is one of the most species-rich in the order Diptera. This study aimed to analyze the diversity of Tephritidae through different ecosystems over a Neotropical transitional region in Mexico. Medium evergreen forest (MEF), transitional vegetation between tropical and temperate environments (TVE), and cloud forest (CF) were sampled in the biosphere reserve "El Cielo." The abundance and diversity of tephritids were analyzed by a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and Hill numbers using rarefaction and extrapolation (R/E) sampling curves, respectively. Also, we computed a diversity ranking over the altitudinal gradient based on a beta diversity approach and functional tools. Anastrepha was the most rich-genus with 11 species, followed by Hexachaeta with two species, and Blepharoneura and Rhagoletis with one species each. Twelve species were registered in the MEF, six in the TVE, and two species in the CF. The GLMM revealed unclear differences between MEF and TVE in the abundance of tephritids. Hill numbers showed the highest species richness in the MEF, but the TVE hosted the most diverse species assemblages of Tephritidae. The diversity ranking exhibited the most diverse community of Tephritidae at 900 m asl. Overall, TVE showed the highest evenness in Tephritidae assemblages. Data on new occurrences of Tephritidae species are provided. This Neotropical limit may be considered as the most northern reservoir of the diversity of Tephritidae in the American continent. Moreover, practical implications of the analysis of such diversity in the context of pest management and conservation are discussed.

AB Three well-conserved Horsfieldia hainanensis Merr. populations were used to investigate their soil seed bank and seedling regeneration characteristics and their relationship to environmental factors. The results showed that the seed reserves were low in the H. hainanensis soil seed bank (16.93 similar to 24.74 seed/m(2)). The distribution pattern for the seeds and seedlings in the H. hainanensis populations was aggregated, and they were mainly found around 2-3 m from the mother plant. The seeds in the litter layer and the 5-10 cm soil layer showed no vigor, and only 25.7%similar to 33.3% of the total seeds in the 0-5 cm soil layer were viable affected by the high temperature and humidity, the animals' eating and poisoning. Affected by the height and coverage of the surrounding herbaceous layer and shrub layer, the seedlings of H. hainanensis could not obtain enough light and nutrients in the competition, resulting in the survival competitiveness of 1- to 3-year-old (1-3a) seedlings in the habitat had been in a weak position and a large number of seedlings died. It would take at least four years for seedlings to develop under the current environmental constraints. It can be concluded that the low seed reserve in the soil seed bank and high mortality of seedlings of H. hainanensis lead to slow or even stagnation of population regeneration, which was an important reason for the endangered of H. hainanensis. Therefore, the next research focus is to explore the influence mechanism of environmental factors on seed germination and seedling growth of H. hainanensis.

AB The high levels of diversity within tropical rainforest communities has been linked to non-random patterns of seedling mortality with several studies implicating pathogenic plant-microbe interactions in driving mortality processes. Despite the proposed importance of microorganisms in maintaining rainforest diversity, few studies have investigated soil community dynamics in relation to non-random mortality processes. A mechanistic understanding of microbial processes that help create rainforest diversity is critical for the conservation of these ecosystems. This study investigated microbial community dynamics that may underpin distance- and density-dependent mortality in the long-term forest dynamics plot, Davies Creek, in tropical Far North Queensland using community fingerprinting. We hypothesized that: (1) microbial involvement in distance-dependent seedling mortality would result in an increase in community similarity or the presence of predictor OTUs in conspecific adult tree rhizospheres, relative to physically nearby heterospecifics; (2) on average, plant species identified as having a history of distance dependent seedling mortality would exhibit more similar microbial communities among their conspecific individuals, than those that did not; and (3) dense patches of conspecific seedlings would promote the assembly of distinct soil microbial communities, which may be involved in density-dependent seedling mortality. We found no evidence of rhizosphere community similarity amongst adult plant rhizospheres. However, the presence of densely germinating seedlings altered the soil communities relative to seedling-sparse soils, enriching different OTUs depending on the patch location.

AB Interspecific dominance hierarchies have been widely reported across animal systems. High-ranking species are expected to monopolize more resources than low-ranking species via resource monopolization. In some ant species, dominance hierarchies have been used to explain species coexistence and community structure. However, it remains unclear whether or in what contexts dominance hierarchies occur in tropical ant communities. This study seeks to examine whether arboreal twig-nesting ants competing for nesting resources in a Mexican coffee agricultural ecosystem are arranged in a linear dominance hierarchy. We described the dominance relationships among 10 species of ants and measured the uncertainty and steepness of the inferred dominance hierarchy. We also assessed the orderliness of the hierarchy by considering species interactions at the network level. Based on the randomized Elo-rating method, we found that the twig-nesting ant species Myrmelachista mexicana ranked highest in the ranking, while Pseudomyrmex ejectus was ranked as the lowest in the hierarchy. Our results show that the hierarchy was intermediate in its steepness, suggesting that the probability of higher ranked species winning contests against lower ranked species was fairly high. Motif analysis and significant excess of triads further revealed that the species networks were largely transitive. This study highlights that some tropical arboreal ant communities organize into dominance hierarchies.

AB Approximately 20% of the Brazilian Amazon has now been deforested, and the Amazon is currently experiencing the highest rates of deforestation in a decade, leading to large-scale land-use changes. Roads have consistently been implicated as drivers of ongoing Amazon deforestation and may act as corridors to facilitate species invasions. Long-term data, however, are necessary to determine how ecological succession alters avian communities following deforestation and whether established roads lead to a constant influx of new species. We used data across nearly 40 years from a large-scale deforestation experiment in the central Amazon to examine the avian colonization process in a spatial and temporal framework, considering the role that roads may play in facilitating colonization. Since 1979, 139 species that are not part of the original forest avifauna have been recorded, including more secondary forest species than expected based on the regional species pool. Among the 35 species considered to have colonized and become established, a disproportionate number were secondary forest birds (63%), almost all of which first appeared during the 1980s. These new residents comprise about 13% of the current community of permanent residents. Widespread generalists associated with secondary forest colonized quickly following deforestation, with few new species added after the first decade, despite a stable road connection. Few species associated with riverine forest or specialized habitats colonized, despite road connection to their preferred source habitat. Colonizing species remained restricted to anthropogenic habitats and did not infiltrate old-growth forests nor displace forest birds. Deforestation and expansion of road networks into terra firme rainforest will continue to create degraded anthropogenic habitat. Even so, the initial pulse of colonization by nonprimary forest bird species was not the beginning of a protracted series of invasions in this study, and the process appears to be reversible by forest succession.

AB Despite the ubiquitous presence of fungal endophytes in woody plants, mechanisms underlying variation in foliar fungal endophyte communities are poorly understood. Given that endophytes in woody plants are predominantly horizontally transmitted, fungal endophyte colonization of foliar tissues is likely to be influenced by plant resistance traits. Here, we evaluated the association between leaf resistance traits and colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 10 dominant trees species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. Because resistance traits might restrict colonization of HTE, it was hypothesized that host trees with similar leaf resistance traits would show similar HTE communities. We measured leaf traits with reported roles in plant resistance against pathogens and/or herbivores: cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids and chitinases. We also determined variation in fungal read counts, number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity and community structure across tree species. Foliar fungal endophyte communities were characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of tagged amplicons of the ITS1 region. Fungal read counts were significantly different among host trees, while number of OTUs and diversity were similar among them. Multivariate analyses showed that community composition of endophytic fungi significantly differed among hosts, and that variation in cell wall, flavonoids, anthocyanins and terpenoids was associated with differences in HTE communities. We found that host trees sharing leaf resistance traits harbour similar HTE communities. Fungal read counts decreased with increasing content of cell wall polysaccharides, while endophyte diversity decreased with increasing anthocyanin levels. Fungal read counts, in contrast, were positively associated with terpenoids. Additionally, culture-based data indicated that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Synthesis. Overall, we found that leaf resistance traits may influence fungal endophyte colonization and community composition in tree species, likely through deterrent effects of structural and chemical traits. We suggest that endophytic fungi that overcome resistance traits might play a role in plant protection.

AB Aims It is widely accepted that deterministic and neutral dispersal processes are two of the principal mechanisms driving community assembly. However, the relative importance of these ecological drivers between distinct life stages both at community and individual species levels remains poorly understood in different vegetation types. Here, we address the following questions: (a) is there a ubiquitous process shaping tree assemblage; (b) how does the relative importance of environmental and dispersal processes vary through ontogeny in different vegetation types; and (c) will the spatial patterns of trees at community and individual species levels reflect similar contribution between ecological processes? Location Yunnan province, southwest China. Methods We used the Homogeneous Poisson, Homogeneous Thomas, Inhomogeneous Poisson, and Inhomogeneous Thomas point process models to predict the effect of stochastic, dispersal and/or environmental processes, respectively, on the distribution of trees across ontogeny in tropical, subtropical and subalpine forests. To evaluate the relative importance of models, we compared the observed and simulated patterns of the species-area relationship and the pair correlation function g(r) at community and species level, respectively. Results The Homogeneous Thomas model was the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) scores across ontogeny and forest types at community level. At the species level, however, Homogeneous Thomas, and Inhomogeneous Thomas predicted the distribution of large and small trees, respectively, with lower AIC values in two of our three plots. In the third plot, the Homogeneous Thomas model is dominant across ontogeny at the species level. Conclusions Tree communities are assembled mainly by the dispersal process at community level. The relative importance of ecological processes for species distribution varies across life stages at the species level, suggesting that there is an ontogenetic shift of ecological processes in shaping tree distribution. Using different summary statistics at both community and species levels helps to discern the different spatial structures of species and increases our appreciation of the processes underpinning community assembly.

AB We estimate the effects of Peru's oldest watershed payments for environmental services (PES) initiative in Moyobamba (Andes-Amazon transition zone) and disentangle the complex intervention into its two main forest conservation treatments. First, a state-managed protected area (PA) was established, allowing sustainable use but drastically limiting de facto land use and land rights of households in the upper watershed through command-andcontrol interventions. Second, a subset of those environmentally regulated households also received incentives: PES-like voluntary contracts with conditional in-kind rewards, combined with access to participation in sustainable income-generating activities of the integrated conservation and development project (ICDP) type. To evaluate impacts, we perform matching procedures and adjustment regressions to obtain the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of each intervention. We investigate impacts on plot-level forest cover and household welfare for the period 2010-2016. We find that both treatments-command-and-control restrictions and the incentive package-modestly but significantly mitigated primary forest loss. Incentive-induced conservation gains came at elevated per-hectare implementation costs. We also find positive effects on incentive-treated households' incomes and assets; however, their self-perceived wellbeing counterintuitively declined. We hypothesise that locally frustrated beneficiary expectations vis-a-vis the ambitiously designed PES-cum-ICDP intervention help explain this surprising finding. We finalise with some recommendations for watershed incentives and policy mix design in Moyobamba and beyond.

AB Models of natural processes necessarily sacrifice some realism for the sake of tractability. Detailed, parameter-rich models often provide accurate estimates of system behaviour but can be data-hungry and difficult to operationalize. Moreover, complexity increases the danger of 'over-fitting', which leads to poor performance when models are applied to novel conditions. This challenge is typically described in terms of a trade-off between bias and variance (i.e. low accuracy vs. low precision). In studies of ecological communities, this trade-off often leads to an argument about the level of detail needed to describe interactions among species. Here, we used data from a grassland biodiversity experiment containing nine locally abundant plant species (the Jena 'dominance experiment') to parameterize models representing six increasingly complex hypotheses about interactions. For each model, we calculated goodness-of-fit across different subsets of the data based on sown species richness levels, and tested how performance changed depending on whether or not the same data were used to parameterize and test the model (i.e. within vs. out-of-sample), and whether the range of diversity treatments being predicted fell inside or outside of the range used for parameterization. As expected, goodness-of-fit improved as a function of model complexity for all within-sample tests. In contrast, the best out-of-sample performance generally resulted from models of intermediate complexity (i.e. with only two interaction coefficients per species-an intraspecific effect and a single pooled interspecific effect), especially for predictions that fell outside the range of diversity treatments used for parameterization. In accordance with other studies, our results also demonstrate that commonly used selection methods based on AIC of models fitted to the full dataset correspond more closely to within-sample than out-of-sample performance. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that models which include only general intra and interspecific interaction coefficients can be sufficient for estimating species-level abundances across a wide range of contexts and may provide better out-of-sample performance than do more complex models. These findings serve as a reminder that simpler models may often provide a better trade-off between bias and variance in ecological systems, particularly when applying models beyond the conditions used to parameterize them.

AB Growing awareness of the role of enemies in plant community dynamics has led to ecologists exploring how plant-enemy interactions change in human-modified systems. Proximity to forest edges was found to weaken the role of two groups of plant enemies-insect herbivores and fungal pathogens-in increasing plant diversity during the seed-to-seedling transition. However, it is less clear whether edge effects similarly compromise the diversifying effects of fungi and insects on established seedlings. We examined this question in a human-modified wet tropical forest in the Western Ghats of southern India. Over an annual cycle of recruitment, in 730 seedling plots (1 x 1 m each) arrayed at distances 0-100 m from the forest edge across 15 locations in a 30 km(2) landscape, we suppressed the activity of fungal pathogens and insect herbivores by applying fungicide and insecticide to soil, seeds, and seedlings in a subset of plots. Suppressing fungi and insects reduced diversity mainly for seedling recruits and not for seedlings that had already established. However, pesticide effects were only apparent at 90-100 m from forest edges. Specifically, in the interior sites, fungi and insect activity increased recruit diversity, which helped maintain local seedling diversity even though diversity of established seedlings declined with annual mortality. By comparison, canopy openness affected neither the diversity of survivors from the initial seedling cohort nor total seedling diversity after an annual cycle of recruitment. Our results indicate that insects and fungi promote diversity more prominently during early seedling establishment rather than through impacts on post-establishment seedling survival. Thus, edge effects can weaken the diversifying effects of plant-insect and plant-fungal interactions during recruitment and thereby modify the seedling template available for the future tree community in human-modified forests.

AB The mortality rates of large trees are critical to determining carbon stocks in tropical forests, but the mechanisms of tropical tree mortality remain poorly understood. Lightning strikes thousands of tropical trees every day, but is commonly assumed to be a minor agent of tree mortality in most tropical forests. We use the first systematic quantification of lightning-caused mortality to show that lightning is a major cause of death for the largest trees in an old-growth lowland forest in Panama. A novel lightning strike location system together with field surveys of strike sites revealed that, on average, each strike directly kills 3.5 trees (> 10 cm diameter) and damages 11.4 more. Given lightning frequency data from the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network and historical total tree mortality rates for this site, we conclude that lightning accounts for 40.5% of the mortality of large trees (> 60 cm diameter) in the short term and probably contributes to an additional 9.0% of large tree deaths over the long term. Any changes in cloud-to-ground lightning frequency due to climatic change will alter tree mortality rates; projected 25-50% increases in lightning frequency would increase large tree mortality rates in this forest by 9-18%. The results of this study indicate that lightning plays a critical and previously underestimated role in tropical forest dynamics and carbon cycling.

AB Selective logging is one of the most widespread pattern of disturbance in tropical forests but has a much lower detrimental impact on forest structure than wildfires and conversion to farmland. Thus, logged tropical forest represents critical strongholds of global biodiversity. The ability of these forests to rapidly recover their baseline thermal environmental conditions will markedly influence their conservation value, particularly under global climate change. We investigated the impacts of commercial selective logging on the forest thermal environment in the Brazilian Amazon by relating canopy disturbance from logging to ambient understorey and ground surface temperatures. Specifically, we assessed the impact of selective logging on the forest thermal heterogeneity; how much post-harvest time is required for the thermal environment of logging gaps and logging roads return to unlogged primary forest levels; and the spatial availability of surface microclimates considering time of recovery since logging. Logging gaps following 1 year of recovery had a hotter understorey ambient than all other environments, especially during peak midday temperatures. Compared to the unlogged understorey, logging gaps after 3 years of recovery were only marginally warmer, and logging gaps after 5 years of recovery were slightly cooler. Older wide roads (5 years; 6 m) experienced very similar understorey thermal conditions than both narrow roads (3 m) after 1-5 years of recovery, and unlogged forest. Ground surface temperatures exhibited the largest discrepancies among all environments. The temperature range spanned by surface microclimates notably increased during peak midday heat in logging gaps following 1 year of recovery. Additionally, the proportion of cool area was smaller in younger logging gaps, but the average size of cool patches and their spatial aggregation was similar to that in unlogged forest. Although commercial selective logging can severely damage tropical forest structure, we found that the forest can fairly rapidly regain its thermal environment. Post-logging forest management should carefully focus on preventing fire incursions and illegal activities with special attention to those 3-5 years post-harvest. Thermal homeostasis in selectively logged tropical forests can be vital for long-term maintenance of global biodiversity under contemporary scenarios of climate change.

AB Simplification of landscapes due to the increase of monocultures negatively impacts biodiversity and its functions. In tropical landscapes that are dominated by sugarcane monocultures, some small natural vegetation patches still exist, yet little is known about their capacity to harbor functional biodiversity that may complement agroecological management of the crop. We compared ant and bird diversity in natural vegetation strips to diversity within sugarcane monocultures at increasing distances from the vegetation strips. We also compared functional groups of ants and birds in order to evaluate the role of vegetation strips in regulating pests of economic importance. During two seasons between 2015 and 2016, we studied 12 sites in the Cauca Valley, Colombia, with both natural vegetation strips and sugarcane monoculture and then sampled ants and birds in natural vegetation strips and at four distances towards the interior of the sugarcane matrix (up to 150m and 350m respectively). Species richness of ants and birds differed in vegetation strips and sugarcane matrix with decreases in richness as the distance from vegetation strips increased. Furthermore, predatory functional groups of ants and birds were less abundant in the sugarcane matrix, with important implications for key predation services on key sugarcane pests (e.g., Diatraea spp. - Lepidoptera: crambidae). Our results provide evidence that even in highly modified landscapes dominated by monocultures, the conservation of small patches of natural vegetation favors functional biodiversity. Therefore, maintaining and promoting and natural vegetation strips is especially important in highly industrialized monoculture landscapes in order to promote beneficial biodiversity for ecosystem services without sacrificing production area.

AB Conserving and restoring biodiversity are compelling challenges in the face of deforestation and fragmentation of tropical forests. Establishing restoration plantings that act as stepping-stone corridors for animals and develop into forest islets is one way we can reconnect forest fragments split by active agricultural landscapes. However, this strategy's success is contingent on dispersal agents attracted from the forests that vary greatly in their dispersal services, diet, and mobility. Dispersal agents capable of traversing the agricultural matrix that also provide high-quality and high-quantity seed dispersal are often a small subset of the present fauna. They also tend to be large-bodied birds with broad diets (e.g. toucans). This subset of dispersal agents (here termed "effective restoration agents") plays a key role in driving succession in restoration plantings. Their absence or low numbers can compromise the strategy of using plantings to enhance connectivity in landscapes fragmented by crops, orchards, or extensive pastures. In this event, additional intervention may be required to attract other dispersal agents that would otherwise not disperse seeds at or play a significant role in restoration plantings.

AB A successful invasion of novel habitat requires that non-native organisms overcome native abiotic and biotic resistance. Non-native species can overcome abiotic resistance if they arrive with traits well-suited for the invaded habitat or if they can rapidly acclimate or adapt. Non-native species may co-exist with native species if they require novel, underused resources or if they can out-compete similar native species. We investigated abiotic and biotic resistance to the progression of a Brachyponera chinensis invasion in the southeastern U.S. relative to the dominant native woodland ant (Aphaenogaster). We used observational data from long-term plots along the elevation gradient of the Southern Appalachian Mountain escarpment to investigate the patterns of B. chinensis invasion, and we used physiological thermal tolerance, aggression assays and stable isotope analysis to determine whether abiotic or biotic factors explained B. chinensis invasion. We found that B. chinensis exhibited an inflexible and relatively poor ability to tolerate cold temperatures, which corresponded with limited success at higher elevations in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Though we found native ant resistance to B. chinensis invasion, it paled in comparison to the invasive ant's ability to form huge, cooperating supercolonies that eventually eliminated the native ant. Without biotic resistance, susceptible native species may only be protected if they can tolerate abiotic conditions that the invasive species cannot. For Aphaenogaster species, high elevations and northern latitudes beyond B. chinensis' cold tolerance may be their only refuge.

AB Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle. High-resolution remote sensing techniques, e.g., spaceborne lidar, can measure complex tropical forest structures, but it remains a challenge how to interpret such information for the assessment of forest biomass and productivity. Here, we develop an approach to estimate basal area, aboveground biomass and productivity within Amazonia by matching 770,000 GLAS lidar (ICESat) profiles with forest simulations considering spatial heterogeneous environmental and ecological conditions. This allows for deriving frequency distributions of key forest attributes for the entire Amazon. This detailed interpretation of remote sensing data improves estimates of forest attributes by 20-43% as compared to (conventional) estimates using mean canopy height. The inclusion of forest modeling has a high potential to close a missing link between remote sensing measurements and the 3D structure of forests, and may thereby improve continent-wide estimates of biomass and productivity.

AB Understanding community assembly mechanisms is helpful to predict community dynamics. To explore which community assembly mechanism(s) drive(s) the grassland restoration in semi-arid region, we investigated the relationships between plant trait and species relative abundance (SRA), and estimated community functional diversity indices for each community under different treatments (enclosure, grazing and mowing treatment) in a restoration region of Stipa grandis - Leymus chinensis communities in the northern China from 2010 to 2012. There was a high fraction of significant relationships between trait value and SRA, suggesting that niche theory structured the grassland restoration in this region. The functional richness was higher and the functional divergence was lower in the enclosure community than that in the grazing or mowing community, and significantly positive plant height - SRA relationship was found in the enclosure community. These findings demonstrated that limiting similarity based on niche theory was more important in structuring the enclosure community and that environmental filtering based on niche theory played a more important role in driving the grazing or mowing community. Only the factor of year significantly affected the functional evenness (FEve), and the lowest FEve in 2011 implied that the relatively lower precipitation could enhance the effect of limiting similarity on community assembly in the semi-arid grassland.

AB Among the local processes that determine species diversity in ecological communities, fluctuation-dependent mechanisms that are mediated by temporal variability in the abundances of species populations have received significant attention. Higher temporal variability in the abundances of species populations can increase the strength of temporal niche partitioning but can also increase the risk of species extinctions, such that the net effect on species coexistence is not clear. We quantified this temporal population variability for tree species in 21 large forest plots and found much greater variability for higher latitude plots with fewer tree species. A fitted mechanistic model showed that among the forest plots, the net effect of temporal population variability on tree species coexistence was usually negative, but sometimes positive or negligible. Therefore, our results suggest that temporal variability in the abundances of species populations has no clear negative or positive contribution to the latitudinal gradient in tree species richness.

AB Aim Plant community assembly in tropical rain forest has been shown to be largely governed by stochastic processes, but as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi display limited host preference, they may not follow the same stochastic assembly pattern. Here, we determined the relative importance of environmental and spatial drivers responsible for the community assembly process of AM fungi in two types of tropical rain forest: semideciduous rain forest and dense ombrophilous forests. Location Atlantic rain forest in north-eastern Brazil, South America. Taxon Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycotina). Methods We collected root samples from eight protected areas of Atlantic forest along a 700 km transect in north-eastern Brazil. We measured the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes by redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning in comparison with null expectations using ad hoc generated neutral communities. Furthermore, we accessed species associations from co-occurrence data, at different scales using a Bayesian approach of Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities. Results Overall, the extent to which stochastic and deterministic processes affected community assembly depended on the forest type and the spatial scale. Specifically, we found that abiotic and biotic predictors of AM fungal community assemblages are related to environmental homogeneity in tropical rain forests. Main conclusions The results of the study show that dynamics in community assembly was clearly different between the two forest types, and that the difference most likely is due to differences in responses to environmental variables.

AB Context Theory predicts that species diversity of isolated habitat patches depends on patch size and isolation. However, there are few previous studies of how patch size and isolation influence community composition. This study tested theory using small and isolated farmland patches in a forested matrix. Objectives I tested whether bird species diversity and community composition of isolated farmland patches depended on patch size, measures of isolation (e.g. distance from the main farmland areas; up to 15 km), and other variables such as presence of human habitation. Methods Farmland bird species diversity and community composition (relative proportions of different ecological guilds) of 130 farmland patches within forest landscapes were recorded in Norway. Results Species diversity and proportion of the species that nested on the ground or low in bushes increased with patch size. Distance from the main farmland region was not related to species diversity or community composition, but species diversity increased when there were stepping stones present. Sites inhabited by humans had higher species diversity, a larger proportion of species nesting high in trees or in cavities (such as in buildings), and a larger proportion of resident species. Other variables were less important. There was also a strong relationship between the occupancy of individual species in the main farmland region and their occupancy in the forest region, suggesting that colonisation pressure also influenced species diversity of these habitat islands. Conclusions I found weak evidence of isolation effects on bird species diversity and community composition of farmland patches within forest, whereas most of the variation was explained by patch size and presence of humans.

AB Urbanization is altering community structure and functioning in marine ecosystems, but knowledge about the mechanisms driving loss of species diversity is still limited. Here, we examine rock thermal patterns in artificial breakwaters and test whether they have higher and spatially less variable rock temperature than natural adjacent habitats, which corresponds with lower biodiversity patterns. We estimated rock temperatures at mid-high intertidal using infrared thermography during mid-day in summer, in both artificial (Rip-raps) and natural (boulder fields) habitats. We also conducted diurnal thermal surveys (every 4 hr) in four seasons at one study site. Concurrent sampling of air and seawater temperature, wind velocity, and topographic structure of habitats were considered to explore their influence on rock temperature. Rock temperature was in average 3.7 degrees C higher in the artificial breakwater in two of the three study sites, while air temperature was about 1.5-4 degrees C higher at this habitat at summer. Thermal patterns were more homogeneous across the artificial habitat. Lower species abundance and richness in the artificial breakwaters were associated with higher rock temperature. Mechanism underlying enhanced substrate temperature in the artificial structures seems related to their lower small-scale spatial heterogeneity. Our study thus highlighted that higher rock temperature in artificial breakwaters can contribute to loss of biodiversity and that integrated artificial structures may alter coastal urban microclimates, a matter that should be considered in the spatial planning of urban coastal ecosystems.

AB Urbanization alters species richness and composition, but studies of urbanization effects on ecological functions have often quantified variation in functional traits and changes in functional diversity rather than measuring directly how ecological functions vary between rural and urban assemblages. Consuming dead animal matter and recycling its nutrients stabilizes and structures food webs and therefore represents a key component of ecosystem functioning. Introduction of free-ranging domestic pet animals adds additional scavenger species to urban habitats, and increased predictability of carcass resources produced by human activities characterizes urban habitats. Here, we investigate the effect of urbanization on the composition of diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages and on the ecological function of carcass removal by using a carcass placement experiment in Swiss urban and adjacent rural habitats. While diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages changed considerably from rural to urban areas by comprising particularly more domestic cats in the latter, carrion consumption rate did not differ between the two habitats. Predictability of carcass occurrence increased carrion consumption rate in both urban and rural habitats but mainly native scavengers and not introduced domestic pets responded to the repeated placements. These results suggest that urbanization shapes scavenger assemblage compositions without affecting their ecological function. The mechanism is likely due to a behavioural change of native scavengers in response to the occurrence of domestic pets resulting in functional plasticity of urban scavenger assemblages. The functional plasticity might be facilitated by the increased carcass predictability and additional anthropogenic food resources in urban habitats exploited by nutritionally flexible native scavenger species.

AB Rhinoptera steindachneri is a commercially important, medium-sized, pelagic migratory batoid fish with benthic feeding habits. It has been considered a specialized predator that feeds on molluscs as well as benthic ophiurids and arthropods off the Mexican Pacific coast. Most biological aspects of this species in La Paz Bay are unknown, despite its being a commercially important species of conservation interest. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the feeding habits of R. steindachneri based on specimens caught in artisanal fisheries. The stomach contents of 310 specimens (146 females and 164 males) were analysed, all captured from 2013 to 2015. The vacuity index was 97.1%, and the most important prey species were Mysidium spp. and Cylichna spp. Because of the high frequency of empty stomachs recorded, it was not possible to describe with precision the general diet of the species. Three hypotheses were developed to try to explain why this characteristic occurred in this species, ranging from eating habits to physiology and prey digestion and geographic location of the study. However, considering the mechanical process of prey handling of R. steindachneri, several hypotheses were formulated, with the hour of capture, chemical processes and physiology and prey digestion being the most probable to explain this high vacuity index reported in this study.

AB Virus host shifts occur frequently, but the whole range of host species and the actual transmission pathways are often poorly understood. Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus described from honeybees (Apis mellifera), has been shown to have a broad host range. Since ants are often scavenging on dead honeybees, foodborne transmission of these viruses may occur. However, the role of the ant Myrmica rubra as an alternative host is not known and foodborne transmission to ants has not been experimentally addressed yet. Here, we show with a 16-week feeding experiment that foodborne transmission enables DWV type-A and -B to infect M. rubra and that these ants may serve as a virus reservoir. However, the titers of both plus- and minus-sense viral RNA strands decreased over time. Since the ants were fed with highly virus-saturated honeybee pupae, this probably resulted in initial viral peaks, then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected individuals later. Since DWV infections were also found in untreated field-collected M. rubra colonies, our results support the wide host range of DWV and further suggest foodborne transmission as a so far underestimated spread mechanism.

AB Background: Hantavirus disease in humans is rare but frequently lethal in the Neotropics. Several abundant and widely distributed Sigmodontinae rodents are the primary hosts of Orthohantavirus and, in combination with other factors, these rodents can shape hantavirus disease. Here, we assessed the influence of host diversity, climate, social vulnerability and land use change on the risk of hantavirus disease in Brazil over 24 years. Methods: Landscape variables (native forest, forestry, sugarcane, maize and pasture), climate (temperature and precipitation), and host biodiversity (derived through niche models) were used in spatiotemporal models, using the 5570 Brazilian municipalities as units of analysis. Results: Amounts of native forest and sugarcane, combined with temperature, were the most important factors influencing the increase of disease risk. Population at risk (rural workers) and rodent host diversity also had a positive effect on disease risk. Conclusions: Land use change-especially the conversion of native areas to sugarcane fields-can have a significant impact on hantavirus disease risk, likely by promoting the interaction between the people and the infected rodents. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the interactions between landscape change, rodent diversity, and hantavirus disease incidence, and suggest that land use policy should consider disease risk. Meanwhile, our risk map can be used to help allocate preventive measures to avoid disease.

AB The ideas that larger fragments have greater species richness and abundance, when compared to smaller fragments and altered environments, and that assemblage composition is different, was tested in an agricultural mosaic using data on small mammals. To achieve this, we sampled ten forest fragments of different sizes, small and large, as well as five areas in a sugarcane matrix, through the capture-mark-recapture method. The study was conducted in a sugarcane plantation (Usina Sao Jose, Igarassu, Pernambuco, Brazil) from January to October 2016. There was a significant difference when comparing richness between small fragments (eight species) and the sugarcane matrix (four species). Abundance differed significantly between all areas, being influenced by fragment size and habitat type. We found that abundance was positively influenced by forested environments and, among them, larger fragments. The composition of assemblages in the forest fragments and the sugarcane matrix differed clearly for NMDS, MANOVA and SIMPER analyses. Between the habitats, assemblage parameters were also distinct. Lower abundance and richness were found in the sugarcane matrix, where the presence of rodents was associated with food availability and less competition; and higher abundance and richness was measured in forest fragments, where there was a strong association between marsupials and forest strata. The landscape configuration in an agricultural mosaic can compromise the level of interspecific interactions of small mammals, which negatively impacts the ecological processes of forested areas. In this case, the conservation of a matrix permeable to most species and the preservation of all fragments are necessary, since small and large fragments have different functions in the maintenance of species.

AB Land governance highly affects rural communities' well-being in landscapes where land and its access are contested. This includes sites with high land pressures from development, but also from conservation interventions. In fact, local people's motivations for sustainably managing their resources is highly tied to their perceptions of security, trust and participation in land management regimes. Understanding these perceptions is essential to ensure the internal legitimacy and sustainability of conservation interventions, especially in areas where development changes are fast paced. This paper presents an analysis of household perceptions of land issues in 20 villages across different conservation and development contexts in Northern Cambodia. We assess whether conservation and development interventions, as economic land concessions, influence perceptions of land issues in control and treatment sites by modelling five key perception indicators. We find that household characteristics rather than village contexts are the main factors influencing the perceptions of land issues. Interventions also affect perceptions, especially with regards to the negative effect of development pressures and population growth. While large-scale protected areas do not calm insecurity about land issues, some village-based payment for environmental services projects do. Ultimately, evidence from perception studies can help address current concerns and shape future conservation activities sustainably.

AB Targeted livestock grazing is a proven tool for manipulating rangeland vegetation, and current knowledge about targeted livestock grazing is extensive and expanding rapidly. Targeted grazing prescriptions optimize the timing, frequency, intensity, and selectivity of grazing (or browsing) in combinations that purposely exert grazing/browsing pressure on specific plant species or portions of the landscape. Targeted grazing differs from traditional grazing management in that the goal of targeted grazing is to apply defoliation or trampling to achieve specific vegetation management objectives, whereas the goal of traditional livestock grazing management is generally the production of livestock commodities. A shared aim of targeted livestock grazing and traditional grazing management is to sustain healthy soils, flora, fauna, and water resources that, in turn, can sustain natural ecological processes (e.g., nutrient cycle, water cycle, energy flow). Targeted grazing prescriptions integrate knowledge of plant ecology, livestock nutrition, and livestock foraging behavior. Livestock can be focused on target areas through fencing, herding, or supplement placement. Although practices can be developed to minimize the impact of toxins contained in target plants, the welfare of the animals used in targeted grazing must be a priority. Monitoring is needed to determine if targeted grazing is successful and to refine techniques to improve efficacy and efficiency. Examples of previous research studies and approaches are presented to highlight the ecological benefits that can be achieved when targeted grazing is applied properly. These cases include ways to suppress invasive plants and ways to enhance wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Future research should address the potential to select more adapted and effective livestock for targeted grazing and the associated animal welfare concerns with this practice. Targeted livestock grazing provides land managers a viable alternative to mechanical, chemical, and prescribed fire treatments to manipulate rangeland vegetation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Scholars and policymakers have argued that insurance can shape behavior in ways that mitigate climate risks, such as by providing financial incentives to property owners to safeguard their property from increasingly intense hurricanes or from the risk of sea-level rise. But natural ecosystems like coral reefs, mangroves, and forest ecosystems can themselves protect property from these increased climate risks. This Article turns the climate governance literature on its head, examining the circumstances under which it is possible to insure nature itself in order to preserve these critical ecosystem services in the face of a changing climate.

AB The consequences of forest fragmentation and edge effects on soil nutrient availability and nutrition of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) forests remain understudied. We assessed soil chemistry (bulk pH, total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), extractable phosphorus (P), exchangeable cations, and mineralizable N) and foliar nutrition (N, P, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg)) of mature sugar maple forests along an edge-interior gradient (10, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 120 m from the forest edges) in seven sugar maple forest stands (three on sandstone and four on dolomite bedrock) that are embedded within an agricultural landscape in southern Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that foliar nutritional imbalances of sugar maple forests would decline along this gradient. Foliar nutrition was analyzed using the diagnosis and recommendation integrated system (DRIS) and the compositional nutrient diagnosis with isometric log-ratio (CND-ilr) method. At the sandstone sites, rates of N mineralization and nitrification increased with increasing distance from the forest edge. Other soil chemical properties and all sugar maple foliar indices of nutritional diagnostics varied weakly along the edge-interior gradient. Assessment of sugar maple forest nutritional status through different nutritional indices revealed K and P deficiencies in all stands that were sampled and at all distances from the forest edge. Overall, we found weak forest-edge effects on soil chemical properties and sugar maple forest nutritional status.

AB Phorid flies (Diptera: Phoridae, Metopinini) are natural enemies of leafcutter ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae, Attini), which are among the most important pests in the Neotropical region. These parasitoids lay their eggs inside worker ants, causing the death of the parasitized ants, and the oviposition attacks on foraging workers interfere with the collection of vegetal material used in fungal gardens, thereby affecting the whole colony. However, because of the large number of ants per colony, more than one type of biological control agent is needed to have a significant impact. We collected parasitized leafcutter ants Acromyrmex lundii (Guerin-Meneville), Acromyrmex heyeri (Forel), and Acromyrmex ambiguus (Emery) from various places in Argentina and reared their parasitoids. We recorded developmental times, host and phorid sizes, and other aspects of the biology of the phorids Apocephalus neivai Borgmeier, Apocephalus noetingerorum Brown & Disney, Myrmosicarius gracilipes Borgmeier, Myrmosicarius catharinensis Borgmeier, Myrmosicarius crudelis Borgmeier, and Myrmosicarius cristobalensis Disney et al. This is the first record of A. ambiguus, an important pest of pine plantations, being a host of phorids. We found the first cases of gregarious parasitoidism of a parasitoid with no-free pupae: M. catharinensis on A. lundii ants. We also evaluated the effect on pupal survival of two cosmopolitan fungi, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuill. and Trichoderma lentiforme (Rehm) Chaverri et al., which are also considered as potential biological control agents of leafcutter ants. Suspensions of conidia were tested on Myrmosicarius and Apocephalus parasitoid pupae of different ages. No negative effect on pupal survival was found under either fungal treatment. Therefore, the use of both natural enemies separately but simultaneously, or the introduction of fungi-inoculated pupae in the pest habitats, seems to be a promising strategy for the multiple biological control of leafcutter ants.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation result in significant landscape changes that ultimately affect plant diversity and add uncertainty to how natural areas will respond to future global change. This uncertainty is important given that the loss of biodiversity often includes losing key ecosystem functions. Few studies have explored the effects of landscape changes on plant functional diversity and evidence so far has shown far more pervasive effects than previously reported by species richness and composition studies. Here we present a review on the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on (1) individual functional traits-related to persistence, dispersal and establishment-and (2) functional diversity. We also discuss current knowledge gaps and propose ways forward. From the literature review we found that studies have largely focused on dispersal traits, strongly impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, while traits related to persistence were the least studied. Furthermore, most studies did not distinguish habitat loss from spatial fragmentation and were conducted at the plot or fragment-level, which taken together limits the ability to generalize the scale-dependency of landscape changes on plant functional diversity. For future work, we recommend (1) clearly distinguishing the effects of habitat loss from those of fragmentation, and (2) recognizing the scale-dependency of predicted responses when functional diversity varies in time and space. We conclude that a clear understanding of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on functional diversity will improve predictions of the resiliency and resistance of plant communities to varying scales of disturbance.

AB Questions The growth-survival trade-off is a central concept for the conflicting strategies of acquisitive species that grow quicker and conservative species that grow slower. Understanding which, and how, cross-species functional traits contribute to the growth-survival trade-off is a key topic for understanding the functioning of tropical forests. The present study aimed to: (a) determine if leaf traits, wood density and fruit size influence the growth-survival trade-off at the community level; and (b) test the hypothesis that averaged leaf traits, averaged wood density and averaged fruit size among all trees of subplots explain tree height in a 50-ha plot of secondary Atlantic Forest in Brazil. Methods All trees with DBH > 3 cm had their heights estimated and were taxonomically identified. The functional traits used were leaf length (LL), leaf width (LW), petiole length (PL), petiole width (PW), leaf width/petiole width (LW/PW), leaf length x leaf width (LL*LW), wood density (WD), fruit length (FL) and fruit width (FW). Results A total of 74,335 trees of 178 species were recorded in 5,076 subplots of 100 m(2). Associations between functional traits and mean height (H-mean) and height mode (H-mode) were congruent with expected trends of LW, LL, LW/PW, WD and FW with the top-ranked global model explaining most of the found variance suggesting that H-mean and H-mode are the best averaged response variables. The growth response represented by H-mean and H-mode had the most distinctive, congruent and consistent association with LW/PW, WD and FW. Conclusions Higher LW and higher LW/PW indicated higher dependence of leaf blade on local microclimatic conditions, and lower dependence on petiole support for plant growth, which is beneficial for the acquisitive strategy. Smaller fruits and higher WD were also associated with the acquisitive strategy. Therefore, LW, LW/PW, WD and FW influenced the growth-survival trade-off at the community level and explained tree height variation in the studied tropical forest.

AB Seed bank, seed dispersal and historical disturbance are critical factors affecting plant population persistence. However, because of difficulties collecting data on these factors they are often ignored. We evaluated the roles of seed bank, seed dispersal and historical disturbance on metapopulation persistence of Hypericum cumulicola, a Florida endemic. We took advantage of long-term demographic data of multiple populations (22 years; ~11 K individuals; 15 populations) and a wealth of information on burn history (1962-present), and habitat attributes (patch specific location, elevation, area and aggregation) of a system of 92 patches of Florida rosemary scrub. We used previously developed integral projection models to assess the relative ability of simulations with different levels of seed dormancy for recently produced and older seeds and different dispersal kernels (including no dispersal) to predict regional observed occupancy and plant abundance in patches in 2016-2018. We compared a simulation with this model using historical burn history to 500 model simulations with the same average fire regime (using a Weibull distribution to determine the probability of ignition) but with random ignition years. The most likely model had limited dispersal (mean = 0.5 m) and the highest dormancy (field estimates x 1.2 %) and its predictions were associated with observed occurrences (67% correct) and densities (20% of variance explained). Historical burn synchrony among neighbouring patches (skewness in the number of patches burned by year = 1.79) probably explains the higher densities predicted by the simulation with the historical fire regime compared with predicted abundances after simulations using random ignition years (skewness = 0.20 + SE = 0.01).Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of seed dormancy, dispersal and fire history on population dynamics, distribution and abundance. Because of the prevalence of metapopulation dynamics, we should be aware of the significance of changes in the availability and configuration of suitable habitat associated with human or non-human landscape changes. Decisions on prescribed fires (or other disturbances) will benefit from our knowledge of consequences of fire frequency, but also of location of ignition and the probability of fire spread.

AB The majority of global forests are secondary and are at different stages of succession. Assessing the dynamics of species richness and similarity, and quantifying the importance of environmental filtering, dispersal limitation and other stochastic processes are essential to understanding the mechanisms of succession for forest restoration. In this article, we explored the accumulation of species, the relative importance of spatial distance, environmental factors and stand age in determining species composition of a tropical secondary forest succession in Hong Kong. Twenty-eight plots with median age of 7, 20, 39, 61 and over 70 years in the secondary forest were established and surveyed, and the indicator species for each age class were identified. Species composition shows large variation both within and between age classes, while species richness in the old growth forest (> 70 yr) was significantly lower than in the mid-age classes. Rarefied species richness showed a rapid accumulation during early succession, but species richness levelled off from 20 yrs onwards. Variation partitioning indicated that spatial distance alone explained 33% of the variation in species composition, followed by environmental distance (8%) and stand age (1%). The results of Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling suggested that idiosyncratic successional pathways and alternative stable states might be prevalent. Our results suggested dispersal limitation was the main limiting factor in explaining the turnover of species during forest succession, while environmental filtering played a lesser role in shaping species distributions. Our results highlight the importance of active restoration in overcoming the barriers of succession in secondary vegetation in the tropics.

AB Ants, as indicators of ecological changes, are widely used in land management and environmental monitoring. At the same time, effects of industrial pollution are less known compared to many other stressors. We studied variations in habitat variables and ant diversity near the Karabash copper smelter (KCS) in Russia, in 2009 and 2014. Pitfall traps were set up at 10 birch forest sites (3 plots per site and 5 traps per plot) located to the north and south of the smelter within a 1-32-km range, with two samplings per season (June and August). The tree height, stand basal area, species richness of the field and moss layers, and the cover of the field layer decreased towards the smelter. The vegetation almost disappeared at the industrial barren close to KCS. In total, 21 ant species of 7 genera were registered. The highest species richness, diversity, and total occurrence of ants were observed in the transitional zone between moderately polluted forest habitats and industrial barren. Ant diversity and occurrence showed the same pattern in different years. Our results conform to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis predicting the greatest diversity at intermediate frequencies or intensities of disturbance or environmental change. Apparently, contaminant exposure affects ant communities near KCS indirectly, through habitat transformation.
   The study emphasizes the need for thorough planning of field studies of pollution effects on ants with examination of the full range of exposures. In addition, the nonlinear pattern of diversity and abundance of the ant community along the pollution gradients suggests caution, when assessing the magnitude of human impact and the state of ecosystems with ants as bioindicators.

AB Stream nutrient uptake is an important ecosystem service, because it supplies human needs such as water purification. Uncertainty in nutrient uptake measurement determines, in combination with effect magnitude, whether effects of land use, stream restoration or climate change can be detected by this method. However, measurement uncertainty for nutrient uptake metrics is rarely reported. Here, we compared whole-stream phosphate and nitrate uptake among three pristine and three agricultural tropical Cerrado streams. We quantified uncertainty in uptake metrics estimated by kinetic nutrient-addition experiments and evaluated their potential to detect land-use effects. Ambient phosphate and nitrate uptake lengths (S-w) ranged from 11 to 106 m and from 29 to 357 m, respectively, in pristine streams and from 41 to 586 m and from 76 to 1372 m in agricultural streams. Moderate measurement uncertainty in S-W allowed for the detection of land-use impacts with this metric. However, derived nutrient uptake metrics, such as ambient uptake rates and uptake velocities, as well as parameters of whole-stream saturation kinetics, were associated with high measurement uncertainties that prevented the detection of potential land-use effects. Sensitivity analyses suggested that avoiding high enrichment levels in kinetic addition experiments and increasing sampling effort for plateau nutrient and tracer concentration at the first and last sampling stations of investigated stream reaches are the most promising strategies to reduce measurement uncertainty. Analyzing nutrient uptake without considering measurement uncertainty might lead to poor interpretation in case studies and meta-analyses, such as incorrect evaluations of human impacts or comparisons among systems.

AB The role of soil fertility in modulating plant water utilization from rainfall pulses under dryland conditions is poorly understood. Moreover, the effectiveness of soil fertilization in drylands is difficult to ensure due to immobilization of nutrients such as phosphorus and micronutrients. The use of foliar fertilization could overcome these difficulties, but its effectiveness has not been evaluated in wild dryland plants so far. In this study, we assessed the responses to foliar P, Fe, Mn and Zn fertilization before a rainfall event in two Mediterranean species with contrasting strategies to cope with drought/light stress, namely, Stipa tenacissima (poikilochlorophyllous) and Rosmarinus officinalis (photoprotective). We hypothesized that foliar fertilization can mitigate soil nutritional constraints and trigger physiological improvements enabling a more efficient use of water pulses. In nonfertilized plants, the rainfall event triggered increases in chlorophyll content, epoxidation of xanthophyll cycle pigments and PSII efficiency, indicating stress alleviation and photosynthesis improvement, but also induced decreases in foliar concentrations of several elements. Foliar fertilization increased the concentrations of sprayed nutrients in the leaves of both species. In R. officinalis, P and Zn fertilization also increased carotenoid concentrations, PSII photochemical efficiency and photosynthesis rates, and changed delta O-18 isotope ratios. While in S. tenacissima, Fe and Mn fertilization increased photosynthetic pigment concentrations without affecting PSII efficiency. The results obtained show that foliar fertilization can mitigate soil nutritional constraints affecting dryland vegetation, thereby promoting species-specific physiological responses to cope with water and/or light stress and ultimately leading to a more efficient use of rainfall pulses.

AB Among the Brazilian marsupials, the species of the genus Didelphis are the most parasitized by helminths. This study aimed to describe the species composition and to analyse the helminth communities of the Atlantic Forest common opossum Didelphis aurita at infracommunity and component community levels using the Elements of Metacommunity Structure Analysis, considering peri-urban, sylvatic and rural environments in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Seventy-three specimens of D. aurita were captured during the study. Fourteen species of helminths were collected: nine of the phylum Nematoda (Trichuris minuta, Trichuris didelphis, Globocephalus marsupialis, Heterostrongylus heterostrongylus, Travassostrongylus orloffi, Viannaia hamata, Aspidodera raillieti, Cruzia tentaculata and Turgida turgida); four of the phylum Platyhelminthes (three species of Trematoda, Duboisiella proloba, Brachylaima advena and Rhopalias coronatus, and one species of the class Cestoda); and one species of the phylum Acanthocephala (Oligacanthorhynchus microcephalus). More than 95% of the animals were infected with parasites. The most abundant parasite species were V. hamata, T. turgida, C. tentaculata and T. orloffi. The nematodes T. turgida, C. tentaculata and A. raillieti were the most dominant species in the three environments. The analysis of the metacommunity structure indicated a structured pattern as a function of the environmental gradient, but only when all localities were considered together. At the infracommunity and component community levels, quasi-nested and nested structures with stochastic species loss were observed, respectively. The results indicate that the settlement of helminth species in the opossums can be attributed to the heterogeneity among individual hosts in relation to their exposure to parasites and to extrinsic factors, which vary among habitats, considering a regional scale. On a local scale, the characteristics of this host species may promote homogenization among individual hosts in terms of their exposure to the helminths. This study constitutes a new host record for the species G. marsupialis and T. didelphis and represents a pioneering investigation of the helminth metacommunity of a Neotropical marsupial.

AB Palms are an important component of Neotropical communities as they are often diverse and abundant. In some areas, palms occur in high density and act as limiting factor in tree recruitment by limiting tree seedling and sapling abundance. In this study, I evaluated the intensity of seed mortality caused by insects in Attalea geraensis, in a large area of preserved Cerrado (Serra do Cabral, MG, Brazil) during wet season when both A. geraensis fruits and bruchid beetles were abundant. I collected a total of 63 infructescences which had from 3 fruits and 7 seeds to 82 fruits and 251 seeds. Endocarps had from 1 to 6 seeds. Seed mortality per infructescence due to beetles (Pachymerus cardo) was intense, and increases positively and disproportionally according to seed number per infructescence. Besides that, average proportions of seeds preyed upon by insects were consistently high (> 0.83), irrespective of seed number per endocarp. Positive density-dependent seed mortality caused by specialized natural enemies has been assumed to promote species rarity, an important feature of species coexistence in Neotropical forests. Then, the intense seed mortality documented in this study suggests that seed predators may contribute to the richness and diversity of plant species in the Cerrado, the richest and most endangered savanna in the world.

AB Microbial communities play essential and preponderant roles in all ecosystems. Understanding the rules that govern microbial community assembly will have a major impact on our ability to manage microbial ecosystems, positively impacting, for instance, human health and agriculture. Here, I present a phylogenetically constrained community assembly principle grounded on the well-supported facts that deterministic processes have a significant impact on microbial community assembly, that microbial communities show significant phylogenetic signal, and that microbial traits and ecological coherence are, to some extent, phylogenetically conserved. From these facts, I derive a few predictions which form the basis of the framework. Chief among them is the existence, within most microbial ecosystems, of phylogenetic core groups (PCGs), defined as discrete portions of the phylogeny of varying depth present in all instances of the given ecosystem, and related to specific niches whose occupancy requires a specific phylogenetically conserved set of traits. The predictions are supported by the recent literature, as well as by dedicated analyses. Integrating the effect of ecosystem patchiness, microbial social interactions, and scale sampling pitfalls takes us to a comprehensive community assembly model that recapitulates the characteristics most commonly observed in microbial communities. PCGs' identification is relatively straightforward using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing, and subsequent bioinformatic analysis of their phylogeny, estimated core pan-genome, and intra-group co-occurrence should provide valuable information on their ecophysiology and niche characteristics. Such a priori information for a significant portion of the community could be used to prime complementing analyses, boosting their usefulness. Thus, the use of the proposed framework could represent a leap forward in our understanding of microbial community assembly and function.

AB Agricultural and extractive frontiers experiment rapid landscape transformation. Land-Use Sciences and Political Ecology are complementary approaches for analysing how landscape transformations are related to biophysical conditions, and socioeconomic, cultural and political processes developed at global, national and local scales. This study examines such relationships in a long-standing agrarian and resource frontier in southern Mexico for the 1986-2015 period. We combine insights from: (1) a quantitative land use/land cover change pattern-based model, involving a weights of evidence and cellular automata simulations, and (2) a qualitative content analysis of literature and of local actors' perspectives. Two grand frontier processes have developed in this region: NAFTA-related agrarian transition toward intensification and the establishment of wind farms. Both were triggered by global forces and new forms of land and resources use, but mediated by national-to-local ecological, socioeconomic and political processes, producing particular landscape transformations.

AB Biofilm heterogeneity has been characterized on various scales for both natural and engineered ecosystems. This heterogeneity has been attributed to spatial differences in environmental factors. Understanding their impact on localized biofilm heterogeneity in building plumbing systems is important for both management and representative sampling strategies. We assessed heterogeneity within the confined engineered ecosystem of a shower hose by high-resolution sampling (200 individual biofilm sections per hose) on varying scales (mm to m). We postulated that a biofilm grown on a single material under uniform conditions should be homogeneous in its structure, bacterial numbers, and community composition. A biofilm grown for 12 months under controlled laboratory conditions, showed homogeneity on large-scale. However, some small-scale heterogeneity was clearly observed. For example, biofilm thickness of cm-sections varied up to 4-fold, total cell concentrations (TCC) 3-fold, and relative abundance of dominant taxa up to 5-fold. A biofilm grown under real (i.e., uncontrolled) use conditions developed considerably more heterogeneity in all variables which was attributed to more discontinuity in environmental conditions. Interestingly, biofilm communities from both hoses showed comparably low diversity, with <400 taxa each, and only three taxa accounting for 57%, respectively, 73% of the community. This low diversity was attributed to a strong selective pressure, originating in migrating carbon from the flexible hoses as major carbon source. High-resolution sampling strategy enabled detailed analysis of spatial heterogeneity within an individual drinking water biofilm. This study gives insight into biofilm structure and community composition on cm-to m-scale and is useful for decision-making on sampling strategies in biofilm research and monitoring.

AB Deforestation and land use change are among the most pressing anthropogenic environmental impacts. In Brazil, a resurgence of malaria in recent decades paralleled rapid deforestation and settlement in the Amazon basin, yet evidence of a deforestation-driven increase in malaria remains equivocal. We hypothesize an underlying cause of this ambiguity is that deforestation and malaria influence each other in bidirectional causal relationships-deforestation increases malaria through ecological mechanisms and malaria reduces deforestation through socioeconomic mechanisms-and that the strength of these relationships depends on the stage of land use transformation. We test these hypotheses with a large geospatial dataset encompassing 795 municipalities across 13 y (2003 to 2015) and show deforestation has a strong positive effect on malaria incidence. Our results suggest a 10% increase in deforestation leads to a 3.3% increase in malaria incidence (similar to 9,980 additional cases associated with 1,567 additional km(2) lost in 2008, the study midpoint, Amazon-wide). The effect is larger in the interior and absent in outer Amazonian states where little forest remains. However, this strong effect is only detectable after controlling for a feedback of malaria burden on forest loss, whereby increased malaria burden significantly reduces forest clearing, possibly mediated by human behavior or economic development. We estimate a 1% increase in malaria incidence results in a 1.4% decrease in forest area cleared (similar to 219 fewer km(2) cleared associated with 3,024 additional cases in 2008). This bidirectional socioecological feedback between deforestation and malaria, which attenuates as land use intensifies, illustrates the intimate ties between environmental change and human health.

AB Aims Photodegradation of senescent plant material has been identified as an important vector of aboveground carbon (C) loss in aridland ecosystems, but the consequences for biotic activity and soil C in the field are not well understood. Methods We established an experiment in a semiarid woodland in Patagonia, Argentina with attenuation of solar radiation and additions of leaf litter to evaluate impacts of photodegradation on changes in labile C and biotic activity in aboveground litter and surface soils. Results Litter decomposition was significantly accelerated by exposure to solar radiation. Moreover, labile sugars (hexoses and pentoses), microbial enzymatic activity (beta-glucosidase activity) and available carbohydrates for cellulase degradation (saccharification) all significantly increased in sunlight-exposed litter. None of these stimulatory effects were observed in the surface soils exposed to sunlight. On the contrary, soil microbial biomass and beta-glucosidase activity in surface soils were significantly greater only with litter addition and attenuated sunlight. Conclusions Our results suggest that photodegradation of plant litter (production of volatile compounds through photochemical mineralization) and photofacilitation (stimulation of biotic activity due to change in litter chemistry with exposure to sunlight) generate rapid turnover of C in aboveground litter. The consequences of this accelerated C turnover may be that a fraction of leaf litter decomposes and is directly released back to the atmosphere as CO2 and never enters soil organic matter pool. Taken together, these results highlight the functional importance of solar radiation in determining the C balance in semiarid ecosystems.

AB A new threat now confronts the Amazon in the form of a massive infrastructure program, the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America, or IIRSA. This article presents results of a projection analysis showing that IIRSA could push the Amazonian forest past a "tipping point,'' replacing it with tropical savanna. Such an event would degrade biodiversity, reduce carbon storage, and harm continental agriculture, dependent on moisture transport from forest-based rainfall recycling. The article considers environmental policy in Brazil and discusses its weakening over time. One short-term approach to conservation is provided by indigenous resistance to development forces. The article presents a case study of the Munduruku people, who recently stopped construction of a large dam on the Tapajos River in defending their territories. It argues that more research is needed to understand the impacts of IIRSA, which is proceeding in the dark.

AB Key message Tree-ring chronologies were built for wild and cultivated Paubrasilia echinata, a presently endangered species. Significantly P. echinata showed measurably different growth patterns related to the environment where wild and cultivated trees have grown. Paubrasilia echinata once grew so abundantly along the tropical coast of South America that the names given to the tree by early Europeans colonists-Bresil, Brasil, Brazil-became synonymous with an entire geography. Today, despite restoration and protection efforts, the species remains under threat of extinction throughout Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Considering the past overexploitation and ongoing climate changes, the future of P. echinata significantly depends upon human understanding of the species' growth dynamics and growth-climate relations. Therefore, this work aims to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of calendar dating P. echinata tree rings; (2) build chronologies by analyzing its growth rings; and (3) establish with detail the specific influence of climate on annual radial xylem production. Differences in vessel and axial parenchyma frequency, local distended rays and marginal parenchyma were the wood anatomical markers used to distinguish boundaries between adjacent rings so that dendrochronological methods could be applied. For climate-growth responses, we developed tree-ring width chronologies from wild and cultivated trees. Results revealed that seasonal rainfall is the most important factor influencing P. echinata growth. More specifically, positive correlation was observed between the tree-ring chronology of wild trees and precipitation during the rainy months of the growing season, while the tree-ring chronology of cultivated trees correlated negatively with precipitation in months before the growth period. Wild trees showed increment growth rates lower than planted trees. Rainfall's observed effect on P. echinata is, of course, not surprising. However, our results contribute a detailed quantitative record of that effect, which expands the body of ecological knowledge regarding P. echinata necessary for ongoing conservation efforts under current and future human-caused climate change.

AB The national Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) programmes of Mexico were originally based on the neoclassical economic theory that conceptualized ecosystems as factories whose various outputs can be quantified and converted to commodities. This model of PES clashed with an alternative theorization, Compensation for Ecosystem Services (CES), with home-grown roots in the ontological orientation and contextualized experience of an epistemic community of public intellectuals with deep engagement in rural Mexico. While built upon the same basic premise - that healthy ecosystems produce services of value - the CES model reimagines payments as compensation for the sustainable stewardship and labour of rural communities and, mediated by the state, as a means to counteract the systemic structural inequities between rural and urban and global North and South. Based on discourse analysis of a series of key actor interviews, longitudinal participant observation and policy analysis, this article explores: 1) the common conceptual underpinnings in the theory of CES, but also the variances; 2) the specific influence of this model on the design of the national PES programmes; and 3) the ways in which this influence has been mediated by politics and shifting relations of power in Mexico.

AB Vascular epiphytes contribute significantly to tropical diversity. Research on the factors that determine vascular epiphytic diversity and composition in tropical areas is flourishing. However, these factors are entirely unknown in tropical-temperate transition zones, which represent the distribution limit of several epiphytic species. We assessed the degree to which climatic and structural variables determine the diversity of vascular epiphytic assemblages (VEAs) in a transition zone in Mexico: the El Cielo Biosphere Reserve. We found 12,103 epiphytic individuals belonging to 30 species and 15 genera along a climatic gradient from 300 to 2,000 m a.s.l. Bromeliaceae and Orchidaceae were the most species-rich families. Forests along the windward slope of the Sierra Madre Oriental (semideciduous forest and tropical montane cloud forest) had higher species richness than forests along the leeward slope (pine-oak forest and submontane scrub). Species richness was largely determined by seasonality and, to a lesser degree, by forest structure, whereas abundance was mainly determined by host tree size. Variation in VEAs composition was largely explained by climatic variables, whereas forest structure was not as important. VEAs differed among forest types and slopes in terms of taxonomic and functional composition. For example, certain bromeliad indicator species reflected differences between slopes. Although within-tree epiphytic species richness (alpha diversity) was low in this transition zone relative to other habitats, species turnover among forest types (beta diversity) was high. These findings suggest that each forest type makes a unique and important contribution to epiphytic diversity in this transition zone.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is one of the main mechanisms influencing diversity maintenance in tropical forests. Tropical highland forests, in contrast to most lowland forests, are commonly dominated by a few tree species, and testing the importance of density dependence effects on seedling establishment of dominant trees may provide insights on the mechanisms regulating population dynamics and forest composition of tropical highlands. We tested the effect of CNDD regulation on seedling survival and recruitment of Quercus costaricensis, a monodominant oak in the Talamanca highland forests of Costa Rica. We used Ripley's K and generalized linear mixed models to test the effects of conspecific density, distance to the nearest adult, density of Chusquea bamboo shoots, and herbivory on the annual survival probability of 3579 seedlings between 2014 and 2017. We did not find a significant effect of CNDD on seedling survival. However, bamboo density and herbivory both significantly decreased oak seedling survival. All seedlings had signs of herbivory and predator satiation may explain the lack of density dependent regulation in seedlings of this species. We argue that the lack of intraspecific density regulation at the seedling stage may contribute to explain the dominance of Q. costaricensis in the highland forests of Costa Rica. Local seedling dynamics of this endemic oak are instead regulated by herbivory and the density of Chusquea. in Spanish is available with online material.

AB Aim While habitat loss is a primary driver of biodiversity declines worldwide, the role of habitat fragmentation per se is inconclusive, but likely depends on the amount of habitat left in a landscape. Here we aimed to tease apart the effects of habitat amount (percentage of native cover) and a fragmentation metric (number of fragments) on species richness and total abundance. Taxon Native small mammals. Location South American Atlantic Forest biome. Methods Small mammal species richness and abundance were obtained from a published database for 96 localities (groups of sampling sites). We then defined circular 100 km(2) landscapes centred on each locality. For each landscape, percentage of habitat cover and number of fragments were measured on time frames close to the sampling periods. Effects of habitat amount, fragmentation and their interaction were modelled considering all landscapes, and also within four classes of habitat cover: 0%-10%, 10%-30%, 30%-50%, and 50%-100%. Results Species richness was mainly affected by percentage of habitat cover, with a three-fold effect size compared to fragmentation. Yet, in landscapes with <10% or >= 50% of remaining cover, fragmentation positively affected species richness. Total species abundance also increased towards more fragmented landscapes. At the species level, three of the 20 species considered increased in abundance with fragmentation, while four species decreased. Main conclusion Percentage of habitat cover was the main driver of species richness when the entire cover range is considered, but the secondary effects of fragmentation were strong at the extreme ends of this range. Adding habitat patches in landscapes with low cover, or promoting habitat heterogeneity in landscapes with high cover, may boost species richness. However, further increases in species richness following fragmentation in high-cover landscapes are likely to correspond to disturbance-adapted species. In addition, such positive effects of fragmentation cannot be presumed to apply to all assemblages and species as some species are negatively affected.

AB Crops have different strategies to acquire poorly-available soil phosphorus (P) which are dependent on their architectural, morphological, and physiological root traits, but their capacity to enhance P acquisition varies with the type of fertilizer applied. The objective of this study was to examine how P-acquisition strategies of three main crops are affected by the application of sewage sludges, compared with a mineral P fertilizer. We carried out a 3-months greenhouse pot experiment and compared the response of P-acquisition traits among wheat, barley and canola in a soil amended with three sludges or a mineral P fertilizer. Results showed that the P-acquisition strategy differed among crops. Compared with canola, wheat and barley had a higher specific root length and a greater root carboxylate release and they acquired as much P from sludge as from mineral P. By contrast, canola shoot P content was greater with sludge than with mineral P. This was attributed to a higher root-released acid phosphatase activity which promoted the mineralization of sludge-derived P-organic. This study showed that contrasted P-acquisition strategies of crops allows increased use of renewable P resources by optimizing combinations of crop and the type of P fertilizer applied within the cropping system.

AB Intertidal zone of rocky shores is influenced by a wide variety of abiotic and biotic drivers. These variables can affect the species abundance at different temporal scales. In the present study our goal was to evaluate the community changes over the years using different temporal scales (fortnightly, monthly, seasonal and annual) as a tool to understand the effects of biotic (i.e. competition or facilitation) and abiotic drivers (i.e. water temperature, air temperature, tidal regime, rainfall and water quality) in abundance pattern of dominant species (Crassostrea rhizophorae, Saccostrea cuccullata, Tetraclita stalactifera and Amphibalanus amphitrite). The samples were seasonally carried out in the mid-intertidal zone in the Boa Viagem Beach in Guanabara Bay over 7 years (2010 July - 2017 June). From June 2015 to June 2017 fortnightly samplings were made in addition to seasonal sampling. The inter annual scale was the main scale in which the differences in the percent cover of the benthic community was noted (pseudo-F = 15.96, p = 0.0001). Hierarchical ANOVA indicated that for the dominant species only the annual scale was significant while to the cryptogenic macroalgae Ulva spp. only the seasonal scale. Among the environmental variables selected, dbRDA indicated 6 of them that were significantly relevant to percent cover variation of all species explaining 86,61% of data variation (p < 0.05). While C. rhizophorae e S. cucullata and T. stalactifera exhibited similar response to the relevant environmental variables, A. amphitrite exhibited opposite response to these variables. The species responded to abiotic drivers in different temporal scales. Water temperature was a very important variable, but its effect in the population dynamics of these long-lived species needs long time scales (60 days) to manifest responses at detectable levels as well as the biotic interactions, such as competition, and the effects of bioinvasion. The niche overlap observed among S. cucullata and C. rhizophorae with A. amphitrite was highly significantly (p < 0.001) (i.e.,negative SES). Conversely for the oyster species the observed niche overlap is greater than the niche overlap expected by chance (i.e., SES positive). Environmentally constrained null model approach showed a significant (p = 0.004) relationship only between A. amphitrite and S. cucullata (C-score obs = 1200; C-score exp = 716.6), indicating a negative association. During this long and continuous monitoring, we verified that each environmental variable affects the same species at distinct temporal scales, affecting also some biotic interactions (S. cucullata x A. amphitrite) and consequently the community structure.

AB In recent years, it has become clear that frugivory and seed dispersal (FSD) by turtles and tortoises is much more common than previously thought. We here review published and unpublished records of chelonian FSD, and assess the role of chelonians as seed dispersers, from individual species to the community level. We first discuss the distribution of chelonian FSD and the characteristics of the fruit and/or seed species eaten and dispersed by chelonians. We then use the seed dispersal efficiency framework to explore the quantitative and qualitative components of seed dispersal by tortoises and turtles, embarking on a journey from when the fruits and/or seeds are consumed, to when and where they are deposited, and assess how efficient chelonians are as seed dispersers. We finally discuss chelonian FSD in the context of communities and of chelonians as megafauna. A substantial proportion of the world's aquatic and terrestrial turtles and a major part of testudinid tortoises (71 species in 12 families) include fruits and/or seeds in their diet; fruits of at least 588 plant species in 121 families are ingested and/or dispersed by chelonians. For some chelonians, overall or in certain seasons, fruit may even form the largest part of their diet. Contrary to seed dispersal by lizards, the other major reptilian frugivores, chelonian FSD is not an island phenomenon in terms of geographic distribution. Nevertheless, on islands tortoises are often among the largest native terrestrial vertebrates - or were until humans arrived. We synthesise our knowledge of chelonian FSD, and discuss the relevance of our findings for conservation and restoration, especially in relation to rewilding with large and giant tortoises.

AB The European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) is a vulnerable species, whose populations are declining throughout its entire range in Central and South-Eastern Europe. To a great extent, its conservation depends on habitat restoration, maintenance and protection. In order to improve the conservation status of the species, reintroductions are increasingly applied. Therefore, researchers focus their attention on factors that facilitate these activities and contribute to their success. In addition to the well-known factors like grass height and exposition, others, related to the underground characteristics, are more difficult to evaluate. The presence of other digging species could help this evaluation. Here, we present two reintroduced ground squirrel colonies, where the vast majority of the burrows are located in the base of anthills, mainly of yellow meadow ant (Lasius flavus). This interspecies relationship offers numerous advantages for the ground squirrel and is mostly neutral for the ants. The benefits for the ground squirrel, including reduced energy demand for digging, as well as additional surveillance and hiding places available, could greatly enhance the post-reintroduction adaptation process.

AB The mechanisms underlying interspecific variation in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) are poorly understood. Using a multilevel modeling approach, we combined long-term seedling demographic data from a subtropical forest plot with soil fungal community data by means of DNA sequencing to address the feedback of various guilds of soil fungi on the density dependence of trees. We show that mycorrhizal type mediates tree neighborhood interactions at the community level, and much of the interspecific variation in CNDD is explained by how tree species differ in their fungal density accumulation rates as they grow. Species with higher accumulation rates of pathogenic fungi suffered more from CNDD, whereas species with lower CNDD had higher accumulation rates of ectomycorrhizal fungi, suggesting that mutualistic and pathogenic fungi play important but opposing roles.

TI Aerial plant biomass and litterfall as local determinants of leaf litter

AB The rate of litter decomposition can vary within ecosystems that have high spatial heterogeneity, and many uncertainties remain regarding the abiotic and biotic factors that act as determinants of decomposition rates at small spatial scales. This study investigated the decomposition rates of leaves and fine roots of Croton sonderianus Mull. Arg., Poincianella pyramidalis Tul., and Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart. over 12 months in a semiarid ecosystem in Brazil. Twelve biotic and abiotic factors were also evaluated as local determinants of decomposition rates. A 2000 x 500 m grid was delimited within which thirty 20 x 20 m plots were established. Two sets of litterbags were installed in each plot, one containing a mixture of leaves and the other a mixture of roots. The approximate mean lost mass was 90% for leaf material and 47% for roots after 10 and 12 months, respectively. Due to the litterbag incubation sites being distributed in a heterogeneous area, values for the intrinsic decay coefficient (k) (through month) varied widely from a minimum of 0.073 to a maximum of 0.458 for leaf litter and from 0.045 to 0.077 for roots. Variation in the decay coefficients for leaves and roots was significantly explained by aerial plant biomass and litterfall production, respectively; more open areas exhibited the highest rates of decomposition. Vegetation structure that favors the exposure of soil to solar radiation can influence the decomposition process, promoting an increase in leaf, and fine root decomposition rates at small spatial scales in tropical semiarid ecosystems.

AB The composition, diversity, structure, leaf characteristics and productivity of plant communities in cloud forests vary along altitudinal gradients. These changes may drive interactions with insect herbivores; however, the empirical evidence is scarce. We evaluated seven leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf density, leaf strength, C, N and water content, and C:N ratio) and insect herbivory of two shrub species (Xylosma flexuosa, Cinnamomum psychotrioides) at two elevations (1300 and 1600 m asl) in a Mexican cloud forest. We expected higher leaf herbivory at 1300 m, associated with a higher quality of leaf tissues (high specific leaf area, water and N content). Plant traits differed between species and elevation. In X. flexuosa, leaf density and C:N ratio were higher at 1600 m, while N content, leaf strength and C content were lower. In C. psychotrioides, only leaf density was higher at 1300 m. In accordance with these traits, herbivory was higher at 1300 m, but only in X. flexuosa. Herbivory levels ranged from 1% to 4.7% and were higher in X. flexuosa than in C. psychotrioides. Variation in leaf traits determines herbivory levels in X. flexuosa; however, perceived differences may also relate to biotic or abiotic factors driving herbivore abundance.

AB Successful conservation of threatened species requires judicious allocation of limited resources. The threatened Black-throated Finch southern subspecies (Poephila cincta cincta), endemic to north-eastern Australia, has suffered an 80% contraction in its historical range. Stemming ongoing habitat loss is the main priority in its conservation, but remaining areas where habitat has been degraded require active management. However, the scarce information about the subspecies' ecology has inhibited effective conservation planning. In this paper, we gather and review current knowledge on the Black-throated Finch southern subspecies' ecology and threats and propose a list of research priorities aimed to support conservation management. We highlight how available knowledge could lead to false assumptions due to the limited temporal scope of most studies and their focus on a substantially modified area within its current range. There is a shortage of information on the present population size and distribution of the subspecies, which creates uncertainty about its conservation status. Our top three priority actions are focused on monitoring the remaining populations and evaluating the effects of management practices in pastoral land. We expect this paper to serve as a first step to create a cohesive framework for researchers and stakeholders when deciding to invest in the conservation of this iconic finch.

AB The genus Sedum has 428 species, and 133 grow in Mexico. They are distributed mainly in the Mexican Transition Zone where the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographic regions converge. The Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS) is one of the most diverse biogeographic provinces in the country. The objectives were: 1) to determine the species richness of Sedum in the SMS, 2) to identify areas with high richness, and 3) to recognize geographical distribution patterns. A database was developed from herbarium specimens and publications. The species richness was quantified by state, vegetation type, biogeographic subprovince, a grid cell of 16 x 16 km and geographical criteria. A total of 429 records were obtained representing 47 taxa, 16 were endemic to the SMS. With 40 species, the highest diversity was concentrated in the districts of Guerrero and Tierras Altas of Oaxaca, in the Oriental subprovince. Most species of Sedum were found in conifer and oak forest. Five areas of high richness were identified in Oaxaca where 6 grid cells were located with 7-10 species. The SMS harbored 47 taxa of Sedum but the diversity and endemism are concentrated in the Oriental subprovince.

AB The mycorrhizal symbiosis is optimal when the plant and the fungi are sympatric. However, in forest plantations the inoculum typically belongs to exotic or allopatric fungi. In this paper, the efficiency of mycorrhization was determined by evaluating the effect of 2 sympatric fungi species (Laccaria trichodermophora and L. bicolor s.l.) and 2 allopatric (L. laccata var. laccata and L. vinaceobrunnea) on the growth and nutrient contents of Pinus montezumae. We also tested the effect of the mycorrhizal helper bacteria P seudomonas fluorescens (Pf_Ag001). After 1 year of growth, we evaluated the mycorrhization percentage, plant height, diameter at root collar, dry weight and nutrient contents (N, P, K) of aerial part and roots. The mycorrhization percentage varied from 93.5% to 98.5%. The treatments that showed higher efficiency (biomass accumulation and K contents) were those inoculated with sympatric species. All Laccaria treatments, either in the presence or absence of the bacteria, showed a better response compared to not inoculated controls. This work demonstrates the significance of using inocula of sympatric species as these are genetically predisposed to associate with their hosts, naturally adapted to the local environmental and edaphic conditions compared with those of allopatric origin.

AB Recent research in the central Amazon suggests that wind is a major agent of disturbance, however, a mechanistic understanding of how wind may lead to tree mortality in Amazonian forests remains unclear. Here we estimated wind speeds necessary to topple central Amazon trees by linking both static and dynamic versions of two wind speed estimation methods (four methods total) to field data on tree failure derived from a static winching study. Static versions of these methods assumed invariant wind characteristics as more trees failed, while dynamic versions updated tree spacing, leaf area index and wind profiles progressively after each tree failure. First, we used a profile method which estimates wind force on individual trees by segments. We calculated drag on each segment and converted drag into basal turning moment, and compared the summed turning moments to the critical turning moment measured in the winching study. Estimated critical wind speeds from the static profile method varied greatly, from 10.75ms(-1) to >120.0ms(-1) with a mean of 45.70ms(-1). Critical wind speeds estimated with static approaches decreased with tree size but were not significantly different between two focal genera. Primary drivers of variation in critical wind speed were tree height and crown size. Second, we used the turning moment coefficient method of Hale, S.E., Gardiner, B., Peace, A., Nicoll, B., Taylor, P. and Pizzirani, S. 2015 Comparison and validation of three versions of a forest wind risk model. Environ. Model. Softw. 68, 27-41. doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.01.016.; the static version of this method yielded less-variable estimates, ranging from 18.98 to 52.01ms(-1), with a mean of 30.88ms(-1). Notably, the two static methods for estimating critical wind speeds differed in the trees they identified as having the highest and lowest critical wind speeds. Dynamic variants of the above two methods produced greatly reduced ranges in CWS estimates for our study trees, because after the early tree failures, remaining trees were subject to greater wind penetration into the stand and thus greater loading for a given abovecanopy wind speed. CWS estimated with dynamic approaches differed significantly between the focal taxa. Nevertheless, both estimates suggest that wind speeds commonly observed during Amazon storms are sufficient to produce widespread tree damage and mortality.

AB Ants can influence soil fertility and the spatial distribution of seeds, with possible effects on seedling recruitment. The ant species Pachycondyla striata Fr. Smith, 1858 and Odontomachus chelifer (Latreille, 1802) co-occur in many forest areas in the Neotropics. We assessed soil fertility and seed bank structure in soil samples close and distant (control) from ant nests in forest fragments. We also assessed the richness and abundance of seedlings on nests and control sites. In soil samples from ant nests, the concentration of phosphorus and potassium were respectively 55.6% and 36% higher than in control sites. Aluminium was 11-15% lower in soil samples from ant nests. In the greenhouse, soils from ant nests had higher plant abundance and species richness, but the same species composition in comparison with control sites. Although more plants emerged from soil samples of O. chelifer nests, in the field, the density and richness of seedlings were similar for the two ant species studied. Seedlings in the nest sites were, on average, 1.8 times more abundant and 1.6 times richer in species than in control sites. Our results showed that ant species can play a key role in seedling recruitment in forest fragments, where other animals with equivalent and positive effects, such as mammals, are missing.

AB The two Buphagus oxpecker species are specialized passerines that forage for ticks and other food particles on the body of ungulates in the African savannahs. One of their intriguing features is their ability to coexist despite sharing the same, specialized diet. Using co-occurrence data (photographs of giraffes with oxpeckers on them) and approximate Bayesian computing, we demonstrate that yellow-billed oxpeckers changed host faster than red-billed oxpeckers and appeared to displace red-billed oxpeckers from preferred giraffe body parts. Conversely, red-billed oxpeckers exhibited a fuller use of each host and displaced yellow-billed oxpeckers from distal giraffe body parts. These findings highlight that the partition of giraffe hosts in two separate niches was only part of the coexistence story in this species pair. More precisely, the oxpeckers shared the resource by exploiting it at different rates. They engaged in different trade-offs between giving-up density, patch discovery rate and competitor displacement ability. They illustrate the importance of the time frame of interactions.

AB The evaluation of the effects of environmental factors on natural communities has been one of the principal approaches in ecology; although, over the past decade, increasing importance has been given to spatial factors. In this context, we evaluated the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors for the structuring of the local odonate communities in preserved and altered streams. Adult Odonata were sampled in 98 streams in eastern Amazonia, Brazil. The physical features of each stream were evaluated and spatial variables were generated. Only environmental factors accounted for the variation in the Odonata community. The same pattern was observed in the suborder Zygoptera. For Anisoptera, environmental factors alone affect the variation in the community, considering all the environments together, and the altered areas on their own. As the two Odonata suborders presented distinct responses to environmental factors, this partitioning may contribute to an improvement in the precision of studies in biomonitoring. We thus suggest that studies would have a greater explanatory potential if additional variables are included, related to biotic interactions (e.g., competition). This will require further investigation on a finer scale of environmental variation to determine how the Odonata fauna of Amazonian streams behaves under this analytical perspective.

AB A functional perspective of tree communities is helpful for understanding forest dynamics, especially vegetation recovery after other land uses. Knowledge about ecological filters and survival strategies of trees are also important for the restoration of degraded areas. This study aimed to evaluate the functional composition and structure of adult and regenerative components of natural Araucaria forests, Araucaria plantations and plantations of exotic Pinus in subtropical southern Brazil. Differences in functional diversity and functional richness, and in community weighted mean trait values, including leaf traits and reproductive traits, were analyzed. RLQ analysis was used to assess the association between community structure, plant traits and environmental variables. Clear differences were found for most traits and for functional richness for the regenerative component, while the adult component was more similar among forest types. A clear separation in RLQ ordination associated with trait variation, for the adult component but not for regenerative trees, also indicates that communities are becoming functionally more similar with time. Plantations were shown to function as environmental filters by directly influencing species recruitment, richness and functional diversity. We conclude that passive restoration may be the best strategy for restoration of Araucaria forests.

AB Global tree cover products are widely used in analyses of deforestation, fragmentation, and connectivity, but are rarely critically assessed. Inaccuracies in these products could have consequences for future decision making, especially in data-poor regions like the tropics. In this study, potential biases in global and regional tree cover products were assessed across a diverse tropical country, Costa Rica. Two global tree cover products and one regional national forest cover map were evaluated along biophysical gradients in elevation, precipitation, and agricultural land cover. To quantify product accuracy and bias, freely available high-resolution imagery was used to validate tree and land cover across these gradients. Although the regional forest cover map was comparable in accuracy to a widely-used global forest map (the Global Forest Change of Hansen et al., also known as the GFC), another global forest map (derived from a cropland dataset) had the highest accuracy. Both global and regional forest cover products showed small to severe biases along biophysical gradients. Unlike the regional map, the global GFC map strongly underestimated tree cover (>10% difference) below 189 mm of precipitation and at elevations above 2000 m, with a larger bias for precipitation. All map products misclassified agricultural fields as forest, but the GFC product particularly misclassified row crops and perennial erect crops (banana, oil palm, and coffee), with maximum tree cover in agricultural fields of 89%-100% across all crops. Our analysis calls into further question the utility of the GFC product for global forest monitoring outside humid regions, indicating that, in tropical regions, the GFC product is most accurate in areas with high, aseasonal rainfall, low relief, and low cropland area. Given that forest product errors are spatially distributed along biophysical gradients, researchers should account for these spatial biases when attempting to analyze or generate forest map products.

AB Nectarivorous bats are essential to the functioning to both agricultural and natural ecosystems in the tropics, yet these pollinator communities are declining as a result of habitat loss and hunting. Temporal variation and habitat changes lead to both roost and floral resource loss, which is the major driver of bat pollination decline. This study aims to determine how the bat pollination networks in mixed-fruit orchards are affected by flowering seasons and different land-use types. We estimated the abundance of nectarivorous and frugivorous bats using video observations to determine floral visitation rates from 18 mixed-fruit orchards in Southern Thailand. Pollination networks were then created based on network level indices (number of interactions and specialisation) and species level indices (strength-dependence of plant on each bat, and generalised degree-the number of interactions per species divided by the number of possible interacting partners) for each bat group at each orchard. We found that specialisation in low season networks was higher than those from peak season. Nectarivorous bats showed higher levels of normalised degree, and strength than frugivorous bats. The normalised degree of frugivorous bats, but not nectarivorous bats increased with the proportion of urban area within 30 km radius. The strength of bats was positively correlated with the proportion of plantations within a 2 km radius. Our results show that both bat guilds are strongly integrated into pollination networks where they occur and provide evidence that increasing the area of plantation and urban alters the degree of generalization of pollinators which can significantly impact pollination success of plants.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs are now high in number, if not always in impact. When groups of users pay groups of service providers, establishing PES involves collective action. We study the creation of collective PES institutions, and their continuation, as group coordination. We use framed lab-in-field experiments with hydroservices users and providers within watersheds participating in Mexico's Matching Funds program in Veracruz, Yucatan and Quintana Roo states. We explore the coordination of contributions between downstream users and upstream providers, plus effects of different types of sanctions that can affect expectations for both users and providers. Both information alone and sanctions raise contributions overall, although outcomes varied by site in line with our rankings of 'watershed trust'. For instance, monetary sanctions raise contributions in the watershed we ranked high in trust, yet initially lowered them for the lowest-trust watershed. This suggests that upstream-downstream social capital will be central to new collective local PES, while our overall trends suggest social capital can be raised by successful coordination over time.

AB Little is known about consumer productivity in the tropics despite the key feedbacks that animals impose on primary productivity. In the Amazon basin, seasonally flooded and unflooded forests exist side by side, and ants (Formicidae) dominate animal biomass. Although flooding has a direct negative effect on soil-dwelling ants, it is less clear whether flooding has indirect effects on arboreal ants via associated changes in tree communities. To test whether seasonal inundation by whitewater affects arboreal ants, we investigated ant communities in adjacent flooded and unflooded forests along a major whitewater river in central-western Amazonia. Whitewater-flooded forest exhibits higher primary productivity than unflooded forest. We thus hypothesized that forest type would affect the productivity and the foraging traits of arboreal ants and that these changes would be mediated by increases in plant-derived food for ants in flooded forest. We compared ant and plant communities between flooded- and unflooded-forest transects along the Jurua River in Amazonas, Brazil. We collected, identified, and counted terrestrial and arboreal ants, and we measured ant traits with putative relationships to foraging strategy. We also identified plant stems to characterize the abundance of ant food rewards. Flooding negatively affected the diversity and abundance of terrestrial ants but did not change the diversity of arboreal ants. Arboreal ants were more abundant and exhibited higher biomass in flooded forest than in unflooded forest. Arboreal ant traits also suggested that ants may rely more heavily on plant-derived food in flooded forest than in unflooded forest. These differences were associated with a higher abundance of plant stems predicted to contain ant food rewards in flooded forest than in unflooded forest. Our results indicate that the productivity of arboreal ants is affected by that of the underlying forest. Such effects may be mediated by the predominantly herbivorous foraging strategy of canopy ants, which would link ant populations closely to primary production and stoichiometry. Given ants' important functional roles, these differences in ant productivity between forest types may have consequences for other arthropods and feedbacks to plants throughout the Amazon basin.

AB Herbivory tolerance can offset the negative effects of herbivory on plants and plays an important role in both immigration and population establishment. Biomass reallocation is an important potential mechanism of herbivory tolerance. To understand how biomass allocation affects plant herbivory tolerance, it is necessary to distinguish the biomass allocations resulting from environmental gradients or plant growth. There is generally a tight balance between the amounts of biomass invested in different organs, which must be analyzed by means of an allometric model. The allometric exponent is not affected by individual growth and can reflect the changes in biomass allocation patterns of different parts. Therefore, the allometric exponent was chosen to study the relationship between biomass allocation pattern and herbivory tolerance. We selected four species (Wedelia chinensis, Wedelia trilobata, Merremia hederacea, and Mikania micrantha), two of which are invasive species and two of which are accompanying native species, and established three herbivory levels (0%, 25% and 50%) to compare differences in allometry. The biomass allocation in stems was negatively correlated with herbivory tolerance, while that in leaves was positively correlated with herbivory tolerance. Furthermore, the stability of the allometric exponent was related to tolerance, indicating that plants with the ability to maintain their biomass allocation patterns are more tolerant than those without this ability, and the tendency to allocate biomass to leaves rather than to stems or roots helps increase this tolerance. The allometric exponent was used to remove the effects of individual development on allocation pattern, allowing the relationship between biomass allocation and herbivory tolerance to be more accurately explored. This research used an allometric model to fit the nonlinear process of biomass partitioning during the growth and development of plants and provides a new understanding of the relationship between biomass allocation and herbivory tolerance.

AB We review 15 forest watershed protection programs in the United States in which a local government agency or water provider collects payments from downstream service beneficiaries, such as water consumers, and pays upstream forest landowners for provision of watershed services. We describe the features of these Payments for Watershed Services (PWS) programs, focusing on funding sources, how the payment mechanisms work, and outcomes achieved. We also assess the extent to which the programs adhere to the economic principles that are associated with efficient or cost effective PWS schemes. In general, we find that payments in the programs do not closely reflect the marginal value of the service provided. Payments received by landowners mainly reflect the landowners' opportunity costs. Fees paid by water consumers are set to yield revenue targets and/or reflect the avoided cost of additional water filtration and treatment. The programs appear to yield societal benefits, primarily through cost savings, but data from program outcomes is limited and more rigorous analysis of both the benefits and costs would be worthwhile.

AB Habitat fragmentation creates habitat edges, and ecological edge effects can cause major changes in the ecology and distribution of many taxa. However, these ecological changes may in turn influence animal movements and lead to molecular edge effects and edge-related genetic structure, matters that are largely unexplored. This study aims to infer molecular edge effects and to test three possible underlying mechanisms in the Endangered golden-brown mouse lemur Microcebus ravelobensis, a nocturnal species in the dry deciduous forest of the Ankarafantsika National Park in north-western Madagascar. Mouse lemurs were sampled in one edge and two interior habitats in close proximity to each other (500-1,400 m) in a continuous forest. A total of 41 mouse lemur samples were genotyped with seven nuclear microsatellites, and a fragment of the mitochondrial control region was sequenced for all samples. The overall genetic diversity (allelic richness, heterozygosity, haplotype richness, nucleotide diversity) was lower in the edge habitat compared to the two interior sites and all subpopulations showed signals of relatively low genetic exchange and significant genetic differentiation between them despite the short geographical distances, supporting the local preference model. These findings can be interpreted as preliminary signals of a molecular edge effect and suggest the potential for local adaptation. They are highly relevant for the conservation of fragmented populations, because a further subdivision of already small populations may increase their vulnerability to stochastic demographic changes and collapse.

AB Vegetation health of any ecosystem and changes in it are vital in global change in ecology and it is delicately linked to climate change. This study evaluated the spatial patterns of significant negative change trend using composite NOAA-AVHRR data time series (1982-2006), long term forest fire point data, invasive hotspot data and predicted climate anomalies data over the different harmonized landcover categories of India. Around 65% of Indian forest shows the trend of negative change. Significant negative change were found to be highest (203,026 km(2)) over 'Tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests' category, followed by 'Tropical lowland forests, broadleaved, evergreen' (81,555 km(2)) and 'Evergreen shrubland & regrowth/Abandoned shifting cultivation/Extensive shifting cultivation' (55,811 km(2)). Around 85% of Indian biodiversity hotspot showed the negative change. The analysis of forest fire revealed the 'Tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests' retained the highest forest fire percentage (40%). The prediction of temperature anomalies for the year 2030 using RCP 4.5 model showed the increase in the temperature in the range of 0.58-1.32 degrees C and was found highest in northern part of India. Similarly, the rainfall prediction for the year 2030 showed rainfall deficit in several states of India. The outcomes of the present study would help in prioritization of various vegetation types suffering from anthropogenic and natural disturbances and will guide the policymakers to safeguard, prioritized forest areas for effective conservation, scientific protection and climate change mitigation endeavors.

AB To reconstruct the history of forest loss in Cambodia, the literature and national/provincial statistics of landuse patterns and the socio-economic situation were investigated. Forest cover in the 1960s was 73.3 % (13.3 Mha). However, this drastically decreased to 47.3% (8.6 Mha) in 2016. In the 1960s, the forest was less-disturbed. From 1970 to 1993, the forest was lost gradually owing to the political instability caused by the Cambodian Civil War. In the post-war reconstruction period from 1993 to around 2002, the need for reconstruction, international demand for timber, and forest logging concessions led to a significant increase in timber production. In the rapid economic growth period from 2002 until present, while several political actions were taken to combat rapid deforestation, economic land concessions, which promoted agroindustrial plantations, as well as small-scale agriculture has been leading to the rapid expansion of arable land and deforestation since 2009.

AB The leaf cutter ant Atta sexdens (L.) (Hymenoptera:Formicidae) causes huge economic losses to agriculture in the Neotropics. In natural environments, parasitic flies of the Phoridae family are natural enemies of leaf cutter ants. Habitat modification is considered one of the main causes of species decline. In this study, we compare the occurrence of parasitic phorids on A. sexdens and the parasitism that they cause on colonies located in agricultural and natural habitats. Phorid flies were collected from trails, nest entrances, and cutting sites when they were hovering over workers of A. sexdens nests from natural vegetation, farmland, and Eucalyptus plantation areas. Simultaneously, workers from A. sexdens nests were collected from these environments, and the parasitism rates of phorids were determined. Ants were parasitized by Apocephalus attophilus, A. vicosae, Eibesfeldtphora bragancai, E. tonhascai, and Myrmosicarius grandicornis. The highest parasitism rate (3.54 +/- 0.49%) was registered for nests from the Eucalyptus plantations. The rate of parasitism of nest from natural vegetation was 2.42 +/- 0.40% and in the farmland was 1.91 +/- 0.39%. The parasitism of each phorid genus varied according to habitat and month. Apocephalus attophilus had the highest parasitism in the three habitats and displayed biological characteristics that give it great potential as a biological control agent for A. sexdens. Eibesfeldtphora spp. had higher parasitism in a natural environment and M. grandicornis in agricultural environments. Apocephalus attophilus and M. grandicornis seemed able to occur in a wide variety of habitats that their hosts occupy, but the rate of parasitism by Eibesfeldtphora spp. was significantly lower in agricultural environments.

AB Productivity is a key driver of ecosystem structure and function, so long-term studies are critical to understanding ecosystems with high temporal variation in productivity. In some deserts, productivity, driven by moisture availability, varies immensely over time (rainfall) and space (landscape factors). At high productivity, species richness is expected to be driven in opposing directions by abundance (More Individuals Hypothesis - MIH) and competition. While studies investigating the impacts of spatial variation in productivity on community structure are common, the impacts of temporal variability on productivity are poorly understood. We tested how well rainfall predicted the activity, species numbers and assemblage composition of ants and if responses were moderated by landscape position. We also asked whether the number of species (richness per sampling unit and estimated species richness) responded directly to rainfall or was moderated by ant activity or competition from dominant ants. Over a 22-year period, when annual rainfall fluctuated between 79 mm and 570 mm, we sampled ants using pitfall traps in paired dune and swale habitats in the Simpson Desert, Australia. We used climate records over this period to model changes in ant assemblages. Activity of dominant ants responded primarily to long-term rainfall, increasing exponentially, while subordinate ants responded to short-term weather and time. Consistent with the MIH, the number of ant species was best predicted by activity, particularly that of subordinate ants. Activity of dominant ants had a declining positive effect on numbers of species. Landscape position strongly predicted species composition, while long-term rainfall determined composition at genus level but not species level. Over time, species composition fluctuated, but several genera consistently increased in activity. Productivity moderators such as long-term rainfall and landscape position are key drivers of ant activity and composition in the study ecosystem, acting indirectly on numbers of species. Numbers of species were explained largely by ant activity, making a strong case for the MIH, but not competition. Longer periods of low rainfall may indirectly reduce species richness in desert ecosystems. However, a trend to increasing richness over time may indicate that conservation management can ameliorate this impact.

AB Interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from forested ecosystems. Therefore, the quantification and modelling of interception loss are of significant importance if human and ecosystem water demands are to be balanced under a future changing climate. This is particularly true for semi-arid/arid regions, where afforestation has become an important ecological restoration measure to tackle desertification, poverty and climate change. However, quantification and modelling of interception loss of plantations in these regions have rarely been reported. In the present study, rainfall interception loss was quantified and modelled over a one-year period (January-December 2016) for a deciduous broad-leafed R. pseudoacacia plantation and an evergreen needle-leaf P. tabuliformis plantation (common afforestation tree species) situated in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. The stand age, density, canopy cover and leaf area index of R. pseudoacacia during the study period were 15 years, 2000 tree ha(-1), 0.48 and 1.41 m(2) m(-2), respectively. The corresponding values for Pinus tabuliformis were 17 years, 1200 tree ha(-1), 0.62 and 2.53 m(2) m(-2). The measured throughfall, stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for R pseudoacacia were 81.1%, 1.3% and 17.6%, respectively. The corresponding values for P. tabuliformis were 75.4%, 0.7% and 23.9%. Given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar, the observed higher interception loss for P. tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rate of this species. The revised Gash analytical model of rainfall interception was well calibrated and validated against field measurements and was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately, and it also effectively captured the seasonal variation (leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons), provided that the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates were used. The revised model was highly sensitive to the canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover, but it was found to be fairly insensitive to the trunk storage capacity.

AB Ecological complexity may improve ecosystem function, stability and adaptability to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Intraspecific trophic variation can represent a significant component of total community variation and can influence food web structure and function. Thus, understanding how trophic niches are partitioned between intraspecific and interspecific processes could improve our understanding of food web dynamics. We examined gut contents, fatty acids and stable isotope ratios in round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) across six sites in Lake Michigan, USA, to determine patterns in intra- and interspecific trophic composition (i.e., mean gut or fatty acid composition) and diversity (i.e., the diversity of gut items or fatty acids). We also examined relationships between fatty acid diversity and gut content characteristics to understand potential mechanisms shaping individual trophic phenotypes. There was significant variation in both trophic composition and diversity among sites, and individual and spatial variation was as important to total trophic variation as species identity. Round goby that consumed dreissenid mussels had more diverse fatty acid profiles than those that consumed other benthic invertebrates, whereas yellow perch fatty acid diversity was not related to gut content composition. Our results confirm that intraspecific variation in resource use can be as important to trophic dynamics as interspecific variation, and that spatial variation in lower level food web processes or habitat may strongly structure local food web dynamics. Individual-level examination of trophic diversity, in concert with trophic composition, could provide additional information about the resilience, function and adaptability of local food webs.

AB An ecological compensation standard should reflect the value of ecosystem services that their beneficiaries derive from providers. However, as there is no uniform method for the establishment of such standards, we researched the flow of water services in the upper reaches of Miyun Reservoir located in Beijing and Hebei provinces (China) based on the InVEST model and integrated water storage capacity method. The proposed ecological compensation standard can reflect the value of water services flowing from upstream to downstream areas. The results show that the total value of water services in the study area was $ 62,778.71x10(4)/year. The water regulation value accounted for 73.64% of the water service value. Further, the downstream areas in Beijing should pay $ 57,444x10(4) to the upper reaches. The ecological compensation standards for different supply areas varied based on forest composition. In Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Beijing, the ecological compensation standards were $ 759.51/hm(2)/year, $ 479.65/hm(2)/year, and $ 938.26/hm(2)/year, respectively. The developed compensation standard reflects the value of the ecosystem services, and is also affordable. The results of this study could thus provide a basis to establish a compensation standard based on continuous consultation and discussion.

AB Inga marginata and Inga subnuda are evergreen N-fixing tree species that are frequently found in the initial stages of forest regeneration. I. marginata has a wide geographic distribution, encompassing the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and dry forests of central Brazil, whereas I. subnuda is endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. We conducted this study to compare the physiological, growth, and biomass allocation responses of I. marginata and I. subnuda to contrasting light environments. Considering that I. marginata and I. subnuda have a similar position in the forest succession and different geographic distributions, we tested a hypothesis that these two congeneric species have similar photosynthetic and growth responses to light availability but different biomass allocation. The plants were grown under three light conditions (36, 15, and 6 mol photons m(-2) day(-1)) for 105 days. Growth, biomass allocation, light-response curves, and leaf pigments were compared among the light conditions and between species by using two-way ANOVA. Our hypothesis was partially supported because the two species had similar photosynthetic responses to changes in light availability, but differences in growth and biomass allocation. The higher relative growth rate in mass of I. subnuda is associated with its higher allocation of biomass to light capture, as shown by the higher values of leaf mass fraction (LMF) and leaf area ratio (LAR). Conversely, the higher values of root mass fraction for I. marginata were in contrast to the higher values of LMF, LAR, and specific leaf area for I. subnuda; this indicates that I. marginata should be better adapted to environments where water could be a limiting factor, which is consistent with its wide geographic distribution.

AB Temperature is a major stressor in the intertidal environment. During emersion, the interaction between physicochemical factors and the external morphology of intertidal organisms results in significant differences between organismal body temperatures and ambient temperatures. Standard temperature loggers do not consider the morphology of the target species and may not serve as effective proxies for body temperatures. Methods such as thermocouples also present their own set of issues, being invasive and potentially damaging. Biomimetic temperature loggers that mimic the organisms of interest are, however, easily deployed in the field and can be used to investigate biological impacts of field temperatures. Due to their high abundance on tropical seawalls and the key ecological roles they play, nerite gastropods (Nerita spp.) were selected as the model organism for the basis of biomimetic "Robonerites". Here, we discuss the development of Robonerites and present results from field and laboratory tests on their effectiveness and accuracy in measuring the in situ body temperatures of nerites on tropical seawalls.

AB Ecological niche models have seen intensive exploration as a tool in biodiversity conservation and evaluation of areas for designing protected natural areas systems, including projections of potential distributions under future conditions. Cloud forest is the most endangered ecosystem in Mexico, and yet ranks high in terms of diversity and endemism. This study focuses on 12 endangered and range-restricted tree species in Mexican cloud forests, exploring patterns of distribution and diversity under 2 future emissions scenarios (representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5) as anticipated by 20 general circulation models. Our results indicate a likely strong reduction in species' distributional areas and -consequently- species diversity manifested in different cloud forest patches across the country. The genus Quercus resulted the most sensitive to climate change. We identified cloud forest patches that are most vulnerable to climate change effects, which can and should focus priorities for protection of this ecosystem, particularly in the Sierra Madre Oriental, where cloud forest is presently lacking any protection.

AB Non-native tree plantations (NNTP) are an increasingly relevant global source of timber. Their expansion may lead to tradeoffs with important local ecosystem services (ES) that need to be evaluated for a sound and sustainable landscape planning. For a mountain area in southern Chile, we assessed the effects of NNTP expansion and potential NNTP timber-ES tradeoffs through a spatial tradeoff typology based on ES supply variations. We evaluated changes in prioritized ES (native timber supply, forage supply, water regulation, and recreation opportunities) and NNTP timber supply based on a probabilistic projection of NNTP expansion at two administrative levels (the municipality and small, medium and large farm properties). Results show that NNTP expansion triggered an increase of 361% in NNTP timber supply at the expense of decreases in provision of selected ES, such as forage supply (16.3%), native timber supply (9.4%), water regulation (0.4%) and recreation opportunities (66.8%). Tradeoffs were restricted to small geographic areas but were considerably high in terms of the magnitude of ES supply losses. Tradeoffs were highest in medium farms as compared to small and large properties. Results corroborate that tradeoffs arise from the interplay of several factors, such as ES type and ES productivity, and they are site-specific and scale dependent. If NNTP continue to expand at the current rate (yearly 9.6%) and under the current management (large scale monocultures), significant ES supply changes are inevitable. These results can inform landowners, landscape planners and governments to better anticipate and mitigate tradeoffs arising from afforestation.

AB Tree planting is the most widely used technique for tropical forest restoration because it accelerates the recovery of forest structure and ecosystem functioning. Despite the importance of tree size distribution to the ecological function and habitat quality of restored forests, it has received little attention. Here we ask if the structure of reference forests has been recovered by planting tree seedlings and discuss the implications of skewed tree-size distributions for sustainability of restored forests. We sampled 11 tropical forest sites that had undergone restoration for between 16 and 53 years after planting tree seedlings and nine reference ecosystems (old-growth, secondary and degraded forests) in Brazilian Atlantic forest, and compared them by the abundance of individuals in five diameter classes. Restored forests presented 83% greater abundance of large trees ( > 20 cm DBH), 41% lower abundance of saplings (1 <= DBH < 5 cm) and 43% lower abundance of small trees (5 <= DBH < 10 cm). The abundance of smaller individuals (DBH < 1 cm), however, did not differ between restored and reference forests, indicating successful colonization of the understorey. Low mortality in the large class (DBH >= 20 cm) results in excess of big trees, which constrains recruitment of small plants to the intermediate size classes, likely due to asymmetric competition for light. The excess of large trees demonstrates that gap dynamics can take longer to naturally re-establish in these even-aged forests, likely due to the high density of long-lived trees planted at the same time. Thinning may be a possible adaptive-management strategy to reduce the density of big trees and stimulate recruitment of intermediate size classes.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in species abundances and distributions of the seedling community, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining species diversity, can help predict future changes in forest communities. We monitored the dynamics of 12,830 seedlings within 405 1-m(2) seedling plots in the Badagongshan (BDGS) 25-ha forest dynamic plot over a 6-year period (2012-2017). We presented changes in the relative abundance for 15 dominant seedling species during the last six years, assessed temporal changes in species richness, species turnover, seedling density, species reordering (mean rank shift of the relative abundance; MRS) and community similarity within three topographically defined habitats (ridge, slope and valley), and explored the mechanisms underlying dynamics of seedling communities. Furthermore, we explored differences in species' ecological indicator values (EIVs) and functional groups for species gained and lost during the study period. Across three habitat types, there were enormous reordering of the 15 dominant seedling species; a few mast-seedling events were clearly identified. Both species richness and seedling density continually declined over the entire census year, except for an increase of species richness during 2012-2013. Species turnover fluctuated temporally in three habitat types; overall, species emigration rate was higher than species immigration rate in three habitats. Valleys with lower soil C:N ratio, light availability and VDCN (vertical distance above the channel network), but higher soil pH and TWI (topographic wetness index), had lower species richness and stem density, and higher species turnover and species reordering than slopes and ridges. At the community-wide scale, significant directional changes in species composition occurred on ridges and slopes. Newly colonizing species were typically more shade- tolerant, water- and temperature- demanding shrub species and grown on soil with low pH but high fertility. In the BDGS plot, species richness and seedling density fluctuated in the first two years and then decreased over time, which reflects that both habitat filtering and seed input regulated temporal dynamics of species composition, but the relative importance varied among studied years. In this subtropical forest, species composition showed obvious directional changes. Shrub species increased more than species of other strata in ridge and slope areas. It is worth noting that an increased dominance of species that are more water-demanding could increase the risk of mortality under global climate change (e.g. drought).

AB The interaction of ocean conditions and weather with small-scale physical features of a habitat can have profound effects on the experiences of individual organisms. On topographically complex shorelines, and particularly within dense aggregations of organisms such as mussel beds, a mosaic of environmental conditions can develop, and the resulting variation in conditions within the aggregation could drastically alter the performance of neighboring individuals. Using a suite of sensors mounted to individual Mytilus californianus mussels over two summer field deployments, we have characterized the temperature variation and valve gaping behavior differences found at two spatial scales: within a group separated by centimeters, and between groups of mussels located at the upper and lower extents of the natural mussel zone separated by meters. While temperature conditions near the lower edge of the mussel bed were generally more benign, temperature extremes were similar at both heights in the bed, and variation in body temperature among neighbors increased as the daily mean temperature increased. These patterns were similar across years despite a 3.8 degrees C difference in mean air and seawater temperatures between years. Gaping behavior was also highly variable among individuals, though that variability diminished at the high end of the mussel bed where the total time mussels spent submerged was much more constrained. These data indicate that an individual mussel's physiological status and past history can be drastically different than those of its nearby neighbors, complicating our ability to characterize representative conditions within a habitat. These observations also provide for the possibility that the impacts of future climate change will be highly specific to certain individuals based on their relative exposure or protection within the mosaic. To address such possibilities, future work must examine the correlation between genotypic and physiological traits that determine performance and individuals' unique experiences in their disparate micro-environments.

AB We addressed the implications of limb loss and regeneration for multispecies interactions and their impacts on ecosystem engineering in freshwater stream environments. We included regenerative and nonregenerative crayfish as well as fish predators in a 2 x 2 factorial design to assess the effects on water turbidity of interactions between crayfish ecosystem engineers differing in regenerative status and their fish predators. We demonstrated that crayfish limb loss and predation risks lead to more turbidity in field and mesocosm conditions. Moreover, ongoing regeneration of crayfish increased turbidity, while fish presence seemed to hinder crayfish turbidity-inducing behaviors (such as tail-flipping and burrowing) in the mesocosm experiment. We confirmed that greater numbers of crayfish produce a greater amount of turbidity in situ in streams. Although mechanical burrowing crayfish capacities may depend on crayfish burrowing classification (primary, secondary, or tertiary), our work emphasizes the implication for turbidity levels of crayfish autotomy in freshwater streams.

AB Proliferation of redundant terms in ecology and conservation slows progress and creates confusion. 'Countryside biogeography' has been promoted as a new framework for conservation in production landscapes, so may offer a replacement for other concepts used by landscape ecologists. We conducted a systematic review to assess whether the 'countryside biogeography' concept provides a distinctive framing for conservation in human-dominated landscapes relative to existing concepts. We reviewed 147 papers referring to countryside biogeography and 81 papers that did not. These papers were divided into categories representing three levels of use of countryside biogeography concepts (strong, weak, cited only) and two categories that did not use countryside biogeography at all but used similar concepts including fragmentation and matrix. We revealed few distinctions among groups of papers. Countryside biogeography papers made more frequent use of the terms 'ecosystem services', 'intensification' and 'land sparing' compared with non-countryside biogeography papers. Papers that did not refer to countryside biogeography sampled production areas (e.g. farms) less often, and this related to their focus on habitat specialist species for which patch-matrix assumptions were reasonable. Countryside biogeography offers a conceptual wrapper rather than a distinctive framework for advancing research in human-modified landscapes. This and similar wrappers such as 'conservation biogeography' and 'agricultural biogeography' risk creating confusion among new researchers, and can prevent clear communication about research. To improve communication, we recommend using the suite of well-established terms already applied to conservation in human-modified landscapes rather than through an interceding conceptual wrapper.

AB Tropical forests are hyperdiverse, yet extensive areas of monodominant forest occur in the tropics worldwide. Most long-lived and persistent monodominant tree species form ectomycorrhizal fungi symbioses, allowing them to obtain nutrients directly from soil organic matter. This might promote monodominance by reducing nutrient availability to co-occurring species, the majority of which form associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forest is the most widespread monodominant forest in tropical Africa. Its distribution appears determined in part by moisture availability, but its monodominance is not thought to be driven by its fungal partner or soil fertility. Here, we compare soil fertility of 20 G. dewevrei stands to mixed forest from three sites across an 8,400 km(2) region of the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo. In contrast to previous studies, we find monodominant G. dewevrei stands associated with infertile soils, as base cations (calcium, magnesium, total exchangeable bases) and extractable manganese are extremely low, and significantly lower in soils under G. dewevrei forest compared to mixed forest. Further, and consistent with ectomycorrhizal forests globally, soil carbon to nitrogen and carbon to phosphorus ratios are significantly higher in G. dewevrei stands than in mixed forest stands, providing evidence in support of direct acquisition of nitrogen and phosphorus from soil organic matter by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Gilbertiodendron dewevrei recruits from the seedling bank, with its large seedlings surviving in high densities for over a decade. We tested whether light plasticity could facilitate monodominance by growing seedlings of G. dewevrei under controlled light conditions. We found that its seedlings grow well under a wide range of irradiance levels and conclude that this plasticity affords a competitive advantage. Synthesis. We reframe the discussion of factors contributing to monodominance of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei into one of resource acquisition and use efficiency. In particular, G. dewevrei is associated with moist and infertile soils and competes well under a variety of light conditions. Our data are consistent with a model where root associations with ectomycorrhizal fungi drive monodominance through the direct acquisition of nutrients from soil organic matter, promoting nutrient limitation of co-occurring species.

AB We investigate how variation in patch area and forest cover quantified for three different spatial scales (buffer size of 500, 1500 and 3000 m radius) affects species richness and functional diversity of bat assemblages in two ecosystems differing in fragment-matrix contrast: a landbridge island system in Panama and a countryside ecosystem in the Brazilian Amazon. Bats were sampled on 11 islands and the adjacent mainland in Panama, and in eight forest fragments and nearby continuous forest in Brazil. Species-area relationships (SAR) were assessed based on Chao1 species richness estimates, and functional diversity-area relationships (FAR) were quantified using Chao1 functional diversity estimates measured as the total branch length of a trait dendrogram. FARs were calculated using three trait sets: considering five species functional traits (FAR(ALL)), and trait subsets reflecting 'diet breadth' (FAR(DIET)) and 'dispersal ability' (FAR(DISPERSAL)). We found that in both study systems, FAR(ALL) was less sensitive to habitat loss than SAR, in the sense that an equal reduction in habitat loss led to a disproportionately smaller loss of functional diversity compared to species richness. However, the inhospitable and static aquatic matrix in the island ecosystem resulted in more pronounced species loss with increasing loss of habitat compared to the countryside ecosystem. Moreover, while we found a significant FAR(DISPERSAL) for the island ecosystem in relation to forest cover within 500 m landscape buffers, FAR(DIET) and FAR(DISPERSAL) were not significant for the countryside ecosystem. Our findings highlight that species richness and functional diversity in island and countryside ecosystems scale fundamentally differently with habitat loss, and suggest that key bat ecological functions, such as pollination, seed dispersal and arthropod suppression, may be maintained in fragments despite a reduction in species richness. Our study reinforces the importance of increasing habitat availability for decreasing the chances of losing species richness in smaller fragments.

AB Vegetation plays an important role in regulating global carbon cycles and is a key component of the Earth system models (ESMs) that aim to project Earth's future climate. In the last decade, the vegetation component within ESMs has witnessed great progress from simple "big-leaf" approaches to demographically structured approaches, which have a better representation of plant size, canopy structure, and disturbances. These demographically structured vegetation models typically have a large number of input parameters, and sensitivity analysis is needed to quantify the impact of each parameter on the model outputs for a better understanding of model behavior. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to diagnose the Community Land Model coupled to the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Simulator, or CLM4.5(FATES). Specifically, we quantified the first-and second-order sensitivities of the model parameters to outputs that represent simulated growth and mortality as well as carbon fluxes and stocks for a tropical site with an extent of 1 x 1 degrees. While the photosynthetic capacity parameter (V-c;max25) is found to be important for simulated carbon stocks and fluxes, we also show the importance of carbon storage and allometry parameters, which determine survival and growth strategies within the model. The parameter sensitivity changes with different sizes of trees and climate conditions. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of the next generation of demographically enabled vegetation models within ESMs to improve model parameterization and structure for better model fidelity.

AB Aim Ongoing and future anthropogenic climate change poses one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, affecting species distributions and ecological interactions. In the Amazon, climatic changes are expected to induce warming, disrupt precipitation patterns and of particular concern, to increase the intensity and frequency of droughts. Yet the response of ecosystems to intense warm, dry events is not well understood. In the Andes the mid-Holocene dry event (MHDE), c. 9,000 to 4,000 years ago, was the warmest and driest period of the last 100,000 years which coincided with changes in evaporation and precipitation that caused lake levels to drop over most of tropical South America. This event probably approximates our near-climatic future, and a critical question is: How much did vegetation change in response to this forcing? Location Lake Pata, Brazilian Western Amazonia. Taxon Terrestrial and aquatic plants. Methods We used pollen, charcoal, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), delta C-13 and delta N-15 data from a new high-resolution core that spans the last c. 7,600 years history of Lake Pata. Results We found that in the wettest section of Amazonia changes associated with the MHDE were detected in the geochemistry analysis but that vegetation changed very little in response to drought during the Holocene. This is the first high-resolution core without apparent hiatuses that spans most of the Holocene (last 7,600 cal yr bp) from Lake Pata, Brazil. Changes in the organic geochemistry of sediments indicated that between c. 6,500 and 3,600 cal yr bp lake levels dropped. Vegetation, however, showed little change as near-modern forests were seen throughout the record, evidencing the substantial resilience of this system. Only a few species replacements and minor fluctuations in abundance were observed in the pollen record. Main conclusions The mid-Holocene warming and reduced precipitation had a limited impact on western Amazonian forests. We attribute much of the resilience to a lack of fire in this system, and that if human-set fires were to be introduced, the forest destruction from that cause would override that induced by climate alone.

AB Coastal ecosystems suffer substantially from the worldwide population growth and its increasing land demands. A common approach to investigate anthropogenic disturbance in coastal ecosystems is to compare urbanized areas with unaffected control sites. However, the question remains whether different types of anthropogenic disturbance that are elements of an urbanized area have the same impact on beach ecosystems. By investigating small islands that are utilized for tourism, inhabited by the local population, or remained completely uninhabited, we disentangled different anthropogenic disturbances and analysed their impacts on hermit crabs as indicator species. We observed a negative impact on abundance on tourist islands and a negative impact on body size on local islands. In comparison to the uninhabited reference, both disturbances had an overall negative impact. As both forms of disturbance also impacted the underlying food resource and habitat availability differently, we propose that the findings from our study approach are valid for most obligate beach species in the same system. This demonstrates that in urbanized areas, the coastal ecosystem is not always impacted identically, which emphasizes the importance of considering the particular type of anthropogenic disturbance when planning conservation action in urbanized areas.

AB In the current era, humans have reshaped relationships with other animals in ways that have significant environmental impacts. While the populations of animals raised for human food continue to increase, populations of wild animals continue to decrease with species increasingly going extinct. These changes in human-animal relations along with their environmental and ecological impacts are unprecedented in human history. This paper examines these impacts as well as the common drivers that perpetuate destructive relations. Drawing from the Frankfurt School, capital's ethos and domination ideology are examined as interlinked drivers of current human-animal relations. While new policies to address animal agriculture and biodiversity loss are critically needed, a more transformative response relies on addressing these underlying drivers.

AB Plant interactions with other organisms are mediated by chemistry, yet chemistry varies among conspecific and within individual plants. The foliar metabolome-the suite of small-molecule metabolites found in the leaf-changes during leaf ontogeny and is influenced by the signaling molecule jasmonic acid. Species differences in secondary metabolites are thought to play an important ecological role by limiting the host ranges of herbivores and pathogens, and hence facilitating competitive coexistence among plant species in species-rich plant communities such as tropical forests. Yet it remains unclear how inducible and ontogenetic variation compare with interspecific variation, particularly in tropical trees. Here, we take advantage of novel methods to assemble mass spectra of all compounds in leaf extracts into molecular networks that quantify their chemical structural similarity in order to compare inducible and ontogenetic chemical variation to among-species variation in species-rich tropical tree genera. We ask (i) whether young and mature leaves differ chemically, (ii) whether jasmonic acid-inducible chemical variation differs between young and mature leaves, and (iii) whether interspecific exceeds intraspecific chemical variation for four species from four hyperdiverse tropical tree genera. We observed significant effects of the jasmonic acid treatment for three of eight combinations of species and ontogenetic stage evaluated. Three of the four species also exhibited large metabolomic differences with leaf ontogenetic stage. The profound effect of leaf ontogenetic stage on the foliar metabolome suggests a qualitative turnover in secondary chemistry with leaf ontogeny. We also quantified foliar metabolomes for 45 congeners of the four focal species. Chemical similarity was much greater within than between species for all four genera, even when within-species comparisons included leaves that differed in age and jasmonic acid treatment. Despite ontogenetic and inducible variation within species, chemical differences among congeneric species may be sufficient to partition niche space with respect to chemical defense.

AB Niche-based theories and the neutral theory of biodiversity differ in their predictions of how the species composition of natural communities will respond to changes in nutrient availability. This is an issue of major environmental relevance, as many ecosystems have experienced changes in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) due to anthropogenic manipulation of nutrient loading. To understand how changes in N and P limitation may impact community structure, we conducted laboratory competition experiments using a multispecies phytoplankton community sampled from the North Sea. Results showed that picocyanobacteria (Cyanobium sp.) won the competition under N limitation, while picocyanobacteria and nonmotile nanophytoplankton (Nannochloropsis sp.) coexisted at equal abundances under P limitation. Additional experiments using isolated monocultures confirmed that Cyanobium sp. depleted N to lower levels than Nannochloropsis sp., but that both species had nearly identical P requirements, suggesting a potential for neutral coexistence under P-limited conditions. Pairwise competition experiments with the two isolates seemed to support the consistency of these results, but P limitation resulted in stable species coexistence irrespective of the initial conditions rather than the random drift of species abundances predicted by neutral theory. Comparison of the light absorption spectra indicates that coexistence of the two species was stabilized through differential use of the underwater light spectrum. Our results provide an interesting experimental example of modern coexistence theory, where species were equal competitors in one niche dimension but their competitive traits differed in other niche dimensions, thus enabling stable species coexistence on a single limiting nutrient through niche differentiation in the light spectrum.

AB Hunting presents a paradox for biodiversity conservation. It is both a problem and a solution to species declines and poverty. Yet, conservation scientists hold different assumptions about the significance and sustainability of hunting based on the cultures and identities of hunters. In Latin America, conservationists largely sort hunters as either indigenous or campesino. Indigenous hunters are often characterized as culturally driven stewards of wildlife sustainability. Campesino hunters, by contrast, are described as peasants-cultureless, uneducated, and uncaring toward wildlife sustainability. Although such ethnically fueled hunting discourse promotes hunting research, campesino hunters remain underrepresented in most comparative hunting reviews. Moreover, there are no targeted syntheses on the current state of knowledge about campesino hunting, nothing to guide conservation research and practice with and for the largest group of hunters in Latin America. We reviewed 334 articles published from 1937 to 2018 in English (55%) and Spanish (45%)-mostly published in 145 peer-reviewed journals-on the meanings, motivations, and sustainability of campesino hunting in Latin America. Although studies spanned 17 countries, 7 ecosystems, and >75 indigenous and nonindigenous demographics in 30 research contexts, they predominantly focused on nonindigenous campesinos for species-specific conservation and protected area management in tropical broadleaf forests of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. Authors used 12 methods to collect campesino hunting data, primarily interviews, surveys, and questionnaires, and drew from 10 local and traditional knowledge themes about wildlife trends and uses. Eighteen drivers, 14 constraints, and 10 conflicts-mainly subsistence, income, ethics, regulations, and crop or livestock protection-shaped whether campesino hunters pursued 799 species, 70% of which were least concern species. Yet, only 25 studies (8%) empirically assessed sustainability. Our results show the need for increased interdisciplinary and geographic engagement with campesino hunting across Latin America.

AB Understory plants are an important component of the high plant species diversity characteristic of neotropical rain forests. Herbs, shrubs, understory trees, and saplings of canopy trees occupy a broadly uniform environment of abundant rainfall, low light levels, and high humidity. We asked whether this community at the La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica was structured by environmental filters such as soil origin, topographic position, and understory light availability. We used nested quadrats to assess effects of soil origin (recent alluvium, weathered alluvium, residual volcanic soil) and topographic position (ridges, mid-slopes and flats) on species composition, density, and diversity and measured six edaphic and understory light parameters. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations were based on frequency of occurrence in 20 quadrats for 272 species in the shrub size class and 136 species in the small-tree size class for 17 sites. Three axes were correlated with composite environmental variables produced by principal component analysis representing slope, extractable phosphorus, and light. NMS site positions also reflected soil origin, topographic position, and geographic location. The analyses illustrated a complex community structured by species responses to environmental filters at multiple, interdigitated spatial scales. We suggest that light availability affected by canopy dynamics and dispersal limitation provides additional sources of variation in species distributions, which interact with edaphic patterns in complex ways. in Spanish is available with online material.

AB Aim Tall and structurally complex forests can provide ample habitat and niche space for climbing plants, supporting high liana species richness. We test to what extent canopy height (as a proxy of 3-D habitat structure), climate and soil interact to determine species richness in the largest clade of Neotropical lianas. We expect that the effect of canopy height on species richness is higher for lianas from closed tropical rain forests compared to riparian and savanna habitats. Location Neotropics. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae). Methods We used structural equation models to evaluate direct and indirect effects of canopy height, climate (temperature, precipitation and precipitation seasonality), and soil (cation exchange capacity and soil types) on overall Bignonieae species richness (339 liana species), as well as on species richness of lianas from forest, riparian and savanna habitats, respectively. We further performed multiple regression models with Moran's eigenvector maps to account for spatial autocorrelation. Results Canopy height was a key driver of liana species richness, in addition to climate and soil. Species richness of forest lianas showed a strong positive relationship with canopy height whereas the relationship was less pronounced for riparian species. Richness of savanna species decreased with increasing canopy height. Climate also explained a substantial proportion of variation in liana species richness whereas soil variables showed little explanatory power. Main conclusions The relationship between canopy height and liana species richness differs among habitats. While forest and riparian lianas benefit from tall and complex habitats that provide physical support to reach the canopy to escape low light availability in the understorey, high light availability in open habitats and an increased risk of embolism of conductive vessels for lianas with long stems living in areas with high seasonality might explain the inverse relationship between species richness and canopy height in savannas.

AB Millions of people are dependent on tropical forests for livelihood. However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD + ) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships.
   Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments.
   To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to reimagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation.

AB Universal features of ecological processes have mathematical properties that are naturally nonlinear and intricate, hitherto oftentimes approximated only by mathematical equations. We aimed to evaluate via mathematical modeling different scenarios of productivity and frugivory of Acca sellowiana (Feijoa) by vertebrates in the highlands of the subtropical Atlantic Forest. In doing so, based on an empirical baseline of mutualistic interactions, we simulated defaunation, species reintroduction and variations in resource production to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of interactions within the network. We utilized empirical data of interactions obtained via camera traps from 2015 to 2016. We performed frugivory simulations based on the use of predator-prey models with the addition of exponential, logistical and structured growth. We evaluated 13 deterministic and stochastic models of frugivory and numerically compared the fruits removal rates among the models and empirical data. We conducted a weighted network formality analysis evaluating the general topology of networks, and a niche overlaps analysis of each scenario, to understand the variation in resource-sharing dynamics. Our results showed that vertebrates underexploited the potential of Feijoa as a subjacent resource, showing that the available fruits exceed the demand of local biota. The network robustness can be significantly changed by species loss or by rewilding. However, in all scenarios, resource-sharing is less than expected. The hypothetical removal by frugivores promote non-random negative effects in the potential seed dispersal process, whereas the increase of frugivores that may improve the reproductive success of Feijoa. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of different scenarios of frugivory and to provide contributions to increase understanding of the relationship between fruit-eating and fleshy-fruited plants. Our results can be used as a proxy for conservation and management plans to predict ecological dynamics applying a species interaction perspective. Moreover, can be used to resources and landscapes management, especially in a region under an overwhelming contemporary defaunation process.

AB Questions What are the primary types of intraspecific distribution patterns and interspecific associations of tree species in the temperate-subtropical transition region? Can potential ecological mechanisms such as habitat heterogeneity, dispersal limitation, density dependence, spatial segregation, and competition between species regulate these patterns? Location The Qinling Mountains, north-central China. Methods Ripley's K-function, D-function and pair correlation function were applied to assess the spatial distribution of 15 dominant tree species in a fully mapped 25-ha plot. Complete spatial randomness (CSR), heterogeneous Poisson (HP) and random-labelling (RL) null models were used to reveal the potential process of community construction. Results (a) Thirteen of 15 adult tree species displayed an aggregation distribution at various scales. (b) Eleven adult species (73.3%) showed significant aggregation, especially at small distances, after removing the effect of habitat. (c) The percentage of species showing additional aggregation relative to adults decreased from saplings to juveniles. The maximum strength of density dependence was negative with species abundance. (d) Only 29 (13.8%) of the species pairs showed significant small-scale interactions. Most of the significant small-scale associations did not occur in abundant species pairs. (e) Negative interactions of interspecific associations were more prevalent than positive ones, yet there was no consistency of the characteristics among species pairs. Conclusions Habitat heterogeneity and dispersal limitation likely contribute to the spatial pattern of tree species at different life stages. Density dependence remains the important factor in maintaining species diversity in this forest stand. Moreover, spatial segregation generates the interspecific spatial patterns of segregation and partial overlap. Unexpectedly, the species herd protection hypothesis and the low-frequency hypothesis cannot well explain the mechanism of interspecific interaction at small distances. Resource competition might be responsible for negative associations being more frequent among species pairs.

AB Premise Understanding plant hydraulic functioning and water balance during drought has become key in predicting species survival and recovery. However, there are few insightful studies that couple physiological and morphological attributes for many ecosystems, such as the vulnerable Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCF). In this study, we evaluated drought resistance and recovery for saplings for five tree species spanning deciduous to evergreen habits from a Mexican TMCF. Methods In drought simulations, water was withheld until plants reached species-specific P-50 or P-88 values (pressures required to induce a 50 or 88% loss in hydraulic conductivity), then they were rewatered. Drought resistance was considered within the isohydric-anisohydric framework and compared to leaf gas exchange, water status, pressure-volume curves, specific leaf area, and stomatal density. Results The TMCF species closed stomata well before significant losses in hydraulic conductivity (isohydric). Yet, despite the coordination of these traits, the traits were not useful for predicting the time needed for the species to reach critical hydraulic thresholds. Instead, maximum photosynthetic rates explained these times, reinforcing the linkage between hydraulic and carbon dynamics. Despite their varying hydraulic conductivities, stomatal responses, and times to hydraulic thresholds, 58 of the 60 study plants recovered after the rewatering. The recovery of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance can be explained by the P-50 values and isohydry. Conclusions This study raises new questions surrounding drought management strategies, recovery processes, and how lethal thresholds are defined. Further studies need to consider the role of water and carbon balance in allowing for both survival and recovery from drought.

AB Discussions of defaunation and taxon substitution have concentrated on megafaunal herbivores and carnivores, but mainly overlooked the particular ecological importance of megafaunal omnivores. In particular, the Homo spp. have been almost completely ignored in this context, despite the extinction of all but one hominin species present since the Plio-Pleistocene. Large omnivores have a particular set of ecological functions reflecting their foraging flexibility and the varied disturbances they create, functions that may maintain ecosystem stability and resilience. Here, we put the ecology of Homo sapiens in the context of comparative interspecific ecological roles and impacts, focusing on the large omnivore guild, as well as comparative intraspecific variation, focusing on hunter-gatherers. We provide an overview of the functional traits of H. sapiens, which can be used to spontaneously provide the functions for currently ecologically extinct or endangered ecosystem processes. We consider the negative impacts of variations in H. sapiens phenotypic strategies, its possible status as an invasive species, and the potential to take advantage of its learning capacities to decouple negative and positive impacts. We provide examples of how practices related to foraging, transhumance, and hunting could contribute to rewilding-inspired programs either drawing on hunter-gatherer baselines of H. sapiens, or as proxies for extinct or threatened large omnivores. We propose that a greater focus on intraspecific ecological variation and interspecific comparative ecology of H. sapiens can provide new avenues for conservation and ecological research.

AB Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the island species-area relationship (ISAR), including the passive sampling effect, the habitat diversity effect, ecological drift and a group of mechanisms jointly termed environmental filtering (or abiotic selection process). However, determining which of these hypotheses underpins the ISAR in a given system remains an open and controversial question, particularly with regards to the environmental filtering. The effect of environmental filtering on the ISAR for woody plants was tested on 29 islands in a subtropical land-bridge archipelago. Island area had a significant effect on species richness, while isolation was not found to have an effect. After controlling for the passive sampling effect and habitat diversity using a systematic sampling design, we found that a positive ISAR remained. After controlling for island area and isolation, species richness was significantly affected by environmental conditions (e.g. total phosphorus, soil depth and bulk density). When a null model was used that randomly assigned individuals to islands from the regional pool, the difference between the observed and expected richness was greater for smaller islands relative to larger islands. Synthesis. Our results point to an overlooked role of environmental filtering in driving the island species-area relationship (ISAR). Consequently, our study highlights the importance of considering deterministic process in future analyses of the ISAR.

AB Automated analysis of acoustic communities is a rapidly emerging approach for the characterization and monitoring of biodiversity. To evaluate its utility, we should verify that such 'bioacoustics' can accurately detect ecological signal in spatiotemporal acoustic data. Targeting the 'Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project' sites in Brazil, we ask: What is the relative contribution of the spatial, temporal and habitat dimension to variation in bird acoustic communities in a previously fragmented tropical rainforest? Does the functional diversity of bird communities scale similarly to space and time as does species diversity, when both are recorded by bioacoustics means? Overall, is the imprint of landscape fragmentation 30 years ago still audible in the present-day soundscape? We sampled forty-four sites in secondary forest and 107 sites in old-growth forest, resulting in 11 000 h of audio recordings. We detected 60 bird species with satisfactory precision and recovered a linear log-log relation between sampling time and species diversity. Sites in primary forest host more species than sites in secondary forest, but the difference decreased with sampling time, as the slope was slightly higher in secondary than primary forests. Functional diversity, as exposed by vocalizing birds, accumulates faster than does species diversity. The similarity among local communities decreases with distance in both time and space, but stability in time is remarkably high: two acoustic samples from the same site one year (or more) apart prove more similar than two samples taken at the same time but from sites situated just a few hundred meters apart. These findings suggest that habitat modification can be heard as a long-lasting imprint on the soundscape of regenerating habitats and identify soundscape-area and soundscape-time relations as a promising tool for biodiversity research, applied biomonitoring and restoration ecology.

AB Differences in the patterns of microhabitat use by small mammals have been largely related to the coexistence process of the species. The present study analyses how the marsupial Marmosops incanus and the rodent Rhipidomys mastacalis use the microhabitat in a areas of arboreal restinga in the Brazilian north-east. Through capture-marking-recapture, sampling was performed monthly from September 2017 to August 2018 using Sherman traps and pitfall. Six microhabitat variables were measured at all capture stations. The use of vertical strata (ground and understory) was compared using a chi-square test, and associations of species abundances with microhabitat characteristics were explored using redundancy analysis. The results indicate that the species use the vertical strata at different frequencies, with R. mastacalis found exclusively in the understory and M. incanus found more in the understory than in the ground. The variation in the abundance of the species was associated with the density of the understory, with an increase in M. incanus abundance and a decrease in R. mastacalis. Differences in the patterns found for these species in other environments indicate plasticity in relation to the use of vertical strata and the approaches used suggest that the differential use of the arboreal stratum can be a facilitator in the process of coexistence in areas of restinga. in Portuguese is available with online material.

AB Acanthopsis is a genus endemic to southern Namibia and southwestern South Africa. Until recently the taxonomy of the group was poorly understood. As a result of a new taxonomic framework (recognising 20 species), the risk of extinction of each taxon could be reassessed and updated. This contribution presents an overview of the distribution and conservation status of the species, as well as the patterns and possible processes involved in the phytogeography of the genus. Specimen localities for all examined specimens were georeferenced and these values were used for mapping and conservation assessments. Phylogenetic relationships within Acanthopsis were studied by using sequence data from the following six gene regions: nrITS, matK, rbcL, rps16, rpl32-trnL and trnS-trnG-trnG. The group appears to have diversified in the arid mountainous semi-desert of the Richtersveld, Northern Cape, South Africa, with the vast majority (96%) of Acanthopsis taxa endemic or near-endemic to the Succulent Karoo Region (more or less congruent with the Succulent Karoo Biome). Twenty of the 23 taxa are range-restricted and have an Extent of Occurrence <= 10000 km(2), with at least eight of these known from only one or two subpopulations each. Fourteen (61%) of the taxa are Red Listed as Least Concern, while 39% are Red Listed as Threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered)-mainly as a result of habitat loss due to overgrazing and trampling by domestic livestock. Although the distribution ranges of most members of Acanthopsis coincide with protected areas, the effectiveness of conservation in these regions is questionable as some protected areas are prone to overgrazing and trampling by domestic livestock. The lack of phylogenetic resolution, complex taxonomy and the high numbers of range-restricted and habitat-specific species implies recent speciation in Acanthopsis due to topography, ecological gradients and climatic conditions prevailing in the arid northwestern parts of South Africa's Northern Cape and adjacent arid parts of southern Namibia.

AB Worldwide, most tree cover loss studies are focused on quantifying it by means of remote sensing techniques. These studies frequently omit land use and vegetation classes, thus, the information of loss occurring for each of the land use vegetation types that exists in a region is limited. In order to identify which plant communities have been most affected by the tree cover loss process in the period 2000 - 2016 within the Usumacinta basin, in this study, two sources of information were analyzed simultaneously, namely: the series II of land use and vegetation of the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico (Inegi) and the results from the evaluation of change in tree cover at the global scale made by Hansen et al. (2013). The results indicate that of the 347 317.68 ha of tree cover lost between 2000 and 2016 in the basin, 62% corresponds to three categories: the tropical rain forest (26%), one of the most biodiverse vegetation types in the country, secondary vegetation derived from tropical rain forest (19.1%) and the cultivated grassland (17%), a class strongly affected by anthropogenic activities. Most of the rain forest loss was concentrated on the medium part of the basin, while most of the grassland loss was located in the lower region. Conversely, the vegetation classes with less tree cover loss were also the least represented on the surface in the basin. The results derived from this work will serve to identify the most threatened systems and guide conservation actions in the region.

AB Large frugivores provide critical seed dispersal services for many plant species and their extirpation from forested ecosystems can cause compositional shifts in regenerating plant cohorts. Yet, we still poorly understand whether large seed-dispersers have complementary or redundant roles for forest regeneration. Here, to assess the functional complementarity of large-bodied frugivores in forest regeneration, we quantified the effects of varying abundance of hornbills, primates and the forest elephant on the density, species richness and the mean weighted seed length of animal-dispersed tree species among seedlings in five sites in a forest-savanna mosaic in D. R. Congo, while accounting for percentage forest cover and the local presence of fruiting trees. We found that the abundance of primates was positively associated with species richness of seedlings, while percentage forest cover was negatively associated (R-2 = 0.19). The abundance of hornbills, the presence of elephants and percentage forest cover were positively associated with mean seed length of the regenerating cohort (R-2 = 0.13). Spatially explicit analysis indicated that some additional processes have an important influence on these response indices. Primates would seem to have a preponderant role for maintaining relatively high species richness, while hornbills and elephant would seem to be predominantly responsible for the recruitment of large-seeded trees. Our results could indicate that these taxa of frugivores play complementary functional roles for forest regeneration. This suggests that the extirpation of one or more of these dispersers would likely not be functionally compensated for by the remaining taxa, hence possibly cascading into compositional shifts.

AB The present paper provides an updated checklist of the ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) of Pakistan. These include seven of the 21 known extant subfamilies with 103 valid ant species in 35 genera. Five species are reported for the first time from Pakistan: Cardiocondyla wroughtonii Forel, 1890; Crematogaster biroi Mayr, 1897; Ooceraea biroi (Forel, 1907); Pseudoneoponera rufipes Jerdon, 1851 and Strumigenys godeffroyi Mayr, 1866. Images to scientifically validate new faunal records from Pakistan and facilitate prompt identification are provided. Among the newly recorded species, three species viz., C. wroughtonii; O. biroi and S. godeffroyi are considered as tramp species having the cosmopolitan distribution. Notes about type localities, depositories and distribution in Pakistan are provided to each species record. The list provides a synthesis of the regional taxonomical work carried out until now and will serve as a baseline survey for future studies.

AB This paper analyzes the spatial distribution of environmental infractions (Els) in the "Nixleo Caraguatatuba" (NuCar) division of the Serra do Mar State Park (PESM in Portuguese) in Brazil. This region, NuCar, of the PESM is a protected area with potential for economic and tourism development. Between 2000 and 2016, 117 environmental infractions were registered according to three sources of data: (1) Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, (2) Forestry Foundation database, and (3) DataGeo, a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) combining environmental and socioeconomic database spatial/environmental data for the state of Sao Paulo. The three most common violations were deforestation, irregular occupation, and heart of palm extraction. Geospatial analysis of the data focused on the main roads and trails and different zones defined by the Park Management Plan corresponded to these areas of increased access. As well as suggestions for increased control and surveillance of cluster areas to restrict opportunities for EIs, this paper also discusses other aspects of management that influence the number of violations in protected areas. These include open, respectful communication between residents and park management to reduce conflict and enacting the socio-environmental park program and the PESM management.

AB Over the last century, climate change has impacted the physiology, distribution, and phenology of marine and terrestrial primary producers worldwide. The study of these fluctuations has been hindered due to the complex response of plants to environmental forcing over large spatial and temporal scales. To bridge this gap, we investigated the synchrony in seasonal phenological activity between marine and terrestrial primary producers to environmental and climatic variability across northern Patagonia. We disentangled the effects on the biological activity of local processes using advanced time-frequency analysis and partial wavelet coherence on 15 years (2003-2017) of data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and global climatic variability using large-scale climate indices. Our results show that periodic variations in both coastal ocean and land productivity are associated with sea surface temperature forcing over seasonal scales and with climatic forcing over multi-annual (2-4 years) modes. These complex relationships indicate that large-scale climatic processes primarily modulate the synchronous phenological seasonal activity across northern Patagonia, which makes these unique ecosystems highly exposed to future climatic change.

AB We applied niche overlap indices to for the first time show possible correlational occurrences among 40 non-marine ostracod taxa from seven aquatic habitats (lakes, creeks, ponds, springs, ditches, pools, troughs) in Turkey. Ecological tolerance and optimum estimates of each species were calculated and compared to explain possible reasons for habitat utilization. Eleven species were found suitable for the application of these indices. Overlap ranges of five of the species were found suitable for five variables (pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, electrical conductivity, and elevation; P < 0.05). Heterocypris incongruens (Ramdohr, 1808) and H. salina (Brady, 1868) were the only two species with common overlap for all the five variables. These two species generally showed common resource-utilization curves for each of these variables along with relatively similar tolerance ranges. Complete overlap was only possible for some cosmoecious species when they displayed wide-tolerance ranges and low optimum estimates for different environmental variables. Results suggest that cosmopolitan species do not only have wide geographical distributions but tolerance ranges higher than other species. Such wide tolerance ranges seem to help species coinhabit with each other and elevate their co-occurrence probabilities in different types of habitats. Applying the first usage of overlap indices on ostracods and attempting to show the relationship between niche overlap and species ecological tolerance could nevertheless provide a new tool to apply in future studies.

AB In recent decades vast areas of Bornean rainforest have been converted to monocultures, particularly to oil palm. This study describes and compares the diversity and persistence of small mammal species in fragmented forests within an oil palm plantation. Small mammals were trapped over 44 sampling days using mist-nets, harp traps, and cage traps. A total of 39 species of small mammals were trapped, represented by 22 volant (bats) and 17 non-volant species. These species were represented by 29, 15 and 26 species, and controlling for sampling effort by rarefaction, 19, 15 and 14 species of small mammals in high conservation value (HCV) forests, forest edge, and in oil palm plantation, respectively. Species diversity was greatest in the HCV forests (H' = 2.22), followed by oil palm plantation (H' = 1.11), and then edge (H' = 1.07). The smaller HCV forest (116 ha vs. 990 ha) contained more species than the larger forest (25 vs. 17 species). We attribute this to differences in species relaxation rates and the possibility that species density compensation has occurred in the smaller forest. This study demonstrates the conservation value of small forest fragments in oil palm plantations to maintaining native species diversity and the ecosystem services they provide.

AB Both biological and stochastic processes can account for the correlation between dominance and species richness in plant communities. We compared plant communities of different types with simulated cenoses composed of species with random values of relative abundance in order to identify the cause of the correlation. The results showed that the communities exposed to stress factors and/or frequent disturbances (trampling, grazing, and the deficit of heat, water, light, or other resources) were characterized by low or moderate correlation between the degree of dominance and species richness and stochastic processes could account for the correlation in this case, whereas the communities from relatively favorable habitats (grasslands and wastelands) showed moderate or strong correlation, which could not be explained by stochastic processes alone. We suggested that the correlation was due to biological factors, among others.

AB Nacella magellanica is an edible limpet that has been consumed since pre-Hispanic times by human populations along the coasts of Patagonia, but studies of its nutritional value and reproduction are not yet available. We investigated the reproductive cycle and the seasonal variation in the nutritional composition (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) of the whole body of this limpet in order to analyse some aspects of its importance as a formal fishery resource. Throughout a single year, the spawning period extended over all months except June in males, while females spawned from late winter to spring, with an increase from August to November. The nutritional data obtained for N. magellanica are within the ranges of widely consumed species of molluscs, with annual average values of 29.8% proteins, 2.7% lipids and 1.8% carbohydrates. The best nutritional values for human consumption (highest concentration of proteins, body weight), avoiding the reproductive period, were found in April but taking into account the minimum size of capture. Our results are useful for increasing the policies aimed at managing this abundant edible limpet as a formal resource, since it is widely consumed in southern South America.

AB Broadleaf-Korean pine forests exhibit high species richness and distinctive species composition, which are currently becoming more dominant among natural forests in Changbai Mountains of north-eastern China. Understanding the ecological process of restored vegetation is quite important for ecosystem reconstruction. Distinguishing stand development stages and analyzing the dynamic spatial patterns could provide insights into significant community coexistence mechanisms. In the present study, eight permanent study areas were established according to the substituting space for time method in Changbai Mountains of north-eastern China. The optimal division method was used to quantify the successional series into different stand development stages, and the point pattern analysis method (L(r) function) was used to analyse the dynamic changes in spatial patterns and interspecific associations. Our results suggested that: (1) The stand development process was divided into five stages: the first three stages were poplar-birch secondary forests in different stages of recovery, the fourth stage was the spruce-fir mixed forest, and the last stage was the primary broadleaf-Korean pine forest; (2) The spatial pattern showed an aggregated distribution at a small scale and changed to a random distribution as the scale increased in poplar-birch secondary forests, but the spatial pattern appeared to be randomly distributed in spruce-fir mixed forest and broadleaf-Korean pine forest; (3) The interspecific associations between pioneer species and climax species changed from negative to positive among the different stand stages, and environmental resources were shared among these species. Interspecific differences in shade tolerance among the tree species were key determinants of forest dynamics and structure. Our study is vital to the understanding of the forest development; thus, the spatial change features should receive greater attention when forest management is being planned and restoration strategies are being developed for the Changbai Mountains.

AB Defining the reference system for restoration projects in regions characterized by complex vegetation mosaics is challenging. Here we use the Cerrado region of Brazil as an example of the importance of clearly defining multiple natural and anthropogenically altered states in grassland-savanna-forest mosaics. We define three main, natural vegetation types-grassland, savanna, and scleromorphic (cerradao) forest-to (1) distinguish between original and degraded states and (2) set appropriate targets for and guide restoration. We contend that the differences in Cerrado vegetation composition originally were driven by soil conditions and secondarily by fire frequency and precipitation patterns that differ from the core to the edge of the Cerrado region. Grasslands are found on the shallowest, least fertile soils and/or in waterlogged soils; scleromorphic forests are generally located on deeper, more fertile soils; and savannas occupy an intermediate position. In recent decades, this biophysical template has been overlain by a range of human land-use intensities that strongly affect resilience, resulting in alternative anthropogenic states. For example, areas that were originally scleromorphic forest are likely to regenerate naturally following low- or medium-intensity land use due to extensive resprouting of woody plants, whereas grassland restoration requires reintroduction of grass and forb species that do not tolerate soil disturbance and exotic grass competition. Planting trees into historic grasslands results in inappropriate restoration targets and often restoration failure. Correctly identifying original vegetation types is critical to most effectively allocate scarce restoration funding.

AB The increasing anthropogenic pressure on Eastern Amazon makes imperative the diagnosis of forest degradation, particularly the effect on key communities within the riparian ecosystems, one of the last remaining Amazonian forests in Maranhao State. The Formicidae family is abundant in these ecosystems, plays a fundamental role in soil functions and is also considered a good indicator of land use changes. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the impact of riparian forest successional stages on the Formicidae richness, frequency, and composition. Sampling was performed during both dry and wet seasons using the TSBF method. Collected organisms were identified as morphospecies. Also, species-accumulation curves were created. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of seasonal, local, and successional stage on ant richness and frequency. Polynomial regression models were applied to investigate the relationship between ant richness and frequency with canopy cover and vegetation height. Lastly, the species composition was represented by the Jaccard similarity index. In total, we observed 1 940 individuals grouped into 86 morphospecies. We obtained more than 80 % of the probable species richness. Ant frequency and richness increased significantly, following the successional stage, with low values in the open areas, especially during the dry season. Canopy cover and vegetation height seemed to affect partially both Formicidae richness and frequency during the dry season. Intermediate and advanced successional areas presented similar species composition (with 50-shared species), followed by the areas of early succession (43) and anthropic use (34). We concluded that the elimination of riparian forests produces a considerable effect on the richness and frequency of the Formicidae family, mainly affecting them in open areas during the dry season, thus resulting in losses of 41 % in richness and 56 % in frequency in forest areas when they were transformed into agricultural systems. Nevertheless, succession restores forest structure and functions, thus favoring re-colonization of ant species. Formicidae reflects forest degradation and is a key group in monitoring programs for the conservation/restoration of local riparian forests.

AB 1. Epimicrobial communities on seaweed surfaces usually contain not only potentially pathogenic but also potentially beneficial micro-organisms. Capacity of terrestrial plants for chemically mediated recruitment, that is, "gardening" of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere was recently demonstrated. Empirical evidence directly linking such chemical "gardening" with the beneficial role of gardened microbes in terrestrial plants is rare and largely missing for aquatic macrophytes.
   2. Here, we demonstrate that our model invasive seaweed holobiont Agarophyton vermiculophyllum possesses beneficial microbiota on its surface that provide protection from bacterial pathogens. Metabolites from the algal holobiont's surface reduced settlement of opportunistic pathogens but attracted protective epibacterial settlement.
   3. We tested 58 different bacterial species (isolated from the surface of A. vermiculophyllum) individually in tip bleaching assays. Kordia algicida was identified as a "significant pathogen" inducing a bleaching disease. In addition, nine other species significantly reduced the risk of algal bleaching and were thus "significantly protective". Additionally, two "potential pathogens" and 10 "potential protectors" were identified. When 19 significant and potential protectors and 3 significant and potential pathogens were tested together, the protective strains fully prevented bleaching, suggesting that a component of A. vermiculophyllum's epimicrobiome provides an associational defence against pathogens. Chemically mediated selective recruitment of microbes was demonstrated in bioassays, where A. vermiculophyllum surface metabolites attracted the settlement of protective strains, but reduced settlement of pathogens.
   4. Synthesis. The capacity of an aquatic macrophyte to chemically "garden" protective micro-organisms to the benefit of strengthened disease resistance is demonstrated for the first time. Such a role of surface chemistry in "gardening" of microbes as found in the current study could also be applicable to other host plant-microbe interactions. Our results may open new avenues towards manipulation of the surface microbiome of seaweeds via chemical "gardening," enhancing sustainable production of healthy seaweeds.

AB Agricultural land uses can contribute to land degradation, water quality decline, and loss of ecosystem function and biodiversity in the surrounding catchment. Trees can assist in catchment management, and re-afforestation strategies have been implemented in an effort to mitigate agricultural impacts and improve degraded land and waterways worldwide. Re-afforestation strategies often target private land, and their success relies on landholder participation. Landholders' decisions about land-use allocation are driven primarily by the private financial costs and benefits associated with different farming strategies. This research assesses the private on-farm financial impact and the public environmental benefit of land use transition from beef grazing to a mixed beef grazing-forestry system in the Richmond River catchment on the east coast of Australia. GIS analysis identified more than 30% of the catchment as beef grazing land potentially available for re-afforestation, across a variety of soil types and geomorphic characteristics. We used a farm-scale financial model to assess the costs and benefits associated with transition from grazing to a variety of cattle-forestry mixtures that were determined on the basis of their suitability to soil type and slope in different parts of a catchment. We also used a multi-criteria approach to assess the environmental outcomes associated with each transition. The results demonstrate that diversification to a mixed beef grazing-forestry system consistently provides environmental benefit, but the financial impact on landholders varies depending on soil type. Landholders on ferrosol and vertosol soils in this catchment have favourable options that can simultaneously deliver private and public benefits, whereas landholders on kurosol and dermosol soils are more restricted, with environmental improvements possible only as a trade-off with farm financial performance. Based on these results, we suggest that different policy mechanisms are required to encourage graziers in different parts of the catchment to shift towards mixed cattle-forestry systems.

AB The study of diversity has become increasingly sophisticated, including the use of measures of phylogenetic diversity. We calculate the spatial variation in species richness, taxonomic beta diversity, and alpha and beta phylogenetic diversity (PD alpha and PD beta, respectively) of Atlantic Forest harvestman communities using a data set containing 556 species from 68 sites, distributed in 12 Brazilian states. We compare the congruence of phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity patterns, and also compare PD alpha with null model expectations, to check for phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion in communities. Species richness and PD alpha are correlated, peaking in southern and south-eastern coastal sites and decreasing towards the interior and towards the north-east. PD alpha in north-eastern sites was higher than expected, while a clustered phylogenetic pattern characterised most other sites. Communities in the southern and south-eastern regions were dominated by species from the large family Gonyleptidae, presenting a high richness and a low PD alpha. As the dominance of Gonyleptidae decreased towards the north, where local communities have fewer species, but a higher PD alpha, they contain representatives of other families. The beta diversity was more sensitive to the compositional changes involving closely related Gonyleptidae species, while PD beta is more influenced by deeper phylogenetic compositional changes, between more distant lineages. Phylogenetic diversity may be of special importance to assess the conservation value of distantly related lineages. These species-poor groups are less likely to influence taxonomic-based diversity analyses, but their importance for conservation arises from their phylogenetic distinctiveness, captured by PD alpha and PD beta measures.

AB Cariniana legalis and C. estrellensis are tropical emergent trees of the Lecythidaceae family that occur naturally in different forest ecosystems and belong to different ecological groups. With the aim of providing information to better manage these two congeneric Cariniana species in secondary forest enrichment plantations, an experiment was conducted using potted plants for comparing the physiological and growth responses of young C. legalis and C. estrellensis plants under contrasting light radiation availabilities. Considering that these two congeneric species occur naturally in different forest ecosystems and belong to different ecological groups, we tested the hypothesis that young plants of C. legalis have more plastic responses of photosynthetic light response curves, anthocyanin content, growth and biomass allocation to contrasting light environments than C. estrellensis. Plants were grown for 105 days under three light conditions (26, 10 and 1 mol photons m(-2) day(-1)), simulating the daily total photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in large and small canopy gaps and in the forest understory, respectively. The photosynthetic responses to contrasting light availabilities were very similar for both species. Higher values for anthocyanin reflectance index (ARI), leaf mass per area (LMA), and changes in biomass allocation indicate that C. legalis has a greater capacity for acclimation to contrasting light environments than did C. estrellensis. In addition, a greater number of smaller leaves in C. legalis could be an advantage in the understory of forests subjected to constant changes in canopy openness through the opening and closing of small- and medium-sized canopy gaps. From a practical point of view, seedlings of C. estrellensis should be planted in more open forests with less dynamic changes in canopy gaps, and seedlings of C. legalis should be planted in forests with more fluctuations in the opening and closing of small and large canopy gaps.

AB Argylia radiata is an herbaceous perennial with substantial potential as an ornamental plant. This is a native plant from the Atacama Desert, it can be found in the north of Chile and the south of Peru. This species is part of the "Flowering Desert", which is an unpredictable phenomenon, associated with unusual winter rainfalls that allow the massive blooming of the Chilean Desert. While most plants in family Bignoniaceae are originally from tropical and subtropical areas, A. radiata lives in very harsh conditions, with average precipitation of around 12 mm per year, a maximum of 34 degrees C in summer, and a minimum of 2 degrees C in winter. This extreme habitat makes this species an interesting option to study for its morphological and anatomical adaptations, which have not been described in depth. In this work, optical and scanning electron microscopy of histological samples from different structures were used to describe the plant and to try to understand how A. radiata survives in the driest desert in the world.

AB Changes in land-cover driven by human activities is one of the main causes of disturbances on natural communities but the impact of this factor on scorpions assemblages remains scarcely know. Here we analyzed the scorpion fauna in five tropical forests and their respective neighboring non-natural matrix (planted forests or crops) in Brazil (n = 4) and Mexico (n = 1), aiming to understand how different species of scorpions respond to land-use changes. Scorpions were actively collected with the help of a UV flashlight. A total of 461 individuals were sampled, belonging to nine species and seven genera distributed in three families Buthidae, Bothriuridae and Diplocentridae. Differences in assemblages between environments were found, with higher gamma diversity in undisturbed environments where species showed the highest abundance. A higher species turnover was found in disturbed environments. Based on these results, we suggest a differential sensitive reaction to habitat alterations amongst scorpions species.

AB Microorganisms are strongly influenced by the bottom-up effects of resource supply. While many species respond to fluctuations in the concentration of resources, microbial diversity may also be affected by the heterogeneity of the resource pool, which often reflects a mixture of distinct molecules. To test this hypothesis, we examined resource-diversity relationships for bacterioplankton in a set of north temperate lakes that varied in their concentration and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is an important resource for heterotrophic bacteria. Using 16S rRNA transcript sequencing and ecosystem metabolomics, we documented strong relationships between bacterial alpha-diversity (richness and evenness) and the bulk concentration and the number of molecules in the DOM pool. Similarly, bacterial community beta-diversity was related to both DOM concentration and composition. However, in some lakes the relative abundance of resource generalists, which was inversely related to the DOM concentration, may have reduced the effect of DOM heterogeneity on community composition. Together, our results demonstrate the potential metabolic interactions between bacteria and organic matter and suggest that changes in organic matter composition may alter the structure and function of bacterial communities.

AB Savannahs are mixed woody-grass communities where low-intensity surface fires are common, affecting mostly the grass layer and rarely damaging trees. We investigated the effect of surface fires in a savannah system in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, on the backscatter of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) C-band Sentinel-1A images. Pre-fire and post-fire dual polarized (VH, VV) C-band backscatter values were examined for 30 burn events. For all events, a systematic backscatter decrease from pre-fire to post-fire conditions was observed, with mean backscatter decreases of 1.61 dB and 0.99 dB for VH and VV, respectively. A total of 90% and 75% of the burn events showed a decrease in VH and VV backscatter greater than 0.43 dB, the overall absolute radiometric of Sentinel-1A products. The VH data were, overall, 1.7 times more sensitive to surface fire effects than the VV data. C-band data are likely sensitive to a reduction in grass biomass typical of surface fires, as well as in grass/soil moisture levels. Early season fires had higher backscatter decreases due to greater early season moisture conditions. For region with more than 30% woody cover, the effect of fire on the C-band backscatter was reduced. Denser woody communities tend to produce lower grass fuel load and less intense surface fires, and limit the penetration of C-band microwaves to the ground where most savannah fires and associated effects occur. This research provides evidence that C-band space-borne SAR is sensitive to the effects of surface-level fires in southern African savannahs. The unique availability of frequent and spatially detailed C-band data from the Sentinel-1 SAR constellation provide new opportunities for burned area mapping and systematic monitoring in savannahs systems, for instance, for fine-scale fire propagation studies.

AB Aim Understanding the role of interspecific interactions in maintaining diversity, ecosystem function and evolutionary processes is a major challenge in ecology. Historically, antagonistic heterospecific interactions were the focus of many studies, but the importance of facilitative interactions has become increasingly apparent over recent decades. Ecological networks can provide insights into potential interactions among co-occurring heterospecifics. We compared the structures of temperate and tropical marine fish co-occurrence networks to estimate their resilience and/or robustness to perturbations. Location Western Australia. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Marine fishes. Methods We compared the structure of temperate and tropical marine fish communities through interspecific co-occurrences using joint species distribution modelling. Network analyses identified modules of co-occurring species and those which play a strong role in the organization of communities. Results In all study locations, most interspecific co-occurrences did not differ significantly from random, with positive co-occurrences being more prevalent than negative non-random co-occurrences. The modularity of networks created from interspecific co-occurrences tended to decrease poleward, with the opposite for species centrality. An increase in functional diversity among co-occurring species with latitude was detected. Species centrality was greatest among the temperate endemic species, with a positive association between species centrality and intrinsic vulnerability scores. Main conclusions The differences in community structure between tropical and temperate Western Australian marine fish communities might be attributable, in part, to differing evolutionary histories. The temperate endemic species have co-evolved in a relatively homogeneous abiotic and biotic environment, whereas the Indo-Pacific ichthyofauna have evolved in a diverse range of environments. The temperate communities are characterized by: (a) low functional redundancy among co-occurring species, with endemic species playing keystone roles in community structure; (b) attributes associated with increased vulnerability to perturbations; with (c) many of the species identified as potential keystone species having high intrinsic vulnerability scores and being targeted by fishers.

AB We determined the seasonal diet of the Andean fox Lycalopex culpaeus in three habitats in the Atacama Desert, northern Chile, by analyzing their scat contents. We estimated the biomass and the number of individuals of each prey species consumed and compared our results with those of other studies on Lycalopex foxes in Chile and South America. In general, the L. culpaeus diet was characterized by a generalist behavior and higher dietary breadth than those in other ecosystems. In contrast with the other biomes of southern Chile and South America, insects represented the most frequent prey species in the present study and the main food item, comprising more than 50% of all prey at the three study sites; however, in terms of biomass, rodent and reptile prey showed the highest percentage from summer to winter. Significant differences were found between the biomass consumed among sites. Likewise, we found a relationship between the niche breadth of the diet and the primary productivity of the sites. Statistically significant differences in prey items consumed were noted across seasons and sites located at different altitudes, which reflected an opportunistic response to the availability of prey. Our report contributes to current data about the natural history of L. culpaeus in hyper-arid habitats.

AB Climate change and biological invasions are two of the most cited factors that may affect species diversity in the coming decades. Here we used five climate scenarios to investigate the potential distribution of two invasive tree species, Acacia mangium and A. auriculiformis, in the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Additionally, we used expansion-contraction maps and maps of potential areas for forest restoration to investigate whether biological invasion could affect restoration efforts. We found A. mangium has a large suitable area in all scenarios (average 268,010.1 km(2) +/- 25,292.4 SD), while A auriculiformis is confined to a relatively small region (average 13,123.1 km(2) +/- 361.7 SD). In the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 2.6), the suitable area for A. mangium varied from the current scenario of 24.8% of the Atlantic Forest to 26.2% and 25.4% in the years 2050 and 2070, respectively. In the high greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP 8.5), the suitable area contracted to 23.1% and 20.5% in 2050 and 2070, respectively. Approximately 30.8% of the potential area for restoration currently overlaps the suitable area for A. mangium, and this overlap reaches at least 23.8% of the potential areas for restoration in the future scenarios (RCP 8.5 in 2070). A. mangium has a large suitable area in the Atlantic Forest and can become a barrier to restoration efforts in the coming decades. Expansion-contraction maps should be used to establish environmental policies that promote both forest restoration and prevention of biological invasion in suitable areas.

AB Biocultural species enhancement within archaeological sites is particularly challenging because restoration goals and the preservation of cultural assets need to be met simultaneously. Biocultural restoration aims to reestablish the ecological components while preserving or restoring the cultural components of the site, as well as the relationships between them. Biocultural species enhancement is one component of these efforts. Biocultural species enhancement within archaeologically protected sites can establish multiple connections among nature and culture; yet, it can be complicated by the need to preserve the archaeological remains. Tzintzuntzan, in the State of Michoacan, Mexico, holds the remains of the capital of the Tarascan empire. Due to ecological degradation of Tzintzuntzan's landscape, hummingbirds are seldom seen within the archeological site. As part of a project that aims to restore habitat components for hummingbirds within the Tzintzuntzan Archaeological Site, we established patches of the native Salvia fulgens (Mexican red sage). Initially, potted S. fulgens plants were temporarily placed within the study site to test the feasibility of attracting hummingbirds by providing feeding resources. Five hummingbird species were recorded using the sage pots, with Cynanthus latirostris (Broad-billed hummingbird) being the most frequent. Results of this study show that at least 37 flowers per patch are needed to attract C. latirostris. A permanent S. fulgens plantation was established to provide this habitat at Tzintzuntzan.

AB Identifying the mechanisms of compensation to insect herbivory remains a major challenge in plant biology and evolutionary ecology. Most previous studies have addressed plant compensatory responses to one or two levels of insect herbivory, and the underlying traits mediating such responses remain elusive in many cases. We evaluated responses associated with compensation to multiple intensities of leaf damage (0% control, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% of leaf area removed) by means of mechanical removal of foliar tissue and application of a caterpillar (Spodoptera exigua) oral secretions in 3-month-old wild cotton plants (Gossypium hirsutum). Four weeks post-treatment, we measured plant growth and multiple traits associated with compensation, namely: changes in above- and belowground, biomass and the concentration of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and non-structural carbon reserves (starch and soluble sugars) in roots, stems and leaves. We found that wild cotton fully compensated in terms of growth and biomass allocation when leaf damage was low (10%), whereas moderate (25%) to high leaf damage in some cases led to under-compensation. Nonetheless, high levels of leaf removal (50% and 75%) in most cases did not cause further reductions in height and allocation to leaf and stem biomass relative to low and moderate damage. There were significant positive effects of leaf damage on P concentration in leaves and stems, but not roots, as well as a negative effect on soluble sugars in roots. These results indicate that wild cotton fully compensated for a low level of leaf damage but under-compensated under moderate to high leaf damage, but can nonetheless sustain growth despite increasing losses to herbivory. Such responses were possibly mediated by a re-allocation of carbohydrate reserves from roots to shoots.

ID REDD PLUS PAYMENTS; ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; SEQUESTRATION
AB This study adapts the Faustmann model (1849) to include the effects of carbon-based payments for environmental services on the optimal rotation length of forest plantations. We assume payments occur at the end of the harvesting cycle and are based on the additional average carbon stock over the rotation length relative to an optimal management scenario without carbon incentives. We present numerical applications of our model based on the four most planted tree species in the world: Eucalyptus sp., Acacia sp., Pinus sp. and Tectona sp. Simulations were performed to quantify the impact of different payment levels (USD Mg CO2-1) on optimal rotation lengths and carbon stocks. We find diminishing sequestration returns to increasing carbon payments. Overall, our results suggest that targeting plantations with longer rotations, associated with slow-growing species, is a more cost-effective strategy to retain additional forest carbon stored (USD Mg CO2-1 ). However, such a strategy results in lower proportional increases in carbon stocks (Mg CO2 ha(-1)) compared to faster-growing species, which benefit the most from the carbon incentives. As a result, increasing payments for additional carbon stored could change the choice of which tree species to produce and ironically promote plantations with lower total carbon stocks.

AB The natural regeneration process is essential for forest maintenance since it is critical for establishing new tree individuals. This study aimed to improve the understanding of the regenerative component dynamics of Araucaria Forests in Southern Brazil. We investigated the effects of climate, light, tree component structure and anthropogenic disturbance on tree species regeneration. Regenerating communities from six different fragments in forest remnants of the "Planalto Sul Catarinense" region was evaluated in permanent plots two years after the first inventory. The following demographic rates were determined: recruitment, mortality, net change in the number of individuals and the changes to both upper and lower height classes. The following variables were measured in each fragment: altitude, climatic variables, light environment, tree component density and cattle presence. Association between dynamics rates, regenerating species abundance and explanatory variables was verified by the fourth-corner and RLQ methods. A total of 4,379 and 5,268 individuals were sampled for the first and second inventories, respectively, with recruitment rate (21 % yr(-1)) higher than mortality rate (13 % yr(-1)). The dynamics pattern of the fragment with greater presence of cattle stood out for the intense height increase of regenerating species caused by the presence of fast growth and light-demanding species. Natural regeneration of forest remnants under study is facing a structuring process. The main conclusions of this study were: i) climate and altitude play a relevant role in defining floristic identity and ii) chronic disturbances may influence the definition of ecological strategies.

AB The successful establishment of mangrove ecosystems depends on an intricate network of interactions among physical and biological factors that are highly dynamic through time. At millennial to centennial time scales, regional climates, sea levels, and local geomorphology play critical roles in the establishment of mangroves. Whereas fluvio-marine dynamics define coastal sedimentary settings, regional precipitation and freshwater input modulate salinity and seasonal flooding patterns. We analyzed a similar to 7800-year-old, continuous sedimentary record from the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico to shed light on regional biophysical coastal processes and the history of the mangroves that occupy the region today. We used a systematic sampling of mud-water interface sediments to generate a modern reference frame for interpreting fossil pollen assemblages. Our results indicate that the cored location that is currently approximately at sea level, was below sea level from similar to 7800 to 4000 calibrated years before present (cal BP). The establishment of dense mangrove stands took place around 3700 cal BP, when regional sea levels stabilized, resulting in a substantial increase of organic matter and therefore carbon stored in the sediments. However, the mangrove ecological succession that started at similar to 6000 cal BP was interrupted by a regional drought that extended from similar to 5400 to 3700 cal BP. From 3700 cal BP to Present, the lagoon has been characterized by relatively stable both substratum and sea level, that together have facilitated the establishment of mangrove forests. Overall, our record demonstrates the complexity of the interactions between local and regional factors in the development and evolution of both coastal geomorphology and ecosystems.

AB Mixed forests are particularly interesting for forest structure and diversity analyses, as higher complexity and diversity can be expected in these forests compared to pure ones. Integrating different approaches in the analyses of structure and diversity in these forests can provide complementary information on non-spatial, spatial and functional diversity patterns. The study aimed at evaluating the spatio-temporal dynamics in forest structure and diversity in a semi-natural mixed oak-hornbeam floodplain forest. All standing trees were mapped and inventoried in 1995, 2005 and 2016 in three 1-ha mixed forest stands, with different soil moisture regime (xeric, mesic, moist conditions). Traditional, non-spatial structure and diversity measures were coupled with spatially-explicit and functional diversity measures. Results indicated that the three stands showed limited variation in stand structure and similar non-spatial diversity attributes, despite the different species composition. Only the extension to spatial and functional analyses was able to reveal more pronounced differences of diversity patterns, as higher complexity, species mingling, and functional tree complementarity was observed in the moister stand. These findings support use of spatially-explicit measurements in traditional inventory measurement protocols to allow more refined analysis of diversity patterns. On the other hand, functional diversity can be easily implemented in diversity analyses, as it requires species abundance information (which is traditionally collected in forest inventory) and species-specific tree traits which can be inferred from literature.

AB Explaining global environmental change requires an understanding of the relationships that exist between social systems and the natural environment. Creating integrative research frameworks capable of explaining these coupled human and natural systems has been a central activity in this long-standing intellectual project. One way to advance framework development is to focus on relationships among people, patterns, and processes. Two fields that have been making simultaneous advances to this triad are landscape ecology and land system architecture. In the introduction to this special issue, we highlight new research streams linking these two fields for a more robust Land System Science. We identify three fruitful avenues where these two fields can be linked to advance our theoretical understanding of the land system and develop broadly applicable mixed methodological tools: a renewed study of social and ecological processes, deeper engagement with this issues surrounding scale, and enhanced analyses of ecosystem services.

AB Intergroup violence is assumed to play a key role in establishing and maintaining gang competitive dominance. However, it is not clear how competitive ability, gang size and reciprocal violence interact. Does competitive dominance lead to larger gangs, or allow them to remain small? Does competitive dominance lead gangs to mount more attacks against rivals, or expose them to more attacks? We explore a model developed in theoretical ecology to understand communities arranged in strict competitive hierarchies. The model is extended to generate expectations about gang size distributions and the directionality of gang violence. Model expectations are explored with twenty-three years of data on gang homicides from Los Angeles. Gangs may mitigate competitive pressure by quickly finding gaps in the spatial coverage of superior competitors. Competitively superior gangs can be larger or smaller than competitively inferior gangs and a disproportionate source or target of directional violence, depending upon where exactly they fall in the competitive hierarchy. A model specifying the mechanism of competitive dominance is needed to correctly interpret gang size and violence patterns.

AB Vegetation is a key determinant of wildfire behaviour at field scales as it functions as fuel. Past studies in the laboratory show that plant flammability, the ability of plants to ignite and maintain combustion, is a function of their traits. However, the way the traits of individual plants combine in a vegetation community to affect field flammability has received little attention. This study aims to bridge the gap between the laboratory and field by linking plant traits to metrics of field-scale flammability. Across three prescribed burns, in Eucalyptus-dominated damp and dry forest, we measured pre-burn plant species abundance and postburn field flammability metrics (percentage area burnt, char and scorch height). For understory species with dominant cover-abundance, we measured nine traits that had been demonstrated to influence flammability in the laboratory. We used fourth-corner ordination to evaluate covariation between the plant traits, species abundance and flammability. We found that several traits covaried at the species level. In some instances, these traits (e.g. specific leaf area and bulk density) could have cumulative effects on the flammability of a species while in other instances (e.g. moisture and specific leaf area) they may have counteractive effects, assuming trait effects on flammability are akin to previous research. At field scales, species with similar traits tended to co-occur, suggesting that the effects of individual traits accumulate within a plant community. Fourth-corner analyses found the trait-field flammability relationship to be statistically significant. Traits significantly associated with increasing field flammability metrics were: bulk density (negatively associated) and hydrocarbon quantity, specific leaf area and surface area to volume ratio (all positively associated). Our study demonstrates that some traits known to influence flammability in the laboratory can be associated with field-scale flammability metrics. Further research is needed to isolate the contributions of individual traits to understand how species composition drives forest flammability.

AB Although the early germination of white oaks has long been considered an adaptation to counter animal predation, the role of the robust radicles of white oak acorns has been largely neglected in the interaction between acorns and seed-eating animals. Here, the regeneration capabilities of the pruned radicles of intermediate oak Quercus variabilis left by the acorn-eating animals were compared to test the 'one acorn produce two seedlings' hypothesis stating that the remnant radicles exhibit the capability to produce normal seedlings owning to their atypical nutritional and anatomical characteristics. Our results first showed that both pruned radicle and cotyledons from single acorn successfully established seedlings, providing strong evidence on an old puzzle that the robust radicles of early-germinating oak acorns act as reserved propagules, allowing them to escape animals' predation. Our study also suggests that much of the investment in the food reserves of an acorn may be important as a food reward for the animals that disperse the acorns, rather than simply serving as energy for the young seedling.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are the most prominent mycobionts of plants in the tropics, yet little is known about their diversity, species compositions and factors driving AMF distribution patterns. To investigate whether elevation and associated vegetation type affect species composition, we sampled 646 mycorrhizal samples in locations between 1000 and 4000 m above sea level (masl) in the South of Ecuador. We estimated diversity, distribution and species compositions of AMF by cloning and Sanger sequencing the 18S rDNA (the section between AML1 and AML2) and subsequent derivation of fungal OTUs based on 99% sequence similarity. In addition, we analyzed the phylogenetic structure of the sites by computing the mean pairwise distance (MPD) and the mean nearest taxon difference (MNTD) for each elevation level. It revealed that AMF species compositions at 1000 and 2000 masl differ from 3000 and 4000 masl. Lower elevations (1000 and 2000 masl) were dominated by members of Glomeraceae, whereas Acaulosporaceae were more abundant in higher elevations (3000 and 4000 masl). Ordination of OTUs with respect to study sites revealed a correlation to elevation with a continuous turnover of species from lower to higher elevations. Most of the abundant OTUs are not endemic to South Ecuador. We also found a high proportion of rare OTUs at all elevations: 79-85% of OTUs occurred in less than 5% of the samples. Phylogenetic community analysis indicated clustering and evenness for most elevation levels indicating that both, stochastic processes and habitat filtering are driving factors of AMF community compositions.

AB Worldwide, fires have substantial economic, social and health-related impacts. Brazil is one of the most affected areas in the globe, particularly the Cerrado, a savanna-like biome, whose composition, structure, species abundance and diversity are shaped by recurring fires. The aim is to assess present and future trends of fire danger and burned area (BA), using the Daily Severity Rating (DSR), an extension of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System, and climate outputs from a regional climate model, the RCA4 from the Rossby Centre. To that end, we validated the climate variables simulated by RCA4 and the resulting DSR, both showing consistency with observation-based datasets. We then developed a statistical model of BA using fire season averaged DSR as a predictor, found to explain 71% of the interannual variability of BA from 2003 to 2017. Using the statistical model, we projected future fire danger and BA over Cerrado for IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. Results show an increase in future BA for all scenarios, with pronounced changes for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, where BA is expected to increase by 39% and 95% for 2100. In the case of RCP 2.6, the closest scenario to the 1.5 degrees C target established by the United Nations, results indicate an increase in mean BA up to 22% by 2050, compared to the historical period, followed by a decrease to 11% by 2100. This is especially relevant since RCP 2.6 is the only scenario where such a decrease is projected, highlighting the importance of keeping global mean surface temperature below the 1.5 degrees C warming target.

AB Aim To examine plant community composition within rain forest remnants, and whether communities in different fragments follow similar trajectories of change in composition. We investigate whether plant communities in rain forest fragments either diverge from, or become more similar to, plant communities in other fragments, in order to understand the biodiversity value of forest fragments. Location Rain forest fragments embedded within agricultural landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Methods We examined 14 forest fragments (39-120,000 ha) and five sites in continuous forest, and compared pre-isolation (trees >5 cm dbh) and post-isolation (seedlings <1 cm dbh) plant community composition. We used Chao-Sorensen dissimilarity metric to compute beta diversity between all pairwise combinations of sites, and then used Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling to reduce 18 pairwise values per site to a single site value, which we used to test whether fragment area and/or isolation are associated with changes in plant communities. We compare analyses for trees and seedlings, and whether community changes arise from recruitment failure. Results Seedlings in fragments have diverged most from other communities, and divergence was greatest between seedling communities in small fragments, which have not only diverged more from tree communities in the same fragment, but also from seedling communities at other sites. This finding is partly associated with recruitment failure: the number of genera represented by both trees and seedlings is positively associated with site area. Main conclusions Seedling communities are diverging in forest remnants, associated primarily with reductions in fragment area, whilst tree communities have not diverged, possibly due to extinction debts. Divergence is likely to continue as seedling cohorts mature, resulting in communities in fragments following different trajectories of change. Individual plant communities in each fragment may become impoverished, but they can support different communities of plants and hence contribute to landscape-scale diversity.

AB Biotic interactions play a critical role in mediating community responses to temporal environmental variation, but the importance of these effects relative to the direct effects of environmental change remains poorly understood, particularly in diverse forest communities. Here we combine a neighborhood modeling approach with insights from coexistence theory to assess the effects of temporal variation in species interactions and environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and understory light availability) on seedling survival over nine census years in a subtropical forest. We find significant temporal shifts in the magnitude of neighborhood effects on both community-wide and species-level seedling survival (statistically significant random effects of neighborhood x year and neighborhood x species x year interactions). These results are consistent with the idea that environmental change will play a fundamental role on forest regeneration dynamics by altering biotic interactions at the neighborhood scale. Moreover, differences among species in response to neighbors over time contribute to a pattern of temporal decoupling of seedling survival between species, which can help to promote diversity in certain contexts. In separate analyses of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), altered interactions with neighbors are much stronger predictors of asynchronous seedling survival among species than the pure effects of climate and plant functional traits, explaining twice as much variation (43.9% vs. 22.2%). In sum, these results reveal that divergent species responses to interannual environmental variability detected are driven primarily by indirect effects mediated by changing biotic environments. This highlights the importance of including indirect effects from local biotic (neighborhood) interactions in forecasts of forest community responses to global change.

AB There is increasing evidence complex forest structure and tree diversity correlates positively with the productivity of forest ecosystems. However, there is little quantitative information regarding the effect of these factors on stand productivity of northern temperate coniferous forests of Mexico. This study aimed to test the hypothesis tree diversity and canopy structure positively associates with forest productivity. Parameterization of tree diversity, stand structure and productivity were carried out on dasometric data from 36 permanent sampling plots re-measured in 1982, 1993, and 2004. Statistical analysis of stand parameters tested the null hypothesis. Statistical relationships revealed well-balanced canopy strata and imbalanced diameter structures positively correlated with stand productivity. Tree diversity was also positively linked with stand productivity, but the effect appeared to be most important in the early to intermediate stages of succession. Further research is required to understand the long-term effects of tree diversity and canopy structure on stand productivity. These preliminary observations stress the importance of prescribing silvicultural practices that maintain the three-dimensional structure of stands and diversity of forest canopies that aim to preserve ecosystem function, diversity, and productivity.

AB Aim Following the near-complete destruction of China's forest ecosystems during the 20th century, recent reforestation programmes have created large-scale mosaics of protected secondary and plantation forests. These restored forests are often assumed to have limited biodiversity conservation value, but large-scale evaluations of their diversity are lacking. In our study, we compared alpha-diversity and species dissimilarity patterns of vascular plants and ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in restored secondary and plantation forests to remnant mature forests across north-eastern temperate China. We also assessed functional traits of beetles and cross-taxon diversity links to evaluate differences in ecosystem functioning among forest types. Location . Northeast China. Methods Vascular plant and ground beetle assemblages were recorded in 159 temperate forest plots. The alpha-diversity and species compositional dissimilarity of these taxa and the functional traits of beetles were compared between plantation, secondary and mature forest ecosystems. Results Herbaceous plant species richness peaked in mature forests, while carabid and woody plant diversity did not differ between forest types. Species dissimilarity of carabids was lowest in mature forests and highest in plantation forests. Mature forest contained the highest proportion of carnivorous beetles and secondary forests of large-bodied carabids. Carabid diversity and woody plant species richness were positively correlated in mature forests, but not in secondary or plantation forests. Main conclusions While China's mature forests show a great conservation value in harbouring highly diverse herbaceous plant assemblages and an abundance of distinct invertebrate trait groups such as small predatory carabids, China's restored temperate forests also support a high diversity of woody plants and carabids. Overall, our findings offer an encouraging conservation message for biodiversity conservation in China and demonstrate the importance of policy measures that ensure effective long-term protection of both, China's remnant mature forests, but also its new forest ecosystems.

AB One of the most contentious issues surrounding the forest conservation program REDD+ is the question whether it should be funded via international carbon markets. The controversy between market supporters and opponents has been especially marked in the public debate in Brazil, one of the main potential beneficiaries of REDD+ payments. In a remarkable shift of policy, the Brazilian Federal Government gave up its long-standing opposition to market-based funding in the run-up to the COP15, following several years of competition between two main discourse coalitions and their preferred story lines. These were analyzed here with discourse network analytical techniques. Brazil's policy change may in part be explained by the failure of market opponents to employ positive arguments about alternative funding mechanisms, such as a public fund model; and by the increasing discursive dominance of a third emerging discourse coalition, which adopted major arguments of both sides in the debate. The research presented here thus provides more general insights on the dynamics of public debates, discourse coalitions, and the impacts of discursive strategies on policy-making, as well as on the value of discourse network analysis as a research method.

AB Aim To assess habitat filtering and dispersal limitation in spore plant community assembly using bryophytes on recently emerged land uplift islands as study system. Location Gulf of Bothnia, northern Europe. Taxa Bryophytes, including the spore plant phyla Bryophyta (mosses) and Marchantiophyta (liverworts). Methods The species compositions of 20 coastal land uplift islands differing in age, area, connectivity and habitat composition were recorded in the field. In addition, we compiled a list of the regional species pool (446 species) and gathered data on species traits related to habitat affiliations (substrate, light, moisture, and pH) and dispersal capacity (regional abundance, spore size, sporophyte frequency, sexual system, vegetative propagules). For the 420 species with available trait data, we used multivariate generalized linear models to compare trait effects on species occurrence probabilities on the islands. Results Occurrence probabilities depended strongly on habitat affiliations. In addition, occurrence probabilities were lower for predominantly asexual species than for sexual species and for regionally rare than for regionally abundant species. Having specialized asexual propagules increased occurrence probabilities, but compensated only partly for the reductions in asexual species. No effect of the size of sexually produced spores was detected. Comparison of trait effects across island size and connectivity gradients revealed (a) reduced habitat filtering on larger islands and (b) decreasing negative effects of being predominantly asexual with increasing island connectivity. Conclusions Both habitat filtering and dispersal capacities affect the community assembly of spore plants on land uplift islands. Asexual mosses and liverworts show landscape scale (<= 10 km) dispersal limitation. The weak or absent relationships between island connectivity and the effects of dispersal traits suggest that colonization is regulated mainly by habitat availability and the abundance of each species in a "regional spore rain" from which colonists are recruited.

AB The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis and the shifting defense hypothesis (SDH) predict that evolutionary changes occur in a suite of traits related to defense and growth in invasive plant species as result of the absence of specialist herbivores. We tested how this suite of traits changed due to the absence of specialist herbivores in multiple invasive regions that differ in climatic conditions with native and invasive Jacobaea vulgaris in a controlled environment. We hypothesized that invasive J. vulgaris in all invasive regions have i) a higher plant growth and underlying traits, such as photosynthetic capacity, ii) lower regrowth-related traits, such as carbohydrate storage, and iii) an increased plant qualitative defense, such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Our results show that invasive J. vulgaris genotypes have evolved a higher photosynthetic rate and total PA concentration but a lower investment in root carbohydrates, which supports the SDH hypothesis. All the traits changed consistently and significantly in the same direction in all four invasive regions, indicative of a parallel evolution. Climatic and soil variables did differ between ranges but explained only a very small part of the variation in trait values. The latter suggests that climate and soil changes were not the main selective forces on these traits.

AB The conservation of tropical forests is recognized as one of the most important challenges for forestry, ecology and politics. Besides strict protection, the sustainable management of natural forests should be enhanced as a key part of the foundation for the maintenance of tropical rain forest ecosystems. Due to methodological reasons it has been complicated to attain reliable growth data to plan sustainable felling cycles and rotation periods. Tree ring analyses enable the estimation of growth rates over the entire life span of trees and their age as well as giving hints from forest dynamics in previous centuries. For tree ring analysis, stem disk samples were taken from three important commercial tree species (Cariniana micrantha, Caryocar villosum and Manilkara huberi) in the upland (terra firme) forests of the Precious Woods Amazon logging company near Itacoatiara, Brazil. Based on radiocarbon estimates of individual growth zones, the annual nature of tree rings was proven for the three species. Tree rings were measured and the results used together with height estimates to model diameter, height and volume growth. The age of the eldest tree, a C. micrantha, was 585 yrs with 165 cm in diameter. The species' diameter increments range from 0.20 +/- 0.12 cm yr(-1) to 0.29 +/- 0.08 cm yr(-1). At first sight, this is considerably lower than increments reported from other Amazonian or African timber species. Considering the respective wood density there is no significant difference in growth performance of dominant timber species across continents. The interpretation of lifetime tree ring curves indicate differences in shadow tolerance among species, the persistence of individuals in the understory for up to 150 years and natural stand dynamics without major disturbances. Management criteria should be adapted for the measured growth rates as they differed considerably from the Brazilian standards fixed by laws (felling cycle of 25-35 years and a common minimum logging diameter of 50 cm). Felling cycles should be increased to 32-51 years and minimum logging diameters to 63-123 cm depending on the species.

AB Little is known regarding how trophic interactions shape community assembly in tropical forests. Here we assess multi-taxonomic community assembly rules using a rare standardized coordinated inventory comprising exhaustive surveys of five highly-diverse taxonomic groups exerting key ecological functions: trees, fungi, earthworms, ants and spiders. We sampled 36 1.9-ha plots from four remote locations in French Guiana including precise soil measurements, and we tested whether species turnover was coordinated among groups across geographic and edaphic gradients. All species group pairs exhibited significant compositional associations that were independent from soil conditions. For some of the pairs, associations were also partly explained by soil properties, especially soil phosphorus availability. Our study provides evidence for coordinated turnover among taxonomic groups beyond simple relationships with environmental factors, thereby refining our understanding regarding the nature of interactions occurring among these ecologically important groups.

AB A new Habenaria species from the state of Mato Grosso is described and illustrated. Habenaria gracilisegmenta was discovered in campinarana understory, in northern Mato Grosso state, on the southern edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The species is distinguished by its slender habit, and by the few, delicate flowers, with very long, thin lateral petals and lip segments. Its morphological affinity with other Neotropical species is unclear. A molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new species does not belong to any of the Neotropical subclades of the genus, constituting an additional lineage. The species is one of two of the genus endemic to the Brazilian Amazon, and considered threatened given the small number of known populations and restricted distribution.

AB This study compares density and size structure of kelp Lessonia berteroana and sea urchins Loxechinus albus inside and outside a port concession area in Caldera. Greater abundance and larger adult individuals in populations of both benthic resources in this zone preliminarily indicates that this might be replicating a marine protected area. In the future, this port concession could contribute to the conservation of benthic resources as a reference site, without access to fisheries, useful for validating or implementing measures and actions in management plans or other instruments to support conservation.

AB Our study aims to provide a comparison of the P- and L-band TomoSAR profiles, Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS), and discrete return LiDAR to assess the ability for TomoSAR to monitor and estimate the tropical forest structure parameters for enhanced forest management and to support biomass missions. The comparison relies on the unique UAVSAR Jet propulsion Laboratory (JPL)/NASA L-band data, P-band data acquired by ONERA airborne system (SETHI), Small Footprint LiDAR (SFL), and NASA Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) LiDAR datasets acquired in 2015 and 2016 in the frame of the AfriSAR campaign. Prior to multi-baseline data processing, a phase residual correction methodology based on phase calibration via phase center double localization has been implemented to improve the phase measurements and compensate for the phase perturbations, and disturbances originated from uncertainties in allocating flight trajectories. First, the vertical structure was estimated from L- and P-band corrected Tomography SAR data measurements, then compared with the canopy height model from SFL data. After that, the SAR and LiDAR three-dimensional (3D) datasets are compared and discussed at a qualitative basis at the region of interest. The L- and P-band's performance for canopy penetration was assessed to determine the underlying ground locations. Additionally, the 3D records for each configuration were compared with their ability to derive forest vertical structure. Finally, the vertical structure extracted from the 3D radar reflectivity from L- and P-band are compared with SFL data, resulting in a root mean square error of 3.02 m and 3.68 m, where the coefficient of determination shows a value of 0.95 and 0.93 for P- and L-band, respectively. The results demonstrate that TomoSAR holds promise for a scientific basis in forest management activities.

AB This study analyzes the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) changes on the hydrology of the dry Afromontane forest landscape in northern Ethiopia. Landsat satellite images of thematic mapper (TM) (1986), TM (2001), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) (2018) were employed to assess LULC. All of the images were classified while using the maximum likelihood image classification technique, and the changes were assessed by post-classification comparison. Seven LULC classes were defined with an overall accuracy 83-90% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.82-0.92. The classification result for 1986 revealed dominance of shrublands (48.5%), followed by cultivated land (42%). Between 1986 and 2018, cultivated land became the dominant (39.6%) LULC type, accompanied by a decrease in shrubland to 32.2%, as well as increases in forestland (from 4.8% to 21.4%) and bare land (from 0% to 0.96%). The soil conservation systems curve number model (SCS-CN) was consequently employed to simulate forest hydrological response to climatic variations and land-cover changes during three selected years. The observed changes in direct surface runoff, the runoff coefficient, and storage capacity of the soil were partially linked to the changes in LULC that were associated with expanding bare land and built-up areas. This change in land use aggravates the runoff potential of the study area by 31.6 mm per year on average. Runoff coefficients ranged from 25.3% to 47.2% with varied storm rainfall intensities of 26.1-45.4 mm/ha. The temporal variability of climate change and potential evapotranspiration increased by 1% during 1981-2018. The observed rainfall and modelled runoff showed a strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.78; p < 0.001). Regression analysis between runoff and rainfall intensity indicates their high and significant correlation (R-2 = 0.89; p < 0.0001). Changes were also common along the slope gradient and agro-ecological zones at varying proportions. The observed changes in land degradation and surface runoff are highly linked to the change in LULC. Further study is suggested on climate scenario-based modeling of hydrological processes that are related to land use changes to understand the hydrological variability of the dry Afromontane forest ecosystems.

AB Coastal human ecology (CHE) is a mixture of different theoretical and thematic approaches straddling between the humanities and social and natural sciences which studies human and coastal/marine interactions at the local-scale and through intense fieldwork. Topics of interest include human coastal adaptations past and present; the historical ecology of fisheries and future implications; local forms of marine governance and economic systems; local food security and livelihoods, and indigenous/local ecological knowledge systems among many research themes. In this paper, I explore different strands of CHE in the study of tribal, artisanal, and small-scale industrial fisheries from the mid-90s onward that can contribute to the foundational knowledge necessary for designing and implementing successful coastal fisheries management and conservation programs. Marine conservation has often failed due to a lack of understanding of the fine grained marine human-environmental interactions at the local scale. In this context, I also examine developing and future research directions in CHE, and discuss their potential contribution for filling the gap in existing approaches to actionable scholarship in marine conservation. The strength of many CHE approaches lies in their potential for bridging humanism and natural science, and thus CHE approaches are well equipped to address many of the challenges faced by marine conservation practitioners today.

AB Understanding forest regeneration processes is increasingly important as disturbed forests spread rapidly in tropical landscapes. While successional dynamics are relatively well-understood for plants, they remain poorly known for tropical insects, particularly in montane rainforests and tree canopies. We studied the effect of montane forest succession on arboreal ant communities in New Guinea near their natural elevational limit (1800 m a.s.l.). We censused ant species and nests in replicated 0.1-ha plots of primary, old and young secondary forests, destined to be felled for gardens by the local landowners. Overall, 1249 felled trees were dissected for all ant-associated microhabitats. We used rarefaction-based models manipulating vegetation structure and multivariate randomizations to assess the effects of tree density, tree size, and nesting microhabitats on the ant communities. We expected increased ant species diversity, microhabitat specialization, and species turnover among trees throughout the succession, with distinct community composition among the stages. In contrast to our expectations, ant species composition and diversity per plot did not change during succession, and species similarity among trees was significantly higher only in old secondary forest. The number of ant species per tree increased with forest age, but trees of similar size hosted only slightly more species in primary than secondary forests. Many ant species were associated with particular nesting microhabitats; however, the same microhabitat types occurred in all stages and thus did not generate successional trends in ant communities. Secondary succession had an unexpectedly low impact on tree-dwelling ant communities in this montane ecosystem, in contrast with our previous findings from lowland rainforests. These results highlight the need to study successional processes along entire elevational gradients, as montane taxa may react differently to vegetation changes than their lowland counterparts.

AB Salvinia molesta D.S. Mitchell (Salviniaceae), a floating aquatic weed, is a menace in many water bodies, disrupting the ecological balance wherever it invades, with wide ranging economic and health impacts. Biological control using the weevil Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder & Sands has been an effective control method globally, although some infestations persist, in particular in shaded waterbodies. This study thus aimed to determine the effect of shade on the efficacy of biological control of S. molesta. Plants were grown in a greenhouse at high and low nutrients, in three varying shade levels, and half of the experiment subjected to herbivory by C. salviniae. Plant biomass was significantly greater in high-nutrient conditions, in the absence and presence of herbivory at all levels of shade tested. Under shade and high-nutrient conditions, plants were significantly higher in quality (i.e. lower carbon:nitrogen ratio) compared with those exposed to full sun. Plants in the shade sustained less damage, possibly due to the high insoluble nitrogen concentrations, which may have deterred herbivory by C. salviniae. However, when exposed to full sun, plants were of lower quality and consequently sustained more damage from the weevils despite lower populations. The results therefore suggest that nutrient supply is pivotal in plant growth compared with light (amount of PAR). The results from this study add to the growing body of literature that plant quality is a major factor in determining the success of aquatic weed biological control programmes.

ID SWITCHGRASS; IMPACT; YIELD
AB Perennial energy crops like switchgrass that are used for biofuel production have the potential to generate various water quality benefits such as reduced nitrogen runoff. Yet the current expected returns to switchgrass are not profitable enough for these crops to be widely adopted by U.S. farmers due to relatively unstable yields, volatile revenues, and high costs of crop establishment. This study uses a dynamic economic model to investigate the uncertainties in the yields and costs of switchgrass production, in comparison with those of corn-soybeans in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed in Pennsylvania. Results indicate that farmers would be willing to convert corn-soybeans to switchgrass land use with the provision of payments for ecosystem services (PES). A targeted PES policy based on the environmental effectiveness of the crop land is found to be slightly more effective in providing nitrogen reductions than a uniform PES policy with cost savings of 8-19%. Moreover, switchgrass has the potential of providing energy supply while reducing greenhouse gases emissions.

AB In temperate ecosystems, earthworms and ants are the most important organisms for bioturbation. Little is known about how these groups contribute to bioturbation in different environments and to what extent overall bioturbation depends on their diversity. We developed a formula that allows quantification of annual earthworm bioturbation, thereby taking differences between earthworm ecotypes into account. With this formula, we calculated earthworm bioturbation at three sites, each with vegetation types typically found in Northern Europe. Earthworm bioturbation was low (1 Mg dry soil ha(-1) y(-1)) in Scots pine and Norway spruce forests with acidic soil (pH 3.9-4.4) and high (between 15 and 34 Mg dry soil ha(-1) y(-1)) in broadleaf forests, grasslands, alder carr and spruce forests on calcareous soil. Burrowing (endogeic and anecic) earthworms accounted for most of the earthworm bioturbation, and these worms had the highest population densities at moderate-to-high soil pH (pH 5-7.2). Estimates of ant bioturbation at the same sites were based on nest abundance, size and residence time. Mean ant bioturbation varied between 0.2 and 1 Mg dry soil ha(-1) y(-1), but individual plots had up to 2.4 Mg dry soil ha(-1) y(-1). In soils with pH higher than 5, the relative contribution of ants to total bioturbation was only 1-5%. Ant bioturbation was higher than earthworm bioturbation only in some forest soils with pH 3.9-4.4. Thus, earthworms appear to be the dominant cause of bioturbation in most types of terrestrial ecosystems in the cold-temperate areas of Europe and when information on local earthworm communities and monthly soil temperatures is available, bioturbation can be quantified using the presented 'earthworm bioturbation formula'.

AB This work brings together the view of different specialists in the areas of larviculture, physiology, ecology, nutrition and animal health, regarding how to deal with the aquaculture farming of species with complex life cycles in a multidisciplinary way, using as models the octopus and the muricid C. concholepas, with the aim of reducing the gap between the experimental and the industrial culture of species that are relevant for the diversification of aquaculture, particularly in Chile. Although these species are similar in their difficulty to reach the terminal planktonic phase prior to juvenile, they differ in the bottlenecks they have to overcome to reach it. Relevant aspects of study to achieve juvenile production from early life stages rearing, whether for repopulation or for ongrowing, are as follows: (i) Replacement or supplementation of live diets with inert diets to achieve significant survival values over the first stages of life. (ii) Physiological approaches to establish cultivation conditions evaluating the individual responses to several rearing conditions, specially the interaction between temperature, dissolved oxygen and acidity. Studies of urgent character due to the global warming scenario. (iii) Genomic studies associated with the effect of ontogenetic development, environment, health and nutrition on gene expression to understand, in an integrated way, the key processes for the development and growth of immature stages. (iv) Studies on the control of reproduction, the quality control of the ova, the genetic structure of reproductive populations and the characterization of diseases are also necessary to achieve efficient hatchery technologies.

AB Leaf-cutter ants are a prominent feature in Neotropical ecosystems, but a comprehensive assessment of their effects on ecosystem functions is lacking. We reviewed the literature and used our own recent findings to identify knowledge gaps and develop a framework to quantify the effects of leaf-cutter ants on ecosystem processes. Leaf-cutter ants disturb the soil structure during nest excavation changing soil aeration and temperature. They mix relatively nutrient-poor soil from deeper layers with the upper organic-rich layers increasing the heterogeneity of carbon and nutrients within nest soils. Leaf-cutter ants account for about 25% of all herbivory in Neotropical forest ecosystems, moving 10%-15% of leaves in their foraging range to their nests. Fungal symbionts transform the fresh, nutrient-rich vegetative material to produce hyphal nodules to feed the ants. Organic material from roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi enhances carbon and nutrient turnover in nest soils and creates biogeochemical hot spots. Breakdown of organic matter, microbial and ant respiration, and nest waste material decomposition result in increased CO2, CH4, and N2O production, but the build-up of gases and heat within the nest is mitigated by the tunnel network ventilation system. Nest ventilation dynamics are challenging to measure without bias, and improved sensor systems would likely solve this problem. Canopy gaps above leaf-cutter ant nests change the light, wind and temperature regimes, which affects ecosystem processes. Nests differ in density and size depending on colony age, forest type and disturbance level and change over time resulting in spatial and temporal changes of ecosystem processes. These characteristics remain a challenge to evaluate rapidly and non-destructively. Addressing the knowledge gaps identified in this synthesis will bring insights into physical and biological processes driving biogeochemical cycles at the nest and ecosystem scale and will improve our understanding of ecosystem biogeochemical heterogeneity and larger scale ecological phenomena. A plain language summary is available for this article.

Here, we test species-specific responses to size-asymmetric competition under various soil environments by manipulating plant size as well as soil fertility, nutrient heterogeneity and the initial suppression of microbial communities within a three-species community. Competition was primarily size-asymmetric; however, the degree to which competition was size-asymmetric was species-specific, where three out of five soil treatments resulted in size-asymmetric competition in some species but size-symmetric competition in others. Overall, soil fertility and nutrient heterogeneity altered the degree of size-asymmetric competition, while the initial suppression of microbial communities had no effect. Contrary to past predictions, when they had an effect, increased soil fertility and the presence of a high-quality patch reduced the degree of size-asymmetric competition, while the presence of a low-quality patch increased it. This suggests that the role nutrient heterogeneity plays on the degree of size-asymmetric competition is dependent on the quality and location of the patch relative to an individual's neighbours. These findings challenge the current understanding that competition for soil resources is always size-symmetric and demonstrate that species within the same community may not experience the same degree of size-dependent competition. These differential responses suggest we must consider variations in tolerance and suppression between species during size-dependent plant-plant interactions, which may promote species coexistence as all small individuals may not be negatively impacted during size-dependent competition. A plain language summary is available for this article.

AB Species interactions lie at the heart of many theories of macroevolution, from adaptive radiation to the Red Queen. Although some theories describe the imprint that interactions will have over long timescales, we are still missing a comprehensive understanding of the effects of interactions on macroevolution. Current research shows strong evidence for the impact of interactions on macroevolutionary patterns of trait evolution and diversification, yet many macroevolutionary studies have only a tenuous relationship to ecological studies of interactions over shorter timescales. We review current research in this area, highlighting approaches that explicitly model species interactions and connect them to broad-scale macroevolutionary patterns. We also suggest that progress has been made by taking an integrative interdisciplinary look at individual clades. We focus on African cichlids as a case study of how this approach can be fruitful. Overall, although the evidence for species interactions shaping macroevolution is strong, further work using integrative and model-based approaches is needed to spur progress towards understanding the complex dynamics that structure communities over time and space.

AB The data, information and knowledge on the tropical forest area and its dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon remain contentious. We use time-series satellite images to quantify annual forest area, loss and gain in the Brazilian Amazon during 2000-2017. We find that forest area was -15% higher than the estimate by the official Brazilian forest dataset (PRODES), but annual forest-loss rates were twice the PRODES estimates (-0.027 x 10(6) km(2) yr(-1) during 2001-2016). Forest-loss rates increased again after 2013. The El Nino and drought year (2015/2016) drove large forest area loss. The cumulative forest-loss area within the protected areas (which include -50% of forests in the region) was -11% of the total forest-loss area, which highlights the roles of protected areas in forest conservation.

AB Context Feral cats (Felis catus) impact the health and welfare of wildlife, livestock and humans worldwide. They are particularly damaging where they have been introduced into island countries such as Australia and New Zealand, where native prey species evolved without feline predators. Kangaroo Island, in South Australia, is Australia's third largest island and supports several threatened and endemic species. Cat densities on Kangaroo Island are thought to be greater than those on the adjacent South Australian mainland, based on one cat density estimate on the island that is higher than most estimates from the mainland. The prevalence of cat-borne disease in cats and sheep is also higher on Kangaroo Island than the mainland, suggesting higher cat densities. A recent continental-scale spatial model of cat density predicted that cat density on Kangaroo Island should be about double that of the adjacent mainland. However, although cats are believed to have severe impacts on some native species on the island, other species that are generally considered vulnerable to cat predation have relatively secure populations on the island compared with the mainland.
   Aims The present study aimed to compare feral cat abundance between Kangaroo Island and the adjacent South Australian mainland using simultaneous standardised methods. Based on previous findings, we predicted that the relative abundance of feral cats on Kangaroo Island would be approximately double that on the South Australian mainland.
   Methods Standardised camera trap surveys were used to simultaneously estimate the relative abundance of feral cats on Kangaroo Island and the adjacent South Australian mainland. Survey data were analysed using the Royle-Nichols abundance-induced heterogeneity model to estimate feral cat relative abundance at each site.
   Key results Cat abundance on the island was estimated to be over 10 times greater than that on the adjacent mainland.
   Conclusions Consistent with predictions, cat abundance on the island was greater than on the adjacent mainland. However, the magnitude of this difference was much greater than expected.
   Implications The findings show that the actual densities of cats at local sites can vary substantially from predictions generated by continental-scale models. The study also demonstrates the value of estimating abundance or density simultaneously across sites using standardised methods.

AB Nestedness refers to a species distribution pattern whereby species found in species-poor sites represent a subset of those in species-rich sites. Nestedness is presumed to be primarily a result of selective extinction of species and thus is important for determining mechanisms of species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes. In this study, we investigated the effects of forest fragment attributes and species' life-history traits on nestedness patterns of terrestrial mammals in an urban-forest mosaic in EThekwini Municipality Area, Durban, South Africa. A presence/absence matrix of mammals (16 species) in forest fragments (28 fragments) was compiled based on the mammalian survey conducted using remote-triggered camera traps. The mammalian assemblage in the study area displayed significant nestedness. The nested ranking of forest fragments was strongly correlated with fragment area and proximity index but not with shape index and foliage height diversity. The best model based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC(c)) showed that among species' life-history traits, body mass, trophic level, niche breadth and sociality were the most suited as predictors of extinction vulnerability. In particular, niche breadth was strongly associated with extinction vulnerability. Thus, the ability to persist in forest fragments of various sizes as well as the ability to move to fragments with different degrees of isolation shape fragment dynamics in this landscape. Furthermore, species with broad resource requirements are more likely to persist with further habitat disturbance. Overall, this study showed the importance of integrating forest fragment attributes and ecological traits of species in nestedness analyses for determining species in most need of conservation action which is important for preventing further loss of species.

AB Transformation of intact vegetation into new kinds and configurations of human-modified habitats is a well-established driver of biodiversity loss. Following initial conversion, many human-dominated landscapes are then subject to further large-scale changes in land use. The impacts on biodiversity of repeated changes in land use remain poorly known, particularly how changes in the matrix interact with initial patterns of vegetation clearing. We used an 18-yr study of birds in remnant patches of endangered temperate woodland in south-eastern Australia to quantify the spatial and temporal effects of successive land use transformation in the surrounding landscape. We examined bird response to (1) initial patterns of landscape modification (creating semi-cleared grazing land dominated by pastures that surrounded remnant woodland patches), (2) subsequent establishment and maturation of exotic tree plantations on the pastures surrounding woodland patches, and (3) additive and interactive effects of both types of landscape transformation. The majority of the 57 bird species modeled responded to conversion of grazing land to exotic plantations, either independently from initial patterns of landscape transformation (20 species), or interactively (18 species) or additively (15 species) with initial landscape transformation. The occurrence of only one species (the Common Bronzewing) was related to patterns of initial transformation but not subsequent transformation due to plantation establishment. Thus, despite many characteristics of the woodland patches within the plantation remaining largely unaltered throughout our 18-yr investigation, the matrix had a profound effect on the kinds of species inhabiting them, with such impacts often magnified over time as the matrix continued to change. Plantation establishment triggered new regional-level spatial processes with effects on birds detected in woodland patches up to 2 km away from the plantation. Matrix conversion selected for species with different traits (size, diet and movement patterns) compared to the initial transformation, suggesting it is acting as a different filter on the bird community. New kinds of landscape transformation (such as plantation establishment on previously cleared land) can radically affect the species that have persisted for many decades in previously modified landscapes. This highlights the challenges, but also opportunities, for conserving taxa in ever changing human-dominated environments.

   ENRICHMENT
AB By means of meta-analyses we determined how 70 traits related to plant anatomy, morphology, chemistry, physiology, growth and reproduction are affected by daily light integral (DLI; mol photons m(-2) d(-1)). A large database including 500 experiments with 760 plant species enabled us to determine generalized dose-response curves. Many traits increase with DLI in a saturating fashion. Some showed a more than 10-fold increase over the DLI range of 1-50 mol m(-2) d(-1), such as the number of seeds produced per plant and the actual rate of photosynthesis. Strong decreases with DLI (up to three-fold) were observed for leaf area ratio and leaf payback time. Plasticity differences among species groups were generally small compared with the overall responses to DLI. However, for a number of traits, including photosynthetic capacity and realized growth, we found woody and shade-tolerant species to have lower plasticity. We further conclude that the direction and degree of trait changes adheres with responses to plant density and to vertical light gradients within plant canopies. This synthesis provides a strong quantitative basis for understanding plant acclimation to light, from molecular to whole plant responses, but also identifies the variables that currently form weak spots in our knowledge, such as respiration and reproductive characteristics.

AB The pattern of a few abundant species and many rarer species is a defining characteristic of communities worldwide. These abundant species are often referred to as dominant species. Yet, despite their importance, the term dominant species is poorly defined and often used to convey different information by different authors. Based on a review of historical and contemporary definitions we develop a synthetic definition of dominant species. This definition incorporates the relative local abundance of a species, its ubiquity across the landscape, and its impact on community and ecosystem properties. A meta-analysis of removal studies shows that the loss of species identified as dominant by authors can significantly impact ecosystem functioning and community structure. We recommend two metrics that can be used jointly to identify dominant species in a given community and provide a roadmap for future avenues of research on dominant species. In our review, we make the case that the identity and effects of dominant species on their environments are key to linking patterns of diversity to ecosystem function, including predicting impacts of species loss and other aspects of global change on ecosystems.

AB Recent criticisms of, and financial limits on, payment for hydrologic services (PHS) programs suggest that rigorous, spatially explicit evaluations are urgently needed to improve their effectiveness in conserving forest cover and to justify payments. To evaluate the effectiveness of Mexico's PHS programs in the Pixquiac and Gavilanes subwatersheds in central Veracruz state, we used a grid-based approach to (1) compare the suitability of national versus regional deforestation risk models in selecting the parcels that should receive payment and (2) evaluate three metrics of program effectiveness in parcels receiving PHS: forest cover loss, additionality associated with deforestation risk, and leakage. Our results suggest that the national deforestation risk model was less effective at predicting actual deforestation patterns and tended to underestimate deforestation risk vs. models run regionally. Regional analysis showed parcels receiving PHS exhibited significantly lower deforestation in plots receiving PHS (0.76% loss) vs. control areas (6.29%) between 2003 and 2013. Furthermore, we found relatively poor additionality with only 38.5% of PHS occurring in zones with high or very high deforestation probability. Finally, we did not detect significant evidence of proximal leakage in our study subwatersheds. Our findings suggest that the PHS programs in central Veracruz have helped to reduce, but not stop forest loss completely. Using increased targeting of areas with higher deforestation risk in selecting PHS areas and updated regional deforestation risk models should be helpful in evaluating and increasing the effectiveness of these programs.

AB Human activities are causing a rapid loss of biodiversity, which impairs ecosystem functions and services. Therefore, understanding which processes shape how biodiversity is distributed along spatial and environmental gradients is a first step to guide conservation and management efforts. We aimed to determine the relative explanatory importance of biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial variables on assemblage dissimilarities and functional diversity of dung beetles along the Atlantic Forest-Pampa (i.e. forest-grassland) transition zone located in Southeast South America. We described each site according to their biogeographic position, environmental conditions, landscape features and spatial patterns. The compositional dissimilarity was partitioned into turnover and nestedness components of beta-diversity. Mantel tests and generalised dissimilarity models were used to relate beta-diversity and its components to biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial variables. Variation partitioning analysis was used to estimate the pure and shared variation in species composition and functional diversity explained by the four categories of predictors. Biome domain was the main factor causing dung beetle compositional dissimilarity, with a high species replacement between Atlantic Forest and Pampa. Biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial distances also affected the patterns of dung beetle dissimilarity and beta-diversity components. The shared effects of the four sets of predictors explained most of the variation in dung beetle composition. A similar response pattern was found for dung beetle functional diversity, which excluded biogeographic effects. Only the pure effects of environmental and spatial predictors were significant for species composition and functional diversity. Our results indicate that dung beetle species composition and functional diversity are jointly driven by environmental, landscape and spatial predictors with higher pure environmental and spatial effects. The forest-grassland transition zone promotes a strong species and trait replacement highly influenced both by environmental filtering and dispersal limitation.

AB The annual growth and wood characteristics of tree species at southern Mediterranean countries, and its relationship with climate variables are recently two important topics for the researchers in this region. Although Moringa peregrina (Forssk.) Fiori is a key species in Africa due to its medicinal and economic values (e.g. as fuel, food and water purifier), little is known about its annual growth or its response to climate variables. In this study, we analyze its dendrochronological potential, macroscopic and microscopic wood structure, and correlation with climate. Wood discs were collected from two desert sites in Egypt Saint Catherine (SC) and Hurghada (HG). Wood discs and micro-slides were prepared, and the distinctness and pattern of rings, vessels, and ray structure were examined microscopically. The ring boundaries of M. peregrina were distinct and marked by thick-walled and flattened fibers. For the HG site, the resulting ring-width chronology spans 16 years, from 2001 to 2016. A significant positive relationship was found between tree growth at HG and precipitation prior to the vegetation period (January-March). April temperature of the year prior to growth had a significant positive relationship with M. peregrina growth. In contrast, April and May-August temperatures of the current growing season had a significant negative relationship with tree growth. We could not develop a chronology for M. peregrina at SC site due to the presence of growth anomalies in the collected wood discs from the site. Consequently, we did not get a clear picture on the climate- annual growth relationship for M. peregrina trees at this site. At SC, M. peregrina trees respond to stressful environmental conditions by adjusting their anatomical structure to produce a high number of small vessels. Moreover, there was spatial variability in the architecture of ray parenchyma that reflected the degree of stress in both sites. The results of this study improve our understanding of the growth-climate relationship in sub-tropical trees and the potential role of ray parenchyma in stressed environments.

   HYPOTHESIS
AB Plant-soil feedback (PSF) theory provides a powerful framework for understanding plant dynamics by integrating growth assays into predictions of whether soil communities stabilise plant-plant interactions. However, we lack a comprehensive view of the likelihood of feedback-driven coexistence, partly because of a failure to analyse pairwise PSF, the metric directly linked to plant species coexistence. Here, we determine the relative importance of plant evolutionary history, traits, and environmental factors for coexistence through PSF using a meta-analysis of 1038 pairwise PSF measures. Consistent with eco-evolutionary predictions, feedback is more likely to mediate coexistence for pairs of plant species (1) associating with similar guilds of mycorrhizal fungi, (2) of increasing phylogenetic distance, and (3) interacting with native microbes. We also found evidence for a primary role of pathogens in feedback-mediated coexistence. By combining results over several independent studies, our results confirm that PSF may play a key role in plant species coexistence, species invasion, and the phylogenetic diversification of plant communities.

AB The patch mosaic-development stage model posits the unity of patches and development stages in primeval temperate forests and links patchiness to the synchronized, coarse-scale canopy senescence, and breakup processes that initiate the demographic transition to new regeneration patches that then asynchronously progress through sequential development stages. Subtle structural differences and inconsistent transitions among development stages observed in primeval forests such as Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) set expected coarse-scale canopy senescence against observed, predominantly fine-scale canopy-gap dynamics. Applying a multi-scale approach to quantify the extent to which stages are characterized by the interspersion of neighborhoods of variously sized trees (i.e., patch types), we investigated patchiness and structural differences in nine Oriental beech stands classified into Initial, Optimum, and Decay stages. Differences among stages in patch type richness and composition occurred primarily at the finest scales and diminished rapidly with increasing scale. Most patch types were ubiquitous and the few patch types unique to a particular stage occurred at very low abundances. Patch types composed of advance regeneration were most prevalent in the Initial stage, but were absorbed into the matrix structure at scales>500m(2). In all three stages, the most heterogeneous patch type encompassed>90% of all trees at scales>100m(2). To portray fine-scale dynamics resulting in similar patch type compositions and structures across development stages, we introduce and discuss the new patch mosaic-gap reabsorption model that avoids the unity of patch and demographic stage to focus instead on structural stages.

AB Differences in feeding performance and aggressive abilities between species and sexes of hummingbirds are often associated with the partitioning of their food sources, but whether such partitioning results in floral isolation (reproductive isolation at the stage of pollination) has received little attention. We examined components of floral isolation and pollinator effectiveness of Heliconia caribaea and H. bihai on the island of Dominica, West Indies. The short flowers of H. caribaea match the short bills of male Anthracothorax jugularis, its primary pollinator, whereas the long flowers of H. bihai match the long bills of female A. jugularis, its primary pollinator. In pollination experiments, both sexes of A. jugularis were equally effective at pollinating the short flowers of H. caribaea, which they preferred to H. bihai, whereas females were more effective at pollinating the long flowers of H. bihai. Moreover, an average difference in length of 12mm between H. caribaea and H. bihai flowers did not prevent heterospecific pollen transfer, and both sexes transported pollen between the two plant species. In field studies using powdered dyes as pollen analogs, however, heterospecific pollen transfer was minimal, with only 2 of 168 flowers receiving dye from the other species. The length of H. bihai flowers acted as an exploitation barrier to male A. jugularis, which were unable to completely remove nectar from 88% of the flowers they visited. In contrast, interference competition combined with high floral fidelity through traplining prevented female A. jugularis from transferring pollen between the two Heliconia species. A combination of exploitation barriers, interference and exploitative competition, and pollinator preferences maintains floral isolation between these heliconias, and may have contributed to the evolution of this hummingbird-plant system.

AB Aim Climate affects the flowering time of many species. Little is known, however, about how climate influences the properties of regional floras, including the rate at which taxa flower sequentially throughout the flowering season. This study is the first to detect geographical variation in this rate across North America. In addition, we tested for the independent effects of intraspecific variation in flowering time and taxonomic composition on the rate of sequential flowering among regional floras distributed across a temperature gradient. Location North America. Time period This study examined >59,000 herbarium specimens that were collected in flower from 1901 to 2013. Major taxa studied 2,803 angiosperm taxa. Methods We identified 51 climatically homogeneous regions across the continental, mostly western states of the USA, in each of which >= 100 species were represented by herbarium specimens. We then examined the effects of mean annual temperature (MAT) on the rate of sequential flowering among species in each region. We also evaluated whether geographical variation in the rate of sequential flowering was attributable to intraspecific variation in the flowering time and/or the taxonomic composition of regional floras. Results As MAT increased over space, the rate of sequential flowering (standardized by the absolute length of the flowering season in each region) increased among relatively early-flowering taxa but decreased among the latest-flowering taxa. Both intraspecific variation and shifts in taxonomic composition among floras contributed to this pattern. Main conclusions Among floras throughout North America, the rate of sequential flowering among co-occurring taxa changes with MAT. Intraspecific phenological variation primarily affects the rate of sequential flowering during the first half of the growing season, consistent with the inference that future warming will most strongly affect flowering synchrony among early-flowering taxa.

AB Aim The relationship between the proportion of sites occupied by a species and the area of a site [occupancy-area relationship (OAR)] offers key information for biodiversity management and has long fascinated ecologists. We quantified the variation in OAR for 3,157 woody species in 17 forest plots worldwide and tested the relative importance of environment and species traits for explaining this variation and evaluated overall model predictive ability. Location Global. Time period Early 21st century. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods We used mixed-effect regression to examine the observed shape of the OAR (its "slope") against species-specific and plot-wide predictors: coarse-grain occupancy, tree size, plot species richness, energy availability and topographic complexity. Results We found large variation in OAR slopes, and the variation was strongest among species within plots. The OAR slopes showed a latitudinal trend and were steeper near the equator. As predicted, coarse-grain occupancy and tree size negatively affected OAR slopes, whereas species richness had a positive effect and explained most of the variance between plots. Although hypothesized directionalities were broadly confirmed, traits and environment had relatively limited overall predictive power. Main conclusions These results document the variation of the OAR for 3,157 species at near-global extent. We found a latitudinal gradient in OAR slopes and confirmed key hypothesized predictors. But at this global extent and over the large set of species analysed, the remaining unexplained variation in OAR slopes was substantial. Nevertheless, this large-scale empirical analysis of the OAR offers an initial step towards a more general use of OARs for the fine-scale prediction of species distributions and abundance.

AB Many successful invasive species have generalist diets, but the extent to which they can track changing resources has seldom been documented. Stable isotope analysis was used to measure dietary shifts with ontogeny and over time in relation to changes in prey availability for Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois sp.). These are invasive predators that are well established throughout the western North Atlantic and Caribbean where they have caused significant decreases in native reef fish populations in some areas. Samples and observations were made off New Providence Island, Bahamas during the summers of 2008 and 2010. Lionfish delta N-15 and delta C-13 values increased only weakly with body length, suggesting that processes other than growth also contribute to stable isotope variability. The trophic niche of lionfish changed significantly between years, concomitant with large changes in native fish prey abundance and community structure. The trophic niche of large lionfish expanded, increasing in trophic diversity at the population level and showing lower individual trophic similarity, while that of small lionfish remained similar in size but shifted towards more N-15-enriched and C-13-depleted prey sources. The ability of lionfish to modify their diet over time may have facilitated their expansion and persistence at high densities in some areas despite local prey depletion.

AB Urban parks are likely the last green areas to preserve fauna diversity in urban ecosystems. We predicted that 1) species richness and ant diversity would increase with increasing park size, and species richness and ant diversity would be inversely related to distance from a peri-urban forest. 2) Larger ants would be predictably prevalent in less-complex habitats but the reverse should be true for small ants. The study was conducted in 47 parks of varying size located in Taichung City, Taiwan. In total, 14,324 ant individuals from 50 morphospecies and 22 genera were collected. No relationship between ant diversity and distance from a peri-urban forest. No significant clustering in functional composition with increasing park size and distance from a peri-urban forest. However, urban ant diversity marginally increased with increasing park size. Larger parks, characterize by heterogeneous fine-scale habitats, had the highest ant species and abundance of ants. The prevalences of opportunist, generalised myrmicinae (GM), and cryptic ant species were linked to increased soil moisture, number of tree species, and leaf litter depth. The positive association between GM and the number of trash bins. Our finding disproved the size-grain hypothesis, but hotter ground surface favored the presence of long-legged ants. The significant association between head width, inter-eye distance, eye width, and environmental variables such as understory vegetation cover, leaf litter depth, and soil temperature suggest that predaceous ants might be prevalent in heterogeneous fine-scale local microhabitats. In conclusion, our study evidenced the importance of heterogeneous fine-scale habitats in urban park to biodiversity.

AB Understanding the relative roles of species interactions and environmental factors in structuring communities has historically focused on local scales where manipulative experiments are possible. However, recent interest in predicting the effects of climate change and species invasions has spurred increasing attention to processes occurring at larger spatial and temporal scales. The "meta-ecosystem" approach is an ideal framework for integrating processes operating at multiple scales as it explicitly considers the influence of local biotic interactions and regional flows of energy, materials, and organisms on community structure. Using a comparative-experimental design, we asked (1) what is the relative importance of local biotic interactions and oceanic processes in determining rocky intertidal community structure in the low zone within the Northern California Current System, and (2) what factors are most important in regulating this structure and why? We focused on functional group interactions between macrophytes and sessile invertebrates and their consumers (grazers, predators), how these varied across spatial scales, and with ocean-driven conditions (upwelling, temperature) and ecological subsidies (nutrients, phytoplankton, sessile invertebrate recruits). Experiments were conducted at 13 sites divided across four capes in Oregon and northern California. Results showed that biotic interactions were variable in space and time but overall, sessile invertebrates had no effect on macrophytes while macrophytes had weakly negative effects on sessile invertebrates. Consumers, particularly predators, also had weakly negative effects on both functional groups. Overall, we found that 40-49% of the variance in community structure at the local scale was explained by external factors (e.g., spatial scale, time, upwelling, temperature, ecological subsidies) vs. 19-39% explained by functional group interactions. When individual functional group interaction strengths were used, only 2-3% of the variation was explained by any one functional group while 28-54% of the variation was explained by external factors. We conclude that community structure in the low intertidal zone is driven primarily by external factors at the regional scale with local biotic interactions playing a secondary role.

AB In the developing world, the exploitation of threatened species jeopardizes their permanence in the wild. Because not all captures are intentional, for instance when capture methods have low selectivity, pressure on these species may be lessened by releasing living incidentally caught animals. However, it is often unrealistic to expect people to voluntarily do so because it means foregoing the benefits of resource extraction. Financial incentives for such animal release may foster conservation objectives. Reducing human-animal conflicts, protecting natural habitat, and conserving nests of threatened species are examples of conservation benefits that can be built on financial reward systems. However, incentives aiming to protect unintentionally captured threatened species are scarce. We considered pay for release, a type of ecosystem-service payment designed to foster the release of incidentally captured threatened species. We aimed to determine the best conditions to implement this scheme, its potential benefits (e.g., incentivizing the release of threatened species), and pitfalls and priority research needs (e.g., required conditions for pay for release to work) to show that its global applicability is possible. Given that approaches solely based on education and law enforcement may be ineffective under some circumstances, we argue that pay for release can protect incidentally captured endangered species if used under conditions conducive for its success. When local participants' intrinsic motivation for conservation is weak, but the release of incidentally live-caught animals into their habitats is readily achievable, pay-for-release schemes could jump start urgently needed conservation efforts against indiscriminate animal harvesting.

AB The use of fire by cattle ranchers is a major source of conflict between conservationists and local communities in tropical savannas. We evaluate the role of traditional pastoral management in wildfire prevention in two protected areas within the Brazilian savanna. Fine-grain field data from transect walks and interviews were combined with geospatial data at landscape scale to compare fire regimes in community-managed areas with those in government-managed areas. Local pastoral management creates seasonal mosaic patterns of burnings performed for productive activities and for deliberate landscape management, i.e. to protect fire-sensitive vegetation and avoid wildfires. Whereas government-managed areas were affected by large biennial late dry season wildfires, community-managed areas with a regular fire regime suffered less damage. These systems are under threat and poorly understood by researchers and environmental managers. In order to improve fire management in tropical savannas, greater understanding of pastoral management practices and their spatiotemporal dimensions is required.

AB Insects are involved in the biogeochemical cycles of multiple elements and influence soil fertility. In particular, soil insects and the functions that they support can affect the response of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes. We experimentally studied the role of dung beetles as recyclers of cow dung in drylands of the Central Monte in mid-western Argentina; and we extrapolated these results to ecosystem impact in a grazing field, considering the dung beetle's abundance in summer. We conducted experiments with four species of dung beetles (Sulcophanaeus imperator, Eucranium arachnoides, Digitonthophagus gazelle and Malagoniella puncticollis), and quantified their abundance on the field. Dung beetles incorporated nitrogen, ammonium, and phosphorous to the soil, but this activity varied substantially among species. The highest quantity of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphate was incorporated to the soil by S. imperator, one of the larger beetle studied. While the per capita effect of S. imperator is superior to other species studied, the impact on the ecosystem of the invasive D. gazelle might be superior due to their major abundance in grazing fields. Our results highlight the importance of considering both components, per capita effect and abundance, to estimate with more reliability the relative importance of dung beetle species. Given that the effect of dung beetles on nutrient cycling is variable among species, and their abundance is variable in space, it is important to conserve beetle diversity in order to maximize their beneficial impacts on soils. Therefore, dung beetle effect on soil might be crucial in drylands to mitigate the nitrogen losses caused by grazing.

AB In 2001, the Pacific Fishery Management Council established 2 large (10878 and 260 km(2)) Southern California Bight marine reserves called Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) in response to declining abundance of west coast rockfishes, particularly overfished cowcod. Following closure, no fishery-independent monitoring took place for groundfishes within the CCAs through 2013. To assess the impact of the closures, we sampled multiple sites inside and outside CCAs from 2014 to 2016 via the Northwest Fisheries Science Center's Hook and Line Survey. We investigated variations in catch per unit effort (CPUE), size, length frequency and percent of sites with positive catch for 14 abundant groundfishes (bank, bocaccio, chilipepper, copper, cowcod, greenspotted, lingcod, olive, rosy, speckled, squarespot, starry, swordspine and the vermilion-sunset complex). General linear models that included area, year, depth and distance from port revealed significantly greater CPUE inside CCAs for 11 species. CPUE for lingcod, copper rockfish and vermilion-sunset was significantly or near-significantly lower inside the CCAs. We saw significant or near-significant differences in size (12 species) and length-frequency distributions (10 species), with larger fish present inside CCAs. The percentage of sites positive for individual species tended to be greater inside CCAs (11 species). We also observed significantly elevated species richness (species per site) and total CPUE inside CCAs. Results indicate larger individuals and greater CPUE for multiple rockfishes inside CCAs either as a result of effective management or perhaps pre-existing conditions.

AB Network analysis is a powerful tool to understand community-level plant-pollinator interactions. We evaluated the role of floral visitors on plant fitness through a series of pollination exclusion experiments to test the effectiveness of pollinators of an Ipomoea community in the Pacific coast of Mexico, including: (1) all flower visitors, (2) visitors that contact the reproductive organs, (3) visitors that deposit pollen on stigmas, and (4) visitors that mediate fruit and seed production. Our results show that networks built from effective pollination interactions are smaller, less connected, more specialized and modular than floral visitor networks. Modules are associated with pollinator functional groups and they provide strong support for pollination syndromes only when non-effective interactions are excluded. In contrast to other studies, the analyzed networks are not nested. Our results also show that only 59% of floral visitors were legitimate pollinators that contribute to seed production. Furthermore, only 27% of the links in visitation network resulted in seed production. Our study shows that plant-pollination networks that consider effectiveness measures of pollination in addition to floral visitation provide insightful information about the different role floral visitors play in a community, encompassing a large number of commensalistic/antagonistic interactions and the more restricted set of mutualistic relationships that underlie the evolution of convergent floral phenotypes in plants.

AB Both niche and stochastic dispersal processes structure the extraordinary diversity of tropical plants, but determining their relative contributions has proven challenging. We address this question using airborne imaging spectroscopy to estimate canopy beta-diversity for an extensive region of a Bornean rainforest and challenge these data with models incorporating niches and dispersal. We show that remotely sensed and field-derived estimates of pairwise dissimilarity in community composition are closely matched, proving the applicability of imaging spectroscopy to provide beta-diversity data for entire landscapes of over 1000 ha containing contrasting forest types. Our model reproduces the empirical data well and shows that the ecological processes maintaining tropical forest diversity are scale dependent. Patterns of beta-diversity are shaped by stochastic dispersal processes acting locally whilst environmental processes act over a wider range of scales.

AB Questions We examined the spatial patterns of dominant canopy species in a tropical forest to investigate: (a) what is the niche occupancy of canopy species with respect to topographic gradients; (b) what are the dominant ecological processes that explain their distribution; (c) what are the interactions among the most prevalent canopy species; and (d) what are the interactions between canopy species adults and juveniles trees? Location Rabi permanent CTFS-ForestGEO plot, Gabon. Methods We selected the four most abundant canopy species and one timber species. We used Berman's test to determine the effect of three topographic variables on the distribution of each species and univariate analysis to model the spatial pattern of each species using either an inhomogeneous Poisson process or an inhomogeneous Cox process. We also used a bivariate form of the pair correlation function (PCF) to determine the spatial interaction between species and the correlation among conspecific adult and juvenile trees. Results Four of the five species had aggregated spatial patterns while Lophira alata showed spatial randomness. Most of the variance in the local tree density was explained by within-population dispersal processes rather than environmental factors. Bivariate PCF tests showed significant segregation between species associations. Two species exhibited aggregation at small distances between young and adult trees, while others showed either complete spatial randomness at small inter-tree distances or segregation at large distances. Conclusions This study showed that the spatial pattern in the majority of canopy species was aggregation. Seed dispersal limitation mainly explained the observed aggregation pattern. Habitat filtering, as evidenced by the influence of topographic variables on niche occupancy, marginally, yet significantly, explained this pattern. The different spatial patterns of the principal species permit their coexistence. Spatial segregation among adult and juvenile trees reveals a strong pattern of either species-specific seed predation or pathogens.

AB Repeated, grid-based forest soil inventories such as the National Forest Soil Inventory of Germany (NFSI) aim, among other things, at detecting changes in soil properties and plant nutrition. In these types of inventories, the only information on soil phosphorus (P) is commonly the total P content. However, total P content in mineral soils of forests is usually not a meaningful variable with respect to predicting the availability of P to trees. Here we tested a modified sequential P extraction according to Hedley (1982) to determine the distribution of different plant-available P fractions in soil samples (at depths of 0-5 and 10-30 cm) from 146 NFSI sites, encompassing a wide variety of soil conditions. In addition, we analyzed relationships between these P fractions and common soil properties such as pH, texture, and soil organic carbon content (SOC). The total P content among our samples ranged from approximately 60 to 2800 mg kg(-1). The labile, moderately labile, and stable P fractions contributed to 27 %, 51 %, and 22 % of the total P content, respectively, at a depth of 0-5 cm. At a depth of 10-30 cm, the labile P fractions decreased to 15 %, whereas the stable P fractions increased to 30 %. These changes with depth were accompanied by a decrease in the organic P fractions. High P contents were related to high pH values. While the labile Hedley P pool increased with decreasing pH in absolute and relative terms, the stable Hedley P pool decreased in absolute and relative terms. Increasing SOC in soils led to significant increases in all Hedley P pools and in total P. In sandy soils, the P content across all fractions was lower than in other soil texture types. Multiple linear regression models indicated that Hedley P pools and P fractions were moderately well related to soil properties (with r(2) values that were mostly above 0.5), and that the sand content of soils had the strongest influence. Foliar P contents in Pinus sylvestris were reasonably well explained by the labile and moderately labile P pool (r(2) = 0.67) but not so for Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica. Foliar P contents in all three species could not be related to specific Hedley P pools. Our study indicates that soil properties such as pH, SOC content, and soil texture may be used to predict certain soil Hedley P pools with different plant availability on the basis of large soil inventories. However, the foliar P contents of tree species cannot be sufficiently well predicted by the soil variables considered here.

AB Upon advances in sequencing techniques, more and more morphologically identical organisms are identified as cryptic species. Often, mutualistic interactions are proposed as drivers of diversification. Species of the neotropical parabiotic ant association between Crematogaster levior and Camponotus femoratus are known for highly diverse cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles, which in insects serve as desiccation barrier but also as communication cues. In the present study, we investigated the association of the ants' CHC profiles with genotypes and morphological traits, and discovered cryptic species pairs in both genera. To assess putative niche differentiation between the cryptic species, we conducted an environmental association study that included various climate variables, canopy cover, and mutualistic plant species. Although mostly sympatric, the two Camponotus species seem to prefer different climate niches. However in the two Crematogaster species, we could not detect any differences in niche preference. The strong differentiation in the CHC profiles may thus suggest a possible role during speciation itself either by inducing assortative mating or by reinforcing sexual selection after the speciation event. We did not detect any further niche differences in the environmental parameters tested. Thus, it remains open how the cryptic species avoid competitive exclusion, with scope for further investigations.

AB Gastropod shells are vital resources for hermit crabs for their growth, reproduction and survival. However, the land hermit crab Coenobita spinosus, which lives in wet and dark coastal forests, sheds its shell. In the present study, to understand this unique behaviour in terms of its ecological and evolutionary aspects, we examined shell utilization and shell-shedding behaviour by C. spinosus as well as sympatric C. brevimanus as a reference. We searched for land hermit crabs during the night on the island of Guam. The shells of the crabs were grasped with the fingers and held up in the air; then, crab behaviour (shell shed or not shed), body size of the crab, and shell length were recorded. Almost all individuals of C. brevimanus occupied shells of invasive giant African snails, and the larger crabs occupied larger shells, whereas C. spinosus occupied smaller snail shells. C. spinosus also utilized nut shells and plastic caps, which were much smaller than the snail shells. Our results suggest that niche differentiation in terms of shell use might have occurred through a shift in shell utilization by C. spinosus to smaller shell types. When the shells of the crabs were held up, a large proportion of C. spinosus individuals shed their shells, whereas almost all C. brevimanus retreated into and hid in their shells. It is known that diurnal birds prey on land hermit crabs. We hypothesize that when a bird grasps a shell of C. spinosus with its bill, the crab itself could be retained within the ground debris through the shell-shedding behaviour, thereby reducing the predation risk. Our hypotheses should be tested by elucidating the original shell use habits and predator-prey interactions of C. spinosus in populations on islands without invasive snails.

AB A central prediction of niche theory is that biotic communities are structured by niche differentiation arising from competition. To date, there have been numerous studies of niche differentiation in local ant communities, but little attention has been given to the macroecology of niche differentiation, including the extent to which particular biomes show distinctive patterns of niche structure across their global ranges. We investigated patterns of niche differentiation and competition in ant communities in tropical rainforests, using different baits reflecting the natural food spectrum. We examined the extent of temporal and dietary niche differentiation and spatial segregation of ant communities at five rainforest sites in the neotropics, paleotropics, and tropical Australia. Despite high niche overlap, we found significant dietary and temporal niche differentiation in every site. However, there was no spatial segregation among foraging ants at the community level, despite strong competition for preferred food resources. Although sucrose, melezitose, and dead insects attracted most ants, some species preferentially foraged on seeds, living insects, or bird feces. Moreover, most sites harbored more diurnal than nocturnal species. Overall niche differentiation was strongest in the least diverse site, possibly due to its lower number of rare species. Both temporal and dietary differentiation thus had strong effects on the ant assemblages, but their relative importance varied markedly among sites. Our analyses show that patterns of niche differentiation in ant communities are highly idiosyncratic even within a biome, such that a mechanistic understanding of the drivers of niche structure in ant communities remains elusive.

AB Fire and herbivory both remove aboveground biomass. Environmental factors determine the type and intensity of these consumers globally, but the traits of plants can also alter their propensity to burn and the degree to which they are eaten. To understand plant life-history strategies associated with fire and herbivory we need to describe both response and effect functional traits, and how they sort within communities, along resource gradients, and across evolutionary timescales. Fire and herbivore functional traits are generally considered separately, but there are advances made in understanding fire that relate to herbivory, and vice versa. Moreover, fire and herbivory interact: the presence of one consumer affects the type and intensity of the other. Here, we present a unifying conceptual framework to understand plant strategies that enable tolerance and persistence to fire and herbivory. Using grasses as an example, we discuss how flammability and fire tolerance, palatability, and grazing tolerance traits might organize themselves in ecosystems exposed to these consumers, and how these traits might have evolved with reference to other strong selective processes, like aridity. Our framework can be used to predict both the diversity of life-history strategies and plant species diversity under different consumer regimes.

AB Trees of montane cloud forests (MCFs) often have small and isolated populations and face numerous threats. Due to limited conservation resources, management decisions are often based on scarce biological information. This study investigated the current status of populations of the critically endangered oak species Quercus arbutifolia in southern China, including its distribution, threats, population structure, and area of occupancy (AOO). Additionally, by using ensembles of small models (ESMs), the present and future (2050) distributions of climatically suitable habitats were predicted throughout south China and Vietnam. The present distribution of Q. arbutifolia is extremely fragmented, with only eight confirmed populations and a very small number of individuals (ca. 1200 in total). The results presented here show that Q. arbutifolia populations suffer from habitat destruction and fragmentation, small population size, unbalanced population structure, and pressure from strong competitor species, even though all known occurrences of Q. arbutifolia are in already established nature reserves. Based on the utilized models, the current potential distribution is limited to MCFs, and 17 new areas were predicted to have complete habitats suitability for Q. arbutifolia. However, only a small area in Fujian province will remain suitable for Q. arbutifolia in the future. The current AOO of Q. arbutifolia is very small (8.49 km(2)), with one-third of all populations predicted to be extinct by 2050, even under the minimum emission assumption. Finally, various actions and conservation measures, such as search for new unknown populations as well as ex situ and in situ conservation, are introduced and discussed in this paper.

AB Smallholder farmers might adopt different farming practices to cope with multiple stressors depending on their livelihood assets, and with varying environmental and economic outcomes. Ongoing global change is triggering stronger and different stressors that threaten conventional farming practices; however, this could be resolved if livelihood assets that drive decision making are actionable and thus can be modified. This study assessed the influence of farmers' livelihood assets, risk perception, and shocks on the choice of non-conventional farming practices for smallholder coffee farmers in San Martin, Peru. Using household survey data, we collected data on 162 coffee plantations along an elevation gradient. We operationalized the sustainable livelihoods framework for the adoption of shade and input coffee farming strategies and explored farmers' motives to change them. Despite associated high risks with pest and disease pressure, coffee price volatility and climate change, these risks did not explain the current shade and input farming strategies. While in the past five years, farmers adapted shade and input management in response to pest and disease and climate change pressures, these occurred in diverging directions: we found higher human and social assets associated with higher shade levels, and a trend for higher physical and financial assets associated with higher input use. These findings illustrate that two main factors affect decisions on farming practices related to shade and input management and they relate to different livelihood capitals. This suggests a potential for conflicting decision-making, push-and-pulling decisions in different directions. Further the disconnect between livelihood assets and perceptions suggests that perception of risk and shocks might not be sufficient to motivate decision making under changing conditions. Such insights in decision making typologies and drivers can inform the development of farming practices that enhance resilience and sustainability of smallholder coffee production in Peru and elsewhere in the tropics.<bold> </bold>

AB This study deploys the livelihoods theory in political ecology together with integrated methods including remote sensing, participatory geographic information systems, interviews and focus group discussions to explore the intricate and dynamic linkages between perennial wildfires and household food insecurity among smallholder farmers in the northern savannah zone of Ghana. Our results suggest that wildfires are a major pathway to household food insecurity in two ways, as perceived by the farmers. First, in instances where wildfires destroy the major crops of smallholders, they are unable to find enough food for the lean season which results in transitory food insecurity. Secondly, in the long term, the environmental impacts of wildfires on the soil lead to lower yields and inadequate food to meet household nutritional needs. Farmers then deploy certain strategies such as early-harvesting and switching to early-maturing crops to avoid with the perennial fires and these strategies further reinforce other dimensions of food insecurity such as nutrition insecurity. Because livelihoods strategies such as crop farming, hunting, charcoal production and herding intersect in the northern savannah zone, we recommend policy options that will engage community members in finding common ways of using shared spaces sustainably. Government should also adopt policies that will encourage domestication of certain livelihood strategies such as cattle herding.

AB The soil microbial community and edaphic factors in the rhizosphere and bulk soils of Hedysarum scoparium were investigated at seven arid desert locations in northwest China in July 2016. Plant and edaphic factors had significant effects on the community composition and functional diversity of soil microbes. Bacteria (ranging from 2.57 to 4.23 nmol g(-1)) contributed the most to the microbial community composition, followed by actinomycetes, followed by fungi. Carbohydrates, polymers, and carboxylic acids were the main carbon sources for soil microorganisms. Principal component analysis showed that the carbon source catabolism of soil microorganisms was higher in the rhizosphere than in bulk soils. Spearman correlation analyses revealed that the content of Gram-negative bacteria was significantly negatively correlated with the amino acids and that the content of AM fungi was significantly positively correlated with the carbohydrates and amines. Soil organic carbon, pH, and ammoniacal-N were significant predictors of microbial community composition, whereas soil organic carbon, phosphatase activity, and soil moisture were closely correlated with microbial carbon catabolism. This study indicated that soil microbial community composition and functional diversity are influenced by plants, nutrient availability, and enzymatic activity in the arid desert and serve as useful indicators for evaluating the soil quality and function of the desert ecosystem based on their relationships with the microbial community and soil nutrient distribution.

AB The ecosystem-level consequences of agricultural land use in Neotropical forests have not been fully studied. In areas like the Choco-Darien, conflict exists between the conservation of highly diverse ecosystems and the use of economically important production areas. Current agricultural practices involve complete deforestation, with consequent multiple effects on stream ecosystems. To address the issue of land use change in tropical rivers of Ecuador, we studied streams draining 3 different land use types in the Mashpi River drainage (Ecuadorian Choco): (1) pristine montane cloud forest, (2) organic farms that included forest patches, and (3) palmito (Bactris gasipaes) production land with extensive use of the insecticide endosulfan and the herbicide glyphosate. We sampled macroinvertebrates (quantitative and qualitative samples) and periphyton, and measured environmental variables during dry and wet seasons, and found a direct relationship between the decline of certain macroinvertebrate groups (e.g., Anacroneuria, Hyallela) and the type of land use. Furthermore, we found that species loss in streams draining organic farms was negligible. Species richness of macroinvertebrates was considerably lower in palmito monoculture farmlands than in the other 2 types of land use. Stream communities of the Mashpi drainage area have been transformed by human agricultural disturbances, and urgent changes to land management practices are necessary.

AB The Amazon rain forest experiences the combined pressures from human-made deforestation and progressing climate change, causing severe and potentially disruptive perturbations of the ecosystem's integrity and stability. To intensify research on critical aspects of Amazonian biosphere-atmosphere exchange, the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) has been established in the central Amazon Basin. Here we present a multi-year analysis of backward trajectories to derive an effective footprint region of the observatory, which spans large parts of the particularly vulnerable eastern basin. Further, we characterize geospatial properties of the footprint regions, such as climatic conditions, distribution of ecoregions, land cover categories, deforestation dynamics, agricultural expansion, fire regimes, infrastructural development, protected areas, and future deforestation scenarios. This study is meant to be a resource and reference work, helping to embed the ATTO observations into the larger context of human-caused transformations of Amazonia. We conclude that the chances to observe an unperturbed rain forest-atmosphere exchange at the ATTO site will likely decrease in the future, whereas the atmospheric signals from human-made and climate-change-related forest perturbations will increase in frequency and intensity.

AB That both stochastic neutral and deterministic niche forces are in effect in shaping the community assembly and diversity maintenance is becoming an increasingly important consensus. However, assessing the effects of disease on the balance between the two forces in the human microbiome has not been explored to the best of our knowledge. In this article, we applied a hybrid model to address this issue by analyzing the potential effect of HIV infection on the human gut microbiome and adopted a further step of multimodality testing to improve the interpretation of their model. Our study revealed that although niche process is the dominant force in shaping human gut microbial communities, niche process- and neutral process-driven taxa could coexist in the same microbiome, confirming the notion of their joint responsibility. However, we failed to detect the effect of HIV infection in changing the balance. This suggests that the rule governing community assembly and diversity maintenance may be changed by the disturbance from HIV infection-caused dysbiosis. Although we admit that the general question of disease effect on community assembly and diversity maintenance may still be an open question, our study presents the first piece of evidence to reject the significant influence of diseases.

AB Aim Area thresholds, at which the form of the species-area relationship (SAR) changes abruptly, have played an important role in the theoretical framework of conservation biogeography and biodiversity research. The application of piecewise regressions has been advocated as a rigorous statistical technique to identify such thresholds within SARs, but a large variety of piecewise models remains untested. We explore the prevalence and number of thresholds in SARs and examine whether the currently widely used method for detecting the small island effect (SIE) is robust. Location Global. Taxon We consider all multicellular taxa based on the criteria of datasets selection. Methods We apply 15 regression models, including linear regression and piecewise regressions with two and three segments to 68 global island datasets that are sourced from the literature. Results The number of area thresholds in SARs varied among groups and correlated positively with area range of a studied system. Under the AIC or AIC(c) criterion, three-segment piecewise models were more prevalent, whereas under the BIC criterion, two-segment piecewise models were more prevalent. From the results of Aegean Sea isopods, West Indies herpetofauna, and Australian Islands mammals, we found evidence that the traditional criteria for detection of SIEs are not robust. Main conclusions Our study demonstrates that (a) to detect an SIE, the comparison should use as many models as possible, including not only variants with and without a left-horizontal part, but also those with two and more segments; (b) naive use of the traditional two-segment piecewise regressions may cause poor estimations of both slope and breakpoint values; (c) the number of thresholds increases with the area range of a studied system; (d) conservation biologists and applied ecologists should determine the number of area thresholds when estimating the precise species-area patterns and making management strategies in fragmented landscapes.

AB The origin and early evolution of South American rodents are ongoing subjects of debate. The caviomorphs of the Peruvian localities of Santa Rosa and Contamana are the oldest South American rodents so far known. The Santa Rosa rodents are abundant and diverse, but dating was based on biostratigraphy (?Eocene), whereas in various Contamana sites radiometric dates, vertebrate biochronology and paly-nostratigraphy suggest an age of 41.6-40.94 Ma (late middle Eocene). Previous faunal comparisons between the localities have identified few shared taxa. Here we studied new and previously described rodent fossils from Santa Rosa and analysed their biochronological and biogeographical implications. We recognize five new taxa and three genera for Santa Rosa, four of them previously known only from the Eocene Contamana region. Thus, the Santa Rosa and the late middle Eocene Contamana assemblages appear to be chronologically closer than previously thought. An ?Eocene age for Santa Rosa is substantiated by other mammals reported from Santa Rosa. With 11 named genera and 15 species, the Santa Rosa rodents represent the most species-rich South American Palaeogene rodent assemblage known. The Eocene radiation in the Neotropics that gave rise to this diversity was not associated with an immediate geographical dispersion to higher latitudes, perhaps because different biogeographical barriers or factors of competition delayed their dispersal. Evidence suggests that replacement, rather than a persistence of conservative long-lasting lineages, was the dominant process among Palaeogene tropical caviomorph rodents.

AB In fragmented landscapes, the composition, diversity, and abundance of communities of various groups of organisms change from the edge inward the forest. To assess such changes in dung beetle assemblages, transects were established perpendicular to the edge in remnants of forest immersed in a heterogeneous matrix. The transects were in three types of edge: Forest-pastures, forest-natural regeneration and forest-highway, each with eight sampling stations at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 m from the edge towards the inside, and 30 and 60 m from the edge towards the matrix. At each station, we set up a pitfall trap baited with human excrement. Six environmental variables were evaluated. The changes in the assemblage of dung beetles were dependent of the edge type and became noticeable to maximum 3o m into the forest; however, stations from 60 to 150 m inward did not show significant changes in these parameters. The percentage of light, indirect measure of plant cover, was the most influential variable on the number of species, individuals and biomass of beetles. Although dung beetles appear to be less affected by the edge effect than other groups it is necessary to consider that 25 % of species avoid the edge and that only a few species can move through the matrix, which can have consequences on the ecological function and the viability of their populations in the long term.

AB 1. The enemy-induced Janzen-Connell ( JC) effect, a classic model invoking conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and distance dependence, is a primary biodiversity maintenance hypothesis. Yet, conflicting evidence for the JC effect leads to disagreement about its role in maintaining forest diversity.
   2. We focus this review on soil-borne pathogens, which are the primary agent inducing the JC effect in many forest ecosystems. Although the test of the pathogeninduced JC effect in ecology critically rests on the seedling mortality caused by soil pathogens, what has not been explicitly explored in the early literature but has increasingly received attention is the long-recognized fact that the environment can alter virulence of pathogens and host susceptibility (thus pathogen-host interactions), as predicted by the classic disease triangle framework enlightened by pathology research in agricultural systems.
   3. Here, following the disease triangle framework we review evidence on how the pathogen-induced JC effect may be contingent on context (e.g. environmental conditions, pathogen inoculum load and genetic divergence in host and pathogen populations). The reviewed evidence reveals and clarifies the conditions where pathogens may or may not cause disease to hosts, thus contributing to reconciling the inconsistent results about the pathogen-induced JC effect in the literature. The context dependence of the disease triangle predicts that the pathogen-induced JC effect would change under global change.
   4. Gaining insights from evidence that the pathogen-induced JC effect is context-dependent, we suggest that future tests on the JC hypothesis be conducted under the framework of disease triangle, and we stress the necessity by controlling the effect of context factors on plant-pathogen interactions when testing for the JC effect. We conclude the review by proposing three lines of future research for testing the importance of the JC effect in maintaining global forest tree species diversity, with a particular emphasis on testing the effect of global warming on the strength of pathogen-host interactions for better predicting changes of forest biodiversity under climate change.

AB 1. The potential of large mammalian herbivores to shift plant communities between nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation has received little attention so far. However, herbivores can influence the cycling of these growth-limiting nutrients, and thereby affect plant nutrient limitation and productivity. Tundra ecosystems are nutrient-poor and commonly grazed by large herbivores like reindeer and may thus be responsive to such changes.
   2. Here, we examined the effect of long-term light and heavy reindeer grazing on nutrient limitation of plant growth in a Scandinavian arctic tundra. We are the first to conduct a factorial N and P fertilization experiment across the two grazing regimes in two functionally contrasting vegetation types: heath and meadow.
   3. Annual primary productivity (APP) showed contrasting responses to our fertilization treatments under light and heavy grazing. Under light grazing, APP increased in response to N + P additions in both the heath and meadow. Under heavy grazing, APP increased in response to N in the heath, with an additional positive effect of N + P combined, while APP increased in response to P and N + P additions in the meadow.
   4. These results clearly show that an increase in the grazing intensity of reindeer facilitated a shift towards more P-limited conditions in Scandinavian arctic tundra, by increasing N cycling without having a corresponding positive effect on P cycling. In the N-poor heath, reindeer increased soil N availability at least partly due to a shift towards more N-rich graminoids, while in the meadow, reindeer decreased soil P availability. The mechanisms behind this decrease remain unclear, but reindeer may simply export more P from the system than N due to their large P demand for the production of their antlers.
   5. Synthesis. We conclude that heavy and long-term reindeer grazing promoted a more P-limited tundra, thus experimentally confirming the potential of large mammalian herbivores to influence nutrient limitation of plant growth.

AB 1. Nutrient resorption from senescing leaves prior to litterfall is a strategy for nutrient conservation in vascular plants. However, the mechanisms through which soil fertility and/or foliar nutrient status affect nutrient resorption are not yet fully known.
   2. We used two 1,000-m-wide altitudinal gradients on two different bedrock types (carbonate and silicate) for analysing the interactive effects of temperature and soil chemistry on the resorption efficiency of two major nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Our objective was to assess how nutrient resorption varied across the gradients through the adaptation of individual species to changing environmental conditions rather than through changes in species composition.
   3. Both N and P resorption efficiency increased across the altitudinal gradients independent of bedrock type. The main process regulating nutrient resorption was a negative feedback to nutrient availability in the soil. The negative feedback of nutrient resorption efficiency to soil nutrient status was unrelated to total soil nutrient contents but depended on concentrations of organic N forms for nitrogen resorption efficiency (NRE) and on inorganic P forms for phosphorus resorption efficiency (PRE), respectively.
   4. While we hypothesized that the resorption of P, as a principally rock-derived nutrient, depended on physical-chemical processes affected by soil chemistry, our results showed that microbial P mineralization was the main source of inorganic P supply to the plants. Both NRE and PRE were effective to improve the growth potential of plants, but there was no evidence of stoichiometric adaptations of N:P RE-to-nutrient ratio in the soil.

AB 1. We assessed differences in the alpha and beta diversity of dung beetles in native forest and two livestock systems (with and without canopy cover) typical of the Argentine Chaco region and related the dung beetle assemblages to environmental conditions.
   2. Dung beetles were sampled in native forest and two livestock systems in the spring (2015-2016), in two areas of the humid Chaco region in northern Argentina. In each area, five sampling sites were selected for each habitat type, and ten pitfall traps were baited with human faeces and carrion and placed at each site.
   3. The livestock systems with canopy cover preserved the environmental conditions from the native forest (temperature and vegetation structure) and the richness and composition of the native forest dung beetle community in the two areas studied, whereas the open pastures exhibited higher ground temperature, simplified vegetation structure and lower dung beetle richness and similarity in species composition in relation to the native forest.
   4. In livestock systems of the humid Chaco, the canopy cover is the main determinant of dung beetle communities through the maintenance of temperature and humidity. In the light of these results, livestock production in silvopastoral systems preserving canopy cover can be an alternative compatible with conservation of the dung beetle diversity of native forests. Considering the central role of dung beetles in maintaining soil structure and fertility (through the relocation of cow dung), silvopastoral systems will probably maintain the productivity compared to open pastures.

AB Brazil's environmental legislation obliges private properties to retain a fixed proportion of their total area with native vegetation, the so-called "Legal Reserves". Those areas represent practically one third of the country's native vegetation and are well known for their role in biodiversity protection and in the provisioning of a wide range of ecosystem services for landowners and society. Despite their relevance, this instrument has been criticized by part of the agribusiness sector and its representatives in the Brazilian Congress. The Legal Reserve requirement is said to be too restrictive and to impede the full expansion of agricultural activities, and thus to be detrimental for the development of the country. Here, we critically analyze the arguments employed in the justification of a recently proposed bill that aims to completely extinguish Legal Reserves. We demonstrate that the arguments used are mostly unsupported by data, evidence or theory, besides being based on illogical reasoning. Further, we synthesize the principal benefits of Legal Reserves, including health and economic benefits, and emphasize the importance of these reserves for water, energy, food, and climate securities, in addition to their primary function of assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We also highlight that Legal Reserves are a key-component for effective and less expensive nature-based solutions, and thus should be considered as assets for the development of Brazil rather than liabilities. Based on available sound scientific evidence and agreement on their relevance, we strongly oppose any attempt to extinguish or weaken the maintenance of Brazil's Legal Reserves.

AB Despite efforts to reduce deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, there has been an up-turn in clearing rates since 2012. These increases are in part due to failures in deforestation control. Soybean planters, cattle ranchers, and timber merchants find ways to circumvent agreements and legislation. Here we explain some of the key problems with the implementation of the principal agreements and Brazilian laws that should be keeping clearing rates under control. To combat increased clearing in the Amazon, we suggest an urgent need to strengthen Brazilian environmental agencies, improve technologies used to monitor the effectiveness of clearing-reduction programmes, better integrate agrarian and environmental policies and integrate environmental enforcement across federal, state and municipal governments, as well as improve transparency along global supply chains and raise awareness among consumers to put market pressure on producers to avoid new deforestation.

AB The New World carpenter ant Camponotus novogranadensis Mayr has a broad, apparently continuous range, extending from subtropical Brazil (29.8 degrees S) to central Mexico (similar to 23.7 degrees N). In 2012, a non-native population of C. novogranadensis was discovered in southwestern Florida. Here, I examine the ecology and geographic distribution of C. novogranadensis, and report additional records of C. novogranadensis in Florida.
   I documented C. novogranadensis at five sites in southwestern Florida from Estero to Fort Myers in Lee County (26.4 degrees-26.5 degrees N) and at nine sites in southeastern Florida ranging Delray Beach to Boynton Beach in Palm Beach County (26.4 degrees-26.5 degrees N). Although I found two well-established populations of C. novogranadensis at the same latitudes in southwestern and southeastern Florida, I did not find this species anywhere in the >150 km between. It is likely that C. novogranadensis will continue to spread in Florida, possibly impacting native ants.

AB While recent research indicates that human health is affected by the gut microbiome, the functional mechanisms that underlie host-microbiome interactions remain poorly resolved. Metagenomic clinical studies can address this problem by revealing specific microbial functions that stratify healthy and diseased individuals. To improve our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and health, we conducted the first integrative functional analysis of nearly 2,000 publicly available fecal metagenomic samples obtained from eight clinical studies. We identified characteristics of the gut microbiome that associate generally with disease, including functional alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and beta-dispersion. Using regression modeling, we identified specific microbial functions that robustly stratify diseased individuals from healthy controls. Many of these functions overlapped multiple diseases, suggesting a general role in host health, while others were specific to a single disease and may indicate disease-specific etiologies. Our results clarify potential microbiome-mediated mechanisms of disease and reveal features of the microbiome that may be useful for the development of microbiome-based diagnostics.
   IMPORTANCE The composition of the gut microbiome associates with a wide range of human diseases, but the mechanisms underpinning these associations are not well understood. To shift toward a mechanistic understanding, we integrated distinct metagenomic data sets to identify functions encoded in the gut microbiome that associate with multiple diseases, which may be important to human health. Additionally, we identified functions that associate with specific diseases, which may elucidate disease-specific etiologies. We demonstrated that the functions encoded in the microbiome can be used to classify disease status, but the inclusion of additional patient covariates may be necessary to obtain sufficient accuracy. Ultimately, this analysis advances our understanding of the gut microbiome functions that constitute a healthy microbiome and identifies potential targets for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

AB Because of its high phosphorus (P) demands, it is likely that the abundance, distribution, and N-fixing capacity of Alnus in boreal forests are tightly coupled with P availability and the mobilization and uptake of soil P via ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). We examined whether Alnus shifts EMF communities in coordination with increasingly more complex organic P forms across a 200-year-old successional sequence along the Tanana River in interior Alaska. Root-tip activities of acid phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, and phytase of A. tenuifolia-associated EMF were positively intercorrelated but did not change in a predictable manner across the shrub, to hardwood to coniferous forest successional sequence. Approximately half of all Alnus roots were colonized by Alnicola and Tomentella taxa, and ordination analysis indicated that the EMF community on Alnus is a relatively distinct, host-specific group. Despite differences in the activities of the two Alnus dominants to mobilize acid phosphatase and phosphodiesterase, the root-tip activities of P-mobilizing enzymes of the Alnus-EMF community were not dramatically different from other co-occurring boreal plant hosts. This suggests that if Alnus has a greater influence on P cycling than other plant functional types, additional factors influencing P mobilization and uptake at the root and / or whole-plant level must be involved.

AB The fringed leaf frog, Cruziohyla craspedopus is rarely sampled in the Brazilian Amazon, probably due to low detection probability associated with its arboreal habit. The knowledge about the species' distribution stems from successive additions of occasional occurrence records, which indicate that the species is widely distributed throughout Amazonia. We present new occurrence records to update the geographic range of the species, which is hereby extended 224 km to the northeast. We also present morphological data from collected specimens and discuss the updated range from the geographic and ecological points of view. We show that the range of the leaf frog crosses several main tributaries along the southern bank of the Amazonas River, although the species occurrence is apparently limited by a minimum tree cover of 70%.

AB Sustainable agricultural practices necessitate accurate baseline data of crop types and their detailed spatial distribution. Compared with field surveys, remote sensing has demonstrated superior performance, offering spatially explicit crop distribution in a timely manner. Recent studies have taken advantage of remote sensing time series to capture the variation in plant phenology, inferring major crop types. However, such an approach was rarely used to extract detailed, multiple crop types spanning a large area, and the impact of topography has yet to be well analyzed in mountainous regions. This study aims to answer two questions in crop type extraction: (i) Is it feasible to accurately map multiple crop types over a large mountainous area with phenology-based modeling? (ii) What are the effects of topography in such modeling? To answer the questions, phenological metrics were extracted from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite time series, and the random forests classifier was used to map 12 crop types in South China (236,700 km(2)), featuring a subtropical monsoon climate and high topographic variation. Our study revealed promising results using MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series, although EVI outperformed NDVI (overall accuracy: 85% versus 81%). The spectral and temporal metrics of plant phenology significantly contributed to crop identification, where the spectral information exhibited greater importance. The increase of slope led to a decrease in model accuracy in general. However, uniformly distributed tree plantations (e.g., tea-oil camellia, gum, and tea trees) being cultivated on large slopes (>15 degrees) achieved accuracies greater than 80%.

AB Cacao agroforestry have been considered as biodiversity-friendly farming practices by maintaining habitats for a high diversity of species in tropical landscapes. However, little information is available to evaluate whether this agrosystem can maintain functional diversity, given that agricultural changes can affect the functional components, but not the taxonomic one (e.g., species richness). Thus, considering functional traits improve the understanding of the agricultural impacts on biodiversity. Here, we measured functional diversity (functional richness-FD, functional evenness-FEve, and functional divergence-Rao) and taxonomic diversity (species richness and Simpson index) to evaluate changes of bird diversity in cacao agroforestry in comparison with nearby mature forests (old-growth forests) in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We used data from two landscapes with constraining areas of mature forest (49% Una and 4.8% Ilheus) and cacao agroforestry cover (6% and 82%, respectively). To remove any bias of species richness and to evaluate assembly processes (functional overdispersion or clustering), all functional indices were adjusted using null models. Our analyses considered the entire community, as well as separately for forest specialists, habitat generalists, and birds that contribute to seed dispersal (frugivores/granivores) or invertebrate removal (insectivores). Our findings showed that small cacao agroforestry in the forested landscape sustains functional diversity (FD and FEve) as diverse as nearby forests when considering the entire community, forest specialist, and habitat generalists. However, we observed declines for frugivores/granivores and insectivores (FD and Rao). These responses of bird communities differed from those observed by taxonomic diversity, suggesting that even species-rich communities in agroforestry may capture lower functional diversity. Furthermore, communities in both landscapes showed either functional clustering or neutral processes as the main driver of functional assembly. Functional clustering may indicate that local conditions and resources were changed or lost, while neutral assemblies may reveal high functional redundancy at the landscape scale. In Ilheus, the neutral assembly predominance suggests an effect of functional homogenization between habitats. Thus, the conservation value of cacao agroforestry to harbor species-rich communities and ecosystem functions relies on smallholder production with reduced farm management in a forested landscape. Finally, we emphasize that seed dispersers and insectivores should be the priority conservation targets in cacao systems.

AB In the northeastern region of Mexico, there is an increase in the establishment of grasslands for livestock, which has created changes in the structure and floristic diversity of ecosystem. The aim of this study was to determine the structure and diversity of the woody species vegetation of an area of Tamaulipas thorn-scrub (MET) which was modified for livestock rising in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, to establish whether or not the changes have contributed to the conservation of plant diversity. The livestock activity practiced in the researched area is mixed purpose use at a moderate intensity, with a thinning treatment at the lower vegetation layer (d < 5 cm) to create open areas for cattle grazing in the study area. Four sampling plots of 1 600 m(2) each were selected. Dasometric measures were recorded and ecological indexes were estimated. The results are a record of 8 families, 16 genus and 17 species of trees and shrubs. The absolute density was 309/ha, while the estimated canopy area was 9 521.83 m(2)/ha. Richness (D-a = 3.03) and species diversity (H' = 2.31) resulted in similar values to scrubs with nonproductive activity. Species with the greatest IVI are characteristic of the MET: Prosopis laevigata (IVI = 28.59), Havardia pallens (IVI = 13.41) and Cordia boissieri (IVI = 8.89), from which, Prosopis laevigata is considered as a species for forage use. We conclude that the composition of the tree and shrub species in this livestock rising system contributes to preserving the desirable attributes of the native vegetation communities, such as richness and species diversity, density and canopy area.

AB Recent research has shown that co-occurring primary and secondary habitat-forming species typically support higher biodiversity than do monocultures of the primary habitat-former alone. However, these habitat cascades' may not be universal and it is important to know whether, when and where positive effects on biodiversity from secondary habitat-forming species change to negative effects. Here, we tested how anthropogenic stressors (fertilisation and sedimentation) and unattached secondary habitat-forming Ulva seaweeds affected the primary habitat-forming seagrass, Zostera muelleri, and its associated invertebrates in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary, New Zealand. We experimentally stressed Zostera by adding different fertilisation and sediment levels. Fertilisation had little impact, whereas even low sedimentation levels had strong negative effects on Zostera and its associated fauna. In a second experiment, sediments and Ulva were added to seagrass beds and unvegetated mudflats to test whether sediment stress modifies habitat cascades. We found again strong negative effects of sediments on Zostera, irrespective of spatio-temporal conditions, and that negative effects of sediments on invertebrates were enhanced in the presence of the secondary habitat former. These results highlighted that anthropogenic stressors can destabilise habitat cascades; processes that may be of particular importance in estuaries that are characterised by low biodiversity and stressful environmental conditions.

AB A current goal among many scientific disciplines is to incorporate data on past human land use and climate change into current global climate and vegetation models. Here, we used existing archaeological and paleoecological data to provide a spatiotemporal reconstruction of human history in Greater Amazonia over the Holocene. We used an ensemble distribution model based on a database of georeferenced C-14-dated material and environmental factors to predict the changes in spatial distributions of past human occupation sites. We ran these models for the precultivation (13,000-6000 yr ago), early cultivation (6000-2500 yr ago), and late cultivation (2500-500 yr ago) periods. The ensemble models suggest that people mostly inhabited the peripheral areas of Greater Amazonia and the eastern sections of the main Amazon River and its larger tributaries during the precultivation period. Human populations began growing exponentially through the early cultivation period, and people spread and expanded into the interior forests and along river channels in western Amazonia. Populations continued growing through the late cultivation period in these same regions. Our results suggest that many forests, particularly in the peripheral regions and riverine locations, may still be in recovery from disturbances that have occurred repeatedly through the Holocene.

AB This study presents the effects of access to Ecosystem Services (ESS) on human wellbeing. In order to fulfil the research objective, we interviewed villagers from 104 households who were exclusively engaged in collecting ESS. Data were also collected from key informants, local leaders, and official records. Higher access (HA) to ESS significantly increased the availability of cleaner water for domestic non-drinking purposes. Access to sufficient food, however, was significantly lower across the HA households because of greater involvement in ESS collection. Overall, in this society, HA families enjoyed significantly greater freedom than Lower access (LA) families. Increased competition for ESS extraction resulting from higher access significantly reduced a collector's physical strength and had larger negative impacts on their mental health (self-esteem decreased and anger level increased) compared to LA collector. There were also significantly stronger financial conditions in the HA families than LA families. Greater access encouraged frequent collaboration and cooperation between HA collectors for collecting more ESS leading to a significant enhancement in social cohesion in compare to LA families. Composite wellbeing scores of the respective wellbeing criteria show that only physical health and economic security would significantly improve with greater access to ESS collection. Thus, ESS can have significant impacts on human wellbeing. However, without integration of other wellbeing improvement programs, sole dependency on the ecosystems would cause resource degradation. These results would greatly assist to improve the current framework of ESS and human wellbeing.

AB Information on long-term growth rates, ages, and survival of dominant tree species is vital to understand forest dynamics. In this study, tree-ring analysis was used to reconstruct lifetime growth patterns and to examine age-diameter relationships of selected tree species from the dry Afromontane forest fragments in northern Ethiopia. Ring width measurements were based on increment core samples and stem discs collected from three tree species (Juniperus procera, Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata, and Podocarpus falcatus). Standard dendrochronological methods were used for data collection and analysis. Overall, across species and sites, significant mean radial growth differences were found. P. falcatus trees showed the highest mean annual radial growth (2.45 mm/year), while O. europaea trees showed slow growth rates, with average annual growth ranging between 1.6 mm in Desa'a and 2.0 mm in Hugumburda. The mean ring width of an individual J. procera tree ranged between 1.8 mm/year (in Desa'a site) and 2.3 mm/year (in Hugumburda site). Many trees of the sampled species exhibited more or less sigmoid growth curves. Age variation is mainly determined by the variation in passage time through the smaller diameter classes (juvenile classes). In general, the results obtained in this study have important implications for understanding growth dynamics of tropical dry Afromontane forests and for planning conservation and restoration activities. This study has to be supported by eco-physiological studies to further understand the responses of these and related main tree species to the varied environmental gradients to better explain the dynamics in relation to emerging environmental changes.

AB We examined the effects of light conditions on plant growth and production of defense compounds in the toxic species Datura inoxia and D. stramonium. Specifically, we investigated morphological and physiological traits, including the contents of nitrogen-based tropane alkaloids (atropine and scopolamine) as defense compounds, under three light conditions: 100%, 80%, and 50% of full sunlight. Both species showed similar morphological and physiological responses to exposure to different intensities of light. Although the total plant mass decreased under lower light conditions, the total leaf area per plant increased. The reason being that the leaf mass per plant did not decrease, while the leaf mass per unit area decreased. Leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations and the chlorophyll/nitrogen ratio increased under lower light conditions, whereas the chlorophyll a/b ratio decreased. These morphological and physiological changes may be seen as ways to increase light acquisition under low light conditions. Leaf atropine and scopolamine concentrations did not differ among the three light conditions for both species. In conclusion, both Datura species underwent morphological and physiological changes under low light conditions, enabling them to use carbon and nitrogen to increase light acquisition while maintaining their chemical defense capability.

AB Question Dispersal limitation (neutral hypothesis) and deterministic factors (niche hypothesis) shape floristic gradients including between-site patterns of species' dominance (co-dominance). Because their relative importance remains poorly known, we ask how their comparative contribution to co-dominance changes with elevation and geographical extent. Location Madidi region, NW Bolivia. Methods We analysed floristic composition and environmental factors of 90 plots spanning the gradient from Amazonian (<1,000 m) to montane forests at three elevations (1,200-1,500; 2,000-2,300; and 2,800-3,200 m) and two geographical extents: local (plots <12 km apart) and regional (38-120 km apart). We modelled distance decay within each elevational band with a neutral model, using two parameters (speciation rate and dispersal distance). Subsequently, we related the model's residuals to environmental differences using flexible machine learning models. Results We found that 5-44% of the variability in floristic differences along the gradient studied can be explained by a neutral model of distance decay, while 18-50% can be explained by environmental differences. Montane forests showed an overall gradient in floristic composition that is congruent with an increase in elevation for both dispersal limitation and environmental filtering. However, Amazonian forest was more niche-structured and more dispersal-limited relative to its elevation and topography. Conclusions Environmental differences explained floristic differences better than the neutral model, even giving preferential attribution to the more parsimonious neutral processes.

AB Questions Do neighbourhood interactions in trees result in discernible spatial and phylogenetic signals among their nearest neighbours in a montane evergreen and deciduous forest? Are neighbourhood patterns of different species associated with their abundances and traits? Location Badagongshan National Nature Reserve, Hunan, China. Methods We used four nearest-neighbour indices: average spatial distance to the nearest conspecific cohort-mate (SNCC), average spatial distance to the nearest conspecific adult (SNCA), average phylogenetic distance to the nearest heterospecific cohort-mate (PNHC), and average phylogenetic distance to the nearest heterospecific adult (PNHA). We focused on 77 abundant species in a 25-ha plot. We evaluated whether the changes in SNCC, PNHC, SNCA and PNHA deviated significantly from expected values of spatially random mortality during two life stage transitions. Results For more than one-fourth of the tested species, the changes in SNCC and PNHC deviated significantly from the expectations of random mortality. Nearly one-third of the tested species showed greater SNCC at the juvenile stage than expected of random mortality, which may be mainly explained by conspecific tree competition for space and resources. Approximately 60% and 40% of the tested species showed significantly smaller SNCA and PNHA than expected by random mortality, respectively, which suggests the effects of facilitation and habitat filtering. In addition, abundant and taller species were suppressed by conspecific cohorts to a greater degree than locally rarer and shorter species. Deciduous species were more negatively influenced by conspecifics and closely related heterospecifics than evergreen species. Conclusions Our study focused on long-term responses of individual species to their conspecific and phylogenetic neighbourhoods and revealed the associations between species traits and neighbourhood patterns. Such trait-neighbourhood interactions provide support for stabilizing mechanisms driving species coexistence in this species-rich subtropical forest.

AB Rocky shores are ecosystems susceptible to anthropic impact, and the absence of information in Brazil about their biota hampers characterization and conservation measures. Thus, this study analyzed the abundance, richness, diversity and dominance of anomuran and brachyuran communities in sheltered and exposed rocky shores in Anchieta and Guarapari on the coast of Espirito Santo State. It was also studied the community variation concerning the types of rocky shores during the rainy and dry seasons. The organisms were collected manually in the mediolittoral zone of the rocky shores from October 2014 to September 2015. Additionally, temperature and salinity of the water were measured and the rainfall recorded from a meteorological station. In this study, 3,156 individuals were collected, comprising 14 species. The hermit crabs Clibanarius antillensis and Calcinus tibicen were the most abundant species. The three-way ANOVA analysis revealed that there was no interaction between ecological indices and the study locations, rocky shores and seasons. The abundance of the decapod community was statistically different between locations. The richness and diversity indices were higher on the sheltered rocky shore because of the presence of rock fragments and heterogeneous sediments, they are providing higher availability of microhabitats in these areas. There was no relationship between the decapod community and environmental factors, possibly because of a small variation of these factors registered between rainy and dry seasons. It is concluded that the anomuran and brachyuran communities are probably more influenced by biological interactions and physiographic features of rocky shores than by environmental factors.

AB Islands are geographically defined as land masses completely surrounded by water, and island systems have been used as models for many biogeographic, ecological, and evolutionary theories ever since Darwin's pioneering efforts. However, their biological definition is complex. Over the past few decades these theories have been applied to many study systems that only share some geographic features with island systems. These features include spatial fragmentation, limited area, spatial and temporal isolation from adjacent parts of the system, and low connectivity between different parts within the system, to mention just a few. These systems vary in their form, the matrix that surrounds them, the factors defining their borders, the extent of insularity they impose on the different taxa, and their geological similarity to different types of actual islands. Here, I seek to understand whether such island-like systems (ILS) function biologically as true islands. In the first part, I describe the wide diversity of ILS suggested in the literature and the variation in the features that define their insularity. In the second part, I review the extent to which the main theories of island biology are applicable to these systems: species-area and species-isolation relationships, community composition, evolutionary radiations, and the extent of endemism and genetic diversity. In the third and final part, I suggest a new conceptual framework within which to classify and study the biology of ILS, as well as practical future research directions. I conclude that the term 'biological island' is a multi-faceted concept, loosely related to its geographical definition. As ILS are often less isolated than true islands, and their biological patterns are only partly similar to those of true islands (and even this is true only for some ILS) the use of the term 'island' to describe any isolated habitat is therefore inappropriate.

AB Plant secondary metabolites are a key defence against herbivores, and their evolutionary origin is likely from primary metabolites. Yet for this to occur, an intermediate step of overexpression of primary metabolites would need to confer some advantage to the plant. Here, we examine the evolution of overexpression of the essential amino acid, L-tyrosine and its role as a defence against herbivores. We examined overexpression of tyrosine in 97 species of Inga (Fabaceae), a genus of tropical trees, at five sites throughout the Neotropics. We predicted that tyrosine could act as an anti-herbivore defence because concentrations of 4% tyrosine in artificial diets halved larval growth rates. We also collected insect herbivores to determine if tyrosine and its derivatives influenced host associations. Overexpression of tyrosine was only present in a single lineage comprising 21 species, with concentrations ranging from 5% to 20% of the leaf dry weight. Overexpression was pronounced in expanding but not in mature leaves. Despite laboratory studies showing toxicity of L-tyrosine, Inga species with tyrosine suffered higher levels of herbivory. We therefore hypothesize that overexpression is only favoured in species with less effective secondary metabolites. Some tyrosine-producing species also contained secondary metabolites that are derived from tyrosine: tyrosine-gallates, tyramine-gallates and DOPA-gallates. Elevated levels of transcripts of prephenate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the tyrosine biosynthetic pathway that is insensitive to negative feedback from tyrosine, were found only in species that overexpress tyrosine or related gallates. Different lineages of herbivores showed contrasting responses to the overexpression of tyrosine and its derived secondary metabolites in their host plants. Synthesis. We propose that overexpression of some primary metabolites can serve as a chemical defence against herbivores, and are most likely to be selected for in species suffering high herbivory due to less effective secondary metabolites. Overexpression may be the first evolutionary step in the transition to the production of more derived secondary metabolites. Presumably, derived compounds would be more effective and less costly than free tyrosine as anti-herbivore defences.

AB The hierarchical structure of biodiversity from a regional scale analysis has received much attention as an alternative approach to unravelling the principal drivers of biodiversification. To better understand the processes that control the diversification of Cambro-Ordovician trilobite communities from the Argentine Cordillera Oriental, we explore patterns of occupancy and diversity trajectories at the local and regional scales through seven intervals (Furongian, loTr1, upTr1, loTr2, upTr2, Tr3 and Fl2-3), and across an onshore-offshore profile. Our results indicate: (1) a decrease in regional diversity from the upper Tr2 onwards, mainly caused by a reduction in the number of rare taxa, coupled with stable beta diversity at regional scale and a constant rise in beta diversity in deep subtidal environments; (2) a higher proportion of regional diversity allocated to the within-habitat beta component; and (3) that changes in gamma diversity are driven primarily by changes in alpha diversity during the Furongian-Tr3, whereas in the Floian, beta diversity seems to modulate regional diversity. These trends and associated patterns indicate increasing ecological differences among taxa, shifting from metacommunities where most taxa have similar ecological preferences or 'Hubbell type' to metacommunities with high niche differentiation or 'Hutchinson type'. Interestingly, the timing of this shift coincides with the regional-scale turnover between trilobite evolutionary faunas suggesting that the rise in niche differentiation among these genera may be related to the transition. Superimposed on this general trend, particular diversity structures can be understood in the light of metacommunity dynamics, such as dispersal limitation and mass effect.

AB Understanding how plants allocate biomass to different organs is of high importance since biomass allocation among organs determines many growth processes. Biomass allocation among plant organs is driven by environmental conditions, while functional traits can also be potential covariates to understand the allocation of biomass. However, the relationships between functional traits and biomass allocation remain poorly known and studied. We investigated the relationships of two biomass allocation indicators, including leaf mass fraction (LMF) and leaf area ratio (LAR), with six economic traits and five hydraulic traits across 30 woody species. We found that LMF and LAR showed different relationships with economics traits. In addition, a significantly negative correlation was observed between LMF and leaf water potential at turgor loss point (TLP), but no significant relationship was found between LAR and TLP. Principal component analyses showed that LMF-related traits and LAR-related traits could be divided into two groups. Taken together, LMF is mainly related to draught tolerance while LAR mainly related to light capture. Although LMF and LAR are two significantly correlated biomass allocation indicators, they play different roles in the acclimation of plants. Researchers should focus on the different functions of these two indicators and the different relationships with other functional traits in the further research.

AB Established plants can affect the recruitment of young plants, filtering out some and allowing the recruitment of others, with profound effects on plant community dynamics. Recruitment networks (RNs) depict which species recruit under which others. We investigated whether species abundance and phylogenetic distance explain the structure of RNs across communities. We estimated the frequency of canopy-recruit interactions among woody plants in 10 forest assemblages to describe their RNs. For each RN, we determined the functional form (linear, power or exponential) best describing the relationship of interaction frequency with three predictors: canopy species abundance, recruit species abundance and phylogenetic distance. We fitted models with all combinations of predictor variables, from which we simulated RNs. The best functional form of each predictor was the same in most communities (linear for canopy species abundance, power for recruit species abundance and exponential for phylogenetic distance). The model including all predictor variables was consistently the best in explaining interaction frequency and showed the best performance in predicting RN structure. Our results suggest that mechanisms related to species abundance are necessary but insufficient to explain the assembly of RNs. Evolutionary processes affecting phylogenetic divergence are critical determinants of RN structure.

AB During almost 20 years of political debate on the nature of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), these schemes have been characterized mostly as a non-market approach, even though attempts to transform them into market instruments has persistently recurred in these debates. One notable example is the materialization of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) in Brazil, where a sustainable development discourse dominates national forest governance at the expense of a carbon commodification discourse. This research paper adopts a Foucauldian approach to plot the epistemological foundations of the market logics that still influence REDD + institutionalization in Brazil to a large extent and thereby reproduce what we define as a ruptured dependence on nature. More specifically, we recognize ruptured dependence in the three building blocks of market instruments, namely singularization, monetary valuation and appropriation. Our analysis shows that REDD + institutions have retained the singularization and monetary valuation of emission reductions, even though the appropriation processes have rejected the possibility of exchange and instead emphasized the national ownership of emission reductions. However, appropriation remains a highly politicized process that is sensitive to criticism and open to calls for alternative approaches that are closer to ruptured dependence.

AB The changes in climate registered at the planetary scale threaten the persistence of current populations for many plant species, with effects particularly evident at the edges of species distributions. However, intraspecific differences in functional traits could modulate the plant responses to the expected increase in drought. Using a trait based approach, we evaluated under controlled conditions how Quercus sober seedlings from the latitudinal edges of the distribution range of the species respond to different watering treatments in terms of vegetative growth and biomass allocation. In addition, we simulated an extreme drought by stopping watering until death to determine chemical and physiological traits under drought stress and to identify which morphological traits were more associated to drought resistance (expressed as survival time without watering). Seedlings from the northern provenance presented higher aboveground biomass allocation (i.e. shoot length and biomass allocation to shoot and leaves), while the southern ones were characterised by longer roots and higher biomass allocation to roots. Under extreme drought, seedlings from the southern provenance maintained higher photosynthetic rates than northern seedlings and were able to modulate their water-use efficiency (estimated from delta C-13) depending on environmental conditions, which allowed them to survive for a longer period. Finally, drought resistance was partially explained by the plant biomass allocation pattern. Traits related to growth in height and light interception were negatively related with drought resistance, whereas traits involving investment in root biomass were positively related with resistance. These geographical differences evidence a local adaptation to drought at the southern edge of Q. sober distribution. Our results highlight the importance of the conservation of the genetic resources that peripheral populations harbour at distribution edges.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) may alter dynamics in coupled human and natural systems, producing reciprocal feedback effects on socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. As forests recover following China's two nation-wide PES programs, wildlife-related crop raiding has been increasingly affecting rural people's livelihoods. We evaluate the feedback effect of crop raiding on people's intention to convert their cropland plots into forests under different PES program scenarios in the Tianma National Nature Reserve. Increases in crop raiding, conservation payment amounts, and program duration significantly increased local people's intention to enroll their cropland plots in future PES programs. Our results suggest that a substantial portion of economic benefit from the current PES programs was offset by the feedback effect of crop raiding promoted by these programs. Therefore, such complex human-environment interactions should be incorporated into the design and evaluation of China's PES practices and other PES programs around the world.

AB Payments for Watershed Services (PWS) have become popular for the conservation of environmental services. As effectiveness is influenced by PWS design and the local contexts in which they are implemented, deficiencies in the process of targeting providers can affect the success of PWS schemes in achieving their goals. This article presents a framework based on data obtained from systematic reviews of worldwide Payments for Environmental Services (PES) schemes and the scientific literature to guide the process of targeting PWS schemes, especially in rural private areas in fragmented landscapes. The framework comprises four sets of operational guidelines for the targeting process based on the scientific literature. A table explaining the data extracted from the literature and PES schemes is provided, comprising the targeting criteria of benefits, risk, cost, socioeconomic issues, and readiness. The framework supplements current approaches that focus on biophysical criteria and is the first initiative to incorporate multidimensional aspects of PES in targeting guidelines. As it gathers empirical and scientific knowledge to promote an effective scheme design, the framework can contribute to the achievement of PWS goals.

AB Payments for watershed services (PWS) are an increasingly popular tool for watershed management, also in the Southern Hemisphere. However, the degree of PWS adoption varies across these countries: while frequently represented in Latin America, water-related payment schemes do not exist in large parts of Africa and Asia. The causes for these adoption differences have so far been little discussed. Here we address this knowledge gap with a quantitative cross-national assessment of factors influencing the decision to adopt PWS schemes across tropical countries. Based on hypotheses from the literature, we construct a logistic regression model, testing the explanatory power of various economic, institutional, and physical-geographic variables on PWS adoption. We show that especially factors associated with a country's topography, hydrology, demographics, and institutions significantly influence the probability of PWS adoption. Our analysis of the de facto framework conditions for PWS adoption also has repercussion for where donor investments in PWS would most likely pay off. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mangroves often form extensive closed forests characterised by the occurrence of canopy gaps consisting of a group of standing dead trees. This article describes the physical characteristics, micro-environmental changes and the regrowth pattern of the naturally created unique circular canopy gaps in the subtropical Avicennia marina mangroves of Moreton Bay, Southeast Queensland, Australia. A survey on 52 canopy gaps was carried out to quantify the size and shape of canopy openings. We found that gap size ranged from a minimum area of 27 m(2) to a maximum area of 474 m(2) with an average (+/- standard deviation) of 134 +/- 102 m(2). All of the gaps surveyed were circular in shape with the eccentricity of length and width between 0.7 and 1.3. Once a canopy gap is created, the forest physical and biological processes are altered compared with the surrounding forest, such as in an increase in the potential photosynthetic active radiation (PPAR) and canopy openness, and a decrease in leaf area index (LAI). We found that canopy openings also had a significant effect on sediment pore water temperature but not on salinity and pH. The sudden increase in the amount of light following canopy opening stimulated rapid growth of seedlings which were available for the opportunity to take the place of the dead trees. Gap Closure Index (GCI) is introduced to illustrate surveyed gaps in the context of vertical growth of seedlings to fill up gap space to reach the site maximal canopy height, thus demonstrating the phases of gap dynamics in the natural regeneration of the subtropical monospecific mangrove forest.

AB Woody encroachment is occurring in all tropical savannas of the world. However, in the Brazilian savanna (the Cerrado), the extent of this phenomenon is still poorly documented. Here woody encroachment was quantified throughout the Cerrado biome and transitional ecotones using a trend analysis of the annual maximum of enhanced vegetation index obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The associations with potential local drivers, such as fire and land use regime, were assessed using satellite data of land cover and fire regime. We found that 19% of the remaining native vegetation showed significant evidence of woody encroachment in the last 15 years and 7% exhibited degradation processes. The local factors that favored woody expansion in 19% of the biome were a decrease of fire (34%) and land use abandonment (26%). Our study highlights that local human-associated drivers are playing a major role in woody encroachment and savanna degradation.

AB Organisms architecturally modify environments and these modifications may persist across generations, potentially strongly shaping social behavior. However, few experiments have directly tested the impact of architectural modifications from earlier generations on social behavior in later generations. Here, I report experiments using extremely durable resources, shells, which endure for decades to centuries in stable form. Terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobita compressus) architecturally remodel shells and pass these modified shelters to subsequent generations, which reuse them long after the original architect's death. I conducted controlled field experiments in a population of these crabs in which shells have been individually marked and tracked for a decade. I examined the impact of architectural modifications by contrasting social behavior around introduced shells, either remodeled shells (whose internal architecture was modified by earlier generations) or unremodeled shells (whose architecture had never been modified). Remodeled shells generated radically different social dynamics than unremodeled shells, catalyzing vacancy chains in which shells were socially redistributed across the population. Social groups that formed around remodeled shells consisted of size-ordered queues, with precise timing and social coordination required if individuals were to acquire superior shells. Interestingly, comparative experiments in two non-architect species (Clibanarius albidigitus and Calcinus obscurus) failed to show any impact of architectural modifications on social behavior; such impacts were only found in the architect species (C. compressus). Broadly, architecture from earlier generations can thus play a major role in driving social dynamics among later generations.

AB Urbanization is currently one the most important causes of biodiversity loss. The Colombian Andes is a well-known hotspot for biodiversity, however, it also exhibit high levels of urbanization, making it a useful site to document how species assemblages respond to habitat transformation. To do this, we compared the structure and composition of bird assemblages between rural and urban habitats in Armenia, a medium sized city located in the Central Andes of Colombia. In addition, we examined the influence of urban characteristics on bird species diversity within the city of Armenia. From September 2016 to February 2017 we performed avian surveys in 76 cells (250 x 250 m each) embedded within Armenia city limits; and in 23 cells (250 x 250 m each) in rural areas around Armenia. We found that bird diversity was significantly lower in urban habitats than in rural habitats, and differed in species composition by 29%. In urban cells, with higher abiotic noise intensity and higher impervious surface area, we found lower bird diversity than that in urban cells with higher guadual (Guadua angustifolia patches), and forested surface areas. We did not find segregation of urban cells according to the species composition, although additional bird surveys inside urban forests remnant are needed to be more conclusive about this aspect. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of green areas embedded within cities to conserve bird diversity through reducing the ecological impact of urbanization on avian biodiversity.

AB Introduction
   Knowledge of species richness patterns and their relation with climate is required to develop various forest management actions including habitat management, biodiversity and risk assessment, restoration and ecosystem modelling. In practice, the pattern of the data might not be spatially constant and cannot be well addressed by ordinary least square (OLS) regression. This study uses GWR to deal with spatial non-stationarity and to identify the spatial correlation between the plant richness distribution and the climate variables (i.e., the temperature and precipitation) in a 1 degrees grid in different biogeographic zones of India.
   Methodology
   We utilized the species richness data collected using 0.04 ha nested quadrats in an Indian study. The data from this national study, titled 'Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level', were aggregated at the 1 degrees grid level and adjudged for sampling sufficiency. The performances of OLS and GWR models were compared in terms of the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc).
   Results and discussion
   A comparative study of the R-2 and AICc values of the models showed that all the GWR models performed better compared with the analogous OLS models. The climate variables were found to significantly influence the distribution of plant richness in India. The minimum precipitation (Pmin) consistently dominated individually (R-2 = 0.69; AICc = 2608) and in combinations. Among the shared models, the one with a combination of Pmin and Tmin had the best model fits (R-2 = 0.72 and AICc = 2619), and variation partitioning revealed that the influence of these parameters on the species richness distribution was dominant in the arid and the semi-arid zones and in the Deccan peninsula zone.
   Conclusion
   The shift in climate variables and their power to explain the species richness of biogeographic zones suggests that the climate-diversity relationships of plants species vary spatially. In particular, the dominant influence of Tmin and Pmin could be closely linked to the climate tolerance hypothesis (CTH). We found that the climate variables had a significant influence in defining species richness patterns in India; however, various other environmental and non-environmental (edaphic, topographic and anthropogenic) variables need to be integrated in the models to understand climate-species richness relationships better at a finer scale.

AB The Pacific Ocean that flanks the hyperarid Atacama Desert of Northern Chile is one of the richest biomass producers around the world. Thus, it is considered a key factor for the subsistence of prehistoric societies (including mixed-economy groups), that inhabited its coastal ecosystems as well as the neighboring inland areas. This study assesses the Arica Culture groups' diet (Late Intermediate Period; 1000-1530 CE), through stable isotope (on bone-collagen; delta C-13 and delta N-15) and dental pathology data. Seventy-seven (n = 77) individuals from two inland (LLU54 and AZ8) and one coastal (CAMS) archaeological sites were studied. Results show an important, but lower than predicted by earlier studies, contribution of marine resources in the diet of all three groups. Dental pathologies and stable isotopes indicate that these groups' diet varied in correlation with their distance to the Pacific Ocean as well as group and individual preferences. The results challenge the idea that Arica Culture groups depended heavily on marine resources for their subsistence. In contrast, this study shows both that the Arica Culture groups' diet was diverse, and that the terrestrial resources consumed were mostly contributed by C-3/CAM plants instead of maize.

AB DnB (Database of nymphalids in Brazil) centralizes the state of the art of all Nymphalidae species lists ever reported in Brazil. Butterflies are diverse, ecologically relevant, charismatic, and are effective flagships and bioindicators for conservation. With about 850 described species in Brazil, Nymphalidae is the group with the most stable taxonomy among the three richest Neotropical butterfly families and are frequently used in several biological disciplines as a model system. This study was developed from the need of an up-to-date, curated, and throughout database of species occurrences, the first of its kind in this continental, heterogeneous, and highly diverse country. The data can be used as a starting point for several purposes, such as mapping the distribution of Brazilian nymphalids, producing regional species lists with information of their richness, estimating priority regions (due to species occurrence or lack of sampling) and niche modeling - see DnB tutorials. Using both coarse-grained and exhaustive search strategies, we compiled 489 studies (peer-reviewed or not), from which 357 had species lists and were thus catalogued in a userfriendly software. We provide a separate worksheet with 34 columns of additional information, to filter DnB by e.g. biome, urban sampling, collection method; or to assess the quality of studies. Descriptive analyses revealed, as commonly reported, sampling bias towards large urban centers and proximity to research institutions (Wallacean shortfall), as well as taxonomic (Linnaean) shortfall of biodiversity. Aiming to standardize the publication and peer-review of species lists, we suggest a protocol, or checklist, of all steps required to ensure the comparability and minimum quality of such publications. DnB is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2561408, with a translated version in Portuguese available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2561417 and we aim to update and re-publish it every 10 years so we encourage authors to send corrections and new species lists, published in any media, to 2018dnb@gmail.com.

AB Hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are characterized by their specialized nectar-feeding behavior. However, fruit consumption by hummingbirds has been reported as an occasional behavior. I present a review on hummingbird frugivory in the Americas, along with the first records from Argentina. There have been 23 reports on fruit-hummingbird interactions belonging to 15 hummingbird species and 10 plant species, with records ranging from Chile to the United States. Two Gilded Hummingbirds (Hylocharis chrysura) and one Glittering-bellied Emerald (Chlorostilbon lucidus) foraging on blue passionflower (Passiflora caerulea) fruits were observed in northeastern Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Far from being rare events, hummingbirds accounted for a 23% of total bird-fruit interactions at my study area. My results suggest that fruit consumption by hummingbirds has a broad geographic range and may be more common than previously thought, at least in certain plant families, such as Cactaceae.

AB NGOs, government agencies, and green businesses proclaim water fund arrangements in Latin America as successful payments for ecosystem services (PES) systems. Associated success narratives emphasize that PES allows downstream ecosystem service beneficiaries to incentivize upstream land managers to pursue conservation activities. However, recent scholarship questions their on-the-ground influence. This article assesses the success narrative of Quito, Ecuador's Fondo para la proteccion del Agua's (FONAG) as a model water fund PES arrangement. Using a novel perceived directionality framework, the author compares the FONAG claims about its influence to ethnographic evidence from three participating rural communities. The findings suggest that statements of direct, causal influence on local conservation activities overlook local context and ignores nuance within the interactions between program incentives and in community activity. This study urges future assessments of PES arrangements to recognize complexities in political, economic, and social context.

AB Ants possess properties that can be used to optimize plant production in agricultural systems. Ant services can be herbivore and pathogen protection and fertilization of their plant partners. They may, however, also harm plants by facilitating ant-attended herbivorous homopterans. To assess whether wood ants can be used in IPM-systems to improve apple production, we transplanted wood ants into a Danish apple plantation and tested whether ants (i) reduced the number of herbivores, (ii) led to higher amounts of leaf nutrients, (iii) controlled apple pathogens, (iv) increased homopteran abundance and (iv) whether these effects affected apple yields. During a two year study, we found that the wood ants significantly reduced the numbers of winter moth larvae, increased magnesium content in apple leaves (but did not affect 10 other nutrients), reduced the number of apples infected with apple brown rot and apple scab (on one apple variety) and increased aphid infections. In the first year, this led to higher apple production on ant trees, whereas ants had no effect on yields in the second year. It was evident that ants provided both services and disservices. If mutualistic ant-homopteran interactions can be disrupted, this would favor plant growth and open for the use of wood ants in sustainable plant management. We discuss how this may be accomplished. Alternatively, ants may be used short term to knock down pest outbreaks (before building up homopteran populations) or used in crops that do not host ant-attended homopterans.

AB The lowland areas of the Himalayan region are subjected to immense anthropogenic pressure because of least representation in the protected area network. Kitam Bird Sanctuary is the only representative protected area that occurs below 1000 m in Sikkim state of India (a part of globally significant biodiversity hotspot of Himalayas) and serves as the refuge for various species of flora and fauna. Here we studied butterfly diversity and community composition in Kitam Bird Sanctuary (a small protected area of 6 km(2) geographical area) following point count method spread across predetermined transects. Altogether 1674 butterflies belonging to 111 species and six families were recorded after completion of 240 point counts. Among these, 18 species are federally protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972) of India. Most of the butterflies were forest specialist in terms of habitat preference, whereas based on host plant specificity, the butterfly community was mostly dominated by generalist feeder (Oligophagous II and Polyphagous). Butterfly community parameters showed a strong correlation with habitat variables. While Kitam Bird Sanctuary is primarily designated for conservation of lowland birds, the high diversity of butterflies both in terms of taxonomic richness and trait composition suggests that the sanctuary harbors an ideal habitat for butterflies of the tropical region and invites conservation attention.

AB The globally expanding colonization of grasslands by shrubs increases soil organic carbon and nitrogen, but the effects of shrubs on phosphorus (P) cycling have been rarely studied. We compared P contents in roots and soil fractions, phosphatase activity in the 1 m profile, and in situ net P mineralization between shrubby Potentilla fruticosa patches and grassy interspaces in grazed shrubby meadows at three representative sites on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The P uptake of P. fruticosa exceeded 1 m soil depth, whereas grasses acquired P mainly within the upper 0.6 m. The P contents in shoots, aboveground litter and roots under P. fruticosa were greater than those under grasses. Litter P stock under the shrubs was 4-8 times higher than that under grasses and the root P stock doubled compared to that in grass areas. P. fruticosa generally increased the organic P (OP) content in the topsoil but decreased inorganic P (IP) in the subsoil. Phosphorus availability increased in the topsoil but decreased in the subsoil under the shrubs compared to grasses. Microbial biomass P (MBP), the activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases, and OP lability were all greater in the 1 m soil under P. fruticosa than grasses, leading to faster P mineralization and the P turnover under the shrubs. In the 1 m soil, P. fruticosa increased MBP and OP stocks but decreased IP and available P stocks. The larger and deeply distributed root system of P. fruticosa improved its P uptake ability especially from the subsoil. The subsequent greater organic matter input through litter fall and root turnover under P. fruticosa fed a larger microbial biomass that synthesized more microbial-derived OP in the topsoil. We concluded that shrubs increase the biological (plant and microbial) P transformation in the soil, the P uplift in the profile, and P cycling in shrubby grassland ecosystems. Such mechanisms structuring spatial heterogeneity of P content, transformation, turnover and fluxes are common in shrubby grasslands worldwide.

AB Testate amoebae diversity from 28 surface (0-3 cm depth) soil samples found near Cuzco (6 samples), in Machu Picchu (17 samples), in Aguas Calientes (5 samples), and one bottom sediment sample from the Lake Titicaca near Puno were collected during March of 2016 were analyzed. The 144 testate amoebae species and infra-specific taxa belonging to 27 genera were identified. Nineteen amoebae have not been identified to species level and likely represent new taxa. Species richness varied from one to 54 taxa per sample. The highest diversity was found in rainforests followed by those in meadows and agave habitats. The only bottom sample from Lake Titicaca has yielded two hydrobiont species from the genus Difflugia. In the course of the study, several rare species with limited geographical distribution were observed, namely Centropyxis castaneus, C. compressa, C. deflandriana, C. latideflandriana, C. cf. ohridensis, C. cf. ovoides, C. cf. pannosus, C. stenodeflandriana, Cyclopyxis plana, C. profundistoma, Apodera vas, Argynnia retorta, A. spicata, Certesella certesi, Trachelcorythion pulchellum. Our study fills a geographical gap in the distribution of some flagship species with restricted geographic distribution, e.g. Apodera vas and Certesella certesi in Peru. The results illustrate the continuity of expansion species along the Pacific coast.

AB The Pampean grassland in South America has been almost completely transformed by human activities and is one of the biomes at the highest conservation risk. Although several land uses are developed in temperate grasslands, studies comparing their impact on bird taxonomic and functional diversity are still missing. We determined what habitat type resulting from human land uses better preserves the assemblage of birds and their functional traits that occur in protected grasslands. We compared taxonomic and functional diversity between protected grasslands and cattle pastures, crop fields, tree plantations, and urban settlements. We surveyed birds and environmental variables in the 5 habitat types using point counts and selected 11 traits to estimate functional diversity. We performed principal component analysis to explore environmental differences between habitat types, ANOVA to compare taxonomic and functional diversity, nonmetric multidimensional scaling to explore relationships between habitat type characteristics and species traits, and similarity percentage analysis to find the bird functional traits that contributed the most to differentiate habitat types. Bird composition and functional diversity in cattle pastures was the most similar to that of protected areas but showed no significant differences with crop fields. In cattle pastures, crop fields, and protected areas, the most frequent species traits were related to narrow ranges and high vulnerability to extinction, whereas urban settlements included traits covering wide ranges or related to impervious areas. When compared with protected areas, land conversion into cattle pastures and some types of agricultural lands resulted in a lower loss of bird species and functional diversity than conversion into tree plantations or urbanized areas. Approximately 35% of species found in protected areas were not recorded in any of the other habitat types. Therefore, we emphasize the need to protect the native habitat. Our findings help with land use planning in the Pampas and other temperate grasslands.

AB Theoretical models and empirical analyses have combined to suggest that, for some ranges of climate, alternative stable states in vegetation structure may be possible: positive feedbacks with fire may differentiate savanna from forest, while positive feedbacks with hydrological processes may differentiate grassland from savanna. However, existing models have largely failed to include spatially explicit fire spread, dispersal, and hydrological processes, and as such ignore key features of vegetation systems. In this paper, we incorporate spatial and stochastic effects to form a comprehensive and realistic description of the dynamics of vegetation growth. By using novel computational tools such as path-sampling, we investigate the effect of noise and spatial coupling on the stability and the dynamics of forest-savanna transitions. Spatial effects change model behaviors: We find that spatial interactions between savanna and grassland result in the eventual nucleation and propagation of one of the states to invade the other. Which state wins depends on parameter values, which in turn depend on environmental conditions. Meanwhile, transitions between savanna and forest occur much less frequently, because an event such as a period of fire suppression in savanna or a fire in forest must be larger to successfully invade a landscape; this results in transitions between savanna and forest that, although not strictly history dependent, look temporally similar to hysteresis because the time lags involved in transitions are so large.

AB Over the last few years, forest-based communities have faced two different but related phenomena. On the one hand, they have become more integrated with global economies, accessing regional and international markets. On the other, they have been pressured by economic groups into becoming part of the ecologically unequal exchange that exports natural resources and generates social and environmental problems at a local level. However, within new approaches to managing common-pool resources in common properties such as sustainable-use protected areas, communities are finding their own ways to be resilient and to face the two phenomena that are part of the same global economic system. Communities have built a multi-partner governance system for forest management and community development that involves agents from the civil society, state and market. Accordingly, multi-partner governance has proven to be a strategy to protect community-based forests against increasing timber market pressure. The question that then emerges is, to what extent has multi-partner governance been effective in supporting forest-based communities to be resilient and to face pressures from the global timber market in forests under community use? The aim of this paper is to analyze forest-based community resilience to the global economic system in situations where common properties are under governance of multiple stakeholders. The research is based on a singular case study in the Tapajos National Forest, Brazilian Amazon, which is a sustainable-use protected area with 24 communities involved in a multi-partner governance system. The article shows that forest-based communities under pressure have been resilient, and facing the global economic system have created a community-based cooperative for managing timber and engaging all partners in the process to improve their collective action. The cooperative provides timber sales revenue that supports community development both through diversification of agroforestry production and building of infrastructure as collective benefits.

AB When compared with other stated preference valuation methodologies, deliberative valuation gives participants more time and information, potentially resulting in more valid and reliable estimations and higher participant confidence. However, it also has weaknesses, such as small sample sizes, lower participant diversity, and high costs. This paper proses a minimalist framework for deliberation that increases sample size and lowers the cost per participant through short, structured deliberative sessions and the use of deliberative sub-groups. A case study was conducted with 192 landholders in south-eastern Mexico, examining how participants' perceptions of benefits from communal forest lands would impact their willingness to accept (WTA) comparatively lower payments to participate in a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) program. The results suggest that a majority of landholders would accept a lower payment level to participate in a PES program over a degradative alternative, with 45.5% of participants surveyed willing to accept a 45% reduction in payments to participate in the PES program. The minimalist framework had an impact on participants' rate of acceptance, with a 13.8% increase in the percentage of participants willing to accept the PES offer post-deliberation. The impact on participant confidence was stronger, with a 31.2% increase in the percentage of participants expressing confidence in their choice after deliberations.

AB Tree rings provide valid predictions regarding species age and growth rates and, therefore, they can contribute to understand forest dynamics and ecology. In this work, we evaluated the tree rings of eight tree species from different successional groups that show distinct degrees of deciduousness in a seasonal semi-deciduous forest located in a transition zone between subtropical and the tropical climates in southern Brazil. We focused on wood anatomical markers, the annual nature of tree-ring formation, the description of false rings, a cross-dating analyses and an interpretation of the radial increment dynamics of the species. We sampled increment cores at breast height, performed cambial wounding and measured tree-ring widths. Annual tree rings were found in seven species, which were confirmed by cambium wounding. Differences in fiber wall thickness between late-wood and earlywood and the marginal parenchyma were the main anatomical markers observed. Deciduous species had better distinction of tree ring boundaries, while the evergreen species had slightly distinct tree ring boundaries. False rings were characterized by variations in wood density and axial parenchyma bands of different widths within true tree rings. The annual tree ring confirmation and the anatomical description of the true and false rings are useful for future dendroecological research in the area. Considering the cross-dating analyses and tree-ring distinctiveness, Chrysophyllum gonocarpum is a recommended species. Regarding radial growth, the early secondary species had higher growth rates than the late secondary species. Assessing the growth trajectories over time, distinct patterns were observed among the species: a constant growth, an initial increase followed by a reduction, and oscillations of the growth were observed. As no consistent pattern of the growth trajectories was observed among species that belong to the same successional groups, they contribute to the explanation of the particular life history of these individuals in the seasonal semi-deciduous forest.

AB Climate models predict increases in drought conditions in many parts of the tropics. Yet the response of tropical forests to drought remains highly uncertain, especially with regards to the factors that generate spatial heterogeneity in drought response across landscapes. In this study, we used Landsat imagery to assess the impacts of a severe drought in 2015 across an 80,000-ha landscape in Puerto Rico. Specifically, we asked whether drought effects varied systematically with topography and with forest age, height, and fragmentation. We quantified drought impacts using anomalies of two vegetation indices, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), and fit random forest models of these metrics including slope, aspect, forest age, canopy height, and two indices of fragmentation as predictors. Drought effects were more severe on drier topographic positions, that is, steeper slopes and southwest-facing aspects, and in second-growth forests. Shorter and more fragmented forests were also more strongly affected by drought. We also assessed which factors were associated with stronger recovery from drought. Factors associated with more negative drought anomalies were also associated with more positive postdrought anomalies, suggesting that increased light availability as a result of drought led to high rates of recovery in forests more severely affected by drought. In general, recovery from drought was rapid across the landscape, with postdrought anomalies at or above average across the study area. This suggests that forests in Puerto Rico might be resilient to a single-year drought, though vulnerability to drought varies depending on forest characteristics and landscape position.

AB We studied the diet of Leptodactylus spixi from a cacao plantation in southern Bahia, Brazil. A total of 109 frogs were manually collected between December 2006 and October 2007 and analysed using a stomach flushing method. Of these, 69 stomachs revealed 168 prey items. Acarina, Orthoptera and Formicidae were the most abundant items, while Orthoptera, Diplopoda and Hemiptera were the most important in terms of frequency of occurrence. With more than 50% of total prey volume and the highest Index of Relative Importance, Orthoptera was considered the dominating prey category for this species in the studied area. The comparison between available potential prey in the environment and diet revealed that L. spixi fed on most present invertebrates. Electivity values were highest for orthopterans, gastropods and dermapterans. We conclude that L. spixi can be considered a "sit-and-wait" predator and also a generalist consuming what is available in the environment.

AB AimsThe phosphorus (P) resource partitioning hypothesis assumes that dissimilarity in P acquisition traits among plant species leads to enhanced P uptake by crop combinations compared with their sole crops. We developed and implemented a test for this hypothesis.MethodsTwo pot experiments were conducted with quartz sands. In Experiment 1, the ability of the crop species to acquire P from sparingly soluble sources (Ca phosphate (CaP), phytate (PhyP) and P-coated Fe (hydr)oxide (FeP)) was tested. In accordance with the species performances in Experiment 1, combinations of millet/chickpea and cabbage/faba bean (which have dissimilar P acquisition traits) and wheat/maize (which have similar traits) were selected for Experiment 2. The biomass production and P uptake were compared between the sole crops and species combinations as well as between the single and mixed P sources.ResultsA dissimilarity in P acquisition traits enhanced P uptake by millet/chickpea on CaP/PhyP (as expected) but not by cabbage/faba bean on FeP/PhyP. Despite their similar P acquisition traits, we found enhanced P uptake by wheat/maize on CaP/PhyP.ConclusionsBecause of complicating factors such as unstable P acquisition traits and competitive inequality between species, the conditions under which the P resource partitioning hypothesis can be tested are limited. This challenge complicates designing for complementarity in soil P pools by intercrops.

AB In the southern US, rice, Oryza sativa L., is frequently attacked simultaneously by rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel, and sheath blight pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani J. G. Kuhn. Field studies were used to determine the impact of L. oryzophilus infestation on development of sheath blight and combined effects of both L. oryzophilus and R. solani on yield of rice cultivars, 'Cocodrie' and ''Jefferson'. Infestation by L. oryzophilus had no influence on severity of sheath blight in either Cocodrie or Jefferson. Grain yield of both cultivars was significantly less in response to infestation by L. oryzophilus. Infection by R. solani alone significantly reduced yield only in the susceptible cultivar Cocodrie. Percent yield losses in Cococdrie in response to exposure to L. oryzophilus and R. solani alone and in combination were 5.6, 23.9, and 20.0%, respectively. Similarly, percent yield losses in Jefferson in response to exposure to L. oryzophilus and R. solani alone and in combination were 7.3, 10.6, and 5.4%, respectively. Combined impact of infestation by L. oryzophilus and infection by R. solani on yield did not differ significantly from the impact of pathogen infection alone in Cocodrie. The combined impact of R. solani and L. oryzophilus on yield in Jefferson did not vary significantly from the impact of either alone. Results suggested that L. oryzophilus did not affect severity of sheath blight in rice, and the combined impact of L. oryzophilus and R. solani on rice yield was less than additive. Understanding the interaction between L. oryzophilus and R. solani, important pests of rice in the southern US, will help manage these pests more effectively.

AB Premise Cambial activity in some tropical trees varies intra-annually, with the formation of xylem rings. Identification of the climatic factors that regulate cambial activity is important for understanding the growth of such species. We analyzed the relationship between climatic factors and cambial activity in four tropical hardwoods, Acacia mangium, Tectona grandis, Eucalyptus urophylla, and Neolamarckia cadamba in Yogyakarta, Java Island, Indonesia, which has a rainy season (November-June) and a dry season (July-October). Methods Small blocks containing phloem, cambium, and xylem were collected from main stems in January 2014, October 2015 and October 2016, and examined with light microscopy for cambial cell division, fusiform cambial cells, and expanding xylem cells as evidence of cambial activity. Results During the rainy season, when precipitation was high, cambium was active. By contrast, during the dry season in 2015, when there was no precipitation, cambium was dormant. However, in October 2016, during the so-called dry season, cambium was active, cell division was conspicuous, and a new xylem ring formation was initiated. The difference in cambial activity appeared to be related to an unusual pattern of precipitation during the typically dry months, from July to October, in 2016. Conclusions Our results indicate that low or absent precipitation for 3 to 4 months induces cessation of cambial activity and temporal periodicity of wood formation in the four species studied. By contrast, in the event of continuing precipitation, cambial activity in the same trees may continue throughout the year. The frequency pattern of precipitation appears to be an important determinant of wood formation in tropical trees.

AB It is assumed that widespread, generalist species have high phenotypic variation, but we know little about how intraspecific trait variation (ITV) relates to species abundance and niche breadth. In the temperate rainforest of southern Chile, we hypothesized that species with wide niche breadth would exhibit 1) high among-plot ITV, 2) a strong relationship between trait values and the environment, and 3) a close fit between traits and local environment trait optima. We measured leaf functional traits (leaf area, LMA, leaf N and P concentrations) of saplings in woody species, and compared the relative abundance of each species with its niche breadth, measured as the range of light, soil N and P availability. We used the slope of the linear regression of species' trait-environment relationships to assess the strength and direction of these relationships, and measured the degree to which species' trait values track the environmental optimum across plots. In some cases, species having wide niche breadth had high ITV in leaf N and also matched traits (LMA and leaf P) to local optima along the light gradient; they also had high ITV in general and matched leaf P to local optima along the soil P gradient. The relationship between species with wide niche breadth and the strength of intraspecific trait-environment relationships was generally weak and varied depending on the niche dimension and trait in question. Species varied considerably in the strength of trait-environment relationships and total magnitude of ITV, and this variation was not generally strongly related to species abundances or niche breadth patterns. In conclusion, trait variation at the community level is not driven by a few abundant, widely distributed species, but depends on the aggregate trait responses of both abundant and rare species. This makes it difficult to scale individual species trait responses up to the community level.

AB Ants are one of the major animals utilizing waste in urban areas, and presumably have an important role in nutrient redistribution and cycling. However, information on ant assemblages on artificial food and their food removal rates in different habitat types is lacking, and the relationship between ant assemblage and removal rate is poorly understood. We assessed assemblages of ants on experimentally placed foods (potato chips, cookies and ham) and their food removal rates on three land cover types (woodlands, lawns and pavements) at 90 sites in 10 urban and suburban parks of Tokyo. Then, we examined the relationship between ant assemblage and food removal rate. In total, 11 trophic generalist ants were associated with food removal. Species composition differed significantly between land cover types, and the mean number of species was higher in woodlands than on lawns and pavements, while not significantly different between urban and suburban parks. The ants removed, on average, 6.3 g of 18-g food in fresh weight (or 5.3 g of 13.9-g food in dry weight) per site in 24 h. There were both negative and positive associations between ant species presence and food removal rate, but no significant associations between species number and food removal rate. Food removal rate was highest on lawns, and that in woodlands was not significantly different from that on lawns and pavements. Therefore, our study suggests that ants on lawns and pavements, despite lower number of species and altered species composition, have a comparable or higher ability to redistribute nutrients from artificial foods as compared with woodland ants. This indicates that such highly artificial land cover types should also be included in studies on urban ecosystem services. (C) 2019 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Bryophytes of continental islands have received little attention in biogeography. To quantify the contributions of island attributes to the species richness (SR) of different bryophyte groups on continental islands, we investigated the species number of fifteen bryophyte groups and seven island attributes (area, elevation, isolation degree, human disturbance intensity, rainfall, vegetation coverage and island shape) on 66 continental islands of the Zhoushan Archipelago in the East China Sea. By using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), we found that all the focal environmental variables exerted effects on bryophyte SR to different extents. According to the marginal R-2 and the ratios of marginal R-2 to conditional R-2 of the GLMMs, area (0.776/0.956) and elevation (0.741/0.981) were the two most important determinants of bryophyte SR, followed by disturbance intensity (0.497/0.755), vegetation coverage (0.478/0.708) and isolation (0.234/0.311). Island shape irregularity (0.049/0.068) and rainfall (0.045/0.06) exerted weak but positive effects on bryophyte SR. The effects of island attributes on bryophyte SR were different, with positive effects on the SR of all or most of the focal bryophyte groups for island area, elevation, rainfall and shape irregularity, and a negative effect for isolation degree. The relationships of bryophyte SR with disturbance intensity and vegetation coverage followed unimodal models for most of the focal bryophyte groups. The responses of different bryophyte groups to a given environmental variable are taxon-specific. With the increase of island area and elevation, SR increased faster in mosses than liverworts, and faster in pleurocarpous mosses than in acrocarpous mosses. With the increase of island shape irregularity, SR increased for most of the focal bryophyte groups, but decreased for pleurocarpous mosses. Our results imply that a forest reserve for conservation of bryophyte diversity should be designated with a large area and a higher elevation, moderate disturbance to produce irregularly-shaped fragments with different types of vegetation.

AB Impacts of invasive species on rare species are relevant to conservation. We studied the response of Leedy's roseroot Rhodiola integrifolia subsp. leedyi, a subspecies listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, to removal of the invasive species Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica. Japanese knotweed has invaded the largest known population of Leedy's roseroot, affecting about 10% of all Leedy's roseroot in the world. Japanese knotweed shaded Leedy's roseroot, but the two did not share belowground resources because of their position on cliffs. To study this interaction and, ultimately, to restore Leedy's roseroot habitat to an open, high-light condition, we removed Japanese knotweed in a three-treatment block design. We measured Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, and reproduction in treatment blocks and in uninvaded areas before and after treatment. Compared with uninvaded areas, Japanese knotweed invasion negatively affected Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, and reproduction. Light interception by Japanese knotweed degraded the habitat for Leedy's roseroot. Herbicide removal of Japanese knotweed resulted in increased light and temperature compared with untreated invaded plots but did not affect Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, or reproduction over the 2 y of our study. These results show that invasive species removal is conducive to restoring Leedy's roseroot habitat, but recovery in the subspecies may lag behind restoration of the habitat, suggesting that additional action or time may be required to restore preinvasion performance of Leedy's roseroot. Results of this study may inform restoration efforts for other systems and contribute to the literature on interspecific interactions.

AB The impacts of soil properties and fire regime on Neotropical savannas are well-known, but the importance of hydrological regime for plant species assembly has received less attention. Here, we assessed changes in diversity patterns of herbaceous and woody communities along a water table gradient in a fire-excluded Neotropical savanna. We found that increased waterlogging of soils was associated with declines in both herbaceous and woody species richness. Woody species richness decreased once the water table depth is less than 4m and no woody species occurred once water table depth was less than 23cm. Herbaceous communities remained species rich until the shallowest water table depth, where there is flooding at some point in the year, and even there, over a dozen species occurred. Woody species that occurred in areas with shallower water tables were a nested subset of those in areas with deeper water tables. In contrast, herbaceous communities showed turnover over the hydrological gradient, with distinct species specialized for different water table levels. However, we found that those specialists are restricted to few evolutionary lineages, evidenced by increased phylogenetic clustering over the water table gradient in herbaceous communities. We suggest that evolutionarily conserved hydrological niches define the herbaceous layer over the hydrological gradient, whereas only generalist woody species persist under high water tables. Our findings show that the effect of soil waterlogging differs between the herbaceous and woody layer of savannas, indicating that these communities will respond differently to shifts in the hydrological regime under future environmental change.

AB The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a global phenomenon that influences climate variation and, in turn, the ecological processes affecting the abundance and distribution of populations across taxa. For example, the ENSO can profoundly influence the development and survival of pelagic species, but the extent to which the ENSO affects offspring of terrestrial species is less well known. We used piecewise structural equation modeling to investigate the direct and indirect relationship between the ENSO and offspring development and survival in a terrestrial tropical passerine, the lance-tailed manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata). The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), a measure of the ENSO, was negatively related to individual growth rate, maximum number of lesion developed by nestlings, and hatching day-of-year; which in turn mediated indirect effects on fledging success and recruitment. Further the ONI was a better predictor of nestling development compared to local temperature and rainfall. Our study establishes a link between the ENSO and the development and survival of young of a terrestrial species and underscores the need to better understand how offspring cope with global climate variation.

AB The probability of long-term persistence of a population is strongly determined by adult survival rates, but estimates of survival are currently lacking for most species of birds in the tropical Andes, a global biodiversity hotspot. We calculated apparent survival rates of birds in the Ecuadorian tropical Andes using a moderately long-term (11 yr) capture-recapture dataset from three habitats that varied in how much they had been modified by human activities (native forest, introduced forest, and shrubs). We fit mark-recapture models for 28 species with habitat as a covariable. For all species, recapture rates between sampling sessions were low and varied from 0.04 for Rainbow Starfrontlets (Coeligena iris) to 0.41 for Stripe-headed Brushfinches (Arremon assimilis) when averaged across all occupied habitats. Annual survival rates varied from 0.07 for Black-crested Warblers (Margarornis squamiger) to 0.75 for Violet-throated Metaltails (Metallura baroni). We found no significant differences in survival rates either among habitats or species grouped by habitat specialization. Because we found similar survival rates in native forest and human-modified habitats, our results support those of recent studies concerning the potential value of secondary habitats for the conservation of some species of birds in the tropics. However, our conclusions are tempered by the uncertainty around the estimates of survival rates. Despite the relatively long-term nature of our study, obtaining survival estimates for bird species in this region was challenging, and either more years of study or modification of field protocols may be needed to obtain more precise survival estimates.

AB Although the Amazon Forest comprises the world's largest rainforest, providing fundamental ecosystem services to human well-being, vicissitudes imposed by deforestation, climate change, widespread use of fire and development of new infrastructure make the region critically vulnerable to the consequences of the creation of new forest edges. In this forest fragmentation scenario, temporal assessment of edge effects influences throughout the life of the trees become necessary for a better understanding of how species are affected and react when exposed to altered environments. In this study, we evaluated the temporal influence of the edge effect on the growth dynamics of Scleronema micranthum (Ducke) Ducke by tree-ring analysis based on basal area increment and release events. This species is one of the most frequent tree species of terra firme type of forest in Central Amazonia at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragment Project (BDFFP) study sites. The results showed that edge effects changed the growth dynamics of the trees for at least 10 years after the disturbance, inducing an 18% reduction in tree growth during this period, and records of increased release events. We concluded that growth rings of edge trees are a valuable bioindicators for evaluating the temporal extent of edge effects, and therefore, they must be considered as relevant ecological indicators of historical environmental changes and forest fragmentation, promoting new insights into the resilience ability of trees when exposed to forest fragmentation processes.

AB The understanding and prediction of species distributions have been advanced by the development of community assembly theories and functional trait-based approaches. Coupled with null models, trait dispersion patterns are commonly used to gauge the relative importance of niche versus neutral-based processes on shaping local communities. However, asymmetrical trait dispersion patterns of identical communities may artificially arise as a result of sampling methods choice. This non-random filtering on traits is overlooked, and it may bias the estimation of functional components as well as the detection of underlying assembly mechanisms-especially for species-rich arthropod communities. We sampled subtropical ground-dwelling ant communities using a paired treatment design comprising pitfall traps and Winkler extractors (Winklers), two commonly used sampling techniques for terrestrial arthropods, in 17 shrublands and 33 secondary forest 400 m(2) plots in Hong Kong to determine the effect of sampling filters on functional composition (community means of six morphological traits) and functional diversity (range and variance of individual traits; size and filling properties of multidimensional trait space) using a null model approach for each habitat. We found, as hypothesized, that sampling filters from different methods affected the trait composition and diversity of ant communities asymmetrically. In shrublands and forests, the trait compositions of communities sampled by pitfall traps were dominated by larger sized, slender-shaped and long-legged ants as compared to those sampled by Winklers. The latter method also underestimated the diversity of individual traits related to body size as well as the size and filling properties of multidimensional trait space. Our results highlight that the usage of particular sampling methods without prior knowledge on their potential filtering effects on traits can affect the detection of assembly processes, and interpretation of functional proxies, such as body size. Additional care should be taken when comparing trait components obtained from studies using different sampling methods, so as to distinguish the sampling artefacts from actual ecological phenomena. Hence, it is important to consider the potential biases that different sampling methods may introduce to functional trait-based research.

AB Key messageThis paper provides an overview of radial growth and tree-ring formation of two tropical tree species used in ecological restoration. It shows that trees growing in natural forests and in plantations have the same diametric growth patterns and climate responses.AbstractUnderstanding the outcomes of ecological restoration projects represents an important step in the conservation of endangered biomes such as the Atlantic forest in Brazil. Tree-ring analysis provides long-term information about the growth dynamics of tree species that can be used to evaluate the potential of different species for restoration projects. To evaluate the potential of using Pseudobombax grandiflorum (Cav.) A. Robyns and Citharexylum myrianthum Cham. in restoration projects in the endangered Atlantic Rain Forest (Reserva Biologica de Poco das AntasRBPA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), we verified the seasonality of tree-ring formation to analyze radial growth dynamics and climate-growth relationships of these species. Cambium wounding experiments and direct anatomical analysis of the cambial zone were conducted to assess tree-ring formation periodicity. Tree-ring widths were measured to build tree-ring chronologies and to estimate radial growth rates in natural and planted areas. Both species produced annual tree rings that are produced during the wet season. Tree-ring chronologies of both species have a positive association with rainfall, but each species also responded to rainfall of a specific season. Tree-ring widths of P. grandiflorum were correlated with rainfall at the end of the previous growth season while tree-ring widths of C. myrianthum were correlated with precipitation in the beginning of the growth season. Both species have fast radial growth, but different long-term growth trends. The growth trend for Pseudobombax grandiflorum produces a positive correlation between diameter and age for the trees, while trees of Citharexylum myrianthum have an age-related growth trend and grow faster in the early years. In the present study, we confirm the success of the ecological restoration performed in RBPA as the plantation does not affect the potential growth of the studied species.

AB In a world of increasing demand for natural resources, conservation actions are frequently postponed, even though this may impair biodiversity and the supply of ecosystem services (ES). Here, we evaluated the consequences of delaying conservation actions to protect ES in the Brazilian Cerrado, the most diverse tropical savanna in the world, which is threatened by rapid expansion of agriculture. We generated land use maps for the present and two future periods (2025 and 2050), using a comprehensive land use model. Based on these maps, we modeled the provision of six ES: water yield, sediment retention, nutrient retention, carbon storage, net primary productivity and wild food provision. We identified priority areas for safeguarding ES to meet four conservation targets (i.e. 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of each ES). We found that expected land use changes tended to diminish ES provision over time and modify their spatial distribution. Priority areas in the region also tended to differ spatially between present and future. Moreover, priority areas identified for the future will encompass more extensive altered environments than those for present day landscapes. Our study highlights the importance of avoiding delays in conservation actions, as this may exacerbate conflicts between conservation and development. Arguments based on ES could create new incentives to simultaneously conserve both ES and the biodiversity associated with them in the region.

AB To increase the limited knowledge about phosphorus (P) species in strongly weathered soils of agroforests in tropical regions, the soil organic P was determined in different cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) agroforestry systems from the Atlantic forest region of Brazil, varying in age and phosphate fertilizer application. For this purpose NaOH-EDTA extraction and solution P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) were used. The studied areas were agroforests with different management systems: cacao-cabruca, cacao + erythrina, and cacao + rubber tree, which were compared with unfertilized pasture and natural forest. The results show that the distribution of P species in soil varied according to the different management practices (P fertilization, tree species and tree density) and stability time (different ages) of the cacao agroforests with low input of phosphate fertilizer. In cacao agroforests, natural forest and pasture a large portion of soil organic P (P-o) consisted of P-monoester with lower concentrations of DNA. This P-o species was correlated positively with clay and soil organic carbon. However, the recent conversion of natural forest and pasture to cacao agroforests led to a decrease in DNA concentration. High concentrations of pyrophosphate found in all cacao agroforests could be an evidence of a high soil fungal activity in cycling and accumulation of this P species. Moreover, the high concentrations and relative proportions of P-o and pyrophosphate species revealed a high potential of P supply to trees in case of suppression of the phosphate fertilization in these agroforestry systems.

AB Changes in morphological and physiological features of plants after fire events can modify their attractiveness to herbivorous insects. Our goal was to assess the effects of fire on plant-insect interactions and the development of induced defenses in the shrub Bauhinia brevipes (Fabaceae). We hypothesized that resprouting plants of B. brevipes after a fire occurrence would be more susceptible to herbivory by leaf-chewing and the gall-maker Schizomyia macrocapillata Maia (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) than non-resprouting plants. We analyzed leaf area, leaf damage caused by chewing insect herbivores and attacks by the gall-midge S. macrocapillata, hypersensitivity response, chlorophyll content and silicon content after a fire event. Resprouting plants presented greater leaf area; higher chlorophyll concentration; hypersensitivity response and greater leaf silicon content. Although these plants experienced a greater number of attacks by S. macrocapillata the greater investment in growth and photosynthetic capacity, and possible leaf nitrogen content, can be determining attractiveness to a range of herbivores specifically galling insects. Leaf silicon content can be related with the lower damage by chewing insects, even with the greater vigor of resprouting plants. Thus, our results are contrary to some previous studies that report increases in leaf herbivory by chewer insects after fire events. Increases in hypersensitive response and silicon content seem to alter herbivorous insect preference and performance after fire occurrence.
