AB The sandy-savanna Mussununga is a little-known ecosystem that is already presenting signs of degradation due to effects of invasive species, anthropogenic disturbances, and land-use change. We investigated the effect of biological invasion by Acacia mangium and A. auriculiformis, disturbance promoted by fire and Eucalyptus management, as well as land-use change around Mussununga patches in this neglected ecosystem. Acacia occurrence is negatively related to abundance, basal area, and height of native woody species, and positively correlated with the proportion of dead woody plants. There is a trend of change in vegetation type from open savanna to woodland Mussununga promoted by Acacia. Mussununga patches disturbed by the planting of Eucalyptus species in the past have greater richness in the woody layer (large shrubs and trees), but lower abundance of species in the ground layer (small shrubs and herbs). The land-use change from forest to Eucalyptus plantation was associated with an increase of richness and abundance in the ground layer. Acacia tends to dominate the woody community in Mussununga by invading treeless patches, presenting a correlation with death of woody plants. Subsequently, Acacia promotes several changes that culminate in a height increment and change of the vegetation type. Different from Acacia, disturbance and land-use change associated with Eucalyptus, the main economic activity in the study area, affected both woody and ground layers. The conservation of Mussununga should include actions to preclude disturbance and land-use change, as well as monitoring and control of biological invasion.

TI Towards a 'Sea-Level Sensitive' dynamic model: impact of island ontogeny

AB A synthetic model is presented to enlarge the evolutionary framework of the General Dynamic Model (GDM) and the Glacial Sensitive Model (GSM) of oceanic island biogeography from the terrestrial to the marine realm. The proposed 'Sea-Level Sensitive' dynamic model (SLS) of marine island biogeography integrates historical and ecological biogeography with patterns of glacio-eustasy, merging concepts from areas as diverse as taxonomy, biogeography, marine biology, volcanology, sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, geochronology and geomorphology. Fundamental to the SLS model is the dynamic variation of the littoral area of volcanic oceanic islands (defined as the area between the intertidal and the 50-m isobath) in response to sea-level oscillations driven by glacial-interglacial cycles. The following questions are considered by means of this revision: (i) what was the impact of (global) glacio-eustatic sea-level oscillations, particularly those of the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial episodes, on the littoral marine fauna and flora of volcanic oceanic islands? (ii) What are the main factors that explain the present littoral marine biodiversity on volcanic oceanic islands? (iii) How can differences in historical and ecological biogeography be reconciled, from a marine point of view? These questions are addressed by compiling the bathymetry of 11 Atlantic archipelagos/islands to obtain quantitative data regarding changes in the littoral area based on Pleistocene sea-level oscillations, from 150 thousand years ago (ka) to the present. Within the framework of a model sensitive to changing sea levels, we discuss the principal factors affecting the geographical range of marine species; the relationships between modes of larval development, dispersal strategies and geographical range; the relationships between times of speciation, modes of larval development, ecological zonation and geographical range; the influence of sea-surface temperatures and latitude on littoral marine species diversity; the effect of eustatic sea-level changes and their impact on the littoral marine biota; island marine species-area relationships; and finally, the physical effects of island ontogeny and its associated submarine topography and marine substrate on littoral biota. Based on the SLS dynamic model, we offer a number of predictions for tropical, subtropical and temperate volcanic oceanic islands on how rates of immigration, colonization, in-situ speciation, local disappearance, and extinction interact and affect the marine biodiversity around islands during glacials and interglacials, thus allowing future testing of the theory.

AB The concept of growth rings is little discussed in the literature and their treatment remains somewhat confusing in terms of the diversity of structures described. This situation has a major impact on the study of growth rings in tropical species, in which variations and complexity are greater and accuracy of identification less good. The rigid conceptual delimitations used by dendrochronologists and wood anatomists of temperate regions cannot be applied to the study of growth rings in most tropical species, which has led to neglect of this subject. With the objective of discussing the concept of growth rings, the present study consists of a survey of anatomical, periodicity, causal and evolutionary aspects of the treatment of these structures as evidenced in previous studies, and the evaluation of their application and limitations to the development of this concept. Anatomical aspects arise through radial integrity, or the presence of early and late wood; the degree of distinction of the rings, which may vary from well to poorly defined; and tangential continuity, meaning that rings may form a complete circle in the transverse section of the trunk, or instead be tangentially discontinuous, lens-shaped or in wedges. In addition there are a diversity of anatomical markers which enable us to recognize growth rings. Regarding periodicity, the rings may be annual, infra-annual or supra-annual. Causal aspects include genetic, endogenous and environmental components. Evolutionary aspects continue to be insufficiently investigated, and although most comparative studies treat growth rings recognized by different markers as though they were a single character, it remains questionable whether they can be regarded as homologous or the result of homoplasy. We conclude that the elaboration of a robust but broad definition which can include all the variation observed in growth rings of tropical species is a complex task, which is only possible by overcoming the restrictions adopted by dendrochronologists and wood anatomists of temperate regions for whom growth rings are essentially annual, strongly demarcated, tangentially continuous and restricted to the most pronounced markers.

AB Clearance and perturbation of Amazonian forests are one of the greatest threats to tropical biodiversity conservation of our times. A better understanding of how soil communities respond to Amazonian deforestation is crucially needed to inform policy interventions that effectively protect biodiversity and the essential ecosystem services it provides. We assessed the impact of deforestation and ecosystem conversion to arable land on Amazonian soil biodiversity through a meta-analysis. We analyzed 274 pairwise comparisons of soil biodiversity in Amazonian primary forests and sites under different stages of deforestation and land-use conversion: disturbed (wildfire and selective logging) and slash-and-burnt forests, pastures, and cropping systems. Overall, 60% and 51% of responses of soil macrofauna and microbial community attributes (i.e., abundance, biomass, richness, and diversity indexes) to deforestation were negative, respectively. We found few studies on mesofauna (e.g., microarthropods) and microfauna (e.g., protozoa and nematodes), so those groups could not be analyzed. Macrofauna abundance and biomass were more vulnerable to the displacement of forests by pastures than by agricultural fields, whereas microbes showed the opposite pattern. Effects of Amazonian deforestation on macrofauna were more detrimental at sites with mean annual precipitation >1900 mm, and higher losses of microbes occurred in highly acidic soils (pH < 4.5). Limited geographic coverage, omission of meso- and microfauna, and low taxonomic resolution were main factors impairing generalizations from the data set. Few studies assessed the impacts of within-forest disturbance (wildfires and selective logging) on soil species in Amazonia, where logging operations rapidly expand across public lands and more frequent severe dry seasons are increasing the prevalence of wildfires.

AB Forest conversion into lands for different uses is a widespread practice in tropical and subtropical regions. Such anthropogenic disturbance drastically modifies environmental conditions and availability of resources for species (ecological niche). While many species usually disappear or become rare, other (resilient species) persist in the disturbed areas, being subject to new and often stressful conditions (ecological filters). The issue of whether human-driven habitat modifications induce phenotypic changes in resilient organisms at the intraspecific level has been poorly studied thus far. In this study, we used the neotropical dung beetle Canthon quinquemaculatus to test the hypothesis that the conversion of native forest into open cattle pastures can induce phenotypic differentiation in the functional morphology of resilient species. Sexual dimorphism and year of collection were simultaneously evaluated as potential sources of intraspecific variation in the measured morphological traits. We measured several functional traits related to thermal niche, burrowing capacity and food resource manipulation, including body size and shape and the size of the anterior leg and its constitutive parts. We found significant morphological differentiation between habitats (native forest vs. cattle pasture), sexes and years in terms of multi- and single-trait comparisons. Individuals from cattle pastures were smaller and less spherical (because of lower body thickness) compared to individuals from native forest. Males were larger with bigger anterior tibia and femur while females were more spherical. The phenotypic differences observed between individuals from native and converted habitats could be attributed to plasticity and/or contemporary (adaptive) evolution. From an ecological viewpoint, this study shows that habitat disturbance may affect morphological variation and functional diversity at the intraspecific level which may in turn influence ecosystem functions that dung beetles perform (i.e. dung burial).

AB Primates play important roles in tropical forests through seed dispersal and herbivory. They comprise a large part of the biomass of forest communities and tend to have clumped patterns of defecations (i.e. at favoured food trees or sleeping sites). Therefore, they may also play important roles in accelerating ecosystem nutrient cycling. Here we conduct a controlled growth experiment to quantify the effect of the addition of primate dung on the growth of both light-demanding and shade-tolerant seedlings over 1 year in Kibale National Park, Uganda. A mixed model analysis revealed that light-demanding species were affected by the natural dung treatment and plants with small initial size had accelerated growth, whereas there was no effect on plant growth for shade-tolerant species. The long-term implications of increased dung deposition on the local tree community are unclear as shade-tolerant species may only show an effect over the long-term and light-demanding species may only be able to take advantage of the increased growth if subsequently exposed to high light conditions, such as a treefall gap.

AB Habitat selection analysis is a widely applied statistical framework used in spatial ecology. Many of the methods used to generate movement and couple it with the environment are strongly integrated within GIScience. The choice of movement conceptualisation and environmental space can potentially have long-lasting implications on the spatial statistics used to infer movement-environment relationships. The aim of this study was to explore how systematically altering the conceptualisation of movement, environmental space and temporal resolution affects the results of habitat selection analyses using both real-world case studies and a virtual ecologist approach. Model performance and coefficient estimates did not differ between the finest conceptualisations of movement (e.g. vector and move), while substantial differences were found for the more aggregated representations (e.g. segment and area). Only segments modelled the expected movement-environment relationship with increasing linear feature resistance in the virtual ecologist approach and altering the temporal resolution identified inversions in the movement-environment relationship for vectors and moves. The results suggest that spatial statistics employed to investigate movement-environment relationships should advance beyond conceptualising movement as the (relatively) static conceptualisation of vectors and moves and replace these with (more) dynamic aggregations of longer-lasting movement processes such as segments and areal representations.

AB Tree saplings are exposed to a competitive growth environment in which resources are limited and the ability to adapt determines general vitality and specific growth performance. In this study we analyzed the aboveground spatial neighborhood of oak [Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.] and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) saplings growing in Germany, by using hemispherical photography and terrestrial laser scanning as proxy for the competitive pressure saplings were exposed to. The hemispherical images were used to analyze the light availability and the three-dimensional (3D) point clouds from the laser scanning were used to assess the space and forest structure around the saplings. The aim was to increase the precision with which the biomass allocation, growth, and morphology of the saplings could be predicted by including more detailed information of their environment. The predictive strength of the models was especially increased through direct neighborhood variables (e.g., relative space filling), next to the light availability being the most important predictor variable. The biomass allocation patterns within the more light demanding oak were strongly driven by the space availability around the saplings. Diameter and height growth variables of both species reacted significantly to changes in light availability, and partly also to the neighborhood variables. The leaf morphology [as leaf-area ratio (LAR)] was also driven by light availability and decreased with increasing light availability. However, the branch morphology (as mean branch weight) could not be explained for oak and the model outcome for beech was hard to interpret. The results could show that individuals of the same species perform differently under constant light conditions but differing neighborhoods. Assessing the neighborhood of trees with highly precise measurement devices, like terrestrial laser scanners, proved to be useful. However, the primary response to a dense neighborhood seemed to be coping with a reduction of the lateral light availability aboveground, rather than responding to an increase of competition belowground. The results suggest continuing efforts to increase the precision with which plant environments can be described through innovative and efficient methods, like terrestrial laser scanning.

AB The babassu palm tree (Attalea speciosa Mart. ex Spreng.) is an endemic species of Amazon forests, and has social and economical impact/utility. Deforestation highlights this palm tree in anthropogenic open areas (pastures and cultivated fields). Simultaneously, knowledge concerning the sustainable functioning of the species within these manmade environments is sorely lacking: its life cycle is not well known, and its population dynamics remains unstudied. In this study, our objective was to generate a model of the population dynamics of the babassu palm tree, validated by in situ analysis, to understand how babassu, a forest species, adapts to pastureland and, under certain conditions, becomes invasive. We propose a random matrix model with aggregated variables based on the biological stages of the species as the input. The probabilities of the between-stage transition matrix were modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial model with a hierarchy taking geographical organization, i.e. transect level, into account. The integration of prior information was formulated through a Bayesian approach. This Bayesian hierarchical matrix model enabled us to demonstrate a bottleneck in the population dynamics and a high year-dependent mortality rate at an early stage.

AB Mammalian biodiversity exhibits strong geographic gradients that correspond to variation in the physical environment (habitat, area, climate, and landforms) and reflect biogeographic processes that have unfolded over millennia. Principal among these patterns are the species-area relationship, as well as latitudinal, elevational, and topographic gradients. We review these gradients for mammalian assemblages of today and over geologic time. Contemporary gradients are for the most part general. Nonetheless, variation across different phylogenetic and ecological subsets of continental mammalian faunas illuminates the multifactorial, historical nature of biodiversity gradients in terms of the diversification history of clades, variation in resources that support species with different ecological traits, and changes in landscapes over time. Accordingly, future work should integrate modern and historical patterns of taxonomic richness with phylogenetic and functional diversity of different clades and ecological subsets of continental faunas. Changes in global climate and land use are disrupting the integrity of biogeographic patterns. Insights from the study of gradients of mammalian biodiversity should address the challenges of conservation in a rapidly changing world.

AB The applications of payments for ecosystem/environmental services (PES) are diverse. However, the changing characteristics of these applications in different contexts have not been adequately elucidated. This article provides a conceptual analysis of China's water eco-compensation mechanism (ECM), a notion reported in the PES literature, through the lens of public-private, state-market, central-local and interjurisdictional relationships. It argues that the water ECM is essentially a state-centric utilitarian approach to mediating regional conflicts and inequalities. The Chinese practices of water ECM indicate an alternative approach to incentive-based conservation, highlighting the potential of integrating government-led instruments with market-oriented mechanisms in the development of a PES framework.

AB Extreme droughts in Amazonia cause anomalous increase in fire occurrence, disrupting the stability of environmental, social, and economic systems. Thus, understanding how droughts affect fire patterns in this region is essential for anticipating and planning actions for remediation of possible impacts. Focused on the Brazilian Amazon biome, we investigated fire responses to the 2010 and 2015/2016 Amazonian droughts using remote sensing data. Our results revealed that the 2015/2016 drought surpassed the 2010 drought in intensity and extent. During the 2010 drought, we found a maximum area of 846,800 km(2) (24% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) with significant (p <= 0.05) rainfall decrease in the first trimester, while during the 2015/2016 the maximum area reached 1,702,800 km(2) (47% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) in the last trimester of 2015. On the other hand, the 2010 drought had a maximum area of 840,400 km(2) (23% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) with significant (p <= 0.05) land surface temperature increase in the first trimester, while during the 2015/2016 drought the maximum area was 2,188,800 km(2) (61% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) in the last trimester of 2015. Unlike the 2010 drought, during the 2015/2016 drought, significant positive anomalies of active fire and CO2 emissions occurred mainly during the wet season, between October 2015 and March 2016. During the 2010 drought, positive active fire anomalies resulted from the simultaneous increase of burned forest, non-forest vegetation and productive lands. During the 2015/2016 drought, however, this increase was dominated by burned forests. The two analyzed droughts emitted together 0.47 Pg CO2, with 0.23 Pg CO2 in 2010, 0.15 Tg CO2 in 2015 and 0.09 Tg CO2 in 2016, which represented, respectively, 209%, 136%, 82% of annual Brazil's national target for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation by 2017 (approximately 0.11 Pg CO2 year(-1) from 2006 to 2017). Finally, we anticipate that the increase of fires during the droughts showed here may intensify and can become more frequent in Amazonia due to changes in climatic variability if no regulations on fire use are implemented.

AB Comparative studies were undertaken in five forest fragments (Chawia, Fururu, Mbololo, Ngangao and Vuria) of varying sizes in Taita Hills, Kenya to determine the effects of forest edge on the forest structure, species diversity and richness and above-ground carbon stock along a forest edge-interior gradient, and the relationship between pioneer and late successional tree species. For each forest fragment, belt transects proportional to the forest area were established. Within each belt transect, plots of 10 x 10 m were systematically established and replicated three times in a stratum at an interval between 10 and 50 m along a forest edge-interior gradient depending on the size of the forest fragment for assessment of the forest structure, species diversity and richness and aboveground carbon stock, and the relationships between pioneer and late successional tree species. Results showed that there was no significant edge effect on tree species diversity in Chawia (p = 0.564), Fururu (p = 0.689), Mbololo (p = 0.369), Ngangao (p = 0.576) and Vuria (p = 0.338), although the species diversity was higher in the forest interior than in the intermediate forest and on the forest edge. Similarly, there was no significant edge effect on species richness in Chawia (p = 0.490), Fururu (p = 0.507), Mbololo (p = 0.303), Ngangao (p = 0.886) and Vuria (p = 0.090). Above-ground carbon stocks were not significantly affected by edge effect in Chawia (p = 0.704), Fururu (p = 0.908), Mbololo (p = 0.544), Ngangao (p = 0.991) and Vuria (p = 0.590). Tabemaemontana stapfiana and M. lanceolata co-existed with 45.5% and 18.2% of the late successional tree species respectively while 9.1% of the late successional tree species co-existed with each of the following pioneer tree species: A. gummifera, M. conglomerata, S. guineense and X. monospora. These results could be used to develop conservation strategies that may minimize forest degradation and biodiversity erosion and loss in the fragmented forest ecosystems.

AB The highly interactive nature of predator-prey relationship is essential for ecosystem conservation; predators have been extirpated, however, from entire ecosystems all over the Earth. Reintroductions comprise a management technique to reverse this trend. Species Distribution Models (SDM) are preemptive tools for release-site selection, and can define levels of habitat quality over the species distribution. The Atlantic Forest of South America has lost most of its apex predators, and Harpy Eagles Harpia harpyja-Earth's largest eagle-are now limited to few forest pockets in this domain. Harpy Eagles are supposedly widespread in the Amazon Forest, however, where habitat loss and degradation is advancing at a rapid pace. We aim to describe the suitability of threatened Amazonian landscapes for this eagle. We also aim to assess the suitability of remaining Atlantic Forest sites for Harpy Eagle reintroductions. Here we show that that considerable eagle habitat has already been lost in Amazonia due to the expansion of the "Arc of Deforestation", and that Amazonian forests currently represent 93% of the current distribution of the species. We also show that the Serra do Mar protected areas in southeastern Brazil is the most promising region for Harpy Eagle reintroductions in the Atlantic Forest. Reintroduction and captive breeding programs have been undertaken for Harpy Eagles, building the technical and biological basis for a successful restoration framework. Our distribution range for this species represents a 41% reduction of what is currently proposed by IUCN. Furthermore, habitat loss in Amazonia, combined with industrial logging and hunting suggest that the conservation status of this species should be reassessed. We suggest researchers and conservation practitioners can use this work to help expand efforts to conserve Harpy Eagles and their natural habitats.

AB Previous studies attempting to explain the factors that determine local participation in conservation initiatives have concluded that socio-political exclusion is the main barrier to being involved in such initiatives. Such studies have not differentiated between different types of conservation initiatives. In this paper, we contribute to the literature analyzing the socio-cultural correlates of participation, by differentiating between participation in three types of conservation schemes: protected areas, payment for environmental services, and community conservation. We use data obtained from six rural communities in Mexico, where different combinations of conservation schemes are found. Through linear regression analysis, we explore the relationship between participation and (1) the community of residence; (2) demographics; and (3) socioeconomic characteristics of individuals. Our results suggest that local participation in conservation strategies depends, to a large extent, on the socio-political context in which they are embedded and that the exclusion of women and young adults is clearly consistent.

ID CERRADO SENSU-STRICTO
AB Background: The Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil and the most biodiverse tropical savannah in the world and acts as a great sequester of atmospheric carbon. The lack of studies related to the quantification of its total biomass compromises the understanding of the dynamics of CO2 in this biome. Thus, it is relevant to develop studies aiming at obtaining accurate estimates of the carbon stock in the different phytophysiognomies that make the Cerrado, to include them in appropriate forest management models. Based on the hypothesis that the amount of carbon stored can vary according to the vegetation typology and vegetation compartments, the aerial stock of dry biomass and carbon were estimated in different compartments (arboreal, herbaceous-shrub and litter). The study was developed in open Brazilian savannah and soils on the sandstone and discussed the effect of fire on this phytophysiognomy. For the arboreal compartment were adjusted mathematical models to fit the biomass equations to estimate the individual stock of the trees in this compartment. The results of the stocks were discussed considering the effect of fire on the phytophysiognomy.
   Results: Based on the precision and extra distribution measures, the Schumacher-Hall (non-logarithmic) equation presented better results to estimate the individual biomass and carbon stocks of the open Brazilian savannah trees. The aboveground biomass was 12.88 Mg ha(-1), corresponding to a total carbon stock of 5.91 Mg ha(-1), where most of the stocks are in the herbaceous-shrub compartment (44%). The arboreal compartment accounts for the smallest part of the stocks, followed by the litter.
   Conclusions: The observed values are in the interval verified for other areas of savannah studied in Brazil. The values verified for the open Brazilian savannah in sandy soils are at the lower limit of this range, due to the nutrient-poor nature of this type of soil. The distribution of stocks in the different compartments above the ground points to the fragility of this environment to the random fire effect, common in the region. That shows the need for conservation measures for vegetation maintenance and soil protection to preserve adequate nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.

AB Mapping vegetation types through remote sensing images has proved to be effective, especially in large biomes, such as the Brazilian Cerrado, which plays an important role in the context of management and conservation at the agricultural frontier of the Amazon. We tested several combinations of optical and radar images to identify the four dominant vegetation types that are prevalent in the Cerrado area (i.e., cerrado denso, cerradAo, gallery forest, and secondary forest). We extracted features from both sources of data such as intensity, grey level co-occurrence matrix, coherence, and polarimetric decompositions using Sentinel 2A, Sentinel 1A, ALOS-PALSAR 2 dual/full polarimetric, and TanDEM-X images during the dry and rainy season of 2017. In order to normalize the analysis of these features, we used principal component analysis and subsequently applied the Random Forest algorithm to evaluate the classification of vegetation types. During the dry season, the overall accuracy ranged from 48 to 83%, and during the dry and rainy seasons it ranged from 41 up to 82%. The classification using Sentinel 2A images during the dry season resulted in the highest overall accuracy and kappa values, followed by the classification that used images from all sensors during the dry and rainy season. Optical images during the dry season were sufficient to map the different types of vegetation in our study area.

AB Introduction
   Defoliation and light competition are ubiquitous stressors that can strongly limit plant performance. Tolerance to defoliation is often associated with compensatory growth, which could be positively or negatively related to plant growth. Genetic variation in growth, tolerance and compensation, in turn, plays an important role in the evolutionary adaptation of plants to changing disturbance regimes but this issue has been poorly investigated for long-lived woody species. We quantified genetic variation in plant growth and growth parameters, tolerance to defoliation and compensation for a population of the understorey palm Chamaedorea elegans. In addition, we evaluated genetic correlations between growth and tolerance/compensation.
   Methods
   We performed a greenhouse experiment with 711 seedlings from 43 families with twelve or more individuals of C. elegans. Seeds were collected in southeast Mexico within a 0.7 ha natural forest area. A two-third defoliation treatment ( repeated every two months) was applied to half of the individuals to simulate leaf loss. Compensatory responses in specific leaf area, biomass allocation to leaves and growth per unit leaf area were quantified using iterative growth models.
   Results
   We found that growth rate was highly heritable and that plants compensated strongly for leaf loss. However, genetic variation in tolerance, compensation, and the individual compensatory responses was low. We found strong correlations between family mean growth rates in control and defoliation treatments. We did not find indications for growth-tolerance/compensation trade-offs: genetic correlation between tolerance/compensation and growth rate were not significant.
   Implications
   The high genetic variation in growth rate, but low genetic variation in tolerance and compensation observed here suggest high ability to adapt to changes in environment that require different growth rates, but a low potential for evolutionary adaptation to changes in damage or herbivory. The strong correlations between family mean growth rates in control and defoliation treatments suggest that performance differences among families are also maintained under stress of disturbance.

AB Anthropogenic activities such as logging or forest conversion into agricultural lands are affecting Ecuadorian Amazon forests. To foster private and communal conservation activities an economic incentive-based conservation program (IFC) called Socio Bosque was established. Existing analyses related to conservation strategies are mainly focused on deforestation; while degradation and the role of IFC to safeguard ecosystem services are still scarce. Further on, there is a lack of landscape-level studies taking into account potential side effects of IFC on different forest types. Therefore we assessed ecosystem services (carbon stocks, timber volume) and species richness in landscapes with and without IFC. Additionally, we evaluated potential side-effects of IFC in adjacent forest types; hypothesizing potential leakage effects of IFC. Finally, we tested if deforestation rates decreased after IFC implementation. Forest inventories were conducted in 72 plots across eight landscapes in the Ecuadorian Central Amazon with and without IFC. Plots were randomly selected within three forest types (old-growth, logged and successional forests). In each plot all individuals with a diameter at breast height greater than 10 cm were measured. Old-growth forests in general showed higher carbon stocks, timber volume and species richness, and no significant differences between old-growth forests in IFC and non-IFC landscapes were found. Logged forests had 32% less above-ground carbon (AGC) and timber volume in comparison to old-growth forests. Surprisingly, logged forests near IFC presented higher AGC stocks than logged forests in non-IFC landscapes, indicating positive side-effects of IFC. Successional forests contain 56% to 64% of AGC, total carbon and timber volume, in comparison to old-growth forests, and 82% to 87% in comparison to logged forests. Therefore, successional forests could play an important role for restoration and should receive more attention in national climate change policies. Finally, after IFC implementation deforestation rate decreased on parish level. Our study presents scientific evidence of IFC contribution to conserving ecosystem services and species richness. In addition IFC could help indirectly to reduce degradation effects attributed to logging, indicating potential compatibility of conservation aims with forest activities at a landscape level.

AB Central and South America tropical dry forest (TDF) is a water-limited biome with a high number of endemic species and numerous ecosystem services which has experienced a boom in research in the last decade. Although the number of case studies across these seasonal, water-limited, tropical forests has increased, there has not been a comprehensive review to assess the physiological variability of this biome across the continent and assess how these forests respond to climatic variables. Additionally, understanding forest change and resilience under climatic variability, currently and in the future, is essential for assessing the future extent and health of forests in the future. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a literature review on the variability of TDF diversity and structure across a latitudinal gradient and to assess how these components respond to differences in climatic variables across this geographic area. We first assess the current state of understanding of the structure, biomass, phenological cycles, and successional stages across the latitudinal gradient. We subsequently review the response of these five areas to differences in precipitation, temperature, and extreme weather events, such as droughts and hurricanes. We find that there is a range of adaptability to precipitation, with many areas exhibiting drought tolerance except under the most extreme circumstances, while being susceptible to damage from increased extreme precipitation events. Finally, we use this climatic response to provide a commentary on the projected resilience of TDFs under climatic changes, finding a likelihood of resilience under drying scenarios, although model projections do not agree on the magnitude or direction of precipitation change. This review of quantitative studies will provide more concrete details on the current diversity that encompasses the TDF, the natural climatic ranges under which this ecosystem can survive and thrive, and can help inform future forest management practices under climate change scenarios.

AB Biomass removal by herbivores usually incurs a fitness cost for the attacked plants, with the total cost per unit lost tissue depending on the value of the removed tissue (i.e., how costly it is to be replaced by regrowth). Optimal defense theory, first outlined in the 1960s and 1970s, predicted that these fitness costs result in an arms race between plants and herbivores, in which selection favors resistance strategies that either repel herbivores through morphological and chemical resistance traits in order to reduce their consumption, or result in enemy escape through rapid growth or by timing the growth or flowering to the periods when herbivores are absent. Such resistance against herbivores would most likely evolve when herbivores are abundant, cause extensive damage, and consume valuable plant tissues. The purpose of this Special Feature is to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the phenomenon of overcompensation, specifically, where the finding has brought us and where it is leading us 30 yr later. We first provide a short overview of how the phenomenon of overcompensation has led to broader studies on plant tolerance to herbivory, summarize key findings, and then discuss some promising new directions in light of six featured research papers.

AB Hydraulic traits are important for woody plant functioning and distribution. Associations among hydraulic traits, other leaf and stem traits, and species' performance are relatively well understood for trees, but remain poorly studied for lianas. We evaluated the coordination among hydraulic efficiency (i.e., maximum hydraulic conductivity), hydraulic safety (i.e., cavitation resistance), a suite of eight morphological and physiological traits, and species' abundances for saplings of 24 liana species and 27 tree species in wet tropical forests in Panama. Trees showed a strong trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and hydraulic safety, whereas efficiency and safety were decoupled in lianas. Hydraulic efficiency was strongly and similarly correlated with acquisitive traits for lianas and trees (e.g., positively with gas exchange rates and negatively with wood density). Hydraulic safety, however, showed no correlations with other traits in lianas, but with several in trees (e.g., positively with leaf dry matter content and wood density and negatively with gas exchange rates), indicating that in lianas hydraulic efficiency is an anchor trait because it is correlated with many other traits, while in trees both efficiency and safety are anchor traits. Traits related to shade tolerance (e.g., low specific leaf area and high wood density) were associated with high local tree sapling abundance, but not with liana abundance. Our results suggest that different, yet unknown mechanisms determine hydraulic safety and local-scale abundance for lianas compared to trees. For trees, the trade-off between efficiency and safety will provide less possibilities for ecological strategies. For lianas, however, the uncoupling of efficiency and safety could allow them to have high hydraulic efficiency, and hence high growth rates, without compromising resistance to cavitation under drought, thus allowing them to thrive and outperform trees under drier conditions.

AB Fire is a major disturbance driving the dynamics of the world's savannas. Almost all fires are set by humans who are increasingly altering fire timing and frequency on every continent. The world's largest protected areas of savannas are found in monsoonal northern Australia. These include relatively intact, tall, open forests where traditional indigenous fire regimes have been largely replaced in the past half century by contemporary patterns with trees experiencing fire as often as three out of five years. Eucalypt canopy trees form the basic structure of these savannas and changes to the canopy due to fire regimes cascade to affect other plants and animals. In this study, we used data from nearly three decades of field studies on the effects of fire on individual trees to define eight life-history stages and to calculate transition rates among stages. We developed a stage-based matrix population model that explicitly considers how fire season and understory influence growth, survival, and recruitment for each life-history stage. Long-term population growth rates and transient population dynamics were calculated under five different fire regimes, each in two understory types, using both deterministic and stochastic simulations of seasonal timing of fires. We found that fire was necessary for long-term persistence of eucalypt canopy tree populations but, under annual fires, most populations did not survive. Population persistence was highly dependent on fire regime (fire season and frequency) and understory type. A stochastic model tended to yield higher population growth rates than the deterministic model with regular, periodic fires, even under the same long-term frequency of fires. Transient population dynamics over 100 yr also depended on fire regime and understory, with implications for savanna physiognomy and management. Model predictions were tested in an independent data set from a 21-yr longitudinal field study in Kakadu National Park. This study is a novel and integrative contribution to our understanding of fire in savanna biomes regarding the potential for long-term persistence and transient dynamics of savanna canopy tree populations. The model is relatively simple, generalizable, and adaptable for further investigations of the population dynamics of savanna trees under fire.

AB Megaherbivores play a central role in the evolution and functioning of ecosystems. In tropical forests elephant species are some of the few remaining megaherbivores. Through elephant foraging, nutrients that would be locked in leaves and stems, taking months or years to decay, are quickly liberated for use. In 10 experimental sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we set up 10 pairs of plots (4 x 4 m), each pair involved one treatment, elephant dung addition, and one control. After 1 y, we quantified growth (height and leaf number) and survival of young light-demanding (12) and shade-tolerant (19) plant species (439 stems in total). In general, the addition of elephant dung did not increase seedling growth, and it only increased the number of leaves in shade-tolerant plants with a large initial number of leaves. Researchers have speculated that the loss of elephants would shift the composition of African forests to slow-growing tree species. However, this is not supported by our finding that shows some slow-growing shade-tolerant plants grew more new leaves with additional nutrient input from elephant dung, a condition that would occur if elephant numbers increase.

AB Aim: To quantify taxon diversity, biogeographic distributions and patterns of community assembly in xeniid octocorals using molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs).
   Location: Red Sea, Indian and western Pacific Oceans.
   Taxon: Xeniidae, a family of reef-dwelling octocorals (Anthozoa, Octocorallia).
   Methods: Xeniids collected at 13 locations were sequenced at three barcode loci, and assigned to MOTUs defined by minimum genetic distance thresholds. Taxon richness (number of MOTUs) and endemicity (per cent of MOTUs found at a single location) were quantified. Patterns of beta-diversity (species turnover) and phylogenetic beta-diversity (lineage turnover) among geographical regions were visualized using hierarchical clustering, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots and distance-decay relationships. Community assembly was investigated by comparing the mean pairwise distance (MPD) and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) separating species in each assemblage to values generated for null communities.
   Results: A genetic distance threshold of 0.3% discriminated 67 MOTUs, with taxon richness ranging from 2-18 MOTUs per site. Out of the 67 MOTUs, 48 (72%) were found at only a single location, and only two spanned both the western Indian and Pacific Oceans. Species turnover among sites was high, but phylogenetic beta-diversity was lower than beta-diversity and differed significantly from null models of community assembly at only two sites. beta-diversity and phylogenetic beta-diversity both increased significantly with geographic distance, and sites clustered into three distinct biogeographic regions (Red Sea and western Indian Ocean; Western Australia; western Pacific Ocean and Great Barrier Reef, Australia). All five major clades of xeniids were represented in each region.
   Main conclusions: A genetic approach to biodiversity estimation suggests that most xeniid taxa are regional endemics whose geographic distribution is likely governed by dispersal limitation. This conclusion contrasts with published records of certain morphospecies occurrences, which imply that they have broad geographic ranges. So far, the distribution of xeniid biodiversity mirrors that of scleractinian corals, with species richness highest in the Coral Triangle, but endemicity peaking in peripheral areas.

AB Moisture availability is the main limiting factor of plant growth and biomass production in arid and semi-arid grasslands. The question whether plant responses to changing precipitation are species-specific, or change over entire plant communities is still controversial. Our study focussed on intraspecific changes in the plant traits canopy height, plant width, specific leaf area, chlorophyll fluorescence, performance index, and individual biomass of three congeneric species pairs with changing precipitation in Mongolian rangelands, covering a gradient from the desert to the forest steppes. Using this trait data set, we focussed on three questions: (i) Is the replacement of congeneric species along an environmental gradient also reflected in their trait values? (ii) Can intraspecific trait variation patterns be derived from patterns in species abundances, i.e., are trait values optimal where species are most abundant? (iii) Is the within-population trait variability lowest in populations growing under very dry conditions, i.e., under highest environmental stress, caused by stronger filtering? We tested the responses of the six traits to changing precipitation according to species' identity and abundance. We found unimodal relationships between most of the species' traits and precipitation, and strong associations between species abundances and trait values, but not for all investigated species. Trait variability did not significantly differ between populations from different positions along the precipitation gradient. Our results highlight that species show multiple or even opposite trait responses along the precipitation gradient. It thus remains challenging to predict how plant distributions will shift under changing environmental conditions based on their trait composition.

AB Tropical forests are increasingly degraded by industrial logging, urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure, with only 20% of the remaining area considered intact. However, this figure does not include other, more cryptic but pervasive forms of degradation, such as overhunting. Here, we quantified and mapped the spatial patterns of mammal defaunation in the tropics using a database of 3,281 mammal abundance declines from local hunting studies. We simultaneously accounted for population abundance declines and the probability of local extirpation of a population as a function of several predictors related to human accessibility to remote areas and species' vulnerability to hunting. We estimated an average abundance decline of 13% across all tropical mammal species, with medium-sized species being reduced by >27% and large mammals by >40%. Mammal populations are predicted to be partially defaunated (i.e., declines of 10%-100%) in ca. 50% of the pantropical forest area (14 million km(2)), with large declines (>70%) in West Africa. According to our projections, 52% of the intact forests (IFs) and 62% of the wilderness areas (WAs) are partially devoid of large mammals, and hunting may affect mammal populations in 20% of protected areas (PAs) in the tropics, particularly in West and Central Africa and Southeast Asia. The pervasive effects of overhunting on tropical mammal populations may have profound ramifications for ecosystem functioning and the livelihoods of wild-meat-dependent communities, and underscore that forest coverage alone is not necessarily indicative of ecosystem intactness. We call for a systematic consideration of hunting effects in (large-scale) biodiversity assessments for more representative estimates of human-induced biodiversity loss.

Milne Edwards, 1837, possess the ability to discriminate between chemical cues produced by intertidal plants. Both species displayed a variable, but broadly comparable, response to plant odours, showing an attraction to aquatic, emergent species irrespective of taxonomy, and either showing no response or an avoidance to non-aquatic coastal species. While the chemical basis for an attraction or avoidance to these plant species is unclear, the ability to differentiate between plant species could have important implications for the behaviour of these shrimps, assisting them to locate and orient towards structurally complex habitats when visual acuity is limited.

AB Species' response to environmental site conditions and neighborhood interactions are among the important drivers of species' spatial distributions and the resultant interspecies spatial association. The importance of competition to interspecies spatial association can be inferred from a high degree of trait dissimilarity of the associated species, and vice versa for environmental filtering. However, because the importance of environmental filtering and competition in structuring plant communities often vary with spatial scale and with plant life stage, the species' spatial association-trait dissimilarity relationship should vary accordingly. We tested these assumptions in a fully mapped 50-ha subtropical evergreen forest of China, where we assessed the degrees of interspecies spatial associations between adult trees and between saplings at two different spatial scales (10 m versus 40 m) and measured the degrees of trait dissimilarity of the associated species using six traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content, wood density, wood dry-matter content and maximum height). Consistent across spatial scales and plant life stages, the degree of interspecies spatial association and the degree of overall trait dissimilarity (i.e. all six traits together) were negatively correlated, suggesting that environmental filtering might help assemble functionally similar species in the forest under study. However, when we looked into the spatial association-trait dissimilarity relationship for individual traits, we found that the relationships between interspecies spatial associations and the dissimilarity of wood density and dry-matter content were significant for adults but not for saplings, suggesting the importance of wood traits in species' survival during ontogeny. We conclude that processes shaping interspecies spatial association are spatial scale and plant life stage dependent, and that the distributions of functional traits offer useful insights into the processes underlying community spatial structure.

AB Identifying the mechanisms underlying invasive plant establishment and native plant decline remains a central goal in ecology, particularly for biodiversity hotspots such as islands. We re-analyzed a previously published meta-dataset to test the prediction that neighbor effects are stronger on islands vs. continents because island plants are weaker competitors. Although we detected marginally stronger neighbor effects on islands than continents, this was due, at least in part, to stronger competition among native species. An absence of studies testing neighbor effects between native vs. invasive plants on islands prevents a rigorous test for competition effects on islands, highlighting an important knowledge gap.

AB Background and aimsWhilst several studies have shown that edaphic variability influences species composition in nutrient-poor tropical forests, the determinants of local species distributions and, in particular, how these change from younger to mature individuals in such forests are still under debate, and have been poorly explored in tropical heath forests that are among the least fertile tropical forest ecosystems.MethodsWe investigated the influence of soil fertility and topography on a Bornean heath forest species composition, -, -diversity and tree size structure among size classes by recording all trees 1cm DBH in 16 forest plots totalling 0.36ha.ResultsTree species distributions generally followed gradients in available Al and soil depth; - and -diversity were linked to soil depth, and to some extent also to pH and the H:Al ratio. In contrast, forest structural attributes (basal area and stem density) were negatively correlated with both available and total P and a wider suite of soil nutrients, although trees 10cm DBH were positively correlated with total P.ConclusionOur study shows that heath forest species distribution, richness and structure is related to both edaphic and topographic characteristics and that soil acidity might have a strong influence in shaping these forests' features. Among size classes, small trees are less influenced by soil and topography, whereas the sensitivity to these variables increases with tree size. We thus highlight that multiple edaphic factors influence different aspects of tropical forest structure, including different tree life stages, and species composition.

AB Active restoration strategies increase the production of leaf litter in tropical forests, but little is known about their effect on litter decomposition and subsequent nutrient release. We quantified changes in leaf litter stoichiometry during decomposition in former pasture sites under contrasting restoration strategies (natural regeneration, applied nucleation/islands tree planting and plantation), as well as in nearby primary forest. Litterbags were employed to evaluate decomposition. We used a leaf mixture of either the four planted tree species in the plantation and island treatments or the nearby primary forest and compared them under a factorial design. Decomposition rates were similar between restoration treatments (p>0.5), but leaves decomposed faster in the forest mixture than in the plantation mixture (p<0.01). The content of Ca, Mg, K, P, and the C:N ratio were higher in the forest mixture at the beginning and during decomposition (p<0.05); the N content in the plantation mixture was higher at the beginning but lower during decomposition (p<0.05), which meant greater mobilization of nitrogen per unit of carbon lost. K and P had a strong initial release, while Mg was released more gradually. N and Ca had an irregular pattern of initial fast release, immobilization, and re-release in the later stages. We conclude that the differences in rates of decomposition and nutrient release in these systems under restoration were at least partly determined by the floristic heterogeneity and chemical quality of the leaf litter that reaches the soil.

AB Deforestation in the tropics is often followed by the creation of anthropogenic savannas used for animal husbandry. By discontinuing burning regimes, forests may recolonize the savanna and carbon stocks may recover. However, little is known about the success and speed of tropical forest recovery, while such information is vital for a better quantification of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD +) as well as supporting Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) practices. Therefore, we designed a forest regeneration experiment within a savanna patch in the Mayombe hills (Democratic Republic of Congo), by discontinuing the annual burning regime in an 88 ha exclosure since 2005. 101 permanent inventory plots (40.4 ha) were installed in 2010 and remeasured in 2014. Tree species were classified as savanna or forest specialists. We estimate a forest specialist encroachment rate of 9 stems ha(-1) yr(-1) and a savanna specialist disappearance rate of 16 stems ha(-1) yr(-1). Average diameter of forest specialists did not change due to an increasing influx of recruits, while average diameter of savanna trees increased due to decreasing recruitment. Carbon stored by forest specialists increased from 3.12 to 5.60 Mg C ha(-1), suggesting a forest carbon recovery rate of 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Using the average carbon stock of 19 nearby mature rainforest plots as a reference, we estimate a total forest carbon recovery time of at least 150 years. The Manzonzi exclosure may potentially become an important reference experiment to quantify REDD + schemes in Central Africa. Furthermore, this natural regeneration experiment demonstrates how carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation can go hand-in-hand. However, more censuses are needed to better quantify the long-term carbon recovery trajectory within the protected area.

AB Xerophytic thickets (XT) in south-western Madagascar are threatened by deforestation, mainly due to slash-and-burn cultivation. However, few studies have been conducted on how XT ecosystems operate. This study characterizes XT plant biodiversity and analyses the post-cultivation regeneration process of XT on the Belomotse plateau. Sixty 10 m x 10 m plots were sampled according to soil type (calcisol and lixisol) and age of abandonment (1-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-40 years and > 40 years as mature XT). Soil was the main driver of XT floristic composition. Overstory floristic composition did not vary along secondary succession stages. However, structure parameters (height and basal area) increased significantly with age of abandonment, while diversity (species richness and evenness index) did not increase with age of abandonment. Secondary succession in XT vegetation was assimilated to growth of structural parameters. The slowness of the growth of shrub species found in post cultivation XT plots can explain this lack of change in diversity and floristic composition along secondary succession stages. The reduction of pressure on XT by promoting alternative activities that provide income for local communities (goat breeding and extension of arable areas along rivers delimiting XT) is proposed in order to protect the endangered biodiversity of this region.

AB To quantify and assess the processes underlying community assembly and driving tree species abundance distributions(SADs) with spatial scale variation in two typical subtropical secondary forests in Dashanchong state-owned forest farm, two 1-ha permanent study plots (100-m x 100-m) were established. We selected four diversity indices including species richness, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson and Pielou, and relative importance values to quantify community assembly and biodiversity. Empirical cumulative distribution and species accumulation curves were utilized to describe the SADs of two forests communities trees. Three types of models, including statistic model (lognormal and logseries model), niche model (broken-stick, niche preemption, and Zipf-Mandelbrodt model), and neutral theory model, were estimated by the fitted SADs. Simulation effects were tested by Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results found that the Fagaceae and Anacardiaceae families were their respective dominance family in the evergreen broad-leaved and deciduous mixed communities. According to original data and random sampling predictions, the SADs were hump-shaped for intermediate abundance classes, peaking between 8 and 32 in the evergreen broad-leaved community, but this maximum increased with size of total sampled area size in the deciduous mixed community. All niche models could only explain SADs patterns at smaller spatial scales. However, both the neutral theory and purely statistical models were suitable for explaining the SADs for secondary forest communities when the sampling plot exceeded 40 m. The results showed the SADs indicated a clear directional trend toward convergence and similar predominating ecological processes in two typical subtropical secondary forests. The neutral process gradually replaced the niche process in importance and become the main mechanism for determining SADs of forest trees as the sampling scale expanded. Thus, we can preliminarily conclude that neutral processes had a major effect on biodiversity patterns in these two subtropical secondary forests but exclude possible contributions of other processes.

AB The species richness-productivity relationship is one of the most debated patterns in ecology. Species coexistence theory suggests that it could be tightly linked to the type of nutrient limitation (no limitation, single-nutrient limitation, colimitation by several nutrients). Yet, the effects of nutrient limitation on the species richness-productivity relationship have been rarely studied at the regional and continental scales. Combining the predictions of the humped-back model and the niche dimension hypothesis, we hypothesized that an increase in plant species richness with the number of different limiting nutrients is detectable only at higher productivity levels, at which competition for nutrients is more intense. Therefore, we expected the shape of the diversity-productivity relationship to differ between sites colimited by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), sites limited by a single nutrient (either N or P), and sites not limited by any of these nutrients. To test this hypothesis, we used species richness data collected in 10 m x 10 m plots at 694 temperate dry grassland sites across eight regions in northern Eurasia. Productivity ranged from 10 to similar to 500 g/m(2) of above-ground standing biomass. The type of nutrient limitation was identified by critical nutrient ratios alone and their combination with critical nutrient concentrations measured in the plant tissue. Relationships were analysed using generalized linear and mixed-effect models. In line with our expectations, species richness of Eurasian temperate dry grasslands increased more steeply and peaked higher under higher productivity levels at N&P-colimited sites. When nutrient limitation was assessed by both ratios and concentrations, species richness at N&P-colimited sites continued to increase monotonically until the maximum productivity sampled in this study. In contrast, at sites with a single-nutrient limitation or no limitation, the peak in species richness was lower and occurred at a lower productivity of about 300-400 g/m(2). Synthesis. We provide the first evidence that the species richness-productivity relationship may depend on the type of nutrient limitation as predicted by the species coexistence theory. To generalize these findings, the role of nutrient limitation needs to be tested in other ecosystems, including more productive plant communities.

AB One of the central questions in ecology is why some species are abundant while others are rare. In plant communities, some studies show that rare plant species are rare because they suffer stronger negative density-dependent effects from pathogens compared to abundant plant species. Moreover, such pathogen effects are also suggested to be related to phylogenetic distance among plant species. However, the importance of pathogens has been commonly inferred by treating the entire pathogen community as a "black box" without explicitly characterizing pathogen richness and community composition. Here, we test two predictions. First, if rare plant species are more susceptible to pathogens, we predict that rare plant species are associated with a higher richness of specialists (i.e., pathogens that attack only a single plant species) and/or the total pathogen community. If phylogenetically distinct plant species are less susceptible to pathogens, we predict that plant species with higher phylogenetic distinctiveness (i.e., a measure of how phylogenetically distant a species is from other co-occurring species) are associated with a lower richness of phylogenetic specialists (i.e., pathogens that attack closely related plant species) and/or the total pathogen community. We conducted a survey of the root-associated pathogen communities from 45 plant species in a subtropical forest. We showed that approximately 40% and 25% of the pathogens were specialists and phylogenetic specialists respectively. In contrast to our first prediction, the richness of the total pathogen community but not the richness of the specialists was found to be positively related to plant species abundance, indicating that rare plant species suffer less from pathogens. Consistent with our second prediction, both the richness of the phylogenetic specialists and the total pathogen community were found to be negatively related to plant species phylogenetic distinctiveness. Furthermore, these correlations were stronger at the earlier plant life stages examined. Synthesis. We found that the root-associated pathogen communities were less diverse in rare plant species and plant species with few close relatives. These associations varied across multiple plant life stages, suggesting that the strength of the above-ground-below-ground interactions change dynamically across plant life span.

AB Mechanisms for maintaining biodiversity are still unclear despite considerable research. The classic theory predicts that stable co-occurrence of competitive species requires niche differentiation. In fact, the co-occurring species are often differentiated from each other. However, the neutral theory assuming equivalence of the reproductive rate of all individuals regardless of the species in a biological community has successfully recreated the observed patterns of species abundance distribution. This success is based on the unrealistic assumption suggesting that some mechanisms eliminate interspecific differences in the reproductive rates. Here, I present sexual selection as a candidate of the mechanisms by constructing analytical and simulation models. Sexual selection affects the traits that increase mating success even at the expense of fecundity when the species is abundant. By contrast, when the species is at a relatively low density, this negative effect on fecundity is mitigated because less competition for mating occurs in the rare species. The analytical model of this effect on fecundity predicted that sexual organisms stop population growth before exhausting resources due to the effect. This prediction was confirmed by simulation models. The simulations also showed that hundreds of competitive species with interspecific differences in reproductive potential can coexist over 10,000 generations. Moreover, species abundance distributions obtained from the simulations were similar to the patterns observed in field data. Given the generality of sexual reproduction in nature, sexual selection is likely to play a significant role in sustaining biodiversity over a broad range of environments. Synthesis. Evolution does not always maximize population growth rate. This study shows that evolution of sexual selection controls the population growth rate according to density and stabilizes the population size. This stabilizing effect has a potential to rescue endangered species from extinction, prevent overgrowth of common species, promote coexistence of competitive species, and successfully recreate the observed patterns of species abundance distribution.

AB Methods based on RGB (Red, Green, Blue) image segmentation may emerge as a new and low-cost method for estimation the quality of tree seedlings. However, the vast number of indexes based on the use of the RGB image segmentation and the lack of references in the literature still hinder the widespread use of this technology. Thus, we conducted a study aiming to test the relationships between methods based on absorbance and reflectance, widely used for the estimation of chlorophyll contents and physiological status of trees, and ten indexes based on RGB component analysis. We used leaves of five tropical tree species, belonging to different botanical families. Leaf absorbance was measured using the handheld chlorophyll meter SPAD-502, reflectance was measured using a spectrometer and the RGB indices were obtained from digitalized images of the leaves using a flatbed scanner. Modified linear regression models including all five species were used to relate RGB indices to absorbance and reflectance indices. Data collected from leaves of seedlings of five tropical tree species indicated that digital image processing technology can be a useful and rapid nondestructive method for assessment of physiological status of tree seedlings at nursery stage. Among the RGB indexes tested in this study the R, 2R*(G-B)/(G+B) and 2G*(G-B)/(G+B) are the most promising for analysis the tropical seedlings physiological status and quality.

AB Light is the most important physical variable that affects patterns of biomass allocation. A quantitative understanding of biomass allocation patterns is crucial to quantifying ecosystem dynamics and might have many practical uses in silviculture. In this research, we investigated the allocation of the aboveground biomass to leaves, branches, and bole as well as leaf morphology, using 26 saplings of Alnus subcordata C. A. M., 26 of Carpinus betulus L., and 27 of Fagus orientalis L. within a wide gradient of light conditions. Saplings were harvested in August 2014 in temperate, mixed deciduous forests of northern Iran in three sites with similar topographic conditions. A linear mixed effect model was used to evaluate the effect of light and species. Moreover, we developed biomass allometric equations using nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression. Biomass allocation to different organs and all leaf morphological traits were different among species. Light affected biomass allocation to leaves as well as specific leaf area and the direction of the effect was different for each species. Branch and bole allocation, leaf area ratio, and leaf area index were not affected by light. The effect of the interaction between light and species was significant for leaf allocation, branch allocation and specific leaf area. Moreover, sapling size seems to be an important factor explaining the effect of light on biomass allocation. Deriving highly precise biomass equations was possible by just using diameter at breast height and height, and available light did not improve the precision of models.

AB Noise is a form of human-induced rapid environmental change, and mounting evidence suggests that it can affect the sensory environment and consequently the decision-making ability of animals. However, while the effects of anthropogenic noise on individual organisms in the context of movement patterns, foraging and predation risk have been reported, relatively little is known about how noise impacts groups and intraspecific interactions. Here we investigated the effects of anthropogenic noise on grouping preference (i.e. being with conspecifics or alone) in the European hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus. Hermit crabs live in empty gastropod shells and frequently fight with each other to gain an optimal-fitting shell. Thus, crabs' grouping preference may depend on the optimality of their own shell and thus on their motivation to gain another. To test the effect of shell size and its interaction with noise exposure on grouping preferences, crabs were housed in either suboptimal or optimal shells before being exposed to playbacks of either ship noise or an ambient sound (control) and given the choice to group with one or five conspecifics or to remain alone in a neutral zone. Crabs occupying suboptimal shells had a longer latency to enter the zone with a single crab than crabs in optimal shells. This difference was only seen in the ambient sound treatment, disappearing completely under ship noise. Under ambient sound, crabs in optimal shells spent most of their time close to a single crab, while crabs in suboptimal shells showed no clear preference. However, exposure to ship noise reversed the effect of shell quality on grouping preference. Our results demonstrate that exposure to anthropogenic noise can alter not only individual behaviour but also social behaviour.

AB Tropical biodiversity is under threat from a wide variety of anthropogenic stressors. Understanding the effect of major stressors-most notably land use change, over-harvesting, emergence of novel pathogens, and climate change-is a major goal of tropical biology. However, to do so requires baseline data with which to compare present-day patterns. Unfortunately, the tropics suffer from a lack of basic historical data; the few studies which have published such data have proven invaluable. In 1989, Fauth et al. described their studies of reptile and amphibian diversity and population demographics across tropical elevational gradients in Costa Rica. Since then, Fauth et al.'s basic ecological data have been widely used to document shifting patterns of species composition and abundance. Here, 30 years later, we argue that (a) collecting foundational ecological data remains incredibly important, especially in the tropics, and especially in those taxa which are generally understudied (e.g., reptiles and amphibians), (b) despite being one of the original goals of the 1989 study, the mechanisms driving biogeographical patterns of diversity remain unclear (both in the tropics and globally), and (c) that revisiting sites of historic biodiversity surveys-particularly those along gradients of environmental change-is incredibly important to our understanding of how tropical diversity is currently, and will continue to be, affected by activities in the Anthropocene. In its simplest terms, there has never been a time where the collection of basic data in the tropics has ever been more important.

AB Urban decision-makers typically cannot utilize empirical bird studies to create bird-friendly landscape designs because academic results are often in a format that is not easily transferable to planning. We report on the results of three systematic reviews of peer reviewed literature regarding bird occurrence in forests, forest fragments, and tree canopy in and around North American cities. Note that our reviews focused on occurrence and did not evaluate species fitness or abundance. We synthesized findings from 48 studies to create a list of 219 forest dwelling species; and for each species, we identified whether the species utilized or did not utilize forest fragments during the breeding season; whether migrant species utilized forest fragments as stopover sites during the migration season; and whether the species utilized residential areas with trees during the breeding and migration seasons. We found that some interior-forest specialists, which generally require large tracts of forest to breed successfully, use small urban and rural forest fragments as well as tree canopy within suburban residential areas as stopover sites during migration seasons. This supports previous literature findings that habitat requirements for migrants, including interior-forest specialists, may differ between breeding and migration seasons. The synthesized bird list will allow built environment professionals to identify bird species that can and cannot use treed habitat in fragmented rural and urban landscapes, and we have created a planning tool for conserving avian habitat.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have become a valuable policy tool for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems. The central premise of PES success is that landholders are willing to provide ecosystem services. However, previous studies failed to consider this willingness of landholders to participate in PES within the theoretical frameworks of opportunity cost, income structure, and energy structure. This lack results in the deviation of the existing PES project design from market-based incentives and gravitation toward adopting command-and-control subsidies that are typically intended to be replaced. To fill this gap, this study examines the effects of opportunity cost, income structure, and energy structure on the participation of landholders in PES, using the panel data of the household survey of the Grain-to-Green Program in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, China. The obtained findings demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between opportunity cost and landholder participation rate, suggesting that the participation of landholders in PES does not always decrease with increasing opportunity cost. The dependence of landholders on cropland income is inversely proportional to their participation in PES. The effects of other agricultural income on the decision-making of householders were not significant. Moreover, the fuelwood-based energy structure negatively affects the participation of landholders in PES. Therefore, we argue that the formulation of PES incentives in line with local socioeconomic conditions and individual preferences can further stimulate the landholder participation in PES.

AB It is now widely accepted that the majority of tropical landscapes are in transition from disturbance to recovery. Remediation efforts are occurring in Central and South America, attempting to recuperate the soils, often using indigenous nitrogen (N)-fixing tree species. Tree species-generated soil microbial heterogeneity might be important in facilitating regeneration of forest vegetation growth and, although some work has identified these efforts may enhance the soil carbon (C), there have been few studies conducted on how these trees are affecting the below-ground soil biological dynamics in these regions. Here, we explored how and to what extent individual plant effects of a native N-fixing and non-N-fixing plant has affected the below-ground soil C and N metrics and soil bacterial and fungal community composition. To begin to address this, we examined if there were differences in various soil abiotic factors (ToC, TN, C:N ratio, C-mic , NH4+, NO3-, pH, and % moisture) and in the soil bacterial and fungal community composition associated with soil of a native non-N-fixer, Dipteryx panamensis and a native N-fixer, Pentaclethra macroloba, and in comparison to the primary forest bulk-soil in which these tree species occur. We found that primary forest-soils had the greatest amounts of soil NH4+ and C-mic, followed by Pentaclethra-soils. Dipteryx-soils had the least amount of soil C-mic and NH4+, but the greatest amounts of soil NO3-. The PERMANOVA results indicated that the Bray-Curtis soil bacterial and fungal community compositions were significantly different between N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree-soils, and also to that of the primary forest-soils. Our results also demonstrated that soil NH4+ best explained the variation observed in the soil C-mic patterns (39.2%), and, both the soil bacterial (22.8%) and fungal community composition (18.1%). Furthermore, we provide evidence that the N-fixer Pentaclethra-soils stimulates the production of more soil C-mic than the non-N-fixer Dipteryx-soils. It is clear that these tree species are important in creating changes in the soil microbial community composition, and that NH4+ may be associated with a shift in a functional response that may have implications for CUE and remediation in this region.

AB The Energy-Water-Food Nexus is one of the most complex sustainability challenges faced by the world. This is particularly true in Brazil, where insufficiently understood interactions within the Nexus are contributing to large-scale deforestation and land-use change, water and energy scarcity, and increased vulnerability to climate change. The reason is a combination of global environmental change and global economic change, putting unprecedented pressures on the Brazilian environment and ecosystems. In this paper, we identify and discuss the main Nexus challenges faced by Brazil across sectors (e.g. energy, agriculture, water) and scales (e.g. federal, state, municipal). We use four case studies to explore all nodes of the Nexus. For each, we analyse data from economic and biophysical modelling sources in combination with an overview of the legislative and policy landscape, in order to identify governance shortcomings in the context of growing challenges. We analyse the complex interdependence of developments at the global and local (Brazilian) levels, highlighting the impact of global environmental and economic change on Brazil and, conversely, that of developments in Brazil for other countries and the world. We conclude that there is a need to adjust the scientific approach to these challenges as an enabling condition for stronger science-policy bridges for sustainability policy-making.

AB The North American cyprinid Pimephales promelas is a species with a wide distribution range, occurring in distinct hydrographic basins in Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Previous morphological and meristic analyses of P. promelas concluded that at least three subspecies exist in the midwestern and northeast region of the United States. No studies have been carried out on the Mexican population of P. promelas, but the findings of cryptic diversity in United States populations of this species, as well as in other codistributed fish species in Mexico could be an indication that Mexican populations of P. promelas consist of cryptic species. Using the mitochondrial gene cyt b and the first intron of the S7 ribosomal protein-coding nuclear gene we carried out phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of populations of P. promelas across its distribution range in northwestern Mexico. Using this information were analyzed the structure and differentiation level between populations of P. promelas from distinct river basins in the region in identifying cryptic diversity. Twenty-four sequences were obtained for cyt b, and 30 for S7, which included the two heterozygous alleles. The results revealed the existence of four well-differentiated lineages: (1) Yaqui in the Pacific slope; (2) Santa Maria, and (3) Casas Grandes in the Guzman Basin; and (4) Nazas+Conchos in Chihuahua state. This challenges the current taxonomy of P. promelas. Differences in the relationships between markers and the small sample size for the Santa Maria population (n = 1), indicate that our results must be corroborated with more data and morphological analyses. Biogeographic analysis of these findings suggest that the evolutionary history of P. promelas is associated with the fragmentation of the ancestral Rio Grande river system since Miocene in northwestern Mexico consistent with findings for codistributed fish species.

AB Background: Prescribed burning is an important management tool in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Sm.) forests of southwest Western Australia to reduce the risk of damaging bushfires. In 1986 to 1987, we established long-term study sites in dry (mean annual rainfall similar to 700 mm) and moist (mean annual rainfall similar to 1000 mm) jarrah forests to assess the effects of prescribed burning, as well as other fire treatments including fire exclusion, on the composition, richness, and relative abundance of forest understory vegetation.
   Results: Over almost 30 years, species assemblages within all fire treatments changed significantly through time, but the changes were independent of treatment. The pattern of change in composition of fire response types over elapsed time was different between sites. At the dry site, changes in species assemblages were initially relatively large in the first decade or so of the study, but slowed thereafter. At the moist site, compositional change driven by obligate seeding shrubs occurred faster and more uniformly with time across all treatments. Species richness was also independent of fire treatment at both sites. Species richness decreased with elapsed time on the moist site but increased with elapsed time on the dry site. The stronger elapsed-time effect rendered the time since fire effect on loss of species richness on the moist site to be insignificant, but there was an inverse relationship with time since fire at the dry site. Within each site, there were clear patterns of changing abundance based on life form and fire response groups, but this was not consistent between sites.
   Conclusions: At the scale of the current study, jarrah forest plant communities displayed resilience to imposed experimental fire regimes. Over time, either elapsed time or time since fire, species assemblages across all treatments changed regardless of fire treatment, but changes were mostly associated with specific plant life forms and fire response traits, suggesting that the process is both deterministic and stochastic. While many species changed in abundance over time, no species were lost as a result of the fire treatments. Within the fire frequency and intensity ranges investigated in this study, there was flexibility in the application of prescribed fire to achieve management objectives without loss of plant diversity.

AB Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) is an increasing global problem that, despite being widely recognized in terrestrial systems, has been studied much less in marine habitats. In this study we investigated the effect of ALAN on behavioral and physiological traits of Concholepas concholepas, an important keystone species of the south-eastern Pacific coast. We used juveniles collected in intertidal habitats that had not previously been exposed to ALAN. In the laboratory we exposed them to two treatments: darkness and white LED ( Lighting Emitting Diodes) to test for the impacts of ALAN on prey-searching behavior, self-righting time and metabolism. In the field, the distribution of juveniles was observed during daylight-hours to determine whether C. concholepas preferred shaded or illuminated microhabitats. Moreover, we compared the abundance of juveniles collected during day- and night-time hours. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that juveniles of C. concholepas seek out and choose their prey more efficiently in darkened areas. White LED illuminated conditions increased righting times and metabolism. Field surveys indicated that, during daylight hours, juveniles were more abundant in shaded micro-habitats than in illuminated ones. However, during darkness hours, individuals were not seen to aggregate in any particular microhabitats. We conclude that the exposure to ALAN might disrupt important behavioral and physiological traits of small juveniles in this species which, as a mechanism to avoid visual predators, are mainly active at night. It follows that ALAN in coastal areas might modify the entire community structure of intertidal habitats by altering the behavior of this keystone species. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding biological community distribution patterns and their drivers across different scales is one of the major goals of community ecology in a rapidly changing world. Considering natural forest-grassland ecotones distributed over the south Brazilian region we investigated how ant communities are assembled locally, i.e. considering different habitats, and regionally, i.e. considering different physiographic regions. We used taxonomic and phylogenetic approaches to investigate diversity patterns and search for environmental/spatial drivers at each scale. We sampled ants using honey and tuna baits in forest and grassland habitats, in ecotones distributed at nine sites in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Overall, we found 85 ant species belonging to 23 genera and six subfamilies. At the local scale, we found forests and grasslands as equivalent in ant species and evolutionary history diversities, but considerably different in terms of species composition. In forests, the soil surface air temperature predicts foraging ant diversity. In grasslands, while the height of herbaceous vegetation reduces ant diversity, treelet density from forest expansion processes clearly increases it. At a regional scale, we did not find models that sufficiently explained ant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity based on regional environmental variables. The variance in species composition, but not in evolutionary histories, across physiographic regions is driven by space and historical processes. Our findings unveil important aspects of ant community ecology in natural transition systems, indicating environmental filtering as an important process structuring the communities at the local scale, but mostly spatial processes acting at the regional scale.

AB Although the impacts of climate change on biodiversity are increasing worldwide, few studies have attempted to forecast these impacts on Amazon Tropical Forest. In this study, we estimated the impact of climate change on Amazonian avian assemblages considering range shifts, species loss, vulnerability of ecosystem functioning, future effectiveness of current protected areas and potential climatically stable areas for conservation actions. Species distribution modelling based on two algorithms and three different scenarios of climate change was used to forecast 501 avian species, organized on main ecosystem functions (frugivores, insectivores and nectarivores) for years 2050 and 2070. Considering the entire study area, we estimated that between 4 and 19% of the species will find no suitable habitat. Inside the currently established protected areas, species loss could be over 70%. Our results suggest that frugivores are the most sensitive guild, which could bring consequences on seed dispersal functions and on natural regeneration. Moreover, we identified the western and northern parts of the study area as climatically stable. Climate change will potentially affect avian assemblages in southeastern Amazonia with detrimental consequences to their ecosystem functions. Information provided here is essential to conservation practitioners and decision makers to help on planning their actions.

AB Tropical rainforests play important roles in carbon sequestration and are hot spots for biodiversity. Tropical forests are being replaced by rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations, causing widespread concern of a crash in biodiversity. Such changes in aboveground vegetation might have stronger impacts on belowground biodiversity. We studied tropical rainforest fragments and derived rubber plantations at a network of sites in Xishuangbanna, China, hypothesizing a major decrease in diversity with conversion to plantations. We used metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene and recovered 2313 OTUs, with a total of 449 OTUs shared between the two land-use types. The most abundant phyla detected were Annelida (66.4% reads) followed by arthropods (15.5% reads) and nematodes (8.9% reads). Of these, only annelids were significantly more abundant in rubber plantation. Taken together, alpha- and beta-diversity were significantly higher in forest than rubber plantation. Soil pH and spatial distance explained a significant portion of the variability in phylogenetic community structure for both land-use types. Community assembly was primarily influenced by stochastic processes. Overall it appears that forest replacement by rubber plantation results in an overall loss and extensive replacement of soil micro- and mesofaunal biodiversity, which should be regarded as an additional aspect of the impact of forest conversion.

AB Seriphidium transiliense, or subshrub sagebrush, is one of the most important forage resources for livestock in many arid lands, but such resources have been threatened by overgrazing for a long time. A 2013 vegetation survey of an original sagebrush rangeland (2400 ha) in the Tianshan Mountains revealed that nearly half of the area once under sagebrush has been replaced by annual species. This is due to the continual and rapid increase in livestock numbers over the past 30 years. Three smaller sites with different grazing scenarios: no grazing (Site N), a decline (Site 1), and an increase (Site 2) in livestock numbers, were selected to monitor recent changes (from 2004 to 2013) in vegetation biomass and the degree of dominance by sagebrush. Supplanting happened at Site 2 but little occurred at Site 1. There were significant differences between Site 2 and Site 1 in standing biomass in Spring and Summer, but no significant differences in Summer between Site 1 and Site N. The supplanting of sagebrush marks the completion of a dynamic process - in which rainfall plays a crucial role - of damage to sagebrush from heavy grazing in drought years and its rehabilitation by light grazing in some good years. Plant biomass loss was greatest when the land was first subjected to heavy grazing. Sagebrush tends to exist as a sole-dominant species rather than a companion species in sagebrush communities. This suggests that sagebrush continued to survive in pockets where grazing pressure had declined.

AB BackgroundClimate-induced challenge remains a growing concern in the dry tropics, threatening carbon sink potential of tropical dry forests. Hence, understanding their responses to the changing climate is of high priority to facilitate sustainable management of the remnant dry forests. In this study, we examined the long-term climate-growth relations of main tree species in the remnant dry Afromontane forests in northern Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess the dendrochronological potential of selected dry Afromontane tree species and to study the influence of climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) on radial growth. It was hypothesized that there are potential tree species with discernible annual growth rings owing to the uni-modality of rainfall in the region. Ring width measurements were based on increment core samples and stem discs collected from a total of 106 trees belonging to three tree species (Juniperus procera, Olea europaea subsp. cuspidate and Podocarpus falcatus). The collected samples were prepared, crossdated, and analyzed using standard dendrochronological methods. The formation of annual growth rings of the study species was verified based on successful crossdatability and by correlating tree-ring widths with rainfall.ResultsThe results showed that all the sampled tree species form distinct growth boundaries though differences in the distinctiveness were observed among the species. Positive and significant correlations were found between the tree-ring widths and rainfall, implying that rainfall plays a vital role in determining tree growth in the region. The study confirmed the formation of annual growth rings through successful crossdating, thus highlighted the potential applicability of dendroclimatic studies in the region.ConclusionsOverall, the results proved the strong linkage between tree-ring chronologies and climate variability in the study region, which further strengthens the potential of dendrochronological studies developing in Ethiopia, and also has great implications for further paleo-climatic reconstructions and in the restoration of degraded lands. Further knowledge on the growth characteristics of tree species from the region is required to improve the network of tree-ring data and quality of the chronology so as to successfully reconstruct historic environmental changes.

AB Invasive plant species (IPS) are the second biggest threat to biodiversity after habitat loss. Since the spatial extent of IPS is essential for managing the invaded ecosystem, the current study aims at identifying and mapping the aggressive IPS of Acacia salicina and Acacia saligna, to understand better the key factors influencing their distribution in the coastal plain of Israel. This goal was achieved by integrating airborne-derived hyperspectral imaging and multispectral earth observation for creating species distribution maps. Hyperspectral data, in conjunction with high spatial resolution species distribution maps, were used to train the multispectral images at the species level. We incorporated a series of statistical models to classify the IPS location and to recognize their distribution and density. We took advantage of the phenological flowering stages of Acacia trees, as obtained by the multispectral images, for the support vector machine classification procedure. The classification yielded an overall Kappa coefficient accuracy of 0.89. We studied the effect of various environmental and human factors on IPS density by using a random forest machine learning model, to understand the mechanisms underlying successful invasions, and to assess where IPS have a higher likelihood of occurring. This algorithm revealed that the high density of Acacia most closely related to elevation, temperature pattern, and distances from rivers, settlements, and roads. Our results demonstrate how the integration of remote-sensing data with different data sources can assist in determining IPS proliferation and provide detailed geographic information for conservation and management efforts to prevent their future spread.

AB Payments for ecosystem services are becoming popular components in strategies to conserve ecosystems and biodiversity, but their effectiveness remains poorly documented. Here we present counterfactual-based evidence on the conservation outcomes of the pilot stage of Peru's National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP). The NFCP provides direct payments to indigenous communities in the Amazon, conditional on avoided deforestation and the adoption of sustainable production systems. Using a spatially explicit quasi-experimental evaluation design, we show that the payment scheme has achieved only small conservation impacts, in terms of avoided deforestation. Counter-intuitively, these materialized largely on land not enrolled for conservation, due to spillover effects. Conservation effects on contracted land were negligible because communities were not chosen according to high deforestation threats, and they self-enrolled low-pressure forest areas for conservation. Occasional non-sanctioned contract incompliance contributed to these outcomes. We highlight implications for the design and implementation of up-scaled national conservation programs. Methodologically, we demonstrate the important role of choosing the appropriate spatial scale in evaluating area-based conservation measures.

AB The physiognomy variation of Brazilian Cerrado is intense and phytosociological studies can provide subsidies on which factors are responsible for this environmental heterogeneity. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the structure of the woody vegetation of three sites of Cerrado sensu stricto, in the municipality of Jatai, state of Goias, Brazil, aiming to discuss the findings with the history of disturbance of each site and physical aspects of the soils. Ten 20 x 50 m contiguous plots of were allocated in each area, totaling three hectares of survey in total. We included in the sample all trunks with diameter >= 5 cm, measured at 30 cm of the ground. The sites showed differences in wood structure, ranging from more open to more dense areas (density ranging 991-1859 ind.ha(-1) and basal area ranging from 10.85 to 17.68 m(2).ha(-1)). The richness in the areas ranged from 70 to 82 as well as the species composition. Although, there is a mix of savanna and forest floristic elements, we detected higher domain of typical savanna species for the three areas. The floristic and structural patterns indicated heterogeneity in the communities, even geographically close, possibly due to soil texture differences. This reinforces the importance of the preservation of savanna formations in the southwest of Goias state to understand the structural and floristic variations and, consequently, to provide information for other studies on the ecological aspects related to them.

AB Unconditional conservation payments are increasingly used by non-governmental conservation organizations to further their environmental objectives. One key objective in many conservation projects that use such unconditional payments schemes is the protection of tropical forest ecosystems in buffer zone areas around protected parks where the scope of instating mandatory restrictions is more limited. We use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of unconditional livelihood payments to local communities on land use outside a protected area-the Gola Rainforest National Park-which is a biodiversity hotspot on the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. High resolution RapidEye satellite imagery from before and after the intervention was used to determine land use changes in treated and control villages. We find support for the hypothesis that unconditional payments, in this setting, increase land clearance in the short run. The study constitutes one of the first attempts to use evidence from a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of conservation payments and provides insights for further research.

ID SEED-DISPERSAL; EXTINCTION; CENTRALITY; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS
AB The relationships between frugivorous animals and plants are of vital importance particularly in tropical forests. The way species interact and how they are organized within interaction networks could be determined by their ecological and morphological characteristics. This study evaluates the hypothesis that the topological position of species within an interaction network is determined by their degree of frugivory, body size, and abundance. Thus, we constructed the frugivory network between birds and plants in a rainforest fragment in northwestern Colombia. The position of the species within the network was calculated based on three centrality measures (degree, betweenness, and closeness), and its association with relative abundance, degree of frugivory, and body size of each bird species was evaluated by means of a generalized linear model. We found that the species that were most abundant and had the smallest body size had central positions in the interaction network. This pattern is contrary to what has been observed in pristine forests, where species with large body size are more important for network stability. Our results suggest that forest fragmentation modifies the roles of species within the network structure, in part, due to changes in the makeup of the original frugivore community. The information presented may be useful to evaluate the effects of the loss of species as a result of anthropic actions, with the aim of generating ecosystem restoration strategies.

AB Although diversity-dependent plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) may contribute significantly to plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning, the influences of underlying abiotic and biotic mechanistic pathways have been little explored to date. Here, we assessed such pathways with a PSF experiment using soil conditioned for >= 12 yr from two grassland biodiversity experiments. Model plant communities differing in plant species and functional group richness (current plant diversity treatment) were grown in soils conditioned by plant communities with either low- or high-diversity (soil history treatment). Our results indicate that plant diversity can modify plant productivity through both diversity-mediated plant-plant and plant-soil interactions, with the main driver (current plant diversity or soil history) differing with experimental context. Structural equation modeling suggests that the underlying mechanisms of PSFs were explained to a significant extent by both abiotic and biotic pathways (specifically, soil nitrogen availability and soil nematode richness). Thus, effects of plant diversity loss on plant productivity may persist or even increase over time because of biotic and abiotic soil legacy effects.

AB We aimed to determine the important functional dimensions that may drive forest succession and community assembly patterns in dry tropical forests. We investigated whether there were patterns in specific functional strategies during succession in the dry tropical forests of the Florida Keys, whose unique physical setting includes nutrient-stressed, salt-stressed, and water-limited environments. The study, which focused on ten traits, determined the leading trait dimensions by which species differentiate from one another in the study area. The general patterns of trait covariation at individual sites and among species were analyzed using principal component analysis. Trait niche overlap indices were calculated for all species sampled across all plots. Evidence for/against likely community assembly processes was tested using the coefficient of heterogeneity to determine whether variation within and among five key traits was clustered, random, or evenly distributed across young, old, or all measured forest stands. A combination of plant architecture, wood density, and three leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf phosphorus, and leaf nitrogen) comprised a key set of functional traits that are important for understanding the community assembly process in dry tropical forest. Older forest stands were dominated by species with low specific area, low leaf nitrogen content, dense wood, and deeper and narrower canopies. Trees of old forests had leaves with lighter carbon isotope composition, suggesting that such individuals were making more efficient use of scarce water. Tests of trait distributions showed significant clustering across forests of all ages. When individual trait distributions in old stands were tested, they displayed either randomly or evenly distributed traits across trait niche space, indicating that resource partitioning was predominant in shaping community composition. Physical traits of trees in young communities are associated with resource acquisitive strategies, while old communities are dominated by species with traits that enhance survival in environments defined by competition or chronic resource scarcity.

AB Understanding the underlying mechanisms of diversity maintenance in tropics remains a challenge for ecologists. To reveal the underlying mechanism from a plant-eye-view perspective, we examined the patterns of local species richness which was defined as the number of species around individuals of a target species within circles of different radii and their correlations with major plant functional traits in a tropical montane rainforest. In 2012, we established a 60-ha forest dynamics plot (FDP) in tropical montane rainforest on Hainan Island, China. In 2013, we measured eight functional traits (specific leaf area [SLA], leaf dry matter content [LDMC], wood density, potential maximum height, leaf carbon content [LCC], leaf nitrogen content [LNC], leaf phosphorus content [LPC], and leaf potassium content) of all the species in the FDP. Based on all the mapped individuals that had a diameter at breast height >= 10 cm, we utilized individual species-area relationships function (ISAR(s)(r)) combined with the heterogeneous Poisson null model to quantify the patterns of local species richness at scales from 1 to 50 m. Regression analysis was used to determine which functional traits could influence the local diversity pattern. Results showed that the 123 ISAR(s)(r) curves were relatively similar and no species seemed to be extremely higher or lower than the average of all the ISAR(s)(r) curves. The percentage of species that behaved predominantly as accumulators or repellers or neutrally was 42.23%, 13.82%, and 43.9% at scale of <30 m, respectively. But at scales >= 30 m, more than 70% of all species behaved neutrally suggesting that facilitative interactions probably occurred when neighborhoods were <30 m apart. Among the eight measured traits, the SLA, LNC, and LPC were negatively associated with local species richness. Our results indicated that (1) the spatial community structure was not controlled by key species; (2) facilitative interactions played an important role in local diversity maintenance; (3) species with conservative functional trait syndromes were more likely to have relatively high local species richness in the tropical montane rainforest on Hainan Island, China.

AB Ecosystem service (ES) assessments have flourished globally in recent years and are now frequently used by policymakers and environmental managers. However, data scarce regions continue to be less well studied, limiting the comprehensiveness of the approach and its potential benefits. Here we aim to assess multiple ES and their spatial relationships in a region with high tropical forest cover, the state of Amapa, in the Brazilian Amazon. We develop a simple method to measure nine ES, identify spatial associations between them, and explore the impact of land use change on the capacity of forests to provide those services. The ES analysed include biodiversity, regional climate regulation, indigenous heritage, agricultural production, and NTFP extraction. Both negative (n= 20) and positive (n= 12) spatial associations are found, with agricultural land and forests having the highest total ES provision. We also show that this varies nonlinearly with distance to forest edges. In the face of currently unavoidable data scarcities in high biodiversity tropical areas, we show that this approach can provide useful evidence for land use management decisions.

AB Microbial dynamics drive the biotic machinery of early soil evolution. However, integrated knowledge of microbial community establishment, functional associations, and community assembly processes in incipient soil is lacking. This study presents a novel approach of combining microbial phylogenetic profiling, functional predictions, and community assembly processes to analyze drivers of microbial community establishment in an emerging soil system. Rigorous submeter sampling of a basalt-soil lysimeter after 2 years of irrigation revealed that microbial community colonization patterns and associated soil parameters were depth dependent. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated the presence of diverse bacterial and archaeal phyla, with high relative abundance of Actinomyceles on the surface and a consistently high abundance of Proteobacteria (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) at all depths. Despite depth-dependent variation in community diversity, predicted functional gene analysis suggested that microbial metabolisms did not differ with depth, thereby suggesting redundancy in functional potential throughout the system. Null modeling revealed that microbial community assembly patterns were predominantly governed by variable selection. The relative influence of variable selection decreased with depth, indicating unique and relatively harsh environmental conditions near the surface and more benign conditions with depth. Additionally, community composition near the center of the domain was influenced by high levels of dispersal, suggesting that spatial processes interact with deterministic selection imposed by the environment. These results suggest that for oligotrophic systems, there are major differences in the length scales of variation between vertical and horizontal dimensions with the vertical dimension dominating variation in physical, chemical, and biological features.

AB Increasing evidence is available for a positive effect of biodiversity on ecosystem productivity and standing biomass, also in highly diverse systems as tropical forests. Biodiversity conservation could therefore be a critical aspect of climate mitigation policies. There is, however, limited understanding of the role of individual species for this relationship, which could aid in focusing conservation efforts and forest management planning. This study characterizes the functional specialization and redundancy for 95% of all tree species (basal area weighted percentage) in a diverse tropical forest in the central Congo Basin and relates this to species' abundance, contribution to aboveground carbon, and maximum size. Functional characterization is based on a set of traits related to resource acquisition (wood density, specific leaf area, leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content, and leaf stable carbon isotope composition). We show that within both mixed and monodominant tropical forest ecosystems, the highest functional specialization and lowest functional redundancy are solely found in rare tree species and significantly more in rare species holding large-sized individuals. Rare species cover the entire range of low and high functional redundancy, contributing both unique and redundant functions. Loss of species supporting functional redundancy could be buffered by other species in the community, including more abundant species. This is not the case for species supporting high functional specialization and low functional redundancy, which would need specific conservation attention. In terms of tropical forest management planning, we argue that specific conservation of large-sized trees is imperative for long-term maintenance of ecosystem functioning.

AB Anthropogenic forest disturbance poses a significant threat to the persistence of wildlife. Generally, disturbance of forest environments alters vegetation structure, affecting specialised niche-dependent avian species. We investigated the influence of a comprehensive suite of vegetation structures on the taxonomic and functional diversity of avian forest species in five protected forest areas in the urban mosaic of eThekwini Municipality, Durban, South Africa during the austral breeding season of 2016. We conducted 135 fixed-radius point-count surveys between the vegetation classes of Indigenous Forest (IF) and Coastal Thicket/Dense Bush (TDB; a secondary wooded-habitat that represents regenerating Indigenous Forest), and recorded microhabitat structure covariates at each survey site. We conducted RLQ analyses to examine the association between avian functional traits and microhabitat structures present at each survey site. There was no significant difference in vegetation structure nor species richness between IF and TDB. Species with specialised ecological niches (e.g. large-bodied frugivores; small-bodied insectivores, cavity-nesters) were present in both IF and TDB, indicating that TDB in Durban represents an advanced stage of forest regeneration. We highlight the importance of both IF and TDB for providing critical habitat for both avian generalised and specialised functional traits in the forest patches in the urban mosaic. Crucially, we show that forested areas under conservation management in urbanised areas successfully provide species with a wide variety of functional traits critical to ecosystem functioning and human health.

AB Premise of the StudyA key question in evolutionary biology is why some clades are more successful by being widespread geographically, biome diverse, or species-rich. To extend understanding of how shifts in area, biomes, and pollinators impact diversification in plants, we examined the relationships of these shifts to diversification across the mega-genus Salvia.
   MethodsA chronogram was developed from a supermatrix of anchored hybrid enrichment genomic data and targeted sequence data for over 500 of the nearly 1000 Salvia species. Ancestral areas and biomes were reconstructed using BioGeoBEARS. Pollinator guilds were scored, ancestral pollinators determined, shifts in pollinator guilds identified, and rates of pollinator switches compared.
   Key ResultsA well-resolved phylogenetic backbone of Salvia and updated subgeneric designations are presented. Salvia originated in Southwest Asia in the Oligocene and subsequently dispersed worldwide. Biome shifts are frequent from a likely ancestral lineage utilizing broadleaf and/or coniferous forests and/or arid shrublands. None of the four species diversification shifts are correlated to shifts in biomes. Shifts in pollination system are not correlated to species diversification shifts, except for one hummingbird shift that precedes a major shift in diversification near the crown of New World subgen. Calosphace. Multiple reversals back to bee pollination occurred within this hummingbird clade.
   ConclusionsSalvia diversified extensively in different continents, biomes, and with both bee and bird pollinators. The lack of tight correlation of area, biome, and most pollinator shifts to the four documented species diversification shifts points to other important drivers of speciation in Salvia.

AB Understanding coexistence in species-rich communities remains a primary challenge of ecology. Interactions mediated through multitrophic networks are thought to play an important role in sustaining species coexistence in the face of competition for resources. The identity of trophic partners and the intensity with which they interact are often mediated by diverse secondary metabolites. Recent innovations in organic-molecule bioinformatics and multivariate statistical analysis are rapidly advancing our understanding of metabolites and the multitrophic interactions they mediate. Here, I examine recent advances in the study of chemical ecology in species-rich multitrophic communities, with an emphasis on plant-herbivore networks, and explore the potential for chemically mediated interactions to shape community composition and sustain species diversity in ecological communities.

AB The Australian desert ecosystem coevolved with humans over the course of fifty millennia, yet our understanding of the place of humans within the ecosystem is only now beginning to deepen; recent research suggests that the removal of Aboriginal people from homelands precipitated rapid ecosystem remodeling. We suggest that network-based approaches are instrumental in broadening our understanding of humans in ecosystems, so apply these approaches to examine nomadic-era ecosystems (when Aboriginal people lived exclusive foraging-based lifeways) and contemporary-era ecosystems (when Aboriginal people live a mixed-based economy lifestyle). Using the approach of food web modeling we explicitly place Martu Aboriginal foragers within the overall ecosystem of the Western Desert. By linking humans to the other biota in the desert, examining each species as nodes in a network and each consumption link as edges in the network, we can better understand the ways the network connectedness shifts between nomadic-era and contemporary-era food webs. Using network randomization simulations we show that the contemporary food webs deviate significantly from the nomadic era food webs, suggesting a key role of humans as knitters of the ecosystem. This work has implications for research on resilient ecosystems, both within Australia and beyond, and suggests that humans have significant roles to play in sustainability and resilience.

AB Conservation efforts in terrestrial environments have focused on preserving patches of natural habitats and restoring disturbed habitats, with the main goal of transforming them into forests or habitats that resemble the original conditions. This approach tends to overlook the importance of conserving early successional vegetation (e.g., riverside vegetation, natural regeneration, young secondary forests), which often includes a large number of species (e.g., plants and animals) associated with or restricted to these habitats. In this paper we want to bring to attention the importance of preserving early successional vegetation, and to encourage scientists to investigate, e.g., the diversity, distribution, and species interactions occurring in these habitats. To address these goals, we focus on two main objectives: (1) to identify the common types of early successional vegetation in the Costa Rican Central Valley; and (2) to use some case studies to draw attention to the importance that such areas have as reservoirs of a large portion of the diversity unique to early successional stages. We first include an example to show the diversity of plants in small forest patches immersed in a large urbanized area. We provide general information on the insects that occur in early successional vegetation in urban areas, and in further detail examples of butterflies. Additionally, we provide examples of birds and mammals that are restricted to early successional vegetation, and how the reduction of this vegetation type affects species conservation. Finally, we encourage scientists to investigate these early successional habitats, particularly those species exclusive to early successional stages. Special attention should be paid to endemic species and those with a restricted distribution. Information of this type will make conservation of the diversity contained in these habitats possible.

AB Shade tolerance (the capacity to survive and grow over long periods under shade) is a key component of plant fitness and the foundation of current theories of forest succession in tropical rain forests. It serves as a paradigm to understand the optimal allocation of limited resources under dynamic light regimes. I analyze how tropical rain forest succession influences the expression of ecophysiological mechanisms leading to shade tolerance, and identify future areas that will increase our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon. Shade tolerance is a multivariate, continuous functional trait reflecting the growth-mortality trade-off of investing resources under limited light vs. exploiting high light conditions. I propose the life cycle successional trajectory model of Gomez-Pompa & Vazquez-Yanes as an integrative tool to understand tropical rain forest succession. This model shows how species distribute along the successional environmental gradient based on their degree of shade tolerance and represents a more integrative paradigm to understand the interface between different aspects of species diversity (ontogenetic variation and functional diversity) throughout succession. It proposes that different trait combinations determining shade tolerance are expressed at different stages of the life cycle, which affects how and when plants enter the successional trajectory. Models explaining the expression of shade tolerance (resource availability, carbon gain, CSR, resource competition) are based on whole-plant economics and are not mutually exclusive. The analysis of shade tolerance is biased towards tree seedlings in the understory of mature forests. Other life stages (juvenile and adult trees), life forms, and microhabitats throughout the forest profile are almost always excluded from these analyses. More integrative explanations based on the distribution of functional traits among species, ontogenetic stages, and the nature of the environmental gradient are being developed based on long-term data and chronosequence comparisons. In summary, shade-tolerance is a complex phenomenon, is determined by multiple characters that change ontogenetically over space and time and entails considerable plasticity. Current methods do not account for this plasticity. Understanding the nature of shade tolerance and its functional basis is critical to comprehending plant performance and improving the management, restoration and conservation of tropical rain forests given the combined threats of global warming and habitat loss.

AB El Nino and La Nina climatic oscillations have dramatic effects on population dynamics and community structure of different animals. For marine birds, El Nino phenomenon drastically increases their mortality and reduces their reproductive success. In terrestrial ecosystems, the lack of long-term longitudinal data limits our understanding of the impact of El Nino and La Nina on bird populations and communities. We analyzed changes in abundance of frugivorous (large, medium, and small) and nectarivorous birds on three tropical forest types (lowland, premontane and montane) during El Nino, La Nina and neutral years using data from 16 Christmas' Bird Counts in Costa Rica. Abundance of large and medium size frugivores increased during La Nina events, and the abundance of nectarivores during El Nino in the lowland forest, but neither of these events affected the abundance of small frugivores. In the montane forest, abundance of all four bird groups increased during El Nino, but decreased during La Nina events. Abundance of large, and small frugivores increased in the premontane forest during La Nina events, but other bird groups were not affected by La Nina. The abundance of small frugivores also increased during El Nino. We hypothesize that changes in abundance of frugivores and nectarivores during La Nina and El Nino events is probably correlated with fluctuations in food resources as it has been reported for other terrestrial tropical ecosystems.

AB The overuse of N fertilizer by rice growers triggers excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, leading to the environmental and climatic problem. However, growers will probably suffer loss in profits if they reduce the use of N fertilizer under the existing technology condition. The payment in market-based or government-driven way may overcome the potential barrier. For the appropriate carbon trading market is absent, the government-driven program will play a role in the payment. Three key issues in the designed program are the price of the payment, the participation rate of rice growers, and the variation of items associated with the social welfare. Due to the difficulty in estimating the economic value, prices of the payment can be set according to shadow prices. This paper applies the parametric directional output distance function to derive shadow prices of CO2 for 308 rice growers in Shanghai from 2008-2015. Average shadow prices range from RMB 1130 to 3769 yuan/ton (or US 163 to 618 $/ton). Taking the year of 2015 as sample, this paper predicts the participation rate (97.08%) of rice growers with the aim of 10% N fertilizer reduction and the specific price of the payment (7.47 yuan/kg). Moreover, this paper discusses on the variation of factors linked with the social welfare, and derive two important relationships from it. In detail, the relationship between the yield of the rice and the reduction of the N fertilizer should be balanced; the relationship between the improvement on the profit of rice growers (or the participation rate) in the program and the payment by the government should also be balanced.

AB Few studies in the Amazon region have evaluated anuran diversity in urban forest fragments or in areas with differing degrees of anthropogenic impact. We determined the composition and abundance of the anurofauna in urban and rural sites within the municipality of Itacoatiara in central Amazonia, Brazil. Specimens were sampled from January 2012 to May 2013 in 10 urban sites and five rural sites. A total of 1,538 anurans (930 in rural sites and 608 in urban sites) were recorded, belonging to 29 species in five families. Species richness was higher in rural sites, with 10 exclusive species. All species found in urban sites were also found in rural sites, however, species abundance varied considerably between the habitats. Sampling-and individual-based rarefaction curves showed a tendency toward stabilization of species richness only in the urban sites. We concluded that the anuran assemblages in the urban sites are depauperate due to the absence of many species associated to pristine terra firme or varzea and igapo forests. Habitat loss and quality degradation in urban landscapes are the main factors threatening amphibian diversity. The anuran assemblages in our study areas were similar to those recorded in other Amazonian habitats. Conservation measures involving anurans in this region should consider the preservation of habitat mosaics, including both pristine terra firme, varzea and igapo forests.

AB Land-use intensification is a major driver of local species extinction and homogenization. Temperate grasslands, managed at low intensities over centuries harbored a high species diversity, which is increasingly threatened by the management intensification over the last decades. This includes key taxa like ants. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to a decrease in ant abundance and species richness as well as changes in functional community composition are not well understood. We sampled ants on 110 grassland plots in three regions in Germany. The sampled grasslands are used as meadows or pastures, being mown, grazed or fertilized at different intensities. We analyzed the effect of the different aspects of land use on ant species richness, functional trait spaces, and community composition by using a multimodel inference approach and structural equation models. Overall, we found 31 ant species belonging to 8 genera, mostly open habitat specialists. Ant species richness, functional trait space of communities, and abundance of nests decreased with increasing land-use intensity. The land-use practice most harmful to ants was mowing, followed by heavy grazing by cattle. Fertilization did not strongly affect ant species richness. Grazing by sheep increased the ant species richness. The effect of mowing differed between species and was strongly negative for Formica species while Myrmica and common Lasius species were less affected. Rare species occurred mainly in plots managed at low intensity. Our results show that mowing less often or later in the season would retain a higher ant species richness-similarly to most other grassland taxa. The transformation from (sheep) pastures to intensively managed meadows and especially mowing directly affects ants via the destruction of nests and indirectly via loss of grassland heterogeneity (reduced plant species richness) and increased soil moisture by shading of fast-growing plant species.

AB The aboveground primary production is a major source of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pool and plays an important role in regulating the response of ecosystem and nutrient cycling to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. To explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of spring fire and topography on the aboveground biomass (AGB) and the soil C and N pool, we conducted a field experiment between April 2014 and August 2016 in a semi-arid grassland of northern China to examine the effects of slope and spring fire, and their potential interactions on the AGB and organic C and total N contents in different plant functional groups (C-3 grasses, C-4 grasses, forbs, Artemisia frigida plants, total grasses and total plants). The dynamics of AGB and the contents of organic C and N in the plants were examined in the burned and unburned plots on different slope positions (upper and lower). There were differences in the total AGB of all plants between the two slope positions. The AGB of grasses was higher on the lower slope than on the upper slope in July. On the lower slope, spring fire marginally or significantly increased the AGB of C-3 grasses, forbs, total grasses and total plants in June and August, but decreased the AGB of C-4 grasses and A. frigida plants from June to August. On the upper slope, however, spring fire significantly increased the AGB of forbs in June, the AGB of C-3 grasses and total grasses in July, and the AGB of forbs and C-4 grasses in August. Spring fire exhibited no significant effect on the total AGB of all plants on the lower and upper slopes in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, the total AGB in the burned plots showed a decreasing trend after fire burning compared with the unburned plots. The different plant functional groups had different responses to slope positions in terms of organic C and N contents in the plants. The lower and upper slopes differed with respect to the organic C and N contents of C-3 grasses, C-4 grasses, total grasses, forbs, A. frigida plants and total plants in different growing months. Slope position and spring fire significantly interacted to affect the AGB and organic C and N contents of C-4 grasses and A. frigida plants. We observed the AGB and organic C and N contents in the plants in a temporal synchronized pattern. Spring fire affected the functional AGB on different slope positions, likely by altering the organic C and N contents and, therefore, it is an important process for C and N cycling in the semi-arid natural grasslands. The findings of this study would facilitate the simulation of ecosystem C and N cycling in the semi-arid grasslands in northern China.

AB In the evolution of cognition and behavior, a recurrent question concerns the degree to which any given aspect of the phenotype has been "selected for" or "specified," as opposed to arising as a byproduct of some other process. In some sense this is the key question for evolutionary theories of development that seek to connect ultimate evolutionary accounts to proximate developmental accounts of ontogeny. A popular solution to the specification problem is to invoke "emergence," in which phenotypes are co-constructed by many causes and cannot be reduced to any one of them. However, the concept of emergence, while appealing, can obscure sources of ultimate causation by leaving them unspecified. Here I explore the idea of selected emergence, in which phenotypic outcomes do emerge from a confluence of factors, some haphazard, but which include in part a history of selection, genetic and / or cultural, to produce phenotypic outcomes of that type. I discuss potential case studies of selected emergence, explore its empirical implications and provide suggestions for future research on the evolution of emergent outcomes.

AB The Brazilian Soy Moratorium has effectively reduced forest conversion for soybeans in Amazonia. This has come at the expense of the region's pasturelands, which have increasingly ceded space for compliant soy expansion. The question of extending the policy to the Cerrado, where recent soy expansion has come at the cost of ecologically valuable vegetation, plugs into a wider discussion on how to reconcile competing commodities on finite amounts of cleared area. Innovative management strategies that allow different land uses to coexist are urgently needed. Integrated crop-livestock systems with soybeans (ICLS) rotates beef and soy on the same area, and shows promise as a means to improve production, farmer benefit, and environmental impacts. Here we reconstruct historical land use maps to estimate Cerrado Soy Moratorium outcomes with benchmark years in 2008 and 2014, we then estimate additional production afforded by ICLS implementation between 2008 and 2014. We find that if a 2008 Cerrado Soy Moratorium were in place, 0.7 Mha of 2014 Cerrado soy area would currently be in violation of the policy. Roughly 96% of this acreage is found in Matopiba (82%) and Mato Grosso (14%) states, suggesting that adoption may have slowed recent production in these rapidly transforming soy centers, in contrast to central and southwestern Cerrado where there is more concentrated eligible expansion area. Changing the benchmark to 2014 could have added 0.7 Mha of eligible expansion area, though over 80% of these additions would be in states with the most 2008 eligible area (Distrito Federal, Mato Grosso, Maranhao, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul). Meanwhile, ICLS adoption could have added between 4.0 and 32 Mha of new soy land to the study area without additional clearing between 2008 and 2014, though this would depend on rigorous accompanying land zoning policy to guide implementation. The roughly 5 Mha of Cerrado soybean expansion that actually occurred between 2008 and 2014 could have been accommodated on 2008 suitable pasture area given an ICLS rotation frequency of every 6 years or less. Conservation estimates presented here represent the upper limit of what is possible, as our scenario modeling does not account for variables such as leakage, laundering, or rebound effects.

AB Determining thresholds of species loss in response to gradients of human impact is becoming an increasingly important component of stream conservation and management. We analyzed the thresholds of change in populations and communities of the infraorder Nepomorpha along a gradient of environmental integrity in streams of the Brazilian savannah, based on samples from 20 sites. We used the Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) to identify the location and magnitude of changes associated with the environmental quality and the frequency and abundance of the different taxa. We also used TITAN to calculate the positive and negative thresholds of the community and species along the habitat integrity gradient. Nepomorphan species were generally associated with sites of higher environmental quality, which presented larger populations and greater species richness. Only a few nepomorphan species groups were associated with impacted streams. Thresholds were evident in some aquatic nepomorphan populations, but not for the community as a whole. This indicates that species have idiosyncratic responses to the environmental gradient, but in general nepomorphans appear to be a good indicator of healthy environments or less impacted streams in the Brazilian savannah.

AB AimsOur aim was to investigate the water sources used by woody species under contrasting water availability and the extent of water-sources-use differentiation among dominant woody species in a tropical coastal dune forest.MethodsWe sampled 15 woody species in a Brazilian restinga forest and, through Bayesian isotope mixing models, we estimated the proportion of water sources used. We tested whether water-sources-use was (i) different between contrasting water availability conditions; (ii) dependent on growth form, plant size or crown illumination; and (iii) influenced by stand density, evenness or biomass.ResultsWe found a seasonal variation in water-sources-use, but no vertical soil-water partitioning among woody species. In wetter periods, plants used mainly water from top-soil, as a shallow water table limited water uptake to top-soil layers recharged with rainwater. Contrastingly, during drier periods, with the absence of rain and a deeper water table, plants generally relied on deeper (50 cm) soil layers. Only under less-wet conditions, a greater evenness and density implied higher water-uptake depth heterogeneity among plants. However, changes in the main water-sources used by plants were neither evoked in more dense or diverse plots, nor induced by plant size.ConclusionsOur study shows that restinga species have dynamic shifts in water-uptake depth caused by seasonal water availability changes, influenced by the combined effect of insufficient moisture at shallow soil layers and water-table lowering in drier periods. These temporal shifts are common among species, implying that restinga woody community has a homogeneous strategy of water-resources acquisition. This study enhances our understanding of the effects that water variations can have on water-resource use in restinga forests.

AB AimsThe aim of this study was to identify how land-use intensity shapes the kinetic properties of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes (EHEs) in rhizosphere soil among and within plant species representing different i) resource acquisition strategies (exploitative (ex) vs. conservative (co) plant species) and ii) response types to land-use intensification (winner (Wi) vs. loser (Lo), i.e. species that increase in abundance due to land-use intensification vs. species that decrease in abundance).MethodsThe potential enzyme activities (V-max) and the apparent substrate affinities (K-m) of -cellobiohydrolase (CBH), -glucosidase (BG), xylanase (XYL), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), and phosphomonoesterase (PH) were determined in rhizosphere samples of Agrimonia eupatoria (co, Lo), Dactylis glomerata (ex, Wi), Lotus corniculatus (co, Lo), Taraxacum sect. Ruderalia (ex, Wi) and Trifolium repens (ex, Wi). Samples (n=37) were taken on six permanent grasslands along a gradient in land-use intensity in central Germany.ResultsPlant species identity and performance of species to land-use intensity are less important for explaining enzyme kinetics than are land-use intensity and associated changes in soil properties (especially organic carbon, pH and C:N ratio) and composition of the surrounding plant community, i.e. the abundance of herbs and plant diversity. However, the rhizosphere of winner species of intensive land-use was characterized by higher K-m of CBH and two out of the three winners were associated with lower K-m of PH. Higher V-max of XYL in the rhizosphere of winner species suggest higher production of hemicellulose-degrading enzymes in rhizospheres of higher land-use intensity.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that both land-use intensity and to a lower degree the type of plants' resource acquisition strategy affect EHEs of C-, N-, and P-cycles in the rhizosphere. Rhizospheres of common grassland species are hotspots of hemicellulose, chitin, and organic P degradation but not of cellulose degradation. Further studies should consider variations in the kinetics of EHEs as a function of root orders and soil depths.

AB Extensive areas of tropical land have been deforested and degraded, leading to declines in ecosystem services, biodiversity, and farm productivity over time in these post-frontier environments. Conservation and development organizations are promoting community-based tree planting for forest restoration as a means to conserve biodiversity, sequester carbon, and improve farmland. This multi-site study examines household-level participation in tree planting in a biodiversity hotspot, the Ecuadorian Andes. We ask: who participates in tree planting, why, and how do practices differ on private and communal land? We interviewed 120 households, conducted oral histories and focus groups, and observed communal workdays. We found that ranchers and farmers (land reliant households) with a history of community engagement were most likely to plant trees. Farmers planted more trees, more kinds of trees, and more native trees than wage and salary earners, integrating them into farming systems. In contrast to previous studies, we did not find that wealth or the total area of land holdings explained household level participation in tree planting; instead, land-reliant households with a vested interest in their communities were the most likely to participate. After planting on communal land, many households applied newly acquired arboricultural knowledge and techniques on their own farms, implementing innovative tree-based systems to restore soils and water availability. On-farm planting tended to be production-focused, whereas on communal land people planted with a wide range of native trees to restore diverse cloud forest and hydrological services. However, the ultimate aim of both was to restore ecosystem services essential to farming. Driven by local ecosystem service scarcity, this 'crisis restoration' was an integral part of a local movement to renew and sustain farming culture, and created forests for which people feel a sense of stewardship, ownership and pride. This model of restoration holds considerable potential to benefit rural farmers and restore biodiversity across the many heavily deforested regions of the Andes.

AB Impacts of climate change on the future dynamics of Central African forests are still largely unknown, despite the acuteness of the expected climate changes and the extent of these forests. The high diversity of species and the potentially equivalent diversity of responses to climate modifications are major difficulties encountered when using predictive models to evaluate these impacts. In this study, we applied a mixture of inhomogeneous matrix models to a long-term experimental site located in M'Baiki forests, in the Central African Republic. This model allows the clustering of tree species into processes-based groups while simultaneously selecting explanatory climate and stand variables at the group-level. Using downscaled outputs of 10. general circulation models (GCM), we projected the future forest dynamics up to the end of the century, under constant climate and Representative Concentration Pathways. 4.5 and. 8.5. Through comparative analyses across GCM versions, we identified tree species meta-groups, which are more adapted than ecological guilds to describe the diversity of tree species dynamics and their responses to climate change. Projections under constant climate were consistent with a forest ageing phenomenon, with a slowdown in tree growth and a reduction of the relative abundance of short-lived pioneers. Projections under climate change showed a general increase in growth, mortality and recruitment. This acceleration in forest dynamics led to a strong natural thinning effect, with different magnitudes across species. These differences caused a compositional shift in favour of long-lived pioneers, at the detriment of shade-bearers. Consistent with other field studies and projections, our results show the importance of elucidating the diversity of tree species responses when considering the general sensitivity of Central African forests dynamics to climate change.

AB Given that land-use change is the main cause of global biodiversity decline, there is widespread interest in adopting land-use practices that maintain high levels of biodiversity, and in restoring degraded land that previously had high biodiversity value. In this study, we use ant taxonomic and functional diversity to examine the effects of different land uses (agriculture, pastoralism, silviculture and conservation) and restoration practices on Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) biodiversity. We also examine the extent to which ant diversity and composition can be explained by vegetation attributes that apply across the full land management spectrum. We surveyed vegetation attributes and ant communities in five replicate plots of each of 13 land-use and restoration treatments, including two types of native vegetation as reference sites: cerrado sensu stricto and cerradAo. Several land-use and restoration treatments had comparable plot richness to that of the native reference habitats. Ant species and functional composition varied systematically among land-use treatments following a gradient from open habitats such as agricultural fields to forested sites. Tree basal area and grass cover were the strongest predictors of ant species richness. Losses in ant diversity were higher in land-use systems that transform vegetation structure. Among productive systems, therefore, uncleared pastures and old pine plantations had similar species composition to that occurring in cerrado sensu stricto. Restoration techniques currently applied to sites that were previously Cerrado have focused on returning tree cover, and have failed to restore ant communities typical of savanna. To improve restoration outcomes for Cerrado biodiversity, greater attention needs to be paid to the re-establishment and maintenance of the grass layer, which requires frequent fire. At the broader scale, conservation planning in agricultural landscapes, should recognize the value of land-use mosaics and the risks of homogenization.

AB Volatile terpenoid resins represent a diverse group of plant defense chemicals involved in defense against herbivory, abiotic stress, and communication. However, their composition in tropical forests remains poorly characterized. As a part of tree identification, the 'smell' of damaged trunks is widely used, but is highly subjective. Here, we analyzed trunk volatile monoterpene emissions from 15 species of the genus Protium in the central Amazon. By normalizing the abundances of 28 monoterpenes, 9 monoterpene 'fingerprint' patterns emerged, characterized by a distinct dominant monoterpene. While 4 of the 'fingerprint' patterns were composed of multiple species, 5 were composed of a single species. Moreover, among individuals of the same species, 6 species had a single 'fingerprint' pattern, while 9 species had two or more 'fingerprint' patterns among individuals. A comparison of 'fingerprints' between 2015 and 2017 from 15 individuals generally showed excellent agreement, demonstrating a strong dependence on species identity, but not time of collection. The results are consistent with a previous study that found multiple divergent copies of monoterpene synthase enzymes in Protium. We conclude that the monoterpene 'fingerprint' database has important implications for constraining Protium species identification and phylogenetic relationships and enhancing understanding of physiological and ecological functions of resins and their potential commercial applications.

AB Endangered species laws seek to prevent extinction by outlawing actions that may cause harm or lead to extinction. In doing so, these laws are sometimes criticized for limiting management flexibility and subjecting landowners to regulatory burdens. One proposed solution to this challenge is development of payment for ecosystem service (PES) programs. These programs provide an economic incentive to conserve endangered species by compensating landowners for the costs of conservation or forgoing other profitable uses of land and resources. To assess the utility of PES as a means of overcoming opposition to endangered species regulations, we surveyed ranch operators in Arizona and New Mexico facing new regulations related to endangered jaguars (Panthera onca). Our findings suggest that PES cannot overcome the perceived burdens of species protection regulations and are unlikely to increase collaboration between landowners and government agencies. PES approaches are only likely to succeed where there is strong fit between institutional design and resource manager preferences. In the context of endangered species, PES proponents must pay particular attention to institutional arrangements that reduce concerns about regulatory risk. To this end, to effectively meet endangered species conservation goals, we recommend: 1) framing PES programs as voluntary conservation incentives, 2) focusing incentives on healthy ecosystems rather than a single species, and 3) using private funding to support incentives. Under these circumstances, PES may be an effective endangered species conservation tool.

AB Tropical forest ecosystems harbor high biodiversity, but they have suffered from ongoing human-induced degradation. We investigated the conservation value of moist evergreen Afromontane forest sites across gradients of site-level disturbance, landscape context and forest history in southwestern Ethiopia. We surveyed woody plants at 108 randomly selected sites and grouped them into forest specialist, pioneer, and generalist species. First, we investigated if coffee dominance, current distance from the forest edge, forest history, heat load and altitude structured the variation in species composition using constrained correspondence analysis. Second, we modelled species richness in response to the same explanatory variables. Our findings show that woody plant community composition was significantly structured by altitude, forest history, coffee dominance and current distance from forest edge. Specifically, (1) total species richness and forest specialist species richness were affected by coffee management intensity; (2) forest specialist species richness increased, while pioneer species decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge; and (3) forest specialist species richness was lower in secondary forest compared to in primary forest. These findings show that coffee management intensity, landscape context and forest history in combination influence local and landscape level biodiversity. We suggest conservation strategies that foster the maintenance of large undisturbed forest sites and that prioritize local species in managed and regenerating forests. Creation of a biosphere reserve and shade coffee certification could be useful to benefit both effective conservation and people's livelihoods.

AB Rapid increase of nitrogen (N) deposition could alter nutrient availability, leading to changes in soil microbial processes and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. However, the effects of N deposition on soil microbes remain elusive in the tropical rainforests in Asia. Here, we conducted a 3-year N addition experiment with four treatments (0, 20, 50, and 100kg N ha(-1)year(-1)) in a primary and secondary tropical montane forest in Hainan Island, China, to explore the effects of elevated N availability on soil microbial community composition. We also conducted a phosphorus (P) treatment (50kg P ha(-1)year(-1)) and a N + P treatment (50kg N ha(-1)year(-1)+50kg P ha(-1)year(-1)) to examine potential P limitation driven by N deposition in highly weathered tropical soils, using a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. The composition of soil bacterial communities differed dramatically between the primary and secondary forests, but not significant dissimilarity among the fertilization treatments. The community composition, phylogenetic diversity and phylotype richness were significantly correlated with soil pH, total organic C (TOC), and total N (TN), respectively. There were significant differences between the primary and secondary forest in pH, TOC, and TN, but not among the fertilization treatments. These results suggest that differences in soil nutrient status between the primary and secondary forests due to different successional stages rather than chronic N fertilization may be the major factor affecting soil bacterial composition in the tropical montane rainforests.

AB The increasing global demand for lumber and pulp has led to the conversion of natural habitats into monocultures of fast-growing tree plantations. The environmental filtering model proposes that both environmental characteristics of anthropogenic habitats and biotic interactions act as a filter that can be passed through by some species of the regional pool, driving the formation of local assemblages. Therefore, environmental filtering promotes the selective loss of species and convergence of functional traits, resulting in assemblages of species that are functionally more similar than expected by chance. In Argentina, pine monocultures have expanded in both subtropical forest and grassland biomes. Typically, environmental similarity between plantations and natural habitat decreases in the grassland and increases in the subtropical forest with increasing plantation age (time since pine stands were planted). Then, we predict that changes in biological diversity with plantation age will be opposite when plantations develop in environmentally contrasting biomes. To test the prediction, we studied taxonomic (species richness) and functional (based in morphological functional traits) diversity of epigeal ant assemblages in pine plantations of different ages (from 1 to 12 years old), developing in contrasting biomes that determined different contexts of the main natural (i.e., native) habitat: subtropical forest and grassland. Temperature, humidity and vegetation cover were recorded, and ants were collected using pitfall traps. For plantations and natural habitats of both biomes, we estimated functional diversity in sets of randomized communities and compared them with the observed functional diversity throughout plantation age. As expected, results showed opposite environmental similarity gradients between natural habitats and plantation ages. In the subtropical forest, ant species richness remained similar but functional diversity increased with increasing plantation age, associated with the presence of predatory ants. In the grassland, species richness showed a maximum at intermediate ages, but functional diversity remained similar with increasing plantation age. Null model analyses showed lower functional diversity than expected by chance in young plantations developing in the subtropical forest and at all ages in grassland, indicating convergence of functional traits. Our findings support environmental filtering as the primary mechanism driving the formation of ant assemblages along pine plantation cycle. To our best knowledge, this is the first study analysing patterns of diversity along tree plantation cycles developing in contrasting biomes. Our results show that the biome effect should be taken into consideration to predict diversity responses to commercial forestry and to unify a theory of assemblage formation in monoculture plantations.

AB We sought to elucidate if the perennial lifestyle per se, or lifeform, enhances independence of soil nutrient availability. We measured parameters of CO2 fixation and electron transport, stomatal conductance, P and N nutrition, as well as integrative water relations (delta C-13 abundance) of an overstory tree (Snow Gum; Eucalyptus pauciflora, Sieber ex Spreng.) and a perennial understory shrub (Alpine Shaggy-pea; Podolobium alpestre F. Muell.) at two Australian field sites with different soil nutrient availability, but otherwise similar environmental conditions. Snow Gums are renowned for their longevity, including the ability to re-sprout profusely after fire, while Alpine Shaggy-pea has a relatively short lifespan, and regenerates from seed after fire. Photosynthesis parameters of P. alpestre were more sensitive to soil properties than for E. pauciflora P and N status of leaves and roots of E. paucifiora were comparable at both sites, whereas P and N status of P. alpestre reflected their availability in the soil. Differences in delta C-13 abundance of the two species studied indicated the use of different water sources at both field sites. These results suggest that long-lived plants with the capability to recycle nutrients from woody tissues, can grow largely independent of soil P and N availability.

AB Nectandra is one of the most representative genera of Lauraceae in the subtropical Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The objective of this work was to study the dendrochronological potential of Nectandra oppositifolia Nees and Mart. from two sites in Santa Catarina State in southern Brazil. A tree-ring chronology of 34 trees was developed. The time span ranged from 1843 to 2013. The oldest and youngest trees were 171 and 47years-old and the average length of the series was 103years. Average diameter and annual increment were 20.64cm and 0.74mma(-1); diameter and age were unrelated. The species has good dendrochronological potential with an intercorrelation of 0.61 between sites, indicating the existence of a synchronous pattern in the development of the trees. The climate response of the species could be seen by negative tree growth effects for previous hot and current rainy growth seasons.

AB The concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) in plant tissues are commonly used as an indicator of total plant carbon (C) supply; but some evidence suggests the possibility for high NSC concentrations during periods of C limitation. Despite this uncertainty, NSC dynamics have not been investigated experimentally under long-term C limitation. We exposed saplings of 10 temperate tree species differing in shade tolerance to 6% of ambient sunlight for 3 yr to induce C limitation, and also defoliated one species, Carpinus betulus, in the third season. Growth and NSC concentrations were monitored to determine C allocation. Shade strongly reduced growth, but after an initial two-fold decrease, NSC concentrations of shaded saplings recovered to the level of unshaded saplings by the third season. NSC concentrations were generally more depleted under shade after leaf flush, and following herbivore attacks. Only under shade did artificial defoliation lead to mortality and depleted NSC concentrations in surviving individuals. We conclude that, irrespective of shade tolerance, C storage is maintained under prolonged shading, and thus high NSC concentrations can occur during C limitation. Yet, our results also suggest that decreased NSC concentrations are indicative of C limitation, and that additional leaf loss can lead to lethal C shortage in deep shade.

AB The "blooming desert", or the explosive development and flowering of ephemeral herbaceous and some woody desert species during years with abnormally high accumulated rainfall, is a spectacular biological phenomenon of the hyper-arid Atacama Desert (northern Chile) attracting botanists, ecologists, geo-scientists, and the general public from all over the world. However, the number of "blooming deserts", their geographical distribution and spatio-temporal patterns have not been quantitatively assessed to date. Here, we used NDVI data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) project to reconstruct the annual land surface phenology (ISP) of the Atacama Desert using a non-parametric statistical approach. From the reconstructed LSP, we detected the "blooming deserts" as positive NDVI anomalies and assessed three dimensions of the events: their temporal extent, intensity of "greening" and spatial extent. We identified 13 "blooming deserts" between 1981 and 2015, of which three (1997-98, 2002-03, and 2011) can be considered major events according to these metrics. The main event occurred in 2011, spanning 180 days between July and December 2011, and spread over 11,136 km2 of Atacama dry plains. "Blooming deserts" in Atacama have been triggered by the accumulation of precipitation during a period of 2 to 12 months before and during the events. The proposed three-dimensional approach allowed us to characterize different types of "blooming deserts": with longer episodes or larger spatial distribution or with different "greening" intensities. Its flexibility to reconstruct different ISP and detect anomalies makes this method a useful tool to study these rare phenomena in other deserts in the world also.

AB Changing forest cover is a key driver of local climate change worldwide, as it affects both albedo and evapotranspiration (ET). Deforestation and forestation are predicted to have opposing influences on surface albedo and ET rates, and thus impact local surface temperatures differently. Relationships between forest change, albedo, ET, and local temperatures may further vary regionally, as the strengths of warming by albedo effects and cooling by ET effects vary with latitude. Despite these important relationships, the magnitude of forest cover effects on local surface temperature across the globe remains unclear. Using recently-released global forest change data, we first show that forestation and deforestation have pervasive and opposite effects on LST, ET and albedo worldwide. Deforestation from 2000 to 2010 caused consistent warming of 0.38 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE) and 0.16 +/- 0.01 degrees C in tropical and temperate regions respectively, while forestation caused cooling in those regions of -0.18 +/- 0.02 and -0.19 +/- 0.02 degrees C. Tropical forests were particularly sensitive to the climate effects of forest change, with forest cover losses of similar to 50% associated with increased LST of 1.08 +/- 0.25 degrees C, whereas similar forest cover gains decreased LST by -1.11 +/- 0.26 degrees C. Secondly, based on a new structural equation model, we show that these changes on LST were largely mediated by changes in albedo and ET. Finally, based on this model, we show that predicted forest changes in Brazil associated with a business-as-usual land use scenario through 2050 may increase LST up to 1.45 degrees C. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanistic inter-relationships between forest change and changes in albedo, ET and LST, and provide additional evidence that forestation has the potential to reverse deforestation impacts on local climate, especially in tropical and temperate regions.

AB In the face of rapid tropical agricultural expansion, preservation of tropical forest remnants is crucially important. Forest remnants often about the edges of new or established plantations, so landscape-level conservation requires an understanding of the balance between ecosystem services and disservices provided by forest, including potential crop yield reductions caused by species such as rodents, an important pest group in oil palm plantations. However, very little is known about the scale of any spillover of native species which inhabit forest into adjacent agricultural areas. We examined the distribution and behaviour of small mammals across an edge separating logged tropical forest and oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, using a dual approach. We used a trapping grid to reveal patterns of species relative abundance across the forest-plantation edge, and tracked individuals of forest species using a spool-and-line. We uncovered little evidence that the native forest small mammal community crosses the edge and uses the plantation, although two invasive small mammal species were found across the whole edge gradient. Of 10 forest species detected, we found only the adaptable murid Maxomys whiteheadi in the plantation, where it persisted at low abundances across all sampling points, including in the plantation interior control site. This pattern is more consistent with persistence of M. whiteheadi throughout plantations than with spill-over from forest fragments. On the forest side, observed species richness of small mammals increased with distance into the interior, suggesting a negative edge effect may exist within forest remnants. Of 23 successfully tracked small mammals, only one M. whiteheadi crossed the forest-plantation edge, and overall, this species was significantly repelled from crossing into plantation habitat. Our results suggest that spillover of native small mammals contributes little to oil palm damage close to forest-plantation edges, but that oil palm negatively impacts small mammal populations within adjacent forest remnants.

AB Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density-dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting Inga (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.

AB Physically fragile soils are subjected to rapid and abrupt land-use changes in many tropical countries. In this respect, it is important to characterize the changes in soil structure as an essential driver of soil functioning. Soil structure and hydric behavior can be analyzed together using soil shrinkage curves (SSC). The purpose of this study was to highlight the relevance of SSC analysis, even for soils with low shrink-swell capacity, to investigate the influence of three factors of vertical and lateral differentiation in the soil: soil horizon type, topographic position and land use. We analyzed SSC variability along two neighboring toposequences, one under forest and the other under pasture, in the southeast of the state of Para in the Brazilian Amazon. Quasi-continuous SSC were obtained using a Retractometer(C), and the pedostructure model was adjusted well to experimental data. Despite the overall weakness of the shrinkage and the high SSC variability, partial Redundancy Analysis demonstrated significant (P < 0.001) influence of each of the three factors addressed in our study. The influence of soil vertical differentiation was modest, explaining 30% of the total variance in parameters of the pedostructure model. Topographic position and land use had a weaker influence on the SSC, explaining only 5% and 4%, respectively, of total variance. These relatively weak influences, in the particular case of our study, were explained by few soil differences along the toposequences (i.e. Ultisols from uphill to downhill, extensive pasture management). However, statistical analysis of hydro-structural variables deduced from the SSC revealed significant differences among soil horizons regarding distribution of porosity between plasma and structural pores, and dynamics of these two compartments as a function of soil moisture, which is specific information provided by SSC analysis.

AB Most of the previous studies have shown that the relationship between functional diversity and aboveground biomass is unpredictable in natural tropical forests, and hence also contrary to the predictions of niche complementarity effect. However, the direct and indirect effects of functional diversity on aboveground biomass via tree crown complementarity in natural forests remain unclear, and this potential ecological mechanism is yet to be understood across large-scale ecological gradients. Here, we hypothesized that tree crown complementarity would link positive functional diversity and aboveground biomass due to increasing species coexistence through efficient capture and use of available resources in natural tropical forests along large-scale ecological gradients. We quantified individual tree crown variation, functional divergence of tree maximum height, and aboveground biomass using data from 187,748 trees, in addition to the quantifications of climatic water availability and soil fertility across 712 tropical forests plots in Hainan Island of Southern China. We used structural equation modeling to test the tree crown complementarity hypothesis. Aboveground biomass increased directly with increasing functional diversity, individual tree crown variation and climatic water availability. As such, functional diversity enhanced individual tree crown variation, thereby increased aboveground biomass indirectly via individual tree crown variation. Additional positive effects of climatic water availability and soil fertility on aboveground biomass were accounted indirectly via increasing individual tree crown variation and/or functional diversity. This study shows that tree crown complementarity mediates the positive effect of functional diversity on aboveground biomass through light capture and use along large-scale ecological gradients in natural forests. This study also mechanistically shows that tree crown complementarity increases species coexistence through maintenance of functional diversity, which in turn enhances aboveground biomass in natural tropical forests. Hence, managing natural forests with the aim of increasing tree crown complementarity holds promise for enhancing carbon storage while conserving biodiversity in functionally-diverse communities.

AB Ecosystemservice value (ESV) included some contributions of ecological environments to human health and living, and provide cultural and economic benefits for sustaining and fulfilling living organisms. The author selected the Ebinur lake Wetland Nature Reserve as our study site to analyze the spatial distribution and dynamics of ecosystem services, and we used 1972, 1998, 2006, 2014 and 2016 images to study land use/cover change (LUCC) over these periods. LUCC is one of the key drivers that affect ecosystem services. Firstly, in 1972-2030, land use/cover (LULC) significantly changed, with all LUCC practices increasing except for the categories of water area, bare land area and barren land/other. Secondly, changes in ESV were significant during the last 60 years. The total annual ESV in the study area decreased by 50.89% between 1972 and 2030, mostly attributable to the 6.82% growth of saline land, 0.09% growth of desert, 1% decrease of wetlands and 0.95% decrease of water bodies. Thirdly, the spatial-temporal variation of ESV was prominent. Spatial correlation was significant, and the degree of spatial clustering was relatively high in the study area, which was mainly distributed in the water body and wetland regions, and these high-value regions exhibited a decreasing trend. Low values occurred around the lake areas, which increased over time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID REASSESSMENT
AB The high loss rate of forest ecosystem by deforestation in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is one of the principal ecological problems of central Mexico, even in natural protected areas. We compiled a checklist and determined beta-diversity indexes of amphibians and reptiles of the highly disturbed protected area, La Malinche National Park (LMNP) in Mexico, to determine the principal habitats for herpetofaunal conservation. After our extensive eight-year field sampling, we documented 28 species (nine amphibians and 19 reptiles), representing 11 families and 18 genera; four of these species are new records for LMNP. Of the species, 89% are endemic to Mexico. The IUCN Red List considers 22 species as Least Concern, one as Near Threatened, and four as Vulnerable. Meanwhile, the Environmental Viability Scores categorize three species as low vulnerability, 15 as medium, and 10 as high. According to the Mexican list of protected species, eight species are under Special Protection and nine are considered Vulnerable. The dissimilarity index between habitat types (beta sor) in both groups is high, principally due to the environmental gradient generated by the altitudinal range. Abies and Pine forest are high diversity areas for amphibians and reptiles, respectively, and must be considered for special protection. LMNP hosts more than 60% of the herpetofauna of Tlaxcala and is the principal "conservation island" for this state. Therefore, based on the percentage of state species represented, endemism and the current social and ecological problems, additional efforts that involve the local communities to protect the biodiversity of this National Park are necessary.

AB The objective of this study is to characterize and quantify the "trans-spatial nexus synergy" benefit of subsidized water ponding in the water-energy-food nexus in Kumamoto, Japan. After years of decreased rice production in upstream areas and associated declines in groundwater levels, the Kumamoto city government implemented a subsidy program whereby farmers in the Shira River basin receive payments to water their fields, which provides valuable groundwater recharge to downstream Kumamoto city. We quantify the economic benefits of this subsidy program, which include avoided additional energy costs to obtain scarcer levels of groundwater, as well as net revenue from the crops in the Shira River basin that would otherwise not be grown in the absence of the subsidy. These annual benefits can be combined and compared to the annual cost of the government subsidy. We also calculate potential historical losses that may have occurred in the region as a result of land use transitions from rice farming to urban use, which disrupted the nexus synergy between the watered fields and the groundwater table.

AB Ecosystem engineers can modulate harsh abiotic conditions, thus creating habitat for species that cannot withstand the local environment. In this study, we investigated if vacant boreholes created by the rock-boring bivalve Petricola dactylus increase species richness in the low intertidal zone of a Patagonian rocky shore characterized by intense hydrodynamic forcing and sediment scour. Invertebrate species richness was three times higher in engineered than unengineered habitats (i.e., with and without Petricola boreholes, respectively) and the increase in species richness was area-independent. The most prevalent species in unengineered areas showed strong adhesion mechanisms, whereas infaunal and vagile species were mostly restricted to boreholes. The positive influence of engineered microhabitats on species richness can largely be attributed to amelioration of physical conditions, particularly a reduction in hydrodynamic forces and sediment trapping/stabilization within boreholes. We conclude that vacant boreholes are essential microhabitats for the maintenance of biodiversity within the otherwise inhospitable low intertidal zone.

AB Nutrient supply in phosphorus (P)-limited ecosystems, with most P being associated with secondary minerals, has to rely on efficient nutrient allocation strategies, such as those involving mycorrhizal symbioses. Yet, little is known about the extent of photo-assimilate transfer to the fungal partner, who in turn mobilizes mineral-bound P sources required by the plant. This study aims to explore the carbon (C)-P trade between an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plant and its ability to incorporate P from differently accessible P sources. We compared P uptake rates of AM plants for orthophosphate (OP) and phytic acid (PA), applied to mesocosms in either dissolved form or bound to goethite (alpha-FeOOH). The design of the mesocosms allowed the plant to only access the P in the fungal compartment via the AM hyphae. We hypothesized the AM plant to invest more C into the symbiosis, if P is present in the less accessible form. To estimate the C budget of the symbiosis, we determined total organic carbon (OC), 16:1 omega 5c phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA; AM fungi extraradical mycelium), 16:1 omega 5c neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA; AM fungi energy storage), and CO2 cumulative respiration in the fungal compartment. A ratio to the total C translocated into the fungal compartment (OC+CO2-C cumulative respiration) and the P incorporated into the AM plant (Total C/P) was calculated to estimate the C investment made by the AM plant into its symbiotic partner. AM plants incorporated P derived from all four P sources exclusively via the mycorrhizal pathway in different amounts and kinetics. The Total C/P ratio was significantly larger for those AM plants accessing the goethite-bound P compounds. They also transferred significantly larger amounts of PLFA and NLFA to their fungal partner, both indicating a larger plant C investment per P taken up. Our data provide first evidence about the ability of an AM plant to incorporate P from an organic source bound to a secondary mineral. The different C investments of AM plants into P allocation from variably available sources suggests a broad nexus between P mining strategies, resource partitioning in soil, and the amounts of C accumulated in terrestrial soils.

AB The increasing urban sprawl has contributed to the extensive fragmentation and reduction of natural habitat worldwide. Urbanization has a range of adverse effects on ecosystem functioning, including the disruption of plant dispersal processes across the landscape. Urban fragmentation can alter the distance and directionality of dispersal, leading to disrupted gene flow among populations. The dispersal processes of plants that rely on animal-mediated dispersal (zoochory) may be disproportionately affected by urbanization, as many animals avoid urban areas or restrict their movements within urban habitats. This could alter the efficiency of animal dispersal vectors and modify seed movements across urban habitats. While recent studies suggest that seed dispersal networks can be complex and dynamic even in highly managed green areas with relatively low biodiversity, zoochory in urban environments remains understudied. We synthesize the existing literature on zoochory in urban environments and place the findings in the context of ecosystem dynamics. We assess the ecological and evolutionary consequences for seed dispersal, following urbanization, by considering how zoochory is affected by specific features of urban environments. These include the complexity of habitats with varying continuity; high disturbance and intense management; a high proportion of alien species combined with low natural biodiversity; animal behavioral adjustments in different urban settings; and rapid evolutionary change due to urbanization. We conclude that (1) urbanization can disrupt and alter zoochory processes; and (2) successful zoochory can, in turn, alleviate or worsen the challenges to ecosystem dynamics originating from increased urbanization. The dynamic urban seed dispersal networks are emerging as useful models for the adaptability of seed dispersal communities. Their study can also shed light on eco-evolutionary processes under anthropogenic selective pressures, including species interactions. Finally, urban zoochory processes are critical to the functioning of urban ecosystems and as such, constitute an important ecosystem service with management implications. We propose directions for further research into urban zoochory processes to ensure the maintenance of ecosystem dynamics as urbanization continues.

AB High complexity habitat traits (i.e. high heterogeneity and/or size of discrete habitat units) often promote larger abundances of fauna. Sandy and rhodolith sea bottoms are typically interspersed as mosaics within coastal landscapes. The aim of this study was to experimentally assess the effect of two complexity attributes of rhodolith nodules (i.e. their heterogeneity and size) on the abundance and structure of vagile epibenthic assemblages. An early-colonization experiment was set up (July 2016), where experimental units containing rhodolith nodules of varying heterogeneity and size were deployed at two adjacent recipient habitats: a sandy bottom and a rhodolith seabed. After one month, the abundance of fauna colonizing the experimental units was similar in both habitats, but the assemblage structure (i.e. composition) notably differed. Importantly, the heterogeneity, rather than the size, of experimental rhodolith nodules influenced patterns of vagile macrofauna (> 0.5 mm) colonization, despite the habitat type where these experimental units were deployed considerably influenced colonization patterns. This result reinforces the idea of the importance of rhodolith tri-dimensional structure, as key influencer on faunal communities of nearshore habitats.

AB Forest is one of the major natural resources which play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of nature. Detection of forest degradation with remote sensing remains a challenging field of study. Over exploitation of forest resources has resulted in the depletion of the extent and quality forests resources. The present study was undertaken to monitor deforestation, forest degradation, and biomass estimation using remote sensing and GIS technology in Harenna Buluk District in Ethiopia. Supervised classification technique was applied to landsat images of 1995, 2005 and 2016. Satellite images were classified into different land-use/land-cover classes using maximum likelihood algorithm with the aid of field observations and Google Earth. Forest degradation was assessed using object-based image analysis from Sentinel-2A satellite image. Results of this study have revealed that during 1995-2005 and 2005-2016, forest and shrubland areas were decreased by 119.2 km(2) (6.19%) and 12.1 km(2) (0.62%), respectively. The extent of farmland, bareland, grassland, settlement and water body were increased by 99.94 km(2) (5.19%), 43.11 km(2) (2.24%), 75.78 km(2) (3.94%), 20.54 km(2) (1.06%) and 6.93 km(2) (0.36%), respectively. As a result, the biomass dramatically decreased. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value decreased significantly during 1995-2016 indicating that the vegetation cover in the study area was highly disturbed. The estimated degradation during the year 2016 was 145.91 km(2) (7.58%), while deforestation accounted for 171.39 km(2) (8.91%) of the total study area. Thus, advanced satellite images are useful to monitor forest cover and degradation processes of natural habitats in the context of human related impacts.

AB Questions What are the ecological processes that determine the spatial distribution of species and species diversity? Partitioning beta diversity can provide fundamental insights into the processes that determine the spatial variation of species assemblages. However, studying beta diversity is conventionally based only on species composition data, ignoring the structural component of communities. Study site Temperate mixed broadleaf-conifer forest in Jiaohe, Jilin Province, northeastern China. Methods We characterized the variation of community assemblages in terms of species composition, size structure, or considering both components. We then employed environmental and spatial variables as explanatory factors to partition the variation in both compositional and structural components of community assemblage and assess the relative contributions of the niche and neutral processes to community assembly. Results The values of overall beta diversity (BD statistics) and the relative contribution of individual sampling units to beta diversity (LCBD indices) depended on whether the species composition, size structure, or both together had been taken into account. The value of compositional-structural beta diversity was the largest, followed by traditional compositional beta diversity; the smallest was the structural beta diversity. The sites with high contributions to beta diversity (LCBD values) varied among structural and compositional components. The explanatory power of the environmental variables and the spatial variables also varied widely with different components of a community. The combination of environmental and spatial variables explained the highest proportion of variation (43.8%) in the compositional component and explained the lowest proportion of variation (25.4%) in the structural component of community assemblage. Conclusion Both deterministic and stochastic processes are acting to determine community assemblages in terms of species composition and structure in our temperate forest site. Our study highlights the importance of considering the structural component of forest communities, in addition to compositional data, when studying beta diversity.

AB Agriculture is frequently held accountable for the depletion of biotic diversity, although a few agroforestry systems support the conservation of a number of organisms. Cocoa farming is noteworthy as an example of an agricultural activity that benefits or maintains species richness. However, the mechanism by which the biodiversity persists throughout the entire process of plant development remains obscure. In Southeastern Bahia, Brazil, cacao tree plantations support the conservation of a large amount of organisms native to the Atlantic Forest, between them the ants. This study aims at recording the relationship between cocoa tree development and ant community structure. The experiment was carried out in a series of six cocoa tree plantations aged one, three, four, eight, fifteen and 33 years, distributed across the experimental grounds of the Cocoa Research Center at Ilheus. 1,500 ant samples were collected using the sampling techniques: hand collection, honey and sardine baits, entomological blanket and "pitfall". Highest values for diversity and richness were reported in the 15-years-old cocoa plantation. No significant correlations between diversity, richness or plant age were reported. Considering the faunistic composition, a statistical similarity was observed between the plantations close in age to one another. Plant aging did not exert any influence on the diversity gradient and richness in the succession process of the ant community. In young plantations, there are low differences between the ants found on the ground and the ones found on the young cocoa trees. In older plantations, the ant community divides in two distinct assemblages on the ground and on the trees. The variations observed in the ant community along the plant development were likely caused by the structural organization of the dominant species mosaic.

AB Acacia melanoxylon is an invasive species of the mountain grassland of the southeastern part of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Fires are a natural disturbance, characteristic of the area, and favor the germination of this invasive plant. However, they are used as the first step in management systems for the Acacia species. Moreover, the use of ants in monitoring programs is very scarce for Argentina. The objectives of this work are: 1) to analyze the response and resilience capacity of native and invaded sites by A. melanoxylon after a fire for controlling this invasive species; 2) to detect groups of ants considered to be indicators of the recovery phase subsequent to the burning; and 3) to apply the concept of groups of disturbances, proposed by Roig and Espadaler, as an effective tool for monitoring. The sampling design consisted of three replicates of 10 pitfall traps for each environment, native and invaded. Ant species were grouped into functional groups, trophic guilds, and disturbance groups. The fire did not generate significant changes in the richness and abundance of ants in the mountain grassland. However, it generated a positive effect on the sites invaded by Acacia during the first year after the fire. The groups of minimum specialists of vegetation and the dominant Dolichoderinae are considered good bioindicators. Finally, the disturbance indicators can be considered reliable management tools if the biology of the species that compose it is known beforehand.

AB The holobiont concept defines a given organism and its associated symbionts as a potential level of selection over evolutionary time. In clonal plants, recent experiments demonstrated vertical transmission of part of the microbiota from one ramet (i.e., potentially autonomous individual) to another within the clonal network (i.e., connections by modified stems present in similar to 35% of all plants). Because of this heritability, and potentially reciprocal exchange of microbes between generations of ramets, we propose to extend the existing holobiont framework to the concept of meta-holobiont. A meta-holobiont is a network of holobionts that can exchange biomolecules and microbiota across generations, thus impacting the fitness of both biological scales: holobionts and meta-holobionts. Specifically, metaholobiont dynamics can result in sharing, specialization, and division of labor across plant clonal generations. This paper, which coins the meta-holobiont concept, is expected to stimulate discussion and to be applied beyond the context of networked clonal plants (e.g., to social insects).

AB General changes in land use have established patterns of modification of native vegetation into agricultural and grazing land. These production systems, as well as social and economic influences, have created diverse landscapes - mosaics composed of varied elements of vegetation cover (forests, crops, pastures, barren fields) that are distributed across spaces in different ways. In this investigation, we determine the distribution patterns of the richness, abundance and diversity of the bird community within the configuration and composition of agroforestry and silvopastoral landscapes. We observed 262 bird species, 6 720 individuals, 23 orders and 54 families within 39 production system mosaics. None of the species accumulation curves in the production systems reached their asymptote, and the calculated estimators predicted a greater number of species than those observed during the survey. In general terms, richness, diversity and equitability indices were highest in the mosaics of agroforestry systems, while abundance and dominance indices were highest in the mosaics associated with silvopastoral and traditional livestock systems. Variables that describe vegetation cover in mosaics have different and independent effects on the diversity of bird assemblages and on the association of land use groups within the mosaics. The positive extreme of the first component contributes to the variance in the model of richness and diversity indices - both the structural components of landscapes and biological components of the assemblages. The area and disposition of different types of elements in the mosaics of the production system landscapes reflect the systematic management of covers, which affects the implications of landscape conservation and restoration practices. Different landscape elements serve as points of contact in the dispersion and distribution of species within these landscapes. The priority of conservation efforts and the first step for the restoration and connectivity of landscapes in the Andean Amazon of Colombia should be the management and protection of covers like old stubble or BFG and BRP. Another approach is the design of landscapes for entire communities of species with respect to certain quantities of habitats in the landscape and the isolation of patches.

AB It is believed that plant communities of harsh and favorable habitats are organized in different ways. The first - mainly by abiotic environment and random processes (S-model organization), the latter - mainly by competition (C-S-R-model). It can be expected that the characteristics of the organization have an impact on the structure of the dominance of plant communities and its relationship to species richness. The aim of our study was to test this assumption with the example of herbaceous plant communities of relatively stable habitats of several regions and high-altitude belts of the Western Caucasus (alpine snowbeds, heaths and meadows, sub alpine meadows and marshes, low-grass meadows, grassy tiers of forests, steppes). As a criterion of the degree of severity of the environment, the aboveground biomass of communities at the time of its maximum development was used. The relative participation of species was estimated as the ratio of their biomass to the total aboveground biomass on the site (D) or to the biomass of the community remaining after removal of the biomass of higher rank species (K) from it. Under the structure of dominance, relative participation in community of the first rank species (degree of dominance) was understood, as well as the ratio of the values of D and K for two or three species with the largest participation in aboveground community biomass. The following results were obtained: 1. If the dominance structure is estimated on the basis of the D, then it varies widely and is almost unrelated to the production of the habitats (environmental conditions). 2. In C-S-R-communities K values for species of first rank (K-1) are on average higher than for less significant species (K-2 and K-3), in S-communities they are on average approximately the same. Moreover, if we consider C-S-R- and S-communities separately, then (K-1 - K-2) values are not related to the aboveground biomass of communities. The assumption is made that (K-1 - K-2) value can be considered as index of the degree of expression in the dominants of the C-strategy features. 3. The spatial variability of the parameters of the dominance structure is higher in areas of harsh habitats than in favorable. 4. C-S-R-communities are characterized by a closer relationship between degree of dominance and species richness than S-communities. Our results suggest that this is due to both more intensive interspecies competition in C-S-R-communities and to the C-strategy of dominant species.

AB Disentangling the effects of dispersal mode on the environmental and spatial processes structuring biological assemblages is essential to understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence and maintenance. Here, we use field investigations to link dispersal mode with environmental and spatial processes that control stream macroinvertebrate assemblage structure across the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon of Tibet (Tibetan Plateau). We sampled macroinvertebrates in streams that occur in 4 distinct regions. Each of these regions has a steep elevational gradient but different altitude ranges, climate types, and water replenishment sources. We classified macroinvertebrate taxa into passive and active dispersal mode groups to test whether macroinvertebrates with different dispersal modes responded differently to environmental and spatial processes. Our results showed that the assemblage structure of active dispersal groups was more strongly determined by environmental variables (habitat filtering/species sorting) than spatial factors both within and across regions. In contrast, the structure of passive dispersers was more strongly associated with spatial factors than environmental filtering in the entire study area and within lower canyon regions. However, spatial effects were not important for either type of dispersal group in the upper canyon regions, especially in the region with glacier-fed streams, indicating the predominance of species sorting processes in these harsh environments. Furthermore, the spatial structuring of assemblages became stronger as habitat filtering declined, which indicates a reduction in species sorting processes in less harsh environments. Our findings demonstrate diverse responses of macroinvertebrate assemblages to environmental and spatial processes across this poorly-known highland river system, and imply that dispersal mode influences the underlying mechanisms of community variation.

AB Cloud forest is a sensitive and vulnerable ecosystem that is threatened by human activities as well as climate change. Previous studies have shown how transitional ecosystems such as cloud forests will be the most negatively impacted by the global increase in temperature. Therefore, the niche modeling framework was used in this study to geographically identify the areas with the climatic potential to host the largest number of key tree species in this ecosystem and to propose them as priority conservation areas. A total of 19 species were modeled using the MaxEnt algorithm; binary maps were generated for each species and combined to produce one potential suitability map and identify climatic priority areas. Thus, 7% of the national area of Mexico shows suitability for the cloud forest ecosystem, although it is currently distributed in less than 1% of the country. Finally, potential suitability areas were compared with natural protected areas, current land use and priority conservation areas. We found that of the current suitable area, only 5% coincides with some federal or state protection regime. Natural protected areas have proven to be a mechanism for forest conservation, so we must consider increasing the number and area of those protected areas that favor the conservation of these key cloud forest species.

AB Several theories explaining the post-introduction evolution of invasive plants predict that specialist-enemy release often leads to decreased defense in introduced plants, but how novel generalist consumers in the introduced ranges affect plant-defense evolution remains largely unexplored. According to the shifting defense hypothesis, the decreased defense against specialist enemies may result in the increased defense against generalists. We compared resistance and tolerance of native (from the USA) and invasive populations (from China) of Spartina alterniflora to the dominant generalist insect Laelia coenosa in China. We also compared leaf traits between Spartina population origins. We found that Laelia had lower performance on invasive than on native Spartina populations. Native Spartina populations, however, had a greater capacity to compensate for leaf damage by Laelia than invasive ones. Although specific leaf area and leaf carbon content did not significantly vary between Spartina origins, invasive Spartina populations had lower leaf-nitrogen content than native populations. These results suggest that, following its introduction to China, Spartina has developed increased resistance but decreased tolerance to the generalist herbivore, which may be related to evolutionary increases in leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. These findings enhance our understanding of invasive plant defense against generalist herbivores in the introduced ranges and highlight the trade-off between resistance and tolerance.

AB We explore the role of mining in contributing to deforestation across 300 plus districts in India. Using a unique dataset, covering the period 2001-2014, the impact of mining related deforestation is delineated from those driven by various socio-economic, demographic and climatic factors. The roles of several minerals, such as coal, iron, bauxite, dolomite, limestone, manganese, quartz, fireclay and granite are explicitly tested using econometric analysis. Findings indicate that, on average, a district that did not produce any of the minerals considered in the study had suffered about 350 km(2) lower forest area loss compared to a mineral producing district. Districts that produced coal, iron or limestone, saw on average 450 km(2) higher forest cover loss compared to those that did not produce the same minerals. Iron ore production was positively associated with barren land area across districts, whereas forest cover loss was higher in districts that produced higher amounts of limestone or granite. Overall, mining has evidently contributed to deforestation at a district level, and within the mineral groups considered in this study, coal, iron and limestone have had the most adverse impact on forest area loss. However, minerals such as fireclay, manganese, dolomite, and quartz are being produced in districts that have seen either a lower deforestation rate or an improvement in forest area over the study period. Among the non-mining related drivers of deforestation, higher share of cropping area in a district's geographical area significantly contributed to deforestation.

AB This study analysed the diversity of tree species, their distribution and soil nutrient status along altitudinal gradients of Saptasajya hill range, Eastern Ghats, India. Thirty quadrats of 10mx 10m size for trees across the altitude ranges between 81m and 450m were laid. Field sampling were conducted at 3 different elevation sites of the hill range: Site 1- Low Elevation Forest (LEF), Site 2- Middle Elevation Forest (MEF) and Site 3- High Elevation Forest (HEF). A total of 368 individuals which belongs to 48 species among 42 genera and 27 families were recorded in 0.3 ha sampling areas. Maximum numbers of tree species occurred at LEF (35) followed by MEF (34) and HEF (14). The density of tree species varied from 433 ha(-1) to 390 ha(-1) with average basal area of 30.64 m(2)/ha. The Shannon diversity index (H') varied among the three sites was 2.19 (LEF), 1.84 (MEF) and 1.29 (HEF). The soil parameters of three forest sites were analysed and correlated with tree species richness, diversity and density. Species richness and tree diversity index were positively correlated with pH (r=0.743 and r=0.829 respectively; p<0.05), whereas tree density was negatively correlated with pH (r=-0.597), phosphorous (r=-0.401), organic carbon (r=-0.543) and tree diversity index (r-= 0.364). It could be helpful to understand the pattern of vegetation and its relation to soil nutrients in Eastern Ghats of India implicating conservation plan for tree species in tropical moist deciduous forests.

AB Inbreeding and enemy infestation are common in plants and can synergistically reduce their performance. This inbreeding xenvironment (I x E) interaction may be of particular importance for the success of plant invasions if introduced populations experience a release from attack by natural enemies relative to their native conspecifics. Here, we investigate whether inbreeding affects plant infestation damage, whether inbreeding depression in growth and reproduction is mitigated by enemy release, and whether this effect is more pronounced in invasive than native plant populations. We used the invader Silene latifolia and its natural enemies as a study system. We performed two generations of experimental out- and inbreeding within eight native (European) and eight invasive (North American) populations under controlled conditions using field-collected seeds. Subsequently, we exposed the offspring to an enemy exclusion and inclusion treatment in a common garden in the species' native range to assess the interactive effects of population origin (range), breeding treatment, and enemy treatment on infestation damage, growth, and reproduction. Inbreeding increased flower and leaf infestation damage in plants from both ranges, but had opposing effects on fruit damage in native versus invasive plants. Inbreeding significantly reduced plant fitness; whereby, inbreeding depression in fruit number was higher in enemy inclusions than exclusions. This effect was equally pronounced in populations from both distribution ranges. Moreover, the magnitude of inbreeding depression in fruit number was lower in invasive than native populations. These results support that inbreeding has the potential to reduce plant defenses in S. latifolia, which magnifies inbreeding depression in the presence of enemies. However, future studies are necessary to further explore whether enemy release in the invaded habitat has actually decreased inbreeding depression and thus facilitated the persistence of inbred founder populations and invasion success.

AB Global change influences biogeochemical cycles within and between environmental compartments (i.e., the cryosphere, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and the atmosphere). A major effect of global change on carbon cycling is altered exposure of natural organic matter (NOM) to solar radiation, particularly solar UV radiation. In terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, NOM is degraded by UV and visible radiation, resulting in the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide, as well as a range of products that can be more easily degraded by microbes (photofacilitation). On land, droughts and land-use change can reduce plant cover causing an increase in exposure of plant litter to solar radiation. The altered transport of soil organic matter from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems also can enhance exposure of NOM to solar radiation. An increase in emission of CO2 from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to the effects of global warming, such as droughts and thawing of permafrost soils, fuels a positive feedback on global warming. This is also the case for greenhouse gases other than CO2, including methane and nitrous oxide, that are emitted from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These trace gases also have indirect or direct impacts on stratospheric ozone concentrations. The interactive effects of UV radiation and climate change greatly alter the fate of synthetic and biological contaminants. Contaminants are degraded or inactivated by direct and indirect photochemical reactions. The balance between direct and indirect photodegradation or photoinactivation of contaminants is likely to change with future changes in stratospheric ozone, and with changes in runoff of coloured dissolved organic matter due to climate and land-use changes.

AB In the present study, partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of 22 island populations of the springtail Homidia socia in the Thousand Island Lake were sequenced. Across all sequences, 37 haplotypes were identified for the 510-bp mitochondrial (mt) DNA COI gene. Haplotype 2 was the most common, and was distributed in the most of the 22 island populations. Haplotype diversity ranged from 0.065 to 0.733, and the total genetic diversity was 0.56216. The genetic characteristics of the 22 island populations were analyzed using the fixation index and gene flow, with values of 0.00043-0.94900 and 0.02703-703.72540, respectively. Comparison between (island area and isolations) with population genetic diversity revealed that there were no significant correlations between them, except for a significant correlation between the number of haplotypes and island area. Mantel tests showed that there was no significant correlation between geographic distance and genetic distance among various groups. All the results indicated that there were no obvious relationships between island characteristics and the genetic diversity of the springtails. We consider that the low dispersal capacity of springtails and the island patches surrounded by water in the Thousand Island Lake are the major factors affecting the genetic diversity of H. socia.

AB The bee avoidance' hypothesis posits that the colour of hummingbird-pollinated flowers will exclude bees, especially in long-tubed flowers, which are more subject to bee nectar robbers. However, many hummingbird-pollinated plants possess bracts, and the role of bract colour in bee avoidance has not previously been tested. We assessed the signal value of bract colours by comparing them with the petals of species with and without bracts. We expected the bracts would contrast and enhance the petal signal more to hummingbirds than to bees, especially in long-tubed flowers. We compared bract signals in the hummingbird and bee visual systems, petal signals between the bract and leaf background, and the relationship between flower length and bract colour. For species with bracts, the bracts contrasted more than petals in the hummingbird visual system, but less in the bee visual system. Petals contrasted more with the bract background than with the leaf background to hummingbirds, but not to bees. Bract colours of long-tubed flowers contrasted less than those of short-tubed flowers to bees. Our results show that bracts are attractive to hummingbirds, and have the potential to exclude antagonists in hummingbird-pollinated plants. These patterns support the bee avoidance hypothesis, especially in long-tubed flowers.

AB Novel relationships between the floral morphology of introduced plants and the trophic morphology of native pollinators have been hypothesized to cause strong natural selection on both parties, but evidence for such selection is rare. We capitalized on a natural disturbance to examine selection on an introduced plant, Heliconia wagneriana, on the island of Dominica, before and after Hurricane Maria. Prior to the hurricane, female Anthracothorax jugularis hummingbirds, which have longer bills than males, were the main visitor to H. wagneriana, and directional selection on corolla length was insignificant. After the hurricane, shorter-billed male A. jugularis were the main visitor to H. wagneriana. The absence of trait matching between a short-billed pollinator and a long-flowered plant resulted in directional selection for shorter flowers because males preferentially visited plants with shorter flowers. The amount of nectar removed by male A. jugularis was negatively associated with flower length, with flowers >53 mm containing nearly five times the nectar than flowers A. jugularis, and results suggest the heaviest mortality occurred among short-billed male hummingbirds and larger-bodied individuals of both sexes, which would have higher nectar requirements and the most difficulty obtaining nectar. Our results indicate that hurricanes may alter relationships between plants and pollinators and that lack of trait matching resulting from such disturbances may lead to selection on both plant and pollinator.

AB Termites are ecosystem engineers that play an important role in the biotransformation and re-distribution of nutrients in soil. The dry forests are endemic repositories, but at same time, they are most threatened by extensive livestock and crop farming, fires, and climate change. In Colombia, the best-protected dry forests are located in the north. The termite fauna of dry forests are poorly known. The aim was to identify the termite species occurring in tropical dry forests of the Colombian Caribbean coast in relation to diet and precipitation, temperature, elevation, and soil properties. A total of 32 species in 1,103 occurrences were found. Termitidae accounted for 78% of the species richness with the Anoplotermes-group, Microcerotermes, and Nasutitermes being the dominant genera. Differences in species composition and abundance were found across sites. These differences may be linked to anthropogenic disturbance and polygyny and polydomy. Strikingly, our highest elevation site (334 m) had the highest species richness much higher than the two lower elevation sites. This implies an inversion of the common elevation-diversity gradient, also found for termites which can be explained by increasing precipitation with elevation in the dry forest. An analysis of termite species richness at the global scale confirms that termite species richness correlates positively with rainfall. Hence, rainfall seems to positively affect termite diversity. In line, the studied Colombian tropical dry forests had low diversity compared to rain forests. A decline of species-rich soil-feeding termites with increasing aridity may explain why the highest termite diversity occurs in humid tropical rain forests. in Spanish is available with online material.

AB Species extinctions caused by the destruction and degradation of tropical primary forest may be at least partially mitigated by the expansion of regenerating secondary forest. However, the conservation value of secondary forest remains controversial, and potentially underestimated, since most previous studies have focused on young, single-aged, or isolated stands. Here, we use point-count surveys to compare tropical forest bird communities in 20-120-year-old secondary forest with primary forest stands in central Panama, with varying connectivity between secondary forest sites and extensive primary forest. We found that species richness and other metrics of ecological diversity, as well as the combined population density of all birds, reached a peak in younger (20-year-old) secondary forests and appeared to decline in older secondary forest stands. This counter-intuitive result can be explained by the greater connectivity between younger secondary forests and extensive primary forests at our study site, compared with older secondary forests that are either (a) more isolated or (b) connected to primary forests that are themselves small and isolated. Our results suggest that connectivity with extensive primary forest is a more important determinant of avian species richness and community structure than forest age, and highlight the vital contribution secondary forests can make in conserving tropical bird diversity, so long as extensive primary habitats are adjacent and spatially connected. in Spanish is available with online material.

AB Omomyiform primates are among the most basal fossil haplorhines, with the oldest classified in the genus Teilhardina and known contemporaneously from Asia, Europe, and North America during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) similar to 56 mya. Characterization of morphology in this genus has been limited by small sample sizes and fragmentary fossils. A new dental sample (n = 163) of the North American species Teilhardina brandti from PETM strata of the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, documents previously unknown morphology and variation, prompting the need for a systematic revision of the genus. The P-4 of T. brandti expresses a range of variation that encompasses that of the recently named, slightly younger North American species 'Teilhardina gingerichi,' which is here synonymized with T. brandti. A new partial dentary preserving the alveoli for P1-2 demonstrates that T. brandti variably expresses an unreduced, centrally-located P-1, and in this regard is similar to that of T. asiatica from China. This observation, coupled with further documentation of variability in P-1 alveolar size, position, and presence in the European type species T. belgica, indicates that the original diagnosis of T. asiatica is insufficient at distinguishing this species from either T. belgica or T. brandti. Likewise, the basal omomyiform 'Archicebus achilles' requires revision to be distinguished from Teilhardina. Results from a phylogenetic analysis of 1890 characters scored for omomyiforms, adapiforms, and other euarchontan mammals produces a novel Glade including T. magnoliana, T. brandti, T. asiatica, and T. belgica to the exclusion of two species previously referred to Teilhardina, which are here classified in a new genus (Bownomomys americanus and Bownomomys crassidens). While hypotheses of relationships and inferred biogeographic patterns among species of Teilhardina could change with the discovery of more complete fossils, the results of these analyses indicate a similar probability that the genus originated in either Asia or North America.

AB Herbaceous plants are often under-studied in tropical forests, despite their high density and diversity, and little is known about the factors that influence their distribution at microscales. In a 25-ha plot in lowland Amazonian rain forest in Yasuni National Park, Ecuador, we censused six species of Heliconia (Heliconiaceae) in a stratified random manner across three topographic habitat types. We observed distribution patterns consistent with habitat filtering. Overall, more individuals occurred in the valley (N = 979) and slope (N = 847) compared with the ridge (N = 571) habitat. At the species level, Heliconia stricta (N = 1135), H. spathocircinata (N = 309) and H. ortotricha (N = 36) all had higher abundance in the valley and slope than ridge. Further, H. vellerigera (N = 20) was completely absent from the ridge. Conversely, H. velutina (N = 903) was most common in the drier ridge habitat. The two most common species (H. stricta and H. velutina) had a reciprocal or negative co-occurrence pattern and occurred preferentially in valley versus ridge habitats. These results suggest that taxa within this family have different adaptations to the wetter valley versus the drier ridge and that habitat partitioning contributes to coexistence.

AB Elevational gradients are a powerful tool to investigate how abiotic factors affect ecosystems and to predict the possible consequences of climate change. Here, we investigated the assemblage-level responses of seed size, ant worker size, and rates of seed removal by ants along a 1700m elevational gradient in Mediterranean grasslands of central Spain, taking into account abiotic factors and interactions between biotic variables. Our results showed that both seed size and ant size decreased with elevation. Structural equation models linking abiotic factors and biotic variables were built to describe these patterns. Two equally plausible models were selected, both based on temperature. In the first model, temperature directly affected seed size and granivorous ant size, and indirectly affected ant size (of both granivorous and non-granivorous species) through a bottom-up pathway. The second model included the direct effects of temperature on ant size and granivorous ant size, and indirect effects on seed size through a top-down pathway. In this model, the link between granivorous ant size and seed size was positive. Seed removal rates decreased with elevation and seed size, with smaller seeds being preferred with increasing elevation. Taken together, our results indicate that the observed patterns of ant size and seed size are ultimately controlled by abiotic factors, although the system is more satisfactorily explained if seed-ant interactions are incorporated into the models. We expect that climate change will have strong effects on this system, including mismatches between consumers and producers potentially altering the interspecific relationships among ants and plants.

AB Ecological disturbance is fundamental to the dynamics of biological communities, yet a conceptual framework for understanding the responses of faunal communities to disturbance remains elusive. Here, I propose five principles for understanding the disturbance dynamics of ants-a globally dominant faunal group that is widely used as bioindicators in land management, which appear to have wide applicability to other taxa. These principles are as follows: (1) The most important effects of habitat disturbance on ants are typically indirect, through its effects on habitat structure, microclimate, resource availability and competitive interactions; (2) habitat openness is a key driver of variation in ant communities; (3) ant species responses to disturbance are to a large degree determined by their responses to habitat openness; (4) the same disturbance will have different effects on ants in different habitats, because of different impacts on habitat openness; and (5) ant community responses to the same disturbance will vary according to ant functional composition and biogeographical history in relation to habitat openness. I illustrate these principles using results primarily from studies of ant responses to fire, a dominant agent of disturbance globally, to provide a common disturbance currency for comparative analysis. I argue that many of the principles also apply to other faunal groups and so can be considered as general ecological "laws." As is the case for ants, many impacts of habitat disturbance on other faunal groups are fundamentally related to habitat openness, the effects of disturbance on it and the functional composition of species in relation to it.

AB Not all herbivory is detrimental to plants. In some cases, plants can compensate for herbivory, maintain growth and fitness following damage, or even overcompensate for herbivory and perform better than if left undamaged. Examples of overcompensation to vertebrate herbivory are well known, but here we review the literature for examples of reproductive overcompensation (i.e., increased production of traits associated with fitness) and increased vegetative growth (i.e., vegetative overcompensation) following insect herbivory. We used a meta-analysis to explore the effects of plant growth form, evolutionary history, herbivore feeding guild, and other plant and insect traits on the expression of reproductive and vegetative overcompensation by plants. Our literature search revealed 86 studies documenting examples of overcompensation for insect herbivory by 67 plant species representing 26 families. These plants included monocots and dicots, annuals and perennials, and woody and herbaceous plants. We also found that varied insect herbivores induce overcompensation, including 75 insect species in six orders representing 27 families and myriad feeding guilds. In our meta-analysis, we calculated 53 effect sizes from 21 publications documenting reproductive overcompensation and 89 effect sizes from 40 publications documenting vegetative overcompensation. Variation in reproductive overcompensation was seen among plant growth forms, functional groups, cultivation, herbivore feeding sites, and plant and herbivore families. Variation in vegetative overcompensation was seen among plant families, herbivore families, and latitudinal gradients. We suggest overcompensation for insect herbivory may be far more prevalent than previously thought. Additional research focusing on the mechanisms, patterns, and ecological and evolutionary consequences of overcompensation for insect herbivory is likely to provide exciting new insights into this poorly understood and largely overlooked outcome of plant-insect interactions.

AB Environmental filtering and dispersal limitation can both maintain diversity in plant communities by aggregating conspecifics, but parsing the contribution of each process has proven difficult empirically. Here, we assess the contribution of filtering and dispersal limitation to the spatial aggregation patterns of 456 tree species in a hyperdiverse Amazonian forest and find distinct functional trait correlates of interspecific variation in these processes. Spatial point process model analysis revealed that both mechanisms are important drivers of intraspecific aggregation for the majority of species. Leaf drought tolerance was correlated with species topographic distributions in this aseasonal rainforest, showing that future increases in drought severity could significantly impact community structure. In addition, seed mass was associated with the spatial scale and density of dispersal-related aggregation. Taken together, these results suggest environmental filtering and dispersal limitation act in concert to influence the spatial and functional structure of diverse forest communities.

AB Payments for environmental services (PES) are part of a suite of market-based conservation mechanisms that have gained international attention for their potential to produce ecosystem services across private landholdings. The Costa Rican government, a PES pioneer, provides landowners with remuneration for conserving forest cover on their properties. The efficiency and effectiveness of PES programs have been critiqued, because little is understood about the ability of payments to alter landowner behavior. Unique to the existent literature, we combine data from semi-structured interviews with an economic nonmarket valuation technique, the stated choice experiment, to explore preferences for PES and the impact of PES on decision making in the mixed-use Bellbird Biological Corridor of Costa Rica. The choice experiment reveals farmer preferences for PES, while interviews provide context for the choice experiment results and illuminate the implications for policy. Results show that farmer objections to PES design and program implementation influence willingness to accept payments for conservation efforts. Results further indicate that a significant share of farmers in the study area are resistant to the PES program irrespective of competitive payments offered. We suggest that this overall resistance to the program is a key driver of program inefficiency. We further suggest that potential program improvements require better engagement with multifaceted landowner values, and that PES may not constitute an effective mechanism for engaging small-scale farmers in conservation.

AB Recent appreciation of the multidimensional nature of biodiversity has prompted biologists to examine the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic attributes of natural communities. Simultaneous consideration of such multiple diversity dimensions provides valuable insights into various community assembly processes. We studied the alpha and beta components of ant diversity on a simple island landscape dominated by adjacent but abiotically distinct evergreen (humid & dense canopy) and littoral (dry & sparse canopy) forest habitats. We sought to (i) describe and examine interrelationships of ant diversity dimensions, and (ii) identify potential processes structuring ant communities by comparing the diversity patterns of observed and randomly generated communities. We found that the drier littoral habitat had lower ant species richness and non-random community composition, but had similar functional diversity as evergreen forests. This result is in contrast with previous studies comparing intact and human-altered habitats that reported severe loss of ant functional diversity with reduced richness. In our study, the functional similarity between habitats was maintained because communities in littoral forests were functionally overdispersed than expected by chance. We suggest that competition and/or thermal tolerance of ants may drive overdispersion of littoral ant communities. At the small spatial scale of our island, phylogenetic diversity was a poor predictor of habitat differences despite significant phylogenetic signal in functional traits and non-random functional diversity patterns. Our work highlights the need for a broad range of studies comparing multidimensional diversity in adjacent habitats that would provide a baseline for interpreting community-level changes due to anthropogenic pressures.

AB Aim The factors determining spatial distributions and diversity of terrestrial invertebrates are typically investigated at small scales. Large-scale studies are lacking for soil animals, which control microbial communities and represent one of the most diverse yet poorly known animal assemblages. Here, we analyzed a major group (Oribatida) to test whether belowground macroecological patterns can be predicted by climatic variables, vegetation and large-scale variation in key soil properties. Location We modelled the multivariate distribution of more than 100 species using biodiversity data collected across Great Britain in the framework of the Countryside Survey (). Methods We analyzed species-level data from 582 samples collected across 162 hectads (10 x 10 km) covering the largest possible range of vegetation types, soil properties and climatic conditions within GB. We created the first large-scale maps of soil animal diversity metrics at the GB scale, including novel estimates of metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD). Using structural equation modelling, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of location (latitude, longitude), plant community structure and abiotic factors such as precipitation on species composition, richness and PD. Results We found that variation in species composition follows a latitudinal gradient with diversity generally increasing northward. The latitudinal variation in species composition drives PD via changes in both species richness and phylogenetic distance between species. This gradient is mostly determined by latitudinal variation in precipitation and organic matter, which were very good predictors of species composition. Precipitation and organic matter were, however, relatively weak while statistically significant predictors of diversity metrics. Conclusions Past studies have emphasized the unpredictability of species distributions and variation in species composition in hyper diverse soil animal communities. However, past studies were conducted at small scales, where stochastic factors may weaken the signal of deterministic factors. Oribatid mites in our study show for the first time that the large scale latitudinal gradients in climate and organic matter predict not only variation in species composition but also taxonomic and PD of soil animal communities.

AB Aim To test whether the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands induced by a major hydroelectric dam is best explained by either the island biogeography theory (IBT) or the habitat amount hypothesis (HAH). Given the low dispersal ability of the focal species group and the hostile water matrix, we predict that the species richness will be predominantly driven by an island effect as posited by the IBT, rather than a sample area effect as posited by the HAH. Location Forest islands within the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir, central Brazilian Amazonia. Taxon Birds. Methods We mist-netted birds at 33 forest islands (0.63-1,699 ha), totalling 874 individuals of 59 species. The size of the local landscape used to calculate the habitat amount was determined by a multi-scale analysis in which buffers around mist-net lines ranged from 50 to 2,000 m. We applied four tests to examine whether the species richness on forest islands is predominantly driven by either an island effect (island size) or a sample area effect (habitat amount). Results From the four tests applied, one was consistent with an island effect, two were regarded as inappropriate to test the HAH, and one could not be adequately addressed due to island size being highly correlated with habitat amount in the local landscape (200-m buffer). Main conclusions Some of the proposed ways of testing the HAH may lead to misleading conclusions. The relative importance of island size in determining the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands is higher than that of surrounding habitat amount, thereby providing stronger support for IBT. We propose a conceptual framework, based on the degree of matrix permeability and species dispersal ability, to determine to what extent a patch- or landscape-centric worldview in landscape ecology provides the most appropriate framework to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.

AB Aim We tested the hypothesis that sympatry among closely related species is possible only in the absence of interspecific competition. Location Dinaric Karst, Western Balkan, Europe. Taxon A clade of subterranean amphipods, genus Niphargus (Crustacea: Amphipoda). Methods Phylogenetic reconstructions; species delimitation; modelling competition using phylogeny and species distributions; reconstruction of historical dispersal. Results The clade comprises six species, which classify into two ecomorphs. Species of the same ecomorph are parapatric or allopatric, whereas species belonging to different ecomorphs overlap their ranges. The phylo-spatial reconstructions suggest that the shift from allopatry to sympatry is associated with relaxation of competitive interactions. Reconstruction of species past dispersal implies that sympatry is of secondary origin. Main conclusions Interspecific competition presumably controls evolutionary and ecological dynamics in subterranean environments in a similar way as in more familiar surface environments.

AB Vegetation-soil systems differentially influence the ecosystem processes related to the carbon cycle, particularly when one tree species is dominant over wide geographic regions that are undergoing climate change. The objective of this study was to quantify the stocks of ecosystem carbon in three vegetation-soil systems along a highland elevational gradient in central Mexico. The vegetation-soil systems, from lower to higher elevation, were dominated by Alnus jorullensis Kunth, Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham., and Pinus hartwegii Lindl., respectively. Above-and below-ground tree biomass was determined in each system, along with the litter, coarse woody material, roots, and litterfall. The A. religiosa system had the greatest stock of aboveground biomass carbon (216 +/- 31 Mg C.ha(-1)). The A. jorullensis system had the greatest production of litterfall (3.1 +/- 0.08 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1)); however, the carbon content of this litter layer (1.2 +/- 0.32 Mg C.ha(-1)) was lower than that of P. hartwegii (10.1 +/- 0.28 Mg C.ha(-1)). Thus, the litter layer in the A. jorullensis system had markedly the shortest residence time (8 years), suggesting high rates of litter decomposition. The soil carbon stock (at soil depth of 1m) was greater in A. jorullensis (189 Mg C.ha(-1)) and P. hartwegii (137 Mg C.ha(-1)) than in A. religiosa (68 Mg C.ha(-1)). The A. religiosa and A. jorullensis systems had the highest and lowest total ecosystem C content (301 and 228 Mg C.ha(-1), respectively). Upward migration of the A. religiosa system in response to global climate change, however, could cause losses by 2030 of 187 Mg C.ha(-1) associated with aboveground biomass.

ID BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; CONSERVATION
AB The current rates of biodiversity loss are amongst the major global environmental problems, especially in the tropics. The creation of Protected Areas (PAs) is the most widespread strategy adopted for the minimization of such problem. However, official studies that guide the creation of PM frequently do not convert their outcomes into conservation. This problem is not expected in Brazil, because scientific studies for the definition of priority areas for conservation were ordered by the same institutions in charge of the creation and management of PM. In this paper, we compared the spatial distribution of PAs created in Brazil in the past decade with studies of priority areas for the protection of biodiversity. At a federal level of analysis, 19.44% of federal PM are located in non-priority sites, which represents 0.47% of the total land area of federal PM created. At a state level, 71.05% of state PM are located in non-priority sites, which represents 60.68% of the total land area of state PM created. In 2015, the total cost for the preservation of PM in non-priority classes was US$17,539.30 (3.28% of the annual budget for federal PAs created after 2007) at federal level and US$541,745.02 (55.98% of the annual budget for state PM created after 2008) at state level. The findings contribute to the development of strategies for the creation of new PM in Brazil.

AB Fire is one of the main modeling agents of savanna ecosystems, affecting their distribution, physiognomy and species diversity. Changes in the natural fire regime on savannas cause disturbances in the structural characteristics of vegetation. Theses disturbances can be effectively monitored by time series of remote sensing data in different terrestrial ecosystems such as savannas. This study used trend analysis in NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) time series to evaluate the influence of different fire recurrences on vegetation phenology of the Brazilian savanna in the period from 2001 to 2016. The trend analysis indicated several factors responsible for changes in vegetation: (a) The absence of fire in savanna phytophysiognomies causes a constant increase in MODIS-NDVI, ranging from 0.001 to 0.002 per year, the moderate presence of fire in these areas does not cause significant changes, while the high recurrence results in decreases of MODIS-NDVI, ranging from -0.002 to -0.008 per year; (b) Forest areas showed a high decrease in NDVI, reaching up to -0.009 MODIS-NDVI per year, but not related to fire recurrence, indicating the high degradation of these phytophysiognomies; (c) Changes in vegetation are highly connected to the protection status of the area, such as areas of integral protection or sustainable use, and consequently their conservation status. Areas with greater vegetation conservation had more than 70% of positive changes in pixels with significant tendencies. Absence or presence of fire are the main agents of vegetation change in areas with lower anthropic influence. These results reinforce the need for a suitable fire management policy for the different types of Cerrado phytophysiognomies, in addition to highlighting the efficiency of remote sensing time series for evaluation of vegetation phenology.

AB Crofton weed is a major invasive species in China. It exhibits superior growth characteristics and can outcompete with native species via allolepathic effects and modulation of the soil fungal microbiome. The simple removal of invading plants will not ensure restoration of the habitat due to the persistence of allelochemicals and viable seeds in the surrounding soil. An orthogonal experimental design was employed to evaluate the effects of three control factors (A, powdered natural inhibitor species to retard growth; B, activated charcoal to absorb allelochemicals; and C, fungicide to reduce fungal modulation effects), applied at three levels, on the growth and competitive ability of Crofton weed against two native species, in a pot-culture experiment. All treatments reduced all measured growth parameters (P < 0.05) except for a specific leaf area, when compared with control plants. Furthermore, the competitive capacity of Crofton weed was decreased in the treatments while that of the native species was improved. Application to soil of the powdered natural inhibitor species and of activated charcoal significantly inhibited plant growth and competitive ability of Crofton weed (P < 0.05). Application of fungicide was less effective, but significantly reduced the specific leaf area of Crofton weed plants (P < 0.05). The specific combination of factors producing the greatest decrease in plant growth and competitive ability (compared with the control) included the addition of Delavaya toxocarpa powder (37.5 g per kg soil), addition of activated charcoal to soil at a ratio of 1:3 (v/v) (62.5 g per kg soil), and application of fungicide (Thiophanate-Methyl) (0.28 g per kg soil).

AB Aim Understanding how ecosystem functioning and evolution shape taxonomic assemblages is a lively debate basically involving two major opposite views: the niche- and dispersal-assembly hypotheses. Here, we introduce a new method allowing for the identification of the first-order process of assembly underlying a set of taxonomic assemblages. Methods Building on Clarke's SIMPER (for "similarity percentage") analysis of a taxon/locality occurrence data set, we develop a permutation-based algorithm named PER-SIMPER, allowing for the identification of the first-order process-either niche- or dispersal-assembly-that drives species distribution within two or more groups of assemblages. We demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the method through cellular automaton-like simulations generating niche-assembled and/or dispersal-assembled species occurrence data sets. Sensitivity analysis further allows evaluation of its accuracy and robustness to sampling effort, including reduced numbers of sampled localities and/or species. Main conclusions Niche- and/or dispersal-assembled communities generate very different SIMPER profiles, which, in turn, allow for the accurate and consistent identification of the first-order process of assembly operating within two or more groups of species assemblages through a threefold randomization procedure named PER-SIMPER. The PER-SIMPER method appears robust to varying sampling efforts that may affect the number of sampled localities and/or species, especially when one of the two processes of assembly dominates the other. The PER-SIMPER analysis can be achieved on any empirical occurrence data set using a dedicated R function available as Supporting Information.

AB Inbreeding and herbivory can interactively reduce the performance of flowering plants. Here, we investigated whether the magnitude of plant inbreeding depression increases under herbivory as a result of diminished leaf metabolic responses to herbivory in inbreds, which entails increased herbivore growth and feeding damage. We additionally explored whether genetic differentiation among native and invasive plant populations impacts the magnitude and direction of these inbreeding x herbivory interactions. Inbred and outbred plants from eight European (native) and eight North American (invasive) populations of Silene latifolia were exposed to two consecutive control or herbivory treatments (infestation with larvae of Mamestra brassicae). After the first treatment, leaf metabolic responses to herbivory were assessed with untargeted metabolic fingerprinting using UHPLC-ESI+-QTOF-MS/MS. After the second herbivory treatment, herbivore growth and plant feeding damage were assessed. Moreover, plant performance traits were recorded 4 weeks after the second herbivory treatment. Metabolic fingerprinting revealed that changes in the pool sizes of various metabolic features in response to herbivory were less intense in inbred than outbred plants from native and invasive populations. While herbivore growth and feeding damage were largely unaffected by plant breeding status in invasive populations, herbivores consumed more biomass from, but showed reduced growth on, inbred than outbred native plants. The magnitude of inbreeding depression in plant performance traits was not affected by herbivory. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that inbreeding compromises herbivory-induced metabolic defences in S. latifolia, and simultaneously reduces the nutritional quality of plants. The magnitude and direction of these inbreeding effects were shaped by genetic differentiation among native and invasive plants. These range-specific responses provide novel insights into the role of inbreeding x herbivory interactions in invasion success.

AB In the present study, we evaluated the long term MODIS fire counts with the grid spacing 1 degrees x1 degrees over the part of continent of Asia. The grid show high percent of fire events was assigned to high risk grid. The study further evaluated three selected 2x2 window representing the risk grid. We have analyzed the fire events along various vegetation types as well as country boundary. The climate data set is further analyzed and statistical analysis was performed to understand the relationship with fire events. The first selected 2x2 window grid roughly represents over region of Punjab and Haryana state of India show 83% of total fire in the month of October and November due to agricultural residues burning. The result of the analysis of vegetation types with fire events manifest the vegetation types dominated by shifting cultivation which occupies the geographical area of 8% whereas they retain fire percent equivalent of 30% of total fire events. Country based fire events analysis shows that Burma fire events per unit geographical area were found roughly 3.5 times higher when compared with India. The analysis of fire events and climate data from February to July in grids over a part of the Asian region (central part of India) exhibit the 50% fire events was in the month of March with maximum temperature (degrees C), precipitation (mm) and solar radiation (KJ/m(2)/day) with range of (26.7-35.9), (6-26) and (22680-24366) respectively. The evaluation of Crammer's V coefficient (CVC) values of precipitation, mean maximum temperature and solar radiation are found in decreasing order and in the range of 0.77-0.31. The highest CVC value of precipitation (0.77) shows that among all other climatic parameters the precipitation has very strong relationship to fire events. Remote sensing data (fire and climate) when coupled with various analyses in GIS domain reflect better understanding of their relationship which will greatly help in management/planning/ making strategy on fire prevention/control.

AB Land-use change threatens a large number of tropical species (so-called loser' species), but a small subset of disturbance-adapted species may proliferate in human-modified landscapes (winner' species). Identifying such loser and winner species is critically needed to improve conservation plans, but this task requires longitudinal studies that are extremely rare. We assessed this topic with small rodent assemblages in the Lacandona rainforest, a relatively new and highly dynamic agricultural frontier from southeastern Mexico. In particular, we measured the abundance of four rodent species in 12 forest sites during a 6year period. We related changes in abundance to differences across time in landscape structure (i.e., percentage of forest cover, matrix contrast, number of forest patches, and forest edge density) surrounding each site. Total rodent abundance was almost two times higher in 2016 than in 2011, although abundances were generally low in all years. The abundance of Heteromys desmarestianus increased through time, mainly in forest sites with increasing matrix contrast. Oryzomys sp. also tended to increase in abundance, especially in sites with decreasing edge density. Sigmodon toltecus remained stable through time, but Peromyscus mexicanus tended to decrease in abundance, particularly in sites with decreasing edge density and increasing matrix contrast across time. Therefore, spatial variations in landscape structure lead to species-specific responses. If current deforestation rates persist, we predict a population decline of forest-specialist species (P. mexicanus), and an increase in generalist species (S. toltecus and Oryzomys sp.). Improving matrix quality is crucial for preventing the extinction of forest-specialist rodent species.

AB Limited knowledge exists about the sessile species found in wave exposed subtidal environments of southeastern Pacific shores, including the temporal patterns of colonization, growth, succession, and the potential problems they pose to human industries, including oceanic aquaculture and renewable wave energy. Filling this information gap is urgent considering the increased interest to exploit these environments. We conducted a 23mo long experimental study on the coast of central Chile to characterize biofouling colonization, rates of accumulation and succession patterns at two different depths and different substrates. Throughout the study, we recorded 62 species, 36 of which were sessile. Biomass accumulation rates were among the highest recorded, with significantly higher and more seasonal rates above than below the thermocline. Slightly but significantly higher biomass was observed in ceramic tiles than acrylic or safety-walk surfaces, but such differences varied with depth and month of the year. In all materials, surface cover reached nearly 100% within about a month of exposure at 5 m deep in spring and summer months, and over 70% at 15 m deep, with lower cover in winter months. The patterns of total biofouling biomass measured in air (weight) were quite different to those measured submerged in seawater, highlighting the importance of species attributes (body density) when assessing risks of biofouling for different human-made structures. The hydrozoan Obelia geniculata was by far the fastest colonizing macro-invertebrate species throughout the year and both depths, covering the entire plate surface in spring-summer months. Community composition shifted in favor of large-bodied, heavier species when surfaces were exposed for more than 6mo. Succession in shallow waters followed a deterministic path from hydrozoans, to the large-bodied barnacle Austromegabalnus psittacus to dominance by the tunicate Pyura chilensis. Final successional stages appear to be the same in deeper waters, but dominance was not achieved before the end of the experiment. Ecological perspectives and simple recommendations to developers and the productive sector are discussed.

AB Village Common Forests (VCFs) are patches of tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen hill forests in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs), Bangladesh that are conserved through voluntary community participation for community perceived sustenance of ecosystem services. VCFs are currently under informal management without any optimal model of Community-Based Management (CBM). By using strength, weakness, opportunity, threat (SWOT) technique combined with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), this paper assessed the perceptions of four major stakeholder groups. Their perceptions were analyzed to ascertain the priority factors related to CBM adoption in VCFs of CHT. The four stakeholder groups were - researchers from academia, government officials, NGO staffers and local indigenous community leaders. Results indicated an overall negative perception among all the stakeholders regarding the adoption of CBM in VCFs. "No land tenure security" was the most serious weakness factor for the implementation of CBM in VCFs among all stakeholder groups except government of-ficials. "Unity and easy decision process", "Positive community attitude" and "Low management cost" were the most important strength factors respectively from academia, government, NGOs and community leaders. All the stakeholder groups identified "Relationship development between government and community" as the most important opportunity factor for CBM of VCFs. "Uncertainty of peace accord 1997 and 1900 CHT regulation implementation" was treated as the most damaging threat factor against the adoption of CBM in VCFs. Therefore, rebuilding indigenous peoples' confidence in government initiatives by counting them in the high-level decision-making process, ensuring land tenure security have been identified as the key initial interventions.

AB Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition may exacerbate soil phosphorus (P) limitations in P-deficient subtropical forest ecosystems. However, which abiotic factors predominantly contribute to soil P transformations and how plant roots affect soil P variations after N addition in these ecosystems are unclear. To address these issues, we studied a natural Castanopsis carlesii forest in Fujian, China subjected to 3 years of N addition. Soil P fractions, soil properties, iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) oxides, root biomass (RB), and root length density (RLD) were investigated. The results showed that N application remarkably increased the concentrations of soil available P but significantly decreased content of soil moderately labile P. The quantities of free Fe and Al (Fe-d and Al-d) and organic-bound Fe and Al (Fe-p and Al-p) decreased after N addition. These changes indicated an important relationship between Fe and Al oxides and P fractions, especially Fe-p and moderately labile P, suggesting that Fe and Al oxides predominantly influenced soil P fractions in N-enriched plots. Meanwhile, RB and RLD were higher after N addition treatments than control treatment. Positive correlations between RB and RLD and P fractions (available P, labile P, and moderately labile P) indicated that plant roots exert an essential influence on changes in soil P fractions. In conclusion, N addition in subtropical forests significantly influenced soil P fractions, primarily by decreasing Fe and Al oxides and increasing plant root biomass and density.

AB Identifying patterns of introgression across the tree of life is foundational to understanding general mechanisms that govern the impacts of gene flow on the speciation process. There are few vertebrate groups in which hybridization is associated with as large a diversity of outcomes as in North American whiptail lizards (Aspidoscelis). Of particular interest is that hybridization among divergent whiptail species has repeatedly led to the formation of unisexual (parthenogenetic) lineages. Understanding the hybrid origin of these unisexual lineages requires an accurate understanding of species boundaries among gonochoristic whiptails. Doing so has historically been an extremely challenging problem which, in part, may be a consequence of widespread hybridization and incomplete reproductive isolation among lineages. The lack of a robust phylogenetic framework and uncertainty in species boundaries precludes studies of general patterns and mechanisms of introgression among whiptail species. Here, we use genomic data to reconstruct a robust estimate of evolutionary history in the largest clade of whiptail lizards (A. sexlineatus species group) and use it to identify patterns of introgression. Our results indicate substantial introgressive hybridization and admixture has occurred among multiple lineages of whiptails across diverse evolutionary time scales, and illustrate their impact on phylogenetic inference. Thus, hybridization among whiptail species appears to have been a prominent feature throughout their evolutionary history, which could, in part, explain why parthenogenesis has evolved so many times in whiptails in comparison to other vertebrate groups.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) is a popular paradigm to address underprovision of ecosystem services in developing economies. Potential PES recipients often experience other market imperfections, which can influence PES uptake and environmental performance. These include poorly functioning financial services markets. We develop a model of nonindustrial timber production with poorly functioning financial service markets and PES. We calibrate the model to the Panama Canal Watershed and solve the dynamic allocation decision using dynamic programming. The results of our model show that improving financial services markets, including improved access to borrowing and savings, can reduce the costs of acquiring ecosystem services. Nonenvironmental market frictions can influence the incentive properties of PES payment vehicles. Our model predicts that wealthier individuals are likely to provide the desired land uses at least cost if incentivized land uses involve production. In these cases cost-effective PES is unlikely to advance development objectives.

AB Mutualistic interactions are powerful drivers of biodiversity on Earth that can be represented as complex interaction networks that vary in connection pattern and intensity. One of the most fascinating mutualisms is the interaction between hummingbirds and the plants they visit. We conducted an exhaustive search for articles, theses, reports, and personal communications with researchers (unpublished data) documenting hummingbird visits to flowers of nectar-rewarding plants. Based on information gathered from 4532 interactions between 292 hummingbird species and 1287 plant species, we built an interaction network between nine hummingbird clades and 100 plant families used by hummingbirds as nectar resources at a continental scale. We explored the network architecture, including phylogenetic, morphological, biogeographical, and distributional information. As expected, the network between hummingbirds and their nectar plants was heterogeneous and nested, but not modular. When we incorporated ecological and historical information in the network nodes, we found a generalization gradient in hummingbird morphology and interaction patterns. The hummingbird clades that most recently diversified in North America acted as generalist nodes and visited flowers with ornithophilous, intermediate and non-ornithophilous morphologies, connecting a high diversity of plant families. This pattern was favored by intermediate morphologies (bill, wing, and body size) and by the low niche conservatism in these clades compared to the oldest clades that diversified in South America. Our work is the first effort exploring the hummingbird-plant mutualistic network at a continental scale using hummingbird clades and plant families as nodes, offering an alternative approach to exploring the ecological and evolutionary factors that explain plant-animal interactions at a large scale.

AB In forest ecosystems, natural and anthropogenic disturbances alter canopy structure, understory vegetation, amount of woody debris, and the properties of litter and soil layers. The magnitude of these environmental changes is context-dependent and determined by the properties of the disturbance, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, and extent. Therefore, disturbances can dynamically impact forest communities over time, including populations of ground-dwelling invertebrates that regulate key ecosystem processes. We propose conceptual models that describe the dynamic temporal effects of canopy gap formation and coarse woody debris accumulation following disturbances caused by invasive insects, wind, and salvage logging, and their impacts on ground-dwelling invertebrate communities. Within this framework, predictions are generated, literature on ground-dwelling invertebrate communities is synthesized, and pertinent knowledge gaps identified.

AB Understanding processes that drive community recovery are needed to predict ecosystem trajectories and manage for impacts under increasing global threats. Yet, the quantification of community recovery in coral reefs has been challenging owing to a paucity of long-term ecological data and high frequency of disturbances. Here we investigate community re-assembly and the bio-physical drivers that determine the capacity of coral reefs to recover following the 1998 bleaching event, using long-term monitoring data across four habitats in Palau. Our study documents that the time needed for coral reefs to recover from bleaching disturbance to coral-dominated state in disturbance-free regimes is at least 9-12 years. Importantly, we show that reefs in two habitats achieve relative stability to a climax community state within that time frame. We then investigated the direct and indirect effects of drivers on the rate of recovery of four dominant coral groups using a structural equation modelling approach. While the rates of recovery differed among coral groups, we found that larval connectivity and juvenile coral density were prominent drivers of recovery for fast growing Acropora but not for the other three groups. Competitive algae and parrotfish had negative and positive effects on coral recovery in general, whereas wave exposure had variable effects related to coral morphology. Overall, the time needed for community re-assembly is habitat specific and drivers of recovery are taxa specific, considerations that require incorporation into planning for ecosystem management under climate change.

AB When confronted with a parasite or pathogen, hosts can defend themselves by resisting or tolerating the attack. While resistance can be diminished when resources are limited, it is unclear how robust tolerance is to changes in environmental conditions. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of tolerance in a single host population living in a highly variable environment. We manipulated the abundance of an invasive parasitic fly, Philornis downsi, in nests of Galapagos mockingbirds (Mimus parvulus) over four field seasons and measured host fitness in response to parasitism. Mockingbird tolerance to P. downsi varied significantly among years and decreased when rainfall was limited. Video observations indicate that parental provisioning of nestlings appears key to tolerance: in drought years, mockingbirds likely do not have sufficient resources to compensate for the effects of P. downsi. These results indicate that host tolerance is a labile trait and suggest that environmental variation plays a major role in mediating the consequences of host-parasite interactions.

AB Tree allometric relationships are widely employed for estimating forest biomass and production and are basic building blocks of dynamic vegetation models. In tropical forests, allometric relationships are often modeled by fitting scale-invariant power functions to pooled data from multiple species, an approach that fails to capture changes in scaling during ontogeny and physical limits to maximum tree size and that ignores interspecific differences in allometry. Here, we analyzed allometric relationships of tree height (9884 individuals) and crown area (2425) with trunk diameter for 162 species from the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. We fit nonlinear, hierarchical models informed by species traits - wood density, mean sapling growth, or sapling mortality - and assessed the performance of three alternative functional forms: the scale-invariant power function and the saturating Weibull and generalized Michaelis-Menten (gMM) functions. The relationship of tree height with trunk diameter was best fit by a saturating gMM model in which variation in allometric parameters was related to interspecific differences in sapling growth rates, a measure of regeneration light demand. Light-demanding species attained taller heights at comparatively smaller diameters as juveniles and had shorter asymptotic heights at larger diameters as adults. The relationship of crown area with trunk diameter was best fit by a power function model incorporating a weak positive relationship between crown area and species-specific wood density. The use of saturating functional forms and the incorporation of functional traits in tree allometric models is a promising approach for improving estimates of forest biomass and productivity. Our results provide an improved basis for parameterizing tropical plant functional types in vegetation models.

AB Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are known to affect plants' germination and seedling establishment in arid ecosystems, but their ecological role in more mesic climates is not so wellknown. We tested the effects of moss-crusted versus uncrusted soils on seed germination dynamics in a temperate pine barren ecosystem. We conducted a 35-day laboratory assay of seed germination on moss-crusted soils versus uncrusted soils from the Albany (NY) Pine Bush Preserve. We compared total seed germination and the number of days to 50% of total germination of two herbaceous perennial forb species in each soil type. Three and five times more seeds germinated on uncrusted soil than on crusted soil for bush clover (Lespedeza capitata) and wild lupine (Lupinus perennis), respectively. Seeds of both species also germinated approximately 10 days earlier on uncrusted soil than on crusted soil. This study, and others in similar habitats, show that BSCs in mesic climates can influence germination and other early life-history stages of plants. We hope that further study of the interactions between BSCs and vascular plants in mesic climates will contribute to our understanding of the ecology of BSCs outside the arid and semiarid climates where they are more extensively studied.

AB Like all interactions, the success of cross-discipline collaborations relies on effective communication. Ecology offers theoretical frameworks and lexicons to study microbiomes. Yet some of the terms and concepts borrowed from ecology are being used discordantly by microbiome studies from their traditional definitions. Here we define some of the ecological terms and concepts as they are used in ecology and the study of microbiomes. Where applicable, we have provided the historical context of the terms, highlighted examples from microbiome studies, and considered the research methods involved. We divided these concepts into four sections: Biomes, Diversity, Symbiosis, and Succession. Biomes encompass the interactions within the biotic and abiotic features of an environment. This extends to the term "microbiome," derived from "biome," and includes an environment and all the microbes within it. Diversity encompasses patterns of species richness, abundance, and biogeography, all of which are important to understanding the distribution of microbiomes. Symbiosis emphasizes the relationships between organisms within a community. Symbioses are often misunderstood to be synonymous with mutualism. We discard that implication, in favor of a broader, more historically accurate definition which spans the continuum from parasitism to mutualism. Succession includes classical succession, alternative stable states, community assembly frameworks, and r/K-selection. Our hope is that as microbiome researchers continue to apply ecological terms, and as ecologists continue to gain interest in microbiomes, each will do so in a way that enables cross-talk between them. We recommend initiating these collaborations by using a common lexicon, from which new concepts can emerge.

AB Riparian areas around streams are those areas in which biological communites are directly influenced by the stream. The size of protected riparian areas and their conservation has become a controversial topic after changes implemented in the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC): a set of laws that regulates the size of Permanent Protection Areas (PPA). Here, we investigate the influence of distance from water bodies on bat-species and guild composition in a lowland Amazonian rainforest. Our hypotheses were that bat assemblages would change depending on the distance to the water body and that the abundance of herbivorous bats (frugivorous and nectarivorous) would be greater in areas close to water. Bats were captured with mist-nets in 24 riparian and 25 non-riparian plots within a trail grid in an old-growth terra-firme forest, northeast of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Each plot was sampled three times in a total of 7056 net-hours. We captured 1191 bats, comprising 51 species. We used model selection based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) to compare linear and piecewise regressions to estimate the ecological thresholds for different bat assemblages. Piecewise models with one breakpoint were more parsimonious than linear models for abundance data, and the species and guild composition of animalivorous and frugivorous bats. Animalivorous-bat abundance increased from the stream to about 181 m, and frugivorous-bat abundance decreased within 50 m of the stream. The patterns of guild abundance suggest that frugivorous bats may need greater access to streams than animalivorous bats. The most conservative model suggests that most of the variation in bat composition occurs close to the stream and extends to up 114 m from the banks. Therefore, the 30 m wide strip of riparian forest protected by Brazilian law would maintain a relatively small fraction of bat-species assemblages in Ducke Reserve, and is insufficient to represent most of the assemblage-composition variation within the riparian zone. The suggestion to reduce the width of the protected riparian zone from 30 to 15 m for streams smaller than 10 m wide, as is under discussion, would likely be prejudicial for bat assemblages.

ID DEFORESTATION; AGRICULTURE; PATTERN; REGION
AB The Brazilian Cerrado is the second largest biome in Latin America, extending over more than 200 million ha and hosts some of the most intensive agricultural activities for grain and beef production in the world. Because of the biodiversity richness and high levels of endemism, Cerrado is considered one of world's hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of this study are three-fold: to present a comprehensive division of Cerrado into different ecoregions that reflect the environmental heterogeneity within the biome; to analyze the ecoregions in terms of biophysical characteristics, protected areas, environmental liability in riparian permanent protection areas along watercourses, and priorities for biodiversity conservation; and to rank the ecoregions in terms of endangerment for biodiversity conservation and restoration. A previous study that delineated 22 ecoregions using geomorphology, vegetation, soil, geology, and plant diversity maps was revised using topography, vegetation, precipitation, and soil maps. Our new ecoregion map consists of 19 units that are unique in terms of landscape characteristics and has been adjusted to the current official boundary map of Cerrado. Some of the ecoregions consist of only one geomorphological compartment, whereas others are heterogeneous, consisting of up to eight compartments. Ferralsols comprise the dominant soil type in 14 of the ecoregions. The percentage of protected areas within ecoregions ranges from 1.7% to 51.5%. The most endangered ecoregion, where land use change critically threatens habitat integrity, is the Depressao Carstica do Sao Francisco (states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Piaui), where environmental liability along riparian permanent protection areas amounts to 85.6% of the total area. Our proposed ecoregion map provides a spatial framework for regional and local assessments to improve decision-making processes to reconcile conservation and restoration planning, sustainable agriculture, and provision of ecosystem services. Besides de adjustment of the previous Cerrado's ecoregion map to the official biome boundary (relevant for the implementation of public policies of conservation as those regulated by the Brazilian Forest Code), the new analyses of the ecoregion map represent a substantial improvement in comparison to the ones conducted by the previous study in 2003. In addition, current web resources allow us to make all the information used or derived from this study available to other users. This opens the possibility of additional improvements of our findings by the scientific community or to be used effectively by decision makers.

   HYPOTHESIS
AB Herbivory, plant facilitation, and competition have complex impacts on tree regeneration which are seldom investigated together. Grazing exclosure experiments have allowed quantification of the effects of large herbivores on tree regeneration dynamics but have often ignored the effect of herbivorous insects. We experimentally tested how folivory (percentage of leaf damaged by insects) and microenvironment (tree canopy cover and herbs) jointly alter performance (growth and survival) of seedlings of two dominant Mediterranean oak-species within ungulate exclosures in a 3-year field study. An agroforestry system dominated by cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak (Q. rotungolia) was assessed in south-east Portugal. We aimed also to determine whether the two oak species differed in the interdependences between folivory, microenvironment, covaring factors, and seedling performance. Unexpectedly, under the low-moderate insect defoliation, growth and survival of cork and holm oak seedlings were positively associated with herbivore damage. Herb removal increased oak folivory by 1.4 times. Herb removal was also positively associated with growth, directly and indirectly through its negative effect on oak folivory. Tree canopy favored insect folivory upon cork oak seedlings directly and upon holm oak indirectly via decreasing light availability. Folivory was threefold greater upon cork than upon holm oak-seedlings. Our study shows that tree canopy, herbs, and covarying factors can affect cork and holm oak-seedling performances through complex pathways, which markedly differ for the two species. The combined effect of insect herbivory and positive and negative plant-plant interactions need to be integrated into future tree regeneration efforts toward tackling the regeneration crisis of oak agroforestry systems of the Mediterranean.

AB Enhanced understanding of relationships between functional diversity (FD) and environmental gradients is crucial given accelerating rates of land-cover change and disturbance worldwide. Functional diversity measures the abundance, range and distribution of traits in a community, and links species diversity with ecosystem function. Several studies have related bird or invertebrate FD to environmental gradients, but information on the responses of mammal FD to vegetation structural diversity at scales of management relevance is scarce. We addressed this knowledge gap by examining responses of ground-dwelling mammal FD to vegetation structural complexity in wet (high-productivity) and dry (low-productivity) eucalypt forest in the Otway Ranges, southeast Australia. In dry forest, we expected a positive relationship between FD and vegetation structural complexity because more resources should enable species with a greater diversity of traits to co-exist. We expected negative correlations in wet forest, where competitive dominance may drive a decrease in FD as structural complexity increases. Ground-dwelling mammals were surveyed using camera traps, and we used five traits to construct four FD indices (richness, evenness, divergence, and dispersion). Six vegetation structure variables were used to calculate two indices of vegetation structure, and we used linear mixed models to relate functional diversity and species richness to vegetation structural complexity (the total abundance of structural attributes) and heterogeneity (the level of contrast or patchiness in structure), in wet and dry forest. Camera traps detected ten native ground-dwelling mammal species. All FD indices were positively correlated with vegetation structural complexity, but only functional dispersion responded to structural heterogeneity. Contrary to expectations, relationships between FD and structural complexity were consistent in both forest types, and we suggest that low levels of functional niche occupancy prevented competitive dominance in wet forest. Species richness did not respond to any predictor variables, and is unlikely to be a useful surrogate of ground-dwelling mammal FD. Our results indicate that forest managers may sustain ecosystem functions performed by ground-dwelling mammals by conserving structurally complex vegetation.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought events have increased during the recent decades, particularly in the tropics. Yet, the growth and physiological responses of many tropical tree species to drought are still inadequately understood. We studied the drought resilience of two functionally different canopy tree species (Chukrasia tabularis and Toone ciliate) from a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh during two extreme drought events (1984 and 1999). We quantified four resilience components (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience) of both species to infer drought tolerance of selected trees. Tree radial growth dropped by 44-56% in the drought years, varying with species and drought events. Two species showed no differences in their drought resistance during any of the drought events. However, C. tabularis showed higher recovery and resilience than T. ciliate after the 1999 drought event. T. ciliate showed higher resilience after the 1984 drought event. Linear mixed effect model (LMEM) revealed that growth rates in the two years before and after the drought events had a dominant role in drought responses over tree age, height, diameter, basal area increment and crown exposure, although crown exposure had significant influence on the resistance and the resilience of light demanding T. ciliate. We conclude that diffuse porous and intermediate shade tolerant C. tabularis is more drought tolerant than the ring-porous and light demanding T. ciliate. Since both study species are widely used as plantation species throughout the tropics, our results have important implications for forest managers to take decision on species suitability for plantation programs and to adopt forest management to future climate change conditions.

AB Trees can adjust their hydraulic architecture by adjusting vessel size and frequency in response to stressful environmental condition. Little is known about the long term adjustment of tropical moist forest trees to changing environment. Here we develop the standard chronologies of seven vessel features and radial growth of two ecologically contrasting South Asian moist forest trees, Toona ciliata M. Roem. and Lagerstroemia speciosa (L.) Pers. and evaluate their hydraulic response to short term climate variability and long term climate variations. Measurements of vessel variables were performed on digital microscopic images. Standard dendrochronological procedure were applied to develop vessel and ring-width chronologies. Relationships among the chronologies and their interaction with climate variables were assessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), bootstrap correlations and moving correlations. Pre-monsoon temperature negatively influenced ring-width (RW) and positively influenced vessel density (VD) in T. ciliata. Mean vessel area (MVA) was negatively related with prior year monsoon temperature. In L. speciosa, previous year temperatures and precipitation showed strong correlations with vessel features and radial growth in the following growing season, probably due to carbon carry over effects. Current year October precipitation was positively related with MVA in both species. Differences in functional traits might have caused the observed variation in hydraulic strategies between the two study species. Our analyses suggest that cellular dendrochronology can be used to understand the long-term hydraulic responses of functionally different moist forest trees to climatic changes which is relevant for forest management under changing climate conditions.

AB Naturally fragmented landscapes provide suitable scenarios through which to investigate patch and landscape effects on biodiversity patterns in areas that are isolated from the disturbances usually associated with human made fragments. We aimed to investigate the patch and landscape effects on the diversity of forest-dependent and matrix-tolerant dung beetles in a naturally fragmented landscape. We also assessed the influence that seasonal and vegetation variations had on these dung beetles. We sampled dung beetles during two summers and two winters in 14 forest islands of various sizes and shapes within a natural mountainous forest archipelago in southeast Brazil. We measured the patch and landscape variables based on high-resolution multispectral images of circular sectors with radii of 100, 250, and 500 m. We used generalized linear mixed models to relate dung beetle metrics to patch and landscape attributes. The interaction between canopy cover and season influenced both species' richness and abundance of the dung beetle metacommunity. The forest-dependent species' richness increased with greater canopy cover, regardless of the season. Patch attributes (e.g., size, canopy cover, distance to the closest patch, and distance to continuous forest) and landscape attributes (e.g., percentage of forest in the landscape, total edge, number of patches, distance to the nearest neighbor, and shape complexity) had small general effects on dung beetle species as a whole and on matrix-tolerant species in particular. However, these values strongly influenced forest-dependent species' richness, abundance, and temporal beta diversity. The matrix-tolerant species, therefore, mask the effects of patch and landscape effects on forest-dependent species within the mountainous forest archipelago. In other words, the changes in these patch and landscape attributes influenced forest-dependent and matrix-tolerant species differently. Therefore, the evaluation of entire metacommunities may not be helpful when evaluating species-specific responses in mixed landscapes-a fact that impairs the conservation of forest-dependent species.

AB Biodiversity in natural systems can be maintained either because niche differentiation among competitors facilitates stable coexistence or because equal fitness among neutral species allows for their long-term cooccurrence despite a slow drift toward extinction. Whereas the relative importance of these two ecological mechanisms has been well-studied in the absence of evolution, the role of local adaptive evolution in maintaining biological diversity through these processes is less clear. Here we study the contribution of local adaptive evolution to coexistence in a landscape of interconnected patches subject to disturbance. Under these conditions, early colonists to empty patches may adapt to local conditions sufficiently fast to prevent successful colonization by other preadapted species. Over the long term, the iteration of these local-scale priority effects results in niche convergence of species at the regional scale even though species tend to monopolize local patches. Thus, the dynamics evolve from stable coexistence through niche differentiation to neutral cooccurrence at the landscape level while still maintaining strong local niche segregation. Our results show that neutrality can emerge at the regional scale from local, niche-based adaptive evolution, potentially resolving why ecologists often observe neutral distribution patterns at the landscape level despite strong niche divergence among local communities.

ID ELECTIONS; BEHAVIOR; PARTIES
AB Political elections exemplify complex decision processes in human populations. Data of proportional elections show a striking feature at different spatial scales, across years, and for several democracies: when ranking the parties according to their number of voters, the amount of votes grows exponentially with the party's rank. We develop a mechanistic mathematical model of birth and death of parties and voter grouping based only on word of mouth and not on political contents, close to neutral models used in evolutionary biology (Ewens sampling formula), or Hubbell's model of species biodiversity. Data and model agree strikingly well. The model explains, for instance, the steady loss of big-tent parties in France and Germany by the increasing number of parties standing for elections. A cannibalism effect (parties/candidates at a given rank systematically withdraw votes from others) can be identified. The interpretation and consequences of the rational or lack thereof of voters' choices for modern democracies are discussed.

AB Dryland ecosystems cover nearly 45% of the Earth's land area and account for large proportions of terrestrial net primary production and carbon pools. However, predicting rates of plant litter decomposition in these vast ecosystems has proven challenging due to their distinctly dry and often hot climate regimes, and potentially unique physical drivers of decomposition. In this study, we elucidated the role of photopriming, i.e. exposure of standing dead leaf litter to solar radiation prior to litter drop that would chemically change litter and enhance biotic decay of fallen litter. We exposed litter substrates to three different UV radiation treatments simulating three-months of UV radiation exposure in southern New Mexico: no light, UVA+UVB+Visible, and UVA+Visible. There were three litter types: mesquite leaflets (Prosopis glandulosa, litter with high nitrogen (N) concentration), filter paper (pure cellulose), and basswood (Tilia spp, high lignin concentration). We deployed the photoprimed litter in the field within a large scale precipitation manipulation experiment: similar to 50% precipitation reduction, similar to 150% precipitation addition, and ambient control. Our results revealed the importance of litter substrate, particularly N content, for overall decomposition in drylands, as neither filter paper nor basswood exhibited measurable mass loss over the course of the year-long study, while high N-containing mesquite litter exhibited potential mass loss. We saw no effect of photopriming on subsequent microbial decay. We did observe a precipitation effect on mesquite where the rate of decay was more rapid in ambient and precipitation addition treatments than in the drought treatment. Overall, we found that precipitation and N played a critical role in litter mass loss. In contrast, photopriming had no detected effects on mass loss over the course of our year-long study. These results underpin the importance of biotic-driven decomposition, even in the presence of photopriming, for understanding litter decomposition and biogeochemical cycles in drylands.

AB Rewilding has been an increasingly popular tool to restore plant-animal interactions and ecological processes impaired by defaunation. However, the reestablishment of such processes has seldom been assessed. We investigated the restoration of ecological interactions following the reintroduction of the brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) to a defaunated Atlantic forest site. We expected the reintroduction to restore plant-animal interactions and interactions between howlers and dung beetles, which promote secondary seed dispersal. We estimated the number of interactions expected to be restored by the reintroduction to provide the baseline interaction richness that could be restored. We followed the reintroduced howler monkeys twice a week for 24 months (337 hours total) to assess their diet. We used howler monkey dung in secondary seed dispersal experiments with 2484 seed mimics to estimate the removal rates by dung beetles and collected the beetles to assess community attributes. We compared the potential future contribution of howler monkeys and other frugivores to seed dispersal based on the seed sizes they disperse in other areas where they occur. In 2 years, howler monkeys consumed 60 animal-dispersed plant species out of the 330 estimated. Twenty-one dung beetle species were attracted to experimentally provided dung; most of them were tunnelers, nocturnal, and large-sized (>10 mm). On average 30% (range 0-100%) of the large seed mimics (14 mm) were moved by dung beetles. About 91% of the species consumed by howlers (size range 0.3-34.3 mm) overlapped in seed size with those removed by dung beetles. In our study area, howler monkeys may consume more large-seeded fruit species than most other frugivores, highlighting their potential to affect forest regeneration. Our results show reintroductions may effectively restore ecological links and enhance ecological processes.

TI California Island Rediscovery: building an archive to improve

AB An understanding of how past conditions have shaped present-day ecological patterns and trends is critical to science-based conservation management. Unfortunately, the records, specimens, and objects historical ecologists need to help generate that understanding are often lacking. And because of a general underinvestrnent by society in systematic collection and museum curation, future historical ecologists may be similarly limited in their ability to investigate conditions regarding our present day. Given the importance of historical data and materials in contemporary conservation decision-making, we suggest it is incumbent upon resource managers and scientists to ask whether additional research efforts are needed to document past and present conditions of the places and resources of their interest. Here, we discuss how such an inquiry was applied to the terrestrial and nearshore environments of Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. The island harbors numerous endemic taxa, important archaeological and fossil sites, and rich cultural significance. It also has undergone dramatic and ongoing alteration due to past and present human activities. We describe an interdisciplinary effort to identify information gaps regarding past and present conditions of the island. In many cases, filling those gaps will require a research focus on a broader geography and suite of resources, including the archipelago in which the island sits and mainland "sister sites." An initiative to improve collection and retention of priority information could be a basis of interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration and could be designed to foster environmental education and citizen science programs that engage the next generation of conservationists. An outcome of this initiative would be an archive of materials and data to inform the historical ecologists and conservationists of the future, and to help conservationists today ensure that the resources they deem most important will be stewarded successfully into that future.

AB Movement within stream corridors is a basic life history requirement of many aquatic organisms. Barrier removal in streams has become a common practice in the United States aimed to restore organism dispersal and meet conservation objectives; however, there are social and economic costs to the removal of barriers. Accordingly, tools to prioritize barrier removal, particularly optimization techniques, can be used to evaluate cost-benefit trade-offs. Many of these techniques, however, require programming experience and are not available to natural resource managers. Furthermore, conservation objectives vary considerably depending on the life histories of organisms under consideration, and these opposing objectives, in conjunction with variant socioeconomic costs, will influence optimization solutions, specifically which barriers to remove. To promote the use of optimization tools, straightforward and open-access platforms are needed to support use by managers, while also providing general approaches for holistic basin-scale connectivity restoration. Herein, we use two case studies, White Oak Creek (small watershed) and the Roanoke River Basin (large basin), to explore the divergent outcomes stemming from different conservation objectives and socioeconomic costs used to prioritize barrier removal. We conducted optimization modeling using a widely accessible platform along with an open-access solver plug-in to support a wide variety of conservation objectives. We used simple approaches to find commonalities in barriers identified for removal among divergent conservation objectives and provide alternative (i.e., hybrid removal-passage) strategies for approaching habitat restoration for diverse aquatic communities while increasing social benefits (i.e., hydropower energy). As expected, different conservation objectives aimed to support varied species life histories (e.g., diadromy, large-river vs. small-river potamodromy) have very different effects on optimization solutions. In both case studies, however, commonalities in solutions were identified through clustering groups of barriers into general connectivity restoration strategies. Furthermore, strategy types for a given barrier could be predicted with >= 72% accuracy using only four metrics. This suggests that optimization results can be simplified into general standards to support adoption of sustainable basin connectivity criteria strategies. Our framework provides a flexible and open-access approach to conduct relatively complex optimization modeling for stream barrier prioritization, while examining potential for agreement among divergence conservation objectives.

AB Octopuses are active predators that feed on a wide range of prey including crustaceans, fishes, and mollusks. They are important components of coral reef systems and support local and artisanal fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Octopus insularis has been found to be one of the most relevant components in catches from the coral reef system of Veracruz in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, and its role in the ecosystem requires assessment. To corroborate the morphological identification of O. insularis, six octopuses were identified by genetic methods. And to understand the trophic relationships between this octopus species and its prey, 394 octopuses caught during 2016 and 2017 by an artisanal fleet were sampled and their stomach contents analyzed. Results showed that crustaceans are the most frequently consumed group, with the genera Mithraculus and Etisus being the most important in the diet. Fishes, bivalves, and gastropods were identified as uncommon prey items in the diet. Their presence in the stomachs could be related to the movement of this octopus outside of the coral reef. Considering that our samples were of medium- and large-sized individuals, cannibalism could be discarded for O. insularis in this size range in the Veracruz reef system. These findings suggest a generalist and opportunistic predation of O. insularis on the most abundant and available prey in the study area, namely the crustaceans. These represents an effective transfer of biomass from the low trophic levels to top predators in the coral reef system.

AB The conspecific negative density dependence hypothesis states that mortality of young trees (seedlings and saplings) is higher near conspecific adults due to mechanisms such as allelopathy, intraspecific competition, and pest facilitation, explaining why in the tropics, most of plant species tend to be rare and live dispersed. However, there are some tree species that defy this expectation and grow in large clusters of conspecific juveniles and adults. We hypothesize that conspecifics living in clusters show higher and/or more variable defensive profiles than conspecifics with dispersed distributions. We evaluated our hypothesis by assessing the expression of physical leaf traits (thickness, and the resistance to punch, tear and shear) and leaf chemical defenses for six clustered and six non-clustered tree species in Yasuni National Park, Ecuadorian Amazon. We ask ourselves whether (a) clustered species have leaves with higher physical resistance to damage and more chemical defenses variability than non-clustered species; (b) saplings of clustered species may show higher physical resistance to damage and higher variation on chemical leaf defenses than their conspecific adults, and (c) saplings of non-clustered species show lower resistance to physical damage and lower variation in chemical defenses compared to conspecific adults. Overall, our study did not support any of our hypotheses. Remarkably, we found that soluble metabolites were significantly species-specific. Our study suggests that plants physical but not chemical leaf antiherbivore defenses may be a crucial strategy for explaining survivorship of clustered species. Trees in Yasuni may also fall along a suite of tolerance/escape/defense strategies based on limitations of each species physiological constraints for survival and establishment. We conclude that other mechanisms, such as those related to indirect defenses, soil nutrient exploitation efficiency, volatile organic compounds, delayed leaf-greening, and seed dispersal mechanisms, shall be evaluated to understand conspecific coexistence in this forest.

AB Due to significant decreases in precipitation in northern China, knowledge of the response of seed germination and plant growth characteristics to key limiting factors is essential for vegetation restoration. We examined seed germination under different temperatures and water potentials, and we examined seedling growth under different amounts of water supply. Experiments were carried out in automatic temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled growth chambers. Under low water potentials, the final germination percentages of four herbaceous species were high, while seed germination of the shrub species Caragana microphylla was significantly inhibited. Under the different water supply amounts, seedlings of Agropyron cristatum allocated more biomass to the root and had a higher growth rate than those of Elymus dahuricus and C.microphylla. In light of these results and drier environmental conditions (annual mean precipitation is 366mm, which falling mainly between June and August), potential selections for revegetation of different landscapes include the following: A.cristatum for shifting sand dunes, the establishment of the pioneer species Agriophyllum squarrosum, C.microphylla for semifixed sand dunes, E.dahuricus for fixed sand dunes, and Melilotus suaveolens and Medicago sativa for cultivation.

AB The boreal forest in Canada comprises a wide variety of ecosystems, including stabilized (overgrown) sand dunes, often referred to as sand hills. Globally, sandy soils are known for supporting a high diversity of invertebrates, including ants, but little is known for boreal systems. We used pitfall trap sampling in sand hill, aspen parkland and peatland ecosystems to compare their ant diversity and test the prediction that areas with sandy soils have higher invertebrate diversity compared to more mesic/organic soils. Overall, sand hills had 45% more ant species compared to other sampled ecosystems from Alberta. Similar to other studies, local canopy cover within sand hills was found to be inversely related to ant species richness and diversity. Although sand hills are rare across the region, they are high biodiversity areas for ants, with the sand hills of north-central Alberta having higher species richness of ants compared to other studied areas in Canada.

AB Climatic factors, such as temperature variation, interfere with the survival of insects. To respond to these variations, insects have some specific characteristics. These include water content of the body, thickness of the lipid layer, as well as the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of cuticular chemical components. This study hypothesizes that different ant species respond to temperature changes in different ways and that such differences may be associated with cuticle hydrocarbons (CHCs) and fatty acids. As model ant species, Atta sexdens, Odontomachus bauri and Ectatomma brunneum were used for experimental analyses. Ants were submitted to a water bath for 5 h at different temperatures, and their CHCs and fatty acids were identified and quantified, followed by correlating these chemical compounds with temperature variations and the survival. Temperatures below 30 degrees C did not affect the survival of the three species. E. brunneum had a higher percentage of survival at temperatures above 30 degrees C. O. bauri was .the most sensitive species with 100% mortality at 40 degrees C. Survival was found to be unrelated to any of the identified fatty acids. However, CHCs underwent significant quantitative and qualitative variation, as shown by an increased percentage of CHCs with longer chain length of linear alkanes at temperatures above 30 degrees C. These increase enables these ants to maintain the integrity of their cuticle and survive at temperatures above 30 degrees C. It can be concluded that the forager ants studied respond differently to temperature variation and that changes in the conformation of CHCs are in line with the ecological characteristics of the different studied species because, they vary in terms of diumal/noctumal foraging and types of environments foraged. Among the three species, E. brunneum foragers were found to be more active under adverse conditions and more tolerant to temperature variation with the correspondingly appropriate changes in CHCs composition.

AB In southern Europe, an intensive agricultural abandonment occurs for more than a century. This change in land use concerns both farming and breeding and induces a large-scale expansion of forest habitats. In the Mediterranean region, which is a centre of endemism and species richness for many groups, a large amount of biodiversity is related to ancient agricultural practices. This current abandonment could consequently induce a drastic flora and fauna impoverishment. This study attempts to identify the consequences of the widespread Mediterranean forest expansion on dung beetle assemblages. Dung beetle assemblages were monitored monthly with dung-baited pitfall trapping in four Mediterranean sites from 250 to 2030m in elevation. At each site, different grazed habitats (grassland, forest and shrubland or wooded grassland) were sampled during the most seasonally active period. In total, 61,645 specimens consisting of 70 species, namely 65 Scarabaeidae (42 Aphodiinae, 23 Scarabaeinae) and 5 Geotrupidae. Sixty-four out of the 70 sampled species (91.43%) were widely distributed in the Palaearctic region. A drastic loss in species richness consecutive to the replacement of grassland by forest was observed all along the elevation gradient: 63 species recorded in grassland habitat versus 60 and 45 species in shrubland and forest, respectively. There was often a loss in species richness according to elevation: 45 versus 30 species in low and high elevation, respectively. For Aphodiinae, the extension of forest also induced a shift in distribution across elevation. This important biodiversity loss that is mainly concerned with lowland thermophilous species was accompanied by crucial changes in the structure of assemblages. The measurement of alpha and beta-diversity in different habitats as well as between habitats across an elevation gradient is essential to our understanding of which habitats are required to best conserve biodiversity. Alpha diversity decreased from grassland to shrubland to forest. Intra-habitat alpha and beta-diversity decreased with elevation. Whereas, inter-habitat beta-diversity (spatial turnover) increased from grassland to shrubland and then to forest regardless of elevation. The contrarily, intra-site beta-diversity increased with elevation. Thus, at the regional scale, the spatial turnover decreased with elevation and increased with the vegetation cover. So, the composition and structure of dung beetle assemblages were affected by vegetation cover, which causes a decreasing abundance and species richness and could result in a drastic loss of dung beetles biodiversity in southern Europe.

AB Invasive pant species (invaders hereafter) have notable effects on the structure and functions of native ecosystems. Plant functional diversity plays a more important role than plant taxonomic diversity in driving ecosystem processes. Moreover, landscape heterogeneity in urban ecosystems may lead to a significant variation in the invasion process. Thus, it is important to evaluate the effects of invaders invasion on the taxonomic and functional diversity of native communities across different types of urban ecosystems to better understand the mechanism underlying successful invasion, especially in heterogeneous landscapes in urban ecosystems. This study aims to determine the effects of an invader Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.) on the taxonomic and functional diversity of native communities by using a comparative study in nine types of urban ecosystems in East China. Canada goldenrod and coexisting natives tend to functionally converge in all urban ecosystem types. Thus, differences in the functional traits between Canada goldenrod and coexisting natives support the habitat filtering hypothesis. Canada goldenrod invasion did not significantly affect the taxonomic diversity of plant communities. Most of the functional diversity indices of plant communities significantly increased under Canada goldenrod invasion. The increased values of some functional diversity of plant communities under Canada goldenrod invasion may cause an promotion in the utilization of resources at the interspecific degree rely largely on the niche complementarity effects. The relative abundance of Canada goldenrod was positively correlated with various indexes of functional diversity of plant communities (including some of community-weighted means, Rao's quadratic entropy, and Mason alpha functional diversity), rather than taxonomic diversity of plant communities. Thus, the invasibility of plant community may be more closely associated with functional diversity than taxonomic diversity of plant communities. Specifically, the invasibility of plant community from the invaded area reached a maximum in traffic land among the nine types of urban ecosystems because of it's higher plant functional diversity. The higher plant functional diversity is supported by a highly heterogeneous landscape structure and creates a great variety of ecological conditions for plants mainly caused by anthropogenic land use. Overall, landscape heterogeneity in urban ecosystems can obviously increase the invasion degree of invaders via shifts in the functional diversity of plant communities.

AB Ants are known to have various feeding habits and play important roles in many terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about how the feeding habits of each ant species are affected by the environmental changes associated with forest succession. In this study, we examined how feeding habits as well as the species composition and food preference of ants would respond to 105-year-old natural secondary succession of a cool-temperate forest. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes and radiocarbon were used to infer the feeding habits. The species richness was not affected by forest stand age. Redundancy analysis indicated that stand age, litter N concentration, and soil microbial respiration had significant relationships with the ant species composition. The bait experiments showed that honey bait became more attractive to ants relative to tuna bait in late succession. This was probably associated with changes in available food resources, such as nectar, during succession. Although the isotopic signatures differed significantly among the sample types (i.e., ant species, canopy leaves, and leaf litter), they were not significantly affected by forest stand age or by the interaction between sample types and stand age. This indicates that the ants showed consistent differences in feeding habits among the species during succession. Our results suggest that despite great changes in vegetation, each ant species would maintain functional roles in C and N flows during forest succession.

AB The coexistence of several species involves a complex mix of positive and negative interactions that can be represented as networks. As much as other ecological features, patterns of multispecies co-occurrence are susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance. In ant communities, wildfires may enhance competitive interactions by benefiting active, aggressive species, and by increasing encounter probabilities through decreased space availability. We explored ant co-occurrence patterns by analysing the macro and microscopic structure of their interaction networks in burned and unburned habitats. We built co-occurrence networks using significant aggregations and segregations between species pairs as positive and negative interactions, respectively. We described aggregate network properties and microscopic structural changes by comparing species and interactions turnover between burned and unburned sites. We found no differences in the macroscopic structure of co-occurrence networks between different fire regimes. However, we detected changes in the composition of both species and negative interactions. Interaction turnover between networks of different habitats was mostly explained by rewiring of interactions between shared species rather than by species replacement. Our results reflected changes in ant communities in response to fire although there were no changes in global structural patterns. These changes in species and negative interactions suggest modifications in species roles translated into changes in the spatial distribution of ant species. The analysis of species co-occurrence networks is a useful tool to detect and visualize patterns in ant communities and to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of disturbance on biodiversity.

AB Determining assembly rules of co-occurring species persists as a fundamental goal in community ecology. At local scales, the relative importance of environmental filtering vs. competitive exclusion remains a subject of debate. In this study, we assessed the relative importance of habitat filtering and competition in structuring understory ant communities in tropical forests of French Guiana. Leaf-litter ants were collected using pitfall and Winkler traps across swamp, slope and plateau forests near Saul, French Guiana. We used a combination of univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate trait response of ants to habitat characteristics. Null model analyses were used to investigate the effects of habitat filtering and competitive interactions on community assembly at the scale of assemblages and sampling points, respectively. Swamp forests presented a much lower taxonomic and functional richness compared to slope and plateau forests. Furthermore, marked differences in taxonomic and functional composition were observed between swamp forests and slope or plateau forests. We found weak evidence for competitive exclusion based on null models. Nevertheless, the contrasting trait composition observed between habitats revealed differences in the ecological attributes of the species in the different forest habitats. Our analyses suggest that competitive interactions may not play an important role in structuring leaf-litter ant assemblages locally. Rather, habitats are responsible for driving both taxonomic and functional composition of ant communities.

AB Japanese stinging nettles, Urtica thunbergiana, in Nara Park (660ha), central Japan, where several hundred sika deer Cervus nippon have been protected for 1200years, bear quite dense stinging hairs on leaves and stems compared to those in surrounding areas where the deer density is very low. Our previous studies have suggested that nettles in the park have evolved such a trait as a constitutive resistance against sika deer through natural selection. Here, we explored differences in plant architecture, flowering phenology, resource allocation pattern and sexual expression between a heavily haired and a lightly haired population with relationship to defence against sika deer. We raised seedlings from the two populations in a greenhouse and monitored relevant traits for three successive years. Individuals from the heavily haired population had earlier flowering, longer flowering period and lower growth rate than those from the lightly haired population. The former allocated more resources to inflorescences and leaves but less to stems and rhizomes than the latter. Most individuals from the heavily haired population were monoecious irrespective of age, while in the lightly haired population the proportion of females increased with age. These results indicate that the historically browsed population has evolved constitutive tolerance conferred by early and prolonged reproduction and that a resource allocation trade-off exists between defence and growth. Consequently, this study suggests that sika deer have exerted selection on U. thunbergiana for changes not only in defensive traits but also in resource allocation pattern and sexual expression.

AB Due to habitat fragmentation, the loss of species diversity has been extensively studied. On the contrary, the effects of habitat fragmentation on functional diversity is still poorly understood. In the Thousand Island Lake, we conducted studies of insect functional diversity on a set of 29 isolated islands. We used 10 functional diversity indices from three aspects (functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence) to respectively describe functional diversity of insects on sample islands. We found the following results: (i) The functional indices selected could reflect the functional diversity of sample islands and it is further proved that in general, three components of functional diversity were independent of each other; (ii) Sample islands could be divided into two categories, island JSD and the remaining islands; (iii) Functional richness increased with island area and shape index, but had no significant correlation with isolation. Likewise, both functional evenness and functional divergence had no significant correlation with island attributes. The conclusion to emphasize from our research is that: (i) habitat fragmentation reduced the biological functional diversity to some extent, further demonstrating the importance of habitat continuity in biodiversity protection; and (ii) for functional diversity protection of insects in a fragmented landscape, an island which has high approximate shape index values of at least hundred hectare magnitude order has a critical promoting effect.

AB In Tenerife (Canary Islands), the laurel forest is considered one of the most biodiverse ecosystems of the archipelago. This study aims at providing useful information about tree species strategies and their natural dynamics in order to improve understanding of the functioning of this ecosystem. The knowledge gained would be of great importance for laurel forest conservation, not only in the Canaries, but also in Madeira and the Azores. Our main research question is: Are the ecological groups of laurel forest tree species, described in earlier studies based exclusively on regeneration strategies, consistent with species functional traits, growth patterns and spatial distributions?' We used data from six 50x50m permanent plots established in 1999 and re-measured in 2015, combined with information on twelve functional traits from newly produced data or extracted from previous studies. For each species, we analyzed the abundance of seedlings/suckers, saplings and adults inside the permanent plots. Two ordination methods were used to assess multivariate differences in functional traits between species. Different mixed-effect models were tested to investigate effects of sites, individual tree size and competition on tree growth rates. Finally we analyzed the spatial distribution of both saplings and adults and their interaction within the six permanent plots. Our results were consistent with a classification of species into different ecological groups based on (1) their shade tolerance: light-demanding versus shade-tolerant species and (2) their reproductive strategies: sexual (i.e., seedlings), asexual (i.e., suckers) or both. These differences between light-demanding versus shade-tolerant and/or seedling-producing species versus sucker-producing species were consistently observed across the species functional traits, growth patterns and spatial distributions. Only one species, Viburnum rigidum Vent., presented singularities compared with its previously established group. Because V. rigidum is mostly an understory species, we proposed to add a third aspect to the classification scheme: understory versus canopy species. This led to a total of six ecological groups within fourteen laurel forest tree species. Finally, this study also showed that the Tenerife laurel forest is still maturing and becoming richer in species, which outlines the importance of its preservation.

AB A primary challenge for modern phylogeography is understanding how ecology and geography, both contemporary and historical, shape the spatial distribution and evolutionary histories of species. Phylogeographic patterns are the result of many factors, including geology, climate, habitat, colonization history and lineage-specific constraints. Assessing the relative influences of these factors is difficult because few species, regions and environments are sampled in enough detail to compare competing hypotheses rigorously and because a particular phylogeographic pattern can potentially result from different evolutionary scenarios. The silky anoles (Anolis sericeus complex) of Central America and Mexico are abundant and found in all types of lowland terrestrial habitat, offering an excellent opportunity to test the relative influences of the factors affecting diversification. Here, we performed a range-wide statistical phylogeographic analysis on restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) markers from silky anoles and compared the phylogeographic patterns we recovered to historical and contemporary environmental and topographic data. We constructed niche models to compare niche overlap between sister lineages and conducted coalescent simulations to characterize how the major lineages of silky anoles have diverged. Our results revealed that the mode of divergence for major lineage diversification events was geographic isolation, resulting in ecological divergence between lineages, followed by secondary contact. Moreover, comparisons of parapatric sister lineages suggest that ecological niche divergence contributed to isolation by environment in this system, reflecting the natural history differences among populations in divergent environments.

AB Spatial consideration of costs and benefits plays a critical role in assessing the effectiveness of payments for ecosystem services (PES). While spatial assessment has received much attention, few, if any, studies have explicitly considered spatial variations in the benefits and landowners' opportunity costs of competing land uses as targeting criteria for PES. The objective of our research is to identify different spatial targets for PES based on spatial variations in ecosystem benefits and opportunity costs for competing land uses. As a case study, we use incentive payments for forest carbon storage in the Central and Southern Appalachian Regions of the eastern United States. We find, on average, supplying forest carbon storage by converting pasture to forest is approximately five times more cost effective than mitigating deforestation for urban use because of its lower opportunity cost and its higher per hectare gain in carbon storage. We also find that the targeted areas that have positive net social benefits in supplying forest carbon represent 9.32% of the case-study region's pasture land, while zero pixels are identified with positive net social benefits when urban use is the competing land use. These findings imply that the spatial targeting of the region's areas that have positive net social benefits should focus on afforesting pasture instead of preventing forestland from being converted to urban use. The results also help target cost-effective areas for afforestation of pasture for carbon storage.

AB Over the past 50years, Costa Rica has experienced extensive landscape changes. It is, therefore, important to understand the historical changes that have occurred and how the forests will change in the future, which provides the objective of this study. To determine the historical deforestation trends and link them to the different biogeophysical and socioeconomic variables, forest maps from 1960 to 2013 were used in the Dinamica Environment for Geoprocessing Objects (Dinamica EGO) to create deforestation models for Costa Rica. The base model was built and analyzed for changes in landscape metrics such as patch size and distance between 1960 and 2013. After validation of the model's ability to replicate patterns, the landscape change was then projected to 2069. The historical model validated at 85% accuracy within 600m for both the 2005-2013 and 1997-2005 iterations. All national future projections exhibited an increase in forest area, including the most extreme deforestation scenarios. Future projections are increasingly important given changes in the global socio-political structure, climatic change, and the ever-increasing globalization of capitalistic endeavors. The trajectory of the forest in Costa Rica can also serve as a way to track both these global pressures on the natural landscape, and as a proxy for how to manage deforestation in other similar political and geographic areas of the tropics.

AB Aim We assess the spatial distribution of a suite of coastal biophysical characteristics and how their variability is related to the distribution and geographic range of a diverse assemblage of coastal benthic species with different larval dispersal strategies. Location South-eastern Pacific (SEP) coast between 18 degrees 20 ' S and 42 degrees 35 ' S. Methods Biophysical variability was assessed using chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature and the signal of turbid river plumes derived from MODIS onboard the Aqua satellite. We established the dominant spatial components using wavelet and coherence analysis, and evaluated the biogeographic structure of 51 rocky intertidal species sampled over similar to 2,600 km along the SEP using multivariate classification and regression trees. Results Biogeographic breaks detected here were consistent with recent biogeographic classification schemes. Distribution breakpoints for species with lecithotrophic larvae clustered around 30 degrees S. We observed a previously unreported break in the distribution of species with planktotrophic larval dispersal strategies around 35 degrees S. These breaks are related to coherence in the spatial structure of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and river outflow over different temporal scales. Regions with similar biophysical characteristics, and the breaks the separate them, are in striking agreement with the biogeographic patterns revealed by the multivariate classification trees. Main conclusions Our results reconcile patterns of biogeographic structure reported for other groups of species along the SEP coast. We suggest that river outflow, a poorly studied coastal environmental forcing, may play an important role in determining the geographic distribution of rocky shore species, probably through its effects on larval dispersal patterns.

AB Biological capacity of earth is limited. While it is obvious at first glance, it has been ignored for decades. Policy makers attempt to overcome the persistent depletion of the human livelihood base through the establishment of protected areas. However, the financial means to sustainably manage a representative network of protected areas on a global scale do not yet exist, and particularly, private sector investment is extremely modest. One option for increasing private investment flows is the development of a market place for protected area certificates (PACs) issued for geographical areas managed according to social and environmental best practices. This paper utilizes semi-structured expert interviews with 39 German companies to analyze major product and market requirements for the sound implementation of an international certification scheme for PACs. Based on a triangulation approach that combines quantitative and qualitative evaluations with the two-step clustering procedure for strategic investor groups, seven design principles are determined that might encourage voluntary investment funds from the private sector, and thus support the sustainable management of protected areas. Having a look at existing markets for protected areas, one scheme provides a good foundation for the defined design principles: the LifeWeb initiativean online clearing house for protected area developers and potential investors.

AB In 2010, the Vietnamese government implemented a national payment for ecosystem services (PES) policy. In promoting the policy, the government has conveyed PES as a successful policy that has achieved multiple objectives, including forest protection and poverty alleviation. Contrary to these claims, however, critical studies of PES in Vietnam have found a weak relationship between PES and forest protection, the continuing dominance, rather than retreat, of the state in forest management, and no clear evidence that PES assists the poor in the near universal manner purported. Using a discourse analysis approach, this paper examines why and how PES policy was formulated and implemented in Vietnam. We explore the influence of key networked individuals involved in the production and negotiation of PES policy, as well as the socio-political and institutional context that influences PES policy design and implementation. The paper details how social relationships between state officials, donors and technical experts were built and mobilized through the process of PES policy design and implementation to achieve specific state objectives. In this context, we argue that government discourse on the 'success' of PES has served as an effective vehicle to deflect attention from the weakness of the forestry sector, to generate new funding for the sector's survival in the face of enduring budget shortages, and to expand state power in relation to forest resources. The 'success' of PES helps sustain the poor management and corrupt practices of state forest entities and eliminates villagers' opportunities to benefit from the forest, hence sustaining poverty in the uplands.

AB Crop wild relatives (CWR) are a globally threatened group of plants, harbouring valuable genes that are sometimes used to enhance commercial crop varieties and landraces. A lack of recognition in national planning for biodiversity conservation has resulted in inadequate CWR conservation strategies, particularly in situ. There is little information on in situ conservation costs, and this paper uses a payment for agrobiodiversity conservation services (PACS) approach to estimate the in situ costs of conserving CWR in Zambia, where 30 CWR have been prioritised for conservation (of which nine are present in our sample). Competitive tender bid offers were elicited from farmers willing to accept compensation for providing a CWR conservation service. Using data from 26 communities we determined the on-farm cost of conserving CWR, specifically in field margins/borders. Heterogeneity was evident in farmer bid offers, suggesting discriminatory price mechanisms can potentially deliver cost savings over uniform payment rules. Selection of bid offers under four different conservation goals using a binary linear programming (BLP) model reveals conservation costs ranging from US$ 23 to 91/ha per year. An untargeted area goal provided a least-cost procurement of conservation services ($ 2.3 k per year), followed by a targeted area goal ($ 5.9 k per year). The cost of selecting conservation sites increased when other constraints were added to the BLP model, including those concerning social equity ($ 6.4 k per year), and diversity ($ 9.2 k per year) goals. Overall, the findings suggest the use of competitive tenders, coupled with CWR data and BLP modelling, can potentially add much to improve the efficiency of in situ CWR conservation.

AB The spatial distribution of the near-surface air temperature over a coastal mountain range in southern Chile [Nahuelbuta Mountains (NM), 38 degrees S, maximum height 1300-m ASL] is investigated using in situ measurements, satellite-derived land-surface temperature, and simulations during the austral winter of 2011. Based on a few selected but representative cases, we found that under rainy conditionseither at day or nighttemperature decreases with height close to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (similar to 6.5 degrees C/km). Likewise, the temperature tends to follow the dry adiabat (similar to 9.8 degrees C/km) during daytime under dry- and clear-skies conditions. During clear-skies nights, the temperature also decreases with height over the southeastern side of NM, but it often increases (at about 8 degrees C/km) over the northwestern side of the mountains. This temperature inversion extends up to about 700-m ASL leading to an average temperature contrast of about 7 degrees C between the northwestern and southeastern sides of Nahuelbuta by the end of dry nights. These dawns also feature substantial temperature differences (>10 degrees C) among closely located stations at a same altitude. High-resolution numerical simulations suggest that upstream blocking of the prevailing SE flow, hydrostatic mountain waves, and strong downslope winds is responsible for such distinctive nocturnal temperature distribution.

AB The Last Interglacial (c. 128,000 to 115,000 years ago) was the last time when global temperatures may have been higher than those of the Holocene, but little is known about vegetation change or paleoclimate during that period in Central America. A new fossil pollen record from the lowland setting of El Valle, Panama, spanned the period from 137,000 to 98,000 years ago. We used multivariate analysis of modern and fossil pollen samples to provide the first regional quantification of Last Interglacial temperature and precipitation change and found mean annual temperatures were c. 1-2 degrees C warmer than modern, while precipitation was mostly similar to modern. The montane genus Quercus was intermittently present throughout the interglacial period, leading to the inference that this dispersal-limited taxon was surviving in microrefugia. Both charcoal and the early successional genus Cecropia were noticeably rare in the last interglacial compared with the Holocene. The modern absence of Quercus from Central Panama does not appear to be the product of interglacial warming, but rather a result of dry conditions in the late Holocene and human activity. It is suggested that humans greatly increased fire frequency, thereby favoring Cecropia and eliminating Quercus from the lower portion of its elevational range. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Our aim was to assess the effect of environmental factors on short temporal abundance variations of the two most abundant native rodents of agricultural agroecosystems, Akodon azarae and Calomys laucha. We conducted a 3-year longitudinal sampling of rodents, and recorded meteorological data such as temperature and precipitation, predation rate by Leopardus geoffroyi, Tyto furcata and Athene cunicularia, vegetation cover and height, characteristics of cropfields and their borders. The effect of these factors on rodent abundance was evaluated through generalized linear mixed models. Abundance variations of both rodent species were explained by characteristics of both cropfields and their borders. At the studied temporal scale, meteorological variables did not have a direct effect on abundance variations, but probably influenced through vegetation characteristics and were expressed in seasonal variations. For A. azarae there was also an effect of predation by L. geoffroyi (positive) and T. furcata (negative), while predation by A. cunicularia did not contribute to explain abundance variations of any species.

AB Payments for hydrological services (PHS) programs are expected to confer tangible benefits to households. Impact evaluations of PHS programs, however, find few to no changes in material indicators. One reason for this may be that non-financial motivations and benefits-including environmental or social-influence participation and are important outcomes for households participating in PHS programs. In this paper we test this hypothesis using 56 interviews and 181 surveys from households in Veracruz State, Mexico. Using logistic regression models we find that human, natural, physical and financial capital are important to the decision to participate in PHS, but so are pro-social and pro-environmental motivations. Using counterfactual impact evaluation methods we find few changes in material benefits but do find that PHS participants are more likely to report positive changes in their household and community quality of life over the last five years compared to households not participating in PHS programs. Qualitative information supports these findings. Our results contribute to the evolving theory on PHS that participation is driven by a mix of financial and non-financial motivations and that nonmaterial benefits are an important outcome of these programs.

AB The current state of knowledge of the suprageneric relationships in Cholevinae is either derived from informal evaluations of putative synapomorphies or based on molecular studies with limited taxonomic sampling. Here we assessed the higher-level relationships in this subfamily based on a phylogenetic analysis of 97 morphological characters scored for 93 terminals, representing all tribes. Both parsimony and Bayesian analyses were used. The monophyletic origin of Cholevinae was corroborated, except for the unexpected inclusion of Leptinus in the implied weighting analysis. Eucatopini + Oritocatopini were retrieved as basal branches in the evolution of Cholevinae. The monophyletic origin of all remaining Cholevinae was confirmed, which is consistent with molecular evidence. Anemadini was non-monophyletic, in accordance with earlier hypotheses. Cholevini was rendered non-monophyletic by the uncertain inclusion of Prionochaeta and the consistent exclusion of Cholevinus. A close affinity of Ptomaphagini to Sciaphyini and Leptodirini was suggested, although the position of Sciaphyes remains uncertain. The phylogenetic hypothesis of Cholevinae provided here is the most comprehensive presently available. The list of characters shows that a substantial part of the data was obtained from the ventral side. This is a strong argument for a detailed pictorial documentation of the ventral body parts in taxonomic descriptions, in contrast to the common practice of only illustrating the dorsal habitus of the beetles.

AB Despite calls for greater use of randomized control trials (RCTs) to evaluate the impact of conservation interventions; such experimental evaluations remain extremely rare. Payments for environmental services (PES) are widely used to slow tropical deforestation but there is widespread recognition of the need for better evidence of effectiveness. A Bolivian nongovernmental organization took the unusual step of randomizing the communities where its conservation incentive program (Watershared) was offered. We explore the impact of the program on deforestation over 5 years by applying generalized additive models to Global Forest Change (GFC) data. The "intention-to-treat" model (where units are analyzed as randomized regardless of whether the intervention was delivered as planned) shows no effect; deforestation did not differ between the control and treatment communities. However, uptake of the intervention varied across communities so we also explored whether higher uptake might reduce deforestation. We found evidence of a small effect at high uptake but the result should be treated with caution. RCTs will not always be appropriate for evaluating conservation interventions due to ethical and practical considerations. Despite these challenges, randomization can improve causal inference and deserves more attention from those interested in improving the evidence base for conservation.

AB Our understanding and quantification of global soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and the underlying processes remain largely uncertain. Here, we assessed the effects of multiple anthropogenic and natural factors, including nitrogen fertilizer (N) application, atmospheric N deposition, manure N application, land cover change, climate change, and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, on global soil N2O emissions for the period 1861-2016 using a standard simulation protocol with seven process-based terrestrial biosphere models. Results suggest global soil N2O emissions have increased from 6.3 +/- 1.1 Tg N2O-N/year in the preindustrial period (the 1860s) to 10.0 +/- 2.0 Tg N2O-N/year in the recent decade (2007-2016). Cropland soil emissions increased from 0.3 Tg N2O-N/year to 3.3 Tg N2O-N/year over the same period, accounting for 82% of the total increase. Regionally, China, South Asia, and Southeast Asia underwent rapid increases in cropland N2O emissions since the 1970s. However, US cropland N2O emissions had been relatively flat in magnitude since the 1980s, and EU cropland N2O emissions appear to have decreased by 14%. Soil N2O emissions from predominantly natural ecosystems accounted for 67% of the global soil emissions in the recent decade but showed only a relatively small increase of 0.7 +/- 0.5 Tg N2O-N/year (11%) since the 1860s. In the recent decade, N fertilizer application, N deposition, manure N application, and climate change contributed 54%, 26%, 15%, and 24%, respectively, to the total increase. Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration reduced soil N2O emissions by 10% through the enhanced plant N uptake, while land cover change played a minor role. Our estimation here does not account for indirect emissions from soils and the directed emissions from excreta of grazing livestock. To address uncertainties in estimating regional and global soil N2O emissions, this study recommends several critical strategies for improving the process-based simulations.

AB An acute imbalance between human population and food production is projected, partially due to increasing resource scarcity; dietary shifts and the current course of technology alone will not soon solve the problem. Natural ecosystems, typically characterized by high species richness and perennial growth habit, have solved many of the resource-acquisition problems faced by crops, making nature a likely source of insights for potential application in commercial agriculture. Further research on undomesticated plants and natural ecosystems, and the adaptations that enable them to meet their needs for N, P, and water, could change the face of commercial food production, including on marginal lands.

AB Multiple sources of evidence suggest an increasing frequency of extreme climatic events during the past century. In Bangladesh, a country strongly influenced by the South Asian monsoon climate, the years 1999 and 2006 were the most severe droughts among the ten drought events identified over the last four decades. We investigated the impact of these two drought events on radial growth and xylem anatomical features of the brevi-deciduous tree species Chukrasia tabularis in a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh. Tree radial growth declined by 54% during the 1999 and 48.7% during the 2006 droughts, respectively. Among the wood anatomical features, the number of vessels (NV) showed the highest sensitivity to drought, with a 45% decrease in the 1999 drought year, followed by total vessel area (TVA) and mean vessel area (MVA). On the other hand, Vessel density (VD) increased by 13% during the 1999 drought but the increase in VD was very low in the drought year 2006. The decreasing vessel area and increasing vessel density indicate xylem hydraulic adaptation of C. tabularis to minimize drought induced cavitation risk and to avoid hydraulic failure. The significant correlations between the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and time series of tree-ring width and vessel variables imply that decline in radial growth and changes in vessel features in C. tabularis are likely to be caused by drought induced water stress. Our analyses suggest that radial growth and wood anatomical features of C. tabularis are highly sensitive to extreme drought events in South Asian moist tropical forests and can be used to reconstruct past droughts and to model tree response to drought stress under future climate conditions.

AB Dendrochronology is a valuable tool to understanding climate-growth and growth-age relationships of native tree species from tropical forests. The information obtained from growth rings can elucidate climate responses of tree-growth under the ongoing environmental changes and support the development of sustainable forest management strategies based on species and site conditions. The Cerrado, which is a vast tropical savannah ecoregion of Brazil, has precipitation seasonally capable of inducing the formation of annual tree rings in moisture sensitive woody species. Hymenaea stigonocarpa is the typical tree species in the Cerrado with proven annual tree rings. It is an important commercial species that has been massively exploited for timber causing the considerable reduction of its natural populations. This study provides information about tree age and growth trajectories as well as climatic-growth signals of H. stigonocarpa in southeastern Brazil. We sampled 13 trees for tree-ring analysis. Tree-ring measurement and analysis were conducted using standard dendrochronological techniques. Sampled trees revealed the young successional stage of the stand, with ages varying from 20 to 35 years old. Nine out of 13 trees were used to build the standard chronology (1981 to 2013) that was positively correlated with precipitation at the end of the growing season (March-April). The chronology was able to capture SST anomalies patterns related to the South American Monsoon System. Growth modeling indicated that minimum logging diameter of 10.4cm is achieved at 24 years of age. The results reported here add valuable contribution to the discussion of sustainable management strategies for Cerrado ecoregion species.

AB Agricultural intensification is one of the major drivers behind biodiversity loss in Mediterranean agroecosystems. The intensification of olive groves as monoculture in large areas of the southern Spain has had important effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In the present study, we explore the olive grove soil management practices effects on taxonomic and functional diversity of ants along a gradient of soil management intensity. We predict that both species richness and functional diversity decrease with an increasing intensification of olive grove soil management. We used pitfall traps to sample ants in 24 olive groves subject to different soil management regimes in southern Spain, and then compared ant species richness and functional diversity (FD). Nonploughed organic farms showed higher species richness. Ploughing was observed to be the soil management practice with the greatest negative effect on ant species richness. Three functional traits significantly responded to soil management intensity, with tibia length and head width showing a higher FD in organic farms and diet showing a lower FD in ploughed farms. The results of the present study highlight the negative effects of olive grove ploughing on ant biodiversity and provide novel evidence of the nonploughing organic farming role with respect to maintaining higher levels of ant functional diversity.

AB In the Southwestern Brazilian Amazon, the Brazil nut tree Bertholletia excelsa is the most conspicuous remnant element of original forest ecosystems in human-modified landscapes. They often exist in pastures that have very different environmental characteristics than forests. In our study, we surveyed the ant fauna of Brazil nut trees in forest and pasture habitats in the Southwestern Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (i) How do arboreal ant assemblages of Brazil nut tree crowns change based on habitat type? (ii) What is the contribution of forest ant species from Brazil nut tree crowns to ant assemblages in pasture Brazil nut tree crowns? (iii) What features of pasture Brazil nut trees lead to a greater number of arboreal ant species? We selected 20 trees in each habitat type (forest and pasture) and collected ant samples both at the soil surface and at tree crowns, sampling a total of 184 ant species. Species composition was primarily determined by sampling layer. We found that the number of ant species was 63% lower in pasture than in forest tree crowns. The dissimilarity between the ant assemblages of tree crown and soil surface remained almost the same in both habitats. There was relatively little overlap in species composition in the forest tree crowns versus the pasture tree crowns, with species replacement component highly contributing to the differences. We conclude that scattered Brazil nut trees plays limited role on the conservation of its associated biodiversity in human-modified landscapes such as pastures.

AB 1. Ants are widely regarded as 'ecosystem engineers' because their nest construction and contributions to nutrient cycling change the biological, chemical, and physical properties of the soil around their nests. Despite increasing attention to ant manipulation of soil ecosystems, the extent to which many common species influence soil properties, as well as nutrient uptake and community composition of plants near nests, is still unknown. 2. This study tested hypotheses that activities of a common subalpine ant, Formica podzolica, alter soil moisture and pH, redistribute nitrogen around nests, and affect plant species abundance and ground cover. 3. A combination of field sampling techniques showed that distance from a nest had a positive relationship with soil moisture and a negative relationship with plant abundance next to and downhill from nests. Slope aspect also affected plant communities, with downhill transects having higher plant cover and above-ground biomass than uphill transects. A stable isotope analysis did not reveal that plants near nests had enriched N-15, but there were substantial differences in N-15 among sites. 4. Overall, this study uncovers significant impacts of F. podzolica on the subalpine microhabitats directly surrounding their nests.

AB In a fragmented landscape, transitional zones between neighboring habitats are common, and our understanding of community organizational forces across such habitats is important. Edge studies are numerous, but the majority of them utilize information on species richness and abundance. Abundance and taxonomic diversity, however, provide little information on the functioning and phylogeny of the co-existing species. Combining the evaluation of their functional and phylogenetic relationships, we aimed to assess whether ground beetle assemblages are deterministically or stochastically structured along grassland-forest gradients. Our results showed different community assembly rules on opposite sides of the forest edge. In the grassland, co-occurring species were functionally and phylogenetically not different from the random null model, indicating a random assembly process. Contrary to this, at the forest edge and the interior, co-occurring species showed functional and phylogenetic clustering, thus environmental filtering was the likely process structuring carabid assemblages. Community assembly in the grassland was considerably affected by asymmetrical species flows (spillover) across the forest edge: more forest species penetrated into the grassland than open-habitat and generalist species entered into the forest. This asymmetrical species flow underlines the importance of the filter function of forest edges. As unfavorable, human-induced changes to the structure, composition and characteristics of forest edges may alter their filter function, edges have to be specifically considered during conservation management.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate impacts of Amazon Forest (AF) fire and conversion to pasture on carbon accumulation in particle size fractions and organic matter (OM) composition of an Acrisol. Soil samples were collected (0.00-2.00 m depth) in three sites: native AF (NAF); AF under natural regeneration for two years after burning (BAF); 23-years old Brachiaria pasture after AF burning (BRA). Assuming NAF area as reference, BAF and BRA areas showed negative carbon balance when carbon emitted to the atmosphere at AF burning is taken into account. Soil OM aromaticity and hydrophobicity, assessed via C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, in BRA and BAF were similar to that in NAF. Fire and post-fire land use altered the carbon distribution in sand, silt and clay along the soil profile and seem to have affected organo-mineral and OM self-assemblage interactions, since the relation between total soil carbon and carbon in clay was asymptotic in BAF and linear in NAF and BRA.

AB In the southwestern Tengger desert in northwestern China, nitrate circulation processes in the unsaturated zone and associated driving factors were studied using water chemistry and stable isotope techniques. At unvegetated sand sites, NO3- content increases from the south to north in the desert. Additionally, a negative correlation (R-2 = 0.90, P < 0.005) was evident between the stability of soil NO3- and elevation, suggesting that NO3- storage in soil is significantly influenced by precipitation and temperature. And a significant positive correlation between mNO(2)(-)/Cl- in unsaturated zone and elevation (R-2 = 0.50, P < 0.0001), indicating both nitrification and denitrification are strongly in the south of desert, however, the nitrification plays a dominant role in the north of desert. Isotopic analyses (delta N-15-NO3-, delta O-18-NO3-, and delta O-18-H(2)o, delta H-2-H2O) of soil pore-water showed that the two dominant NO3- sources were the mixing of atmospheric deposition and soil nitrification, and that the NO3- circulation at the vegetated sand sites was affected by vegetation and animals. Additionally, local environmental conditions lead to complex driving factors, such as the abiotic process of ammonia volatilization of NO3- circulation, which resulted in the N-15 enrichment and O-18 depletion of residual nitrate in the unsaturated zone of one of the soil profiles. Denitrification was noted in the deep unsaturated zone of two profiles, indicating that the N loss resulted from abiotic versus biotic processes. Analyses of the stable isotope results and the distribution characteristics of NO3- and Cl- suggests leaching of soil NO3- as a result of NO3- in unsaturated zone poses a potential threat to groundwater quality in Dengmaying region. This study suggests that NO3- circulation in the unsaturated zone responds to climate characteristics in the desert ecosystem, and to provide useful information for the protection of groundwater quality in arid desert regions.

AB Over the last decade there has been a global effort to eco-engineer urban artificial shorelines with the aim of increasing their biodiversity and extending their conservation value. One of the most common and viable eco-engineering approaches on seawalls is to use enhancement features that increase habitat structural complexity, including concrete tiles molded with complex designs and precast "flowerpots" that create artificial rock pools. Increases in species diversity in pits and pools due to microhabitat conditions (water retention, shade, protection from waves, and/or biotic refugia) are often reported, but these results can be confounded by differences in the surface area sampled. In this study, we fabricated three tile types (n = 10): covered tile (grooved tile with a cover to retain water), uncovered tile (same grooved tile but without a cover) and granite control. We tested the effects of these tile types on species richness (S), total individual abundance (N), and community composition. All tiles were installed at 0.5 m above chart datum along seawalls surrounding two island sites (Pulau Hantu and Kusu Island) south of Singapore mainland. The colonizing assemblages were sampled after 8 months. Consistent with previous studies, mean S was significantly greater on covered tiles compared to the uncovered and granite tiles. While it is implied in much of the eco-engineering literature that this pattern results from greater niche availability allotted by microhabitat conditions, we further investigated whether there was an underlying species-individual relationship to determine whether increases in S could have simply resulted from covered tiles supporting greater N (i.e., increasing the probability of detecting more species despite a constant area). The species-individual relationship was positive, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are at play, and that biodiversity enhancements may in some instances operate simply by increasing the abundance of individuals, even when microhabitat availability is unchanged. This finding underscores the importance of testing mechanisms in eco-engineering studies and highlights ongoing mechanistic uncertainties that should be addressed to inform the design of more biodiverse seawalls and urban marine environments.

AB Movement strategies of animals have been well studied as a function of ecological drivers (e.g., forage selection and avoiding predation) rather than physiological requirements (e.g., thermoregulation). Thermal stress is a major concern for large mammals, especially for savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), which have amongst the greatest challenge for heat dissipation in hot and arid environments. Therefore, elephants must make decisions about where and how fast to move to reduce thermal stress. We tracked 14 herds of elephant in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, for 2 years, using GPS collars with inbuilt temperature sensors to examine the influence of temperature on movement strategies, particularly when accessing water. We first confirmed that collar-mounted temperature loggers captured hourly variation in relative ambient temperatures across the landscape, and, thus, could be used to predict elephant movement strategies at fine spatio-temporal scales. We found that elephants moved slower in more densely wooded areas, but, unexpectedly, moved faster at higher temperatures, especially in the wet season compared to the dry season. Notably, this speed of movement was highest when elephants were approaching and leaving water sources. Visits to water showed a periodic shuttling pattern, with a peak return rate of 10-30 h, wherein elephants were closest to water during the hotter times of the day, and spent longer at water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. When elephants left water, they showed low fidelity to the same water source, and traveled farther in the dry season than in the wet season. In KNP, where water is easily accessible, and the risk of poaching is low, we found that elephants use short, high-speed bursts of movement to get to water at hotter times of day. This strategy not only provides the benefit of predation risk avoidance, but also allows them to use water to thermoregulate. We demonstrate that ambient temperature is an important predictor of movement and water use across the landscape, with elephants responding facultatively to a "landscape of thermal stress."

AB Toxicants have both sub-lethal and lethal effects on aquatic biota, influencing organism fitness and community composition. However, toxicant effects within ecosystems may be altered by interactions with abiotic and biotic ecosystem components, including biological interactions. Collectively, this generates the potential for toxicant sensitivity to be highly context dependent, with significantly different outcomes in ecosystems than laboratory toxicity tests predict. We experimentally manipulated stream macroinvertebrate communities in 32 mesocosms to examine how communities from a low-salinity site were influenced by interactions with those from a high-salinity site along a gradient of salinity. Relative to those from the low-salinity site, organisms from the high-salinity site were expected to have greater tolerance and fitness at higher salinities. This created the potential for both salinity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions to influence communities. We found that community composition was influenced by both direct toxicity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions. Taxon and context-dependent responses included: (i) direct toxicity effects, irrespective of biotic interactions; (ii) effects that were owing to the addition of tolerant taxa, irrespective of salinity; (iii) toxicity dependent on sensitive-tolerant taxa interactions; and (iv) toxic effects that were increased by interactions. Our results reinforce that ecological processes require consideration when examining toxicant effects within ecosystems.

AB With forest fragmentation continuing in many parts of the tropics, it is likely that fragmented forests will become the rule for most remaining global tropical forests in the next decades. In this context, there is a need for practical tools to assess and monitor fragmented forests if we are to conserve tree species diversity as much as possible. Several methods, either using (1) field-based or (2) remote-sensing approaches could be used to achieve this goal. This paper aims at providing a state-of-the-art review of both approaches in order to make recommendations for rapid and cost-effective assessments of tree species diversity and forest structure, with specific applications in studies of fragmented tropical forests. Overall both methods have pros and cons, depending on the type of data needed to address the research objectives and the quantity of resources available. We suggest combining the use of both field-based and remotely-sensed methods as they can be complementary. Remote-sensing data should be used to predict and map the tree species diversity and stand structure at regional scales, while field-inventories provide accurate information at local scales and allow validation of remotely sensed data. For field-inventories, we recommend the use of small (e.g. 20 x 50 m) plots with a 10 cm DBH minimum measurement. In terms of remotely-sensed techniques, if funding is sufficient, airborne imagery seems the best regarding the quality of information (i.e. hyperspectral and hyperspatial imagery, LiDAR). If funding is limited, a cost-effective alternative providing reasonably accurate estimates would be the use of high-resolution satellite imagery such as Worldview. Ultimately, for studies where data accessible for free is the only possible option, we recommend the use of Sentinel-2, although it is relatively coarser in terms of quality. However, further research needs to be done to validate these approaches in fragmented tropical forests.

AB The enhancement of biodiversity is an important strategy to improve the structure and functioning of monoculture plantations. However, compared with seedling transplanting, there is limited information about the utilization of soil seedbanks in regenerating plantation forests. In the present study, to investigate the potential application of soil seedbanks in plantation forest regeneration, the topsoil (0-10 cm) of natural forests was translocated to different monoculture plantations, namely, Acacia crassicarpa, Castanopsis hystrix and Eucalyptus urophylla monocultures. Seed germination, seedling growth and related environmental conditions of the plantation forests were monitored in the experiment. Although, at the very start, large numbers of seedlings emerged from the soil seedbank, only nine species survived after 2.5 years, including seven tree species and two shrub species. Notably, Machilus chekiangensis, a tree species with high economic value, was established in the plantation forests. Except for the common species that emerged in the three plantations, there were some special species that were only associated with a specific plantation. Redundancy analysis revealed that nitrogen from both the natural forest and plantation forest soil had significant effects on seedlings growth. However, environmental conditions such as light (reflected by leaf area index), soil temperature, moisture and pH showed no obvious influence on seedling growth. Our study suggests that soil seedbank translocation from a natural forest to a plantation forest can be a useful approach for plantation forest regeneration because it could introduce valuable plant species and improve the plant biodiversity.

AB Tree plantations are considered as strategic systems for climate change mitigation and economic development. However, their establishment in subtropical areas frequently involves the replacement of a species-rich forest by a tree monoculture with exotic species, which may be functionally different from native species. The impact of this change on ecosystem processes is still widely unknown. In Argentina, large portions of the Semideciduous Atlantic Forest were replaced by non-native Pinus taeda monocultures. The P. taeda litter has lower quality and a slower decomposition rate than native plant litter. Therefore, this replacement would change the characteristic of the litter that reaches the ground. Litter quality is one of the major drivers of decomposition. In the transitional area between two different environments, the edge effect influences populations and communities and could affect ecosystem processes due to changes in its drivers. We wonder how ecosystem processes, as litter decomposition and litterfall production, will respond from the forest edge into the exotic pine monocultures. In five P. taeda plantations and five sites in native forest, we established litter traps to estimate litterfall and litterbags to estimate pine litter decay rate. Litter layer thickness and necromass were also estimated. The change of these variables along a distance gradient from the forest edge into the pine plantation was studied in 10 points at different distances from the edge (0-300 m). Comparisons of these variables between P. taeda plantations and native forest were also done. Native forest replacement by P. taeda monocultures changed the litter identity that reached the ground and decreased the pine litter decomposition rate. The litter layer necromass increased towards the interior of P. taeda plantations, consistently with the increase in pine litterfall. Within the pine plantation, the distance to the native forest edge had no effect on the litterfall neither on pine litter decomposition rates. However, the increase in litter layer necromass towards the interior of plantations suggests that the presence of native forest contiguous to pine plantations in the Semideciduous Atlantic Forest favors litter layer decomposition. Litter from native species, with higher quality than pine litter, decomposes faster in the litter layer and would drive to a more efficient stabilization of soil organic matter. Accordingly, management techniques promoting the increase in the abundance of native species inside pine plantations would improve nutrient cycling and monoculture sustainability.

AB In savannas, grazing is an important disturbance that modifies the grass layer structure and composition. Habitat structural complexity influences species diversity and assemblage functioning. By using a combination of natural sites and manipulated experiments, we explored how habitat structure (grazing lawns and adjacent bunch grass) affects ant diversity and foraging behaviour, specifically the efficiency of resource acquisition, resource monopolisation and ant body size. We found that in the natural sites there was no difference in the amount of time ants took to locate resources, but in the manipulated experiments, ants were faster at locating resources and were more abundant in the simple treatments than in the more complex treatments. Ant body size was only affected by the manipulated experiments, with smaller ants found in the more complex treatments. In both the grazing lawn and bunch grass habitats there were differences in assemblage patterns of ants discovering resources and those dominating them. Seasonality, which was predicted to affect the speed at which ants discovered resources and the intensity of resource monopolisation, also played a role. We show that ants in winter monopolised more baits and discovered resources at a slower rate, but only at certain times within the experiment. Grazing in conjunction with season thus had a significant effect on ant diversity and foraging behaviour, with dominant ants promoted where habitat complexity was simplified when temperatures were low. Our results indicate that structural complexity plays a major role in determining ant assemblage structure and function in African savannas.

AB Forest cover changes have diverse outcomes for the livelihoods of rural people across the developing world. However, these outcomes are poorly characterized across varying landscapes. This study examined forest cover changes, associated drivers, and impacts on ecosystem services supporting livelihoods in three distinct areas (i.e. remote, intermediate and on-road) in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh. The three zones had features of decreasing distance to major roads, decreasing levels of forest cover, and increasing levels of agricultural change. Data was collected from satellite images for 1989-2014, structured household interviews, and group discussions using Participatory Rural Appraisal approaches with local communities to integrate and contrast local people's perceptions of forest cover and ecosystem service change with commonly used methods for mapping forest dynamics. Satellite image analysis showed a net gain of forest areas from 1989 to 2003 followed by a net loss from 2003 to 2014. The gain was slightly higher in intermediate (1.68%) and on-road (1.33%) zones than in the remote (0.5%) zone. By contrast, almost 90% of households perceived severe forest loss and 75% of respondents observed concomitant declines in the availability of fuel wood, construction materials, wild foods, and fresh water. People also reported traveling further from the household to harvest forest products. The main drivers of forest loss identified included increased harvesting of timber and fuel wood over time in the intermediate and on-road zones, whereas swidden farming persisted as the major driver of change over time in the remote zone. The contrast between remotely-sensed forest gains and household-perceived forest loss shows community experiences may be a critical addition to satellite imagery analysis by revealing the livelihood outcomes linked to patterns of forest loss and gain. Community experiences may also evoke solutions by characterizing local drivers of forest change. Failing to disaggregate the impacts of forest loss and gains on ecosystems services over time may lead to uninformed management and further negative consequences for human well-being.

AB Climatic stresses limit plant growth and productivity. In the past decade, tree improvement programs were mainly focused on yield but it is obvious that enhanced stress resistance is also required. In this review we highlight important drought avoidance and tolerance mechanisms in forest trees. Genomes of economically important trees species with divergent resistance mechanisms can now be exploited to uncover the mechanistic basis of long-term drought adaptation at the whole plant level. Molecular tree physiology indicates that osmotic adjustment, antioxidative defense and increased water use efficiency are important targets for enhanced drought tolerance at the cellular and tissue level. Recent biotechnological approaches focused on overexpression of genes involved in stress sensing and signaling, such as the abscisic acid core pathway, and down-stream transcription factors. By this strategy, a suite of defense systems was recruited, generally enhancing drought and salt stress tolerance under laboratory conditions. However, field studies are still scarce. Under field conditions trees are exposed to combinations of stresses that vary in duration and magnitude. Variable stresses may overrule the positive effect achieved by engineering an individual defense pathway. To assess the usability of distinct modi fications, large-scale experimental field studies in different environments are necessary. To optimize the balance between growth and defense, the use of stress-inducible promoters may be useful. Future improvement programs for drought resistance will bene fit from a better understanding of the intricate networks that ameliorate molecular and ecological traits of forest trees.

AB Brazil has become a global leader in the production of commodity row crops such as soybean, sugarcane, cotton, and corn. Here, we report an increase in Brazilian cropland extent from 26.0 Mha in 2000 to 46.1 Mha in 2014. The states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui, Bahia (collectively MATOPIBA), Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Para all more than doubled in cropland extent. The states of Goias, Minas Gerais, and Sao Paulo each experienced >50% increases. The vast majority of expansion, 79%, occurred on repurposed pasture lands, and 20% was from the conversion of natural vegetation. Area of converted Cerrado savannas was nearly 2.5 times that of Amazon forests, and accounted for more than half of new cropland in MATOPIBA. Spatiotemporal dynamics of cropland expansion reflect market conditions, land use policies, and other factors. Continued extensification of cropland across Brazil is possible and may be likely under current conditions, with attendant benefits for and challenges to development.

AB Malaria remains a serious public health problem in Brazil despite a significant drop in the number of cases in the past decade. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of malaria transmission in Brazil to highlight the epidemiologically most relevant components that could help tackle the disease. We consider factors impacting on the malaria burden and transmission dynamics including the geographical occurrence of both autochthonous and imported infections, the distribution and abundance of malaria vectors and records of natural mosquito infections with Plasmodium. Our analysis identifies three discrete malaria transmission systems related to the Amazon rainforest, Atlantic rainforest and Brazilian coast, respectively. The Amazonian system accounts for 99% of all malaria cases in the country. It is largely due to autochthonous P. vivax and P. falciparum transmission by mosquitoes of the Nyssorhynchus subgenus, primarily Anopheles darlingi. Whilst P. vivax transmission is widespread, P. falciparum transmission is restricted to hotspot areas mostly in the States of Amazonas and Acre. This system is the major source of P. vivax exportation to the extra-Amazonian regions that are also affected by importation of P. falciparum from Africa. The Atlantic system comprises autochthonous P. vivax transmission typically by the bromeliad-associated mosquitoes An. cruzii and An. bellator of the Kerteszia subgenus. An. cruzii also transmits simian malaria parasites to humans. The third, widespread but geographically fragmented, system is found along the Brazilian coast and comprises P. vivax transmission mainly by An. aquasalis. We conclude that these geographically and biologically distinct malaria transmission systems require specific strategies for effective disease control.

AB The Sierra Madre Occidental in the Mexican State of Durango, is home to about 5 million ha of species-rich forest ecosystems. Local communities depend on these forests for their livelihood. The preservation of the species richness and productivity of this unique resource requires improved understanding of the effects of forest structure and density on production. The community structure was analysed for three species groups (all species; 12 species of Pinus; and 16 species of Quercus). Based on data gathered in 580 remeasured observational field plots, the main results of this study were as follows: (1) two distinct clusters were identified in each species group, (a) the dominant species with a smaller range of growth rates, and (b) the remaining species which have a smaller maximum size and a greater variation of growth rates. (2) Density (expressed as basal area per hectare) and the percentage contribution to the total basal area of all pine species have a significant effect on forest production (expressed as volume increment per hectare per year). (3) Potential production is surprisingly high (in excess of 20 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) for some stands) in these forests, but the high potential cannot be realised in many areas because of reduced basal areas caused by overharvesting. (4) The available evidence does not confirm the findings of a recent study that suggests a continuous increase in production with increasing richness. Our observations show that production attains a potential maximum at intermediate levels of richness (between 7 and 9 species per 0.25 ha) and declines with further increases in species richness. This study represents a comprehensive analysis of the effects of density and structure on the community forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental based on a large set of permanent field plots where all trees have been mapped.

AB The dragonflies from the Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso, municipality of Cananeia, located at the southern limit of the state of Sao Paulo in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, were surveyed for the first time through a short sampling effort lasting four days in October 2011. A total of 36 species, including four new state records for species of the genera Lestes, Phyllocycla, Navicordulia and 'Schizocordulia', and three undescribed species of damselflies belonging to Cyanallagma, Forcepsioneura and Idioneura were identified. Some notes are also given for other species, as well as on the morphology and behavior of the intriguing corduliid Lauromacromia picinguaba (incertae sedis). The results, based on a small sample, indicate that the local dragonfly biota at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso is rich and impressive, and needs to be investigated and protected.

AB Anthropogenic impacts are the greatest threat to survival of plant and animal populations worldwide. The importance of involving local communities in conservation is evident, yet poverty and livelihood concerns may preclude community participation in conservation, especially in developing countries. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) may enable local participation. However, payments need to be acceptable to communities while remaining within project budgets. Contingent valuation (CV) can be useful for establishing a community's willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for participation in conservation activities and for associated opportunity costs. In the Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok (3S) River basin of Cambodia, a community-based nest protection program utilizing PES is being implemented for six waterbird species. This scheme employs local communities to prevent human exploitation (harvest of eggs and chicks) and disturbance at nesting sites. The program provides guard salaries as an incentive to local communities to report nest sites and ensure their success, rather than harvesting their contents. This study aimed to establish an appropriate level of conservation incentives for local communities to take part in conservation activities. We used CV methods to assess community WTA compensation for participating in conservation activities. Specifically, this chapter evaluates the acceptability of different payment levels by community respondents. This information will be useful for future implementation of the waterbird nest protection program in the 3S River basin, as well as for other conservation projects in Cambodia. Moreover, our approach to assessing communities' WTA compensation for participating in the conservation project can be applied to other similar participatory, community-based conservation programs.

AB The present research aims to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the normalized difference, vegetation index (NDVI) by the exclusion of fire in the Aguas Emendadas Ecological Station, Central Brazil. The study area presents savanna vegetation, in which fire is an integral part of the ecosystem. The results indicate that the fire exclusion for more than 15 years resulted in a significant increase of NDVI within the ecological season. This increase in vegetation may result in more severe fires in the future given the greater availability of fuels.

AB Agricultural matrices can lead to landscape homogenization, culminating in losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Agricultural management is determinant for developing conservation strategies. In this review, we discuss the influence of the agricultural matrix on biodiversity at different scales. Intensive agriculture under agrochemicals and synthetic fertilizers aggravates forest fragmentation processes, compromising conservation habitats. On the other hand, managed matrixes with greater agricultural biodiversity and reduced synthetic inputs tend to favor species' persistence. There is discord regarding the best model to conserve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, but the land sharing system increases the landscape heterogeneity, ensures food production, and constitutes a safer approach from the socioecological perspective. Future studies should consider the matrix identity and management to assess fragmentation effects and its ability to harbor biodiversity.

ID ATLANTIC FOREST; FRAGMENTATION
AB Because of forest fragmentation, the edge effect can lead to changes in the plant community. This study was carried out in conservation units remaining of Semidecidual Seasonal Forest in Espirito Santo Southern State. The objective was to describe the floristic composition, tree structure and microclimate in border and interior areas of the forest fragment. For data collection, 39 fixed area plots were demarcated on the border and in the interior. All individuals with DBH > 5 cm were sampled. There were 167 species in the border and 314 in the interior, being 73 exclusive for edge and 220 for interior. The analysis of floristic similarity, based on the Sorensen index, is an indicator of the distinction between the species of the border and the interior of the fragment. Air and soil temperatures tend to be higher at the edges and lower in the interior, while the relative humidity of the air exhibits opposite behavior. Considering the importance of the environment and highlighting the significant vegetal richness in the studied fragment, it is justified the need of this area to be prioritized in management and conservation programs of the vegetation in the region, especially in forest border environments.

AB One of the unifying goals of ecology is understanding the mechanisms that drive ecological patterns. For any particular observed pattern, ecologists have proposed varied mechanistic models. However, in spite of their differences, all of these mechanistic models rely on either abiotic conditions or biotic conditions, our "ecological first principles". These major components underlie all of the major mechanistic explanations for patterns of diversity like the latitudinal gradient in diversity, the maintenance of diversity, and the (often positive) biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. These components and their interactions alter the dynamics of plant populations, which ultimately determine local coexistence at the community level, and functioning at the ecosystem level. We present a review, starting from ecological first principles of the ways in which ecosystem functioning may be linked to local coexistence in plant communities via mutual effects on and reactions to the abiotic and biotic conditions in which they are imbedded.

AB Trees can be associated with dozens of fungi helping them to acquire resources from forest soils. The most widespread mutualistic association in boreal and temperate forests is the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. This symbiosis involves mushroom-forming fungi of basidiomycota, ascomycota, and some zygomycota clades and the roots of woody plant species, including oaks, poplars or pines. Although the impact of this association on ecosystem production and tree nutrition is investigated for about a century, our understanding on the molecular mechanisms that control water and nutrient fluxes between plant and fungal partners is still limited. Here, we review the recent knowledge on the ectomycorrhizal contribution to tree nutrition. We specifically highlight the molecular mechanisms driving the acquisition, translocation and release of water and nutrients in ectomycorrhizal systems. We particularly focus on the transport of macronutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur and calcium, micronutrients, and water by the symbiotic partner. We also provide background on the evolution, diversity, and importance of this symbiosis, identify knowledge gaps, and propose future research directions.

AB Roadways and road traffic modify landscapes, posing a threat to the conservation of species in different biomes. The aim of the present study was to analyze roadkill records of wild mammals and to compare the results to findings from 37 other studies conducted in Brazil, to evaluate the richness and diversity of threatened species in different eco-regions of the country. This study was conducted between June 2007 and June 2008, along 60 km of the inter-state highway BR-364, which connects the municipalities of Ouro Preto d'Oeste and Presidente Medici in the state of Rondonia (northern Brazil). Two hundred twenty roadkills were recorded involving 13 species of mammals. Cingualata, Pilosa and Carnivora were the most represented orders. The most represented were the generalist species Dasypus novemcinctus (56.7%), Tamandua tetradactyla (10.5%), and Cerdocyon thous (8.2%), reflecting the adaptability of these species to habitat changes and presence of humans. The number of roadkilled individuals and species indicated no significant differences between the dry and rainy seasons. The findings indicate a high index of roadkills (3.38 individuals/km/year) and moderate number of run over species (0.20 species/km/year) in the region in comparison to records from other roadways in Brazil, with 46% species having an endangered status. Roadways in the eco-regions of the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) accounted a significantly larger proportion of endangered species (mean: 52%) in comparison to the Pampa (lowlands of southern Brazil; 24%), but the differences in comparison to roadways in Amazonia (37%) and the Atlantic Forest (31%) were non-significant. The present findings underscore the need for emergency measures to minimize the impact of roadkills on mammals. Moreover, priority should be given to more impacted roadways and more threaten eco-regions.

AB Agricultural activities are considered the main cause of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. Command and control operations of the Brazilian government, fines and monitoring of illegal activities are institutional mechanisms to reduce deforestation in the region, mainly supervising the agricultural activities. The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of agricultural activities on deforestation in the 21st century, considering the role of government and enforcement to reduce deforestation rates in priority municipalities in the Amazon. Using panel data analysis with 335 municipalities of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rondonia, including high-priority municipalities to combat deforestation, we show that cattle ranching remains the leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, while soybean cultivation and others temporary crops do not yet represent a major threat. In addition, it is observed that enforcement operations produce positive effects in reducing deforestation, combating activities not conforming to the legislation and sustainability standards. Although this institutional mechanism of enforcement is reaching its limits, slowing the reduction of deforestation rates in recent years.

AB Biodiversity conservation interventions often aim to benefit both nature and people; however, the social impacts of these interventions remain poorly understood. We reviewed recent literature on the social impacts of four marine conservation interventions to understand the synergies, tradeoffs, and equity (STE) of these impacts, focusing on the direction, magnitude, and distribution of impacts across domains of human wellbeing and across spatial, temporal, and social scales. STE literature has increased dramatically since 2000, particularly for marine protected areas (MPAs), but remains limited. Few studies use rigorous counterfactual study designs, and significant research gaps remain regarding specific wellbeing domains (culture, education), social groups (gender, age, ethnic groups), and impacts over time. Practitioners and researchers should recognize the role of shifting property rights, power asymmetries, individual capabilities, and resource dependency in shaping STE in conservation outcomes, and utilize multi-consequential frameworks to support the wellbeing of vulnerable and marginalized groups.

AB The presence of domestic cats in natural areas is considered one of the main reasons for species loss, especially on islands and among native small non-volant mammals, birds and reptiles. However, in this study, we detected values opposite to those expected for species richness, abundance, and diversity among different areas when considering the presence or absence and density of these felines. We also observed that in the evaluated environments, prey availability did not influence consumption of small mammal species. Our results reinforce the theory of domestic cats' behaviour as being opportunistic and generalist predators. In addition, we only recorded the presence of exotic species in the faeces of cats; that is, we did not capture exotic species in the traps. The close relationship between these exotic species and anthropogenic environments indicates that felines are likely hunting in areas close to the homes where they live. Assessing the impact of predation by domestic cats on native fauna is important for the development and implementation of strategic resource management and to minimize long-term impacts.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamics of the community and shrub-woody individuals in a dry forest in the Brazilian semiarid region after 29 years of vegetation suppression. Individuals with a circumference at 1.30 m above the ground (CBH) >= 6 cm were counted and their heights and CBH were measured in 40 permanent plots on three monitoring occasions (2011, 2013 and 2015). In the period between 2011 and 2015 the area presented a below average precipitation for the last 30 years. Phytosociological parameters and diversity were estimated. The density of individuals decreased from 2011 to 2015 (p < 0.01) and the basal area was similar. During the monitoring period, Poincianella bracteosa stood out in density, frequency and dominance. Phytosociological changes were more evident for an interval of four years. After 29 years of vegetation suppression, the community diversity is within the values for preserved semiarid (caatinga) vegetation. A long period of drought was the main disturbance factor affecting vegetation dynamics.

AB Biodiversity is arguably a major topic in ecology. Some of the key questions of the discipline are: why are species distributed the way they are, in a given area, or across areas? Or: why are there so many animals (as G. Evelyn Hutchinson asked in a famous paper)? It appears as what is supposed to be explained, namely an explanandum of ecology. Various families of theories have been proposed, which are nowadays mostly distinguished according to the role they confer to competition and the competitive exclusion principle. Niche theories, where the difference between "fundamental" and "realised" niches (Hutchinson GE, Am Nat 93: 145159, 1959) through competitive exclusion explains species distributions, contrast with neutral theories, where an assumption of fitness equivalence, species abundance distributions are explained by stochastic models, inspired by (Hubbell SP, The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2001).
   Yet, while an important part of community ecology and biogeography understands biodiversity as an explanandum, in other areas of ecology the concept of biodiversity rather plays the role of the explanans. This is manifest in the long lasting stability-diversity debate, where the key question has been: how does diversity beget stability? Thus explanatory reversibility of the biodiversity concept in ecology may prevent biodiversity from being a unifying object for ecology.
   In this chapter, I will describe such reversible explanatory status of biodiversity in various ecological fields (biogeography, functional ecology, community ecology). After having considered diversity as an explanandum, and then as an explanans, I will show that the concepts of biodiversity that are used in each of these symmetrical explanatory projects are not identical nor even equivalent. Using an approach to the concept of biodiversity in terms of "conceptual space", I will finally argue that the lack of unity of a biodiversity concept able to function identically as explanans and explanandum underlies the structural disunity of ecology that has been pointed out by some historians and philosophers.

AB Amazonia is often cited as having the most diverse flora on the planet. However, the total number of species of higher plants in the region has been largely a matter of guesswork. Some recent publications have estimated the total number of species present, which indicate a lower overall diversity than was estimated in the past. However, analysis of the sampling density across the region, and data from various sources suggest that there may be reason why the recent figures may be considerable underestimates. I believe that much more investment in extensive collecting of quality plant specimens is needed to encounter the very large number of rare and local species that might never have been collected. Unfortunately the tendencies of investment in botany, in terms of geography and types of project, suggest that we will probably not be able to accurately assess the real diversity of the region.

AB Maqui berries are traded internationally for their extraordinary high antioxidant capacity. The traditional wild-crafting is being replaced by cultivated orchards of three selected clones of Aristotelia chilensis, suitable for commercial fruit production. In some shaded areas, low fruit set has been observed, thus the objective of this research was to evaluate the physiological responses to different light conditions in clones 'Luna Nueva', 'Morena', and 'Perla Negra' during two seasons. Plants were established in an experimental design under full sunlight (without cover), black net (50% shade), transparent polycarbonate, and both covers. Number of flowers, fruit, plant height and internode length, as well as physiological traits, such as CO2 assimilation and transpiration rates, and water use efficiency were evaluated. The results indicated that quantity and quality of light affect the growth and fruit production in maqui with differences being genotype dependent. In all studied clones, shaded plants (50% of available solar radiation) grew taller and produced less flowers than those exposed to full sunlight. Since clone by cover interactions were significant, specific maqui clones should be recommended for different climate zones: 'Morena' seems to be more plastic when exposed to different light conditions than 'Luna Nueva' and 'Perla Negra'.

AB The ant community living in leaf litter was assessed in 65 forest sites in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest in the southern region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. In addition, we aimed to understand the patterns between taxonomic and functional diversities using two different resolutions of classification of ants into functional groups. We identified 364 ant species belonging to 68 genera in 10 subfamilies in 65 regions. Considering a more general functional classification, we identified a total of 13 functional ant groups, and 26 functional ant groups considering a more specific functional classification. The Atlantic Forest environments studied presented great taxonomic ant diversity. We observed that ant species richness and the number of functional groups are not closely related metrics, especially when considering a more general functional classification. Moreover, even when considering a more specific functional classification, the relationship with ant richness is only moderate. These results suggest that the number of species in a given group does not necessarily reflect the role played by that group within the environment. Integrating different biodiversity perspectives is crucial for the successful conservation of the Atlantic Forest ants.

AB Poaching in non-volant mammals in the Neotropical region: the importance of a metric to assess its impacts. Much of the information on the hunting of mammals in natural environments is not performed in a standard way and is usually dispersed by different areas or regions that have different environmental structures. This limitation prevents the detection of trends and patterns such as which biomes are under more pressure and what are the rates and level of impact. We aimed to review the scientific literature on poaching of non-volant mammals to evaluate the impact at different study sites in the Neotropical region. We found that in more than half of these studies (66/112, 59%), the main objectives were related to characterizing hunting activity while the potential impact of the hunting was not assessed. Evaluating the poaching through a metric assessment using qualitative and quantitative variables was the main objective in only 58 articles. We classified the hunting events as subsistence in most cases (46/58, 79%), as illegal in a few case (12/58, 21 %) and as legal in one study only (1/58, 2%). Based on this extensive review of scientific literature, we propose a metric assessment that can be performed in natural reserves and can lead to extensive monitoring on mammal populations through training on how to gauge this geo- referenced data.

AB The extreme diversity of dispersal strategies in ants is unique among terrestrial animals. The nature of ant colonies as social, perennial, and sessile superorganisms is the basis for understanding this diversity, together with the inclusive-fitness framework for social evolution. We review ant dispersal strategies, with the aim of identifying future research directions on ant dispersal and its evolution. We list ultimate and proximate determinants of dispersal traits and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of dispersal for population structures and dynamics, as well as species communities. We outline the eco-evolutionary feedbacks between the multitude of traits affecting dispersal evolution and the likely evolutionary routes and ecological drivers in transitions among the diverse ant dispersal strategies. We conclude by presenting a research framework to fill the gaps in current knowledge, including comparative studies of colony life histories and population structures and theoretical models of the eco-evolutionary dynamics affecting dispersal, in an inclusive-fitness framework.

AB Habitat complexity conferred by vegetation characteristics mediates key processes that govern the assemblage of insect communities. Thus, species within the community should only persist if their functional traits are well-matched to the conditions of their environment. Here, we compared ant assemblages between habitats in terms of species richness and functional-trait distribution at the species and the assemblage level. Ants were collected from 36 sites representing different degrees of habitat complexity mediated by standing vegetation. We found fewer ant species in simpler habitats, supporting the "habitat-heterogeneity" hypothesis. We measured key functional traits of ants that reflect their foraging and dispersal strategies, such as body size, femur length, antenna scape length, and head length / width. Interactions of species traits with measured habitat complexity variables were assessed at the species and the assemblage level using a fourth-corner approach. Ant traits were closely related to environmental complexity. In wooded habitats, ants were larger and had broader heads, while ants with longer antenna scapes prevailed in habitats with a dense herb / grass layer. Our study suggests that vegetation structural complexity can act as an environmental filter, driving ant assemblages in terms of both species numbers and functional traits. Our results can be used to predict turnover patterns in ant assemblages due to changes in management practices.

AB As for all living organisms, the nutritional needs of ants change over time in response to varying environmental conditions and demands for growth, health, and reproduction. Solitary individuals regulate their nutritional intake to maintain an appropriate balance of nutrients by selectively choosing the quality and quantity of food that meet their nutritional requirements. For social organisms, such as ants, food collection for the entire colony relies on a few individuals whose nutritional requirements may be very different from those of other members of their colony. Recent studies have used an integrative framework, the "geometric framework", to better understand how living organisms regulate macronutrient intake to defend a specific nutrient "intake target". In this review, we first reveal how the geometric framework has been used to deepen our understanding of ant communal nutrition. Second, we describe how this framework might be used to also understand the nutritional strategies used by ants facing infection challenges. Lastly, we conclude with a brief discussion of the promising techniques that could be used in the future to improve our understanding of communal nutrition in ants.

AB We estimate the early effects of the pilot project to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) in the Brazilian Amazon. This project offers a mix of interventions, including conditional payments, to reduce deforestation by smallholders who depend on swidden agriculture and extensive cattle ranching. We collected original data from 181 individual farmers. We use difference-in-difference (DID) and DID-matching approaches and find evidence that supports our identification strategy. We estimate that an average of 4 ha of forest were saved on each participating farm in 2014, and that this conservation came at the expense of pastures rather than croplands. This amounts to a decrease in the deforestation rate of about 50%. We find no evidence of within-community spillovers.

AB The objective of the study was to evaluate the socio-spatial transformations in two municipalities, Rondonia State, southern Brazilian Amazon. Thus, we used indirect methods of landscape analysis, including products generated from sensor MODIS, in the TERRA and AQUA satellites. Deforestation data were obtained from the results of deforestation monitoring project in the Brazilian Amazon by means of Satellite (PRODES) and a human pressure model. The results showed that deforestation occur mainly in the northern part, especially in Nova Mamore. In addition, it was observed that 82.62% of the deforested areas are located within 5 km from the highways of the study area. Consequently, it was observed that the special areas located in Nova Mamore are subject to significant anthropogenic pressure levels, reaching moderate, as is the case Guajara-Mirim Park, in addition to part of the extractive reserve Jaci-Parana. In the case of the municipality of Guajara-Mirim, the extractive reserve of Rio Ouro Preto has portions at low and moderate anthropic pressure.

AB The Amazonian rainforest has been subjected to exceptionally high rates of land use change (LUC), primarily for pasture. We present here an analysis of the impact of LUC on trees from studies made in Para state. LUC results in drastic declines in native species richness, changes species composition and impacts community resilience and ecosystem services provided by the Amazonian rainforest. Given that secondary forests are expanding in Amazonia we argue that this regrowth forest should be taken into account when planning conservation in this region.

Surveys were made at least one time in a week and in irregular form between May and October which of vegatation time for grapes. At the end of study, 127 insect species belonging to 37 families from 6 ordo were determined. In addition, 14 insects could be identified at genus level and 1 insect at subfamily level. It was determined that 80 species were phytophagous and 35 species were entomophagous of these insects. Also, 12 ant species were found in the study. In the literature, no information has been found on the fact that most phytophagous species obtained are grape pests. However, the species belong to Aphididae, Cicadellidae and Tortricidae families are important pests of grapes. Especially, Lobesia botrana (Denis schiffermuller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and some Cicadellidae species such as Arboridia adanae (Dlabola, 1957) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) are key pests of vineyards in the region.

AB Monitoring long-term forest dynamics is essential for assessing human-induced land-cover changes, and related studies are often based on the multi-decadal Landsat archive. However, in areas such as the Tropical Andes, scarce data and the resulting poor signal-to-noise ratio in time series data render the implementation of automated time-series analysis algorithms difficult. The aim of this research was to investigate a novel approach that combines image compositing, multi-sensor data fusion, and postclassification change detection that is applicable in data-scarce regions of the Tropical Andes, exemplified for a case study in Ecuador. We derived biennial deforestation and reforestation patterns for the period from 1992 to 2014, achieving accuracies of 82 +/- 3% for deforestation and 71 +/- 3% for reforestation mapping. Our research demonstrated that an adapted methodology allowed us to derive the forest dynamics from the Landsat time series, despite the abundant regional data gaps in the archive, namely across the Tropical Andes. This study, therefore, presented a novel methodology in support of monitoring long-term forest dynamics in areas with limited historical data availability.

AB We tested the hypothesis that plant populations in natural fragments have distinct ecological behavior in relation to anthropic fragments. We selected the species Myrcia splendens (SW.) DC. in 2 forest fragments located in southeastern Brazil that present different origins and landscape contexts. The natural fragment originates from landscape relief variations and is inserted in a native grassland matrix, while the anthropic fragment originates from fragmentation due to area conversion and is inserted in an agricultural matrix. We established transects covering an area from one border to the other in each fragment, and we established subunits of 400 m(2) within them. Within each subunit we measured all individuals of M. splendens at all establishment stages (seedlings to established trees). We monitored population behavior in the two fragments for 4 years, evaluating their spatial structure, temporal behavior, and age structure. The two populations present distinct ecological behaviors associated with their different origins and landscape contexts; the natural fragment is exposed to disturbances it has adapted to throughout the evolutionary process, whereas the anthropic fragment is subject to new evolutionary disturbances, such as effect edge, cattle, and recurrent fire.

AB Tropical woody plants store similar to 230 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in their above-ground living biomass. This review suggests that these stocks are currently growing in primary forests at rates that have decreased in recent decades. Droughts are an important mechanism in reducing forest C uptake and stocks by decreasing photosynthesis, elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires. Tropical forests were a C source to the atmosphere during the 2015-2016 El Nino-related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released. With continued climate change, the intensity and frequency of droughts and fires will likely increase. It is unclear at what point the impacts of severe, repeated disturbances by drought and fires could exceed tropical forests' capacity to recover. Although specific threshold conditions beyond which ecosystem properties could lead to alternative stable states are largely unknown, the growing body of scientific evidence points to such threshold conditions becoming more likely as climate and land use change across the tropics.
   Droughts have reduced forest carbon uptake and stocks by elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires.
   Threshold conditions beyond which tropical forests are pushed into alternative stable states are becoming more likely as effects of droughts intensify.

AB Many deforested areas worldwide have been planted with Alnus spp. to protect watersheds and soils. However, the effects of these plantations on biodiversity are little known yet. Contrasting forest types may impose strong environmental filters to some behavioural traits, leading to dissimilar communities. Insectivorous birds are known to be sensitive to changes in habitat structure due to their specialized foraging behaviour. We contrasted species richness, abundance and composition of insectivorous birds, according to functional behaviour groups (foraging strategy and stratum), between secondary forest stands and Andean alder Alnus acuminata plantations, to assess how contrasting forest types affect this bird group in the Colombian Andes. Insectivorous bird species richness and abundance were higher at the Alder plantation rather than at the secondary forest, resulting in dissimilar communities. In this regard, forest plantations act as a positive filter for foliage gleaners and flycatchers, whereas secondary forests act as a positive filter for bark foragers. Secondary forests and alder plantations impose different ecological scenarios to insectivorous birds, related to foraging strategies and foraging stratum, which ultimately leads to a dissimilar species composition.

AB We present here an embracing freshwater fish inventory of the Parque Nacional dos Lencois Maranhenses and adjacent areas, reporting 49 fish species, 33 of which were identified accurately at the species level, representing ten orders and 25 fish families that range from obligate freshwater to estuarine organisms. This number of species is much larger than two previous studies for the park, each reporting just 12 and 33 fishes occurring on freshwater environments. Among the 49 freshwater species recorded in this study, 14 are new records for the Parque Nacional dos Lencois Maranhenses, and just one corresponds to an introduced species. Some of the 14 new records in the Parque Nacional dos Lencois Maranhenses, cited above, as well as some of the 16 species which we are not able to identify accurately at the species level, could include undescribed species, but more study is necessary before sorting out which species are truly undescribed, and which are already described ones. The orders reported by this survey which comprise the highest percentage of species richness, excluding introduced species, were: Characiformes, Cichliformes and Siluriformes, in the same ranking position, and Gymnotiformes, as expected for Neotropical freshwater surveys. The families with the highest number of species, excluding non-native species, were: Characidae, followed by Cichlidae, and Loricariidae. Out of the 33 species herein identified accurately at the species level, five of them are species typically found in brackish water environments, and when occurring on freshwater environments, are restricted mainly to estuaries, or, occasionally, the lower portions of the rivers. Thus, we will not address them in our biogeographical comments. From the remaining 28 species, eight did not occur in the Amazon River basin, six of them being endemic to the Maranhao-Piaui ecoregion. The remaining species herein reported also have their distribution recorded for the Amazon River basin, which shows the great influence of the Amazon basin. In the last two decades efforts to inventory the freshwater fish fauna and to taxonomically solve some groups occurring on the Maranhao state have been made. However the knowledge regarding the composition of the Maranhao freshwater fishes is still insufficient and underestimated, with several groups still lacking adequate taxonomic and systematic resolution, and with many gaps of knowledge, something that is not appropriate for our current picture of "biodiversity crisis". As well as, the other Brazilian protected areas, the PNLM fails to preserve its freshwater environment properly, since it includes only fragments of the major river systems of the area, not including and conserving the hole river drainages, mainly excluding their headwaters. Thus, its water bodies are exposed to typical human impacts.

AB Here we present an updated species list of native non-flying mammals in Los Tuxtlas region, Veracruz, a complex and environmentally relevant region for its biodiversity which has lost most of its original forest and is now under negative pressures which affect its natural communities and species, and thus modify the alfa, beta and gamma diversity patterns. Updated distribution and taxonomic information are basic for programs concerning environmental management and conservation among other studies. The list we present is based upon the revision of specimens deposited in scientific collections of Instituto de Biologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, and Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas, Universidad Veracruzana, in national and international online databases. In this manner, we confirm therefore the presence of 52 species of non-flying mammals and discard 9 species still not confirmed yet in this region, but mentioned in various previous bibliographic sources.

AB Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) host high biodiversity and endemicity and are severely threatened by illegal selective logging, deforestation, fragmentation and climate change. The fragments of TMCF present high heterogeneity over short spatial intervals and a regional forest restoration approach must therefore incorporate seedling performance throughout the TMCF elevation range. We examined early seedling establishment in 12 endangered and valuable TMCF species in the understory of unplanned selectively logged TMCF and assessed the influence of elevation and canopy cover on seedling performance. Tree seedlings (10-18 mo-old) were transplanted into restoration plantings in 6 forest sites along an elevation range (1,250 to 1,995 m) in Veracruz, Mexico. In each forest, 30 seedlings per species were planted and their survival and relative growth rates in height (RGRh) and basal stem diameter (RGRd) recorded, along with canopy cover. Survival was high for all species after one year (81.1 to 99.4%) and was unaffected by elevation. Canopy cover positively affected the survival probability of 3 species. Both RGRh and RGRd decreased at lower elevations in 4 species; however, overall growth rates were positive. Our results indicate a positive early seedling establishment response in the evaluated tree species under the TMCF canopy (66-97% of canopy cover).

AB Herbivory is one of the most important threats that plants face during early stages of development. Previous studies have indicated that seed size and seedling ontogeny strongly influence the response to herbivory at the seedling stage. However, little is known about their interactive effect. We simulated herbivory on seedlings of the exotic Gleditsia triacanthos L. and evaluated the combined effects of seed size and ontogenetic stage at which herbivory occurred on tolerance to herbivory. Agreenhouse experiment was performed, with three non-overlapping levels of seed size. Seedlings from each seed size were clipped at two ontogenetic stages (two and five leaves). After three weeks, seedling survival, height, leaf number and dry biomass were measured. Damaged seedlings were not able to reach the size of the undamaged ones. Seedlings from small seeds showed the lowest values in most of the growth variables. Seedlings cut at two-leaf stage showed a higher compensation capacity than those cut at five-leaf stage. Seedlings from large seeds cut at ontogenetic stage I showed the highest compensation capacity in most of the variables. Partly compensating herbivory at this stage may be an advantage for the expansion of this exotic species to new areas.

AB It is generally assumed that plants can respond to varying degrees of physical damage by growth compensation via resprouting, and resprouting is a key functional trait in many species. Few studies have investigated how grass and shrub species distributed in moving dunes and semifixed dunes in semiarid areas respond to the combined effects of temperature and shoot removal. Medicago sativa, Artemisia ordosica, and Artemisia sphaerocephala plants were grown in a glasshouse for 8 weeks at air temperatures of 10/20 degrees C, 12.5/22.5 degrees C, 15/25 degrees C, and 17.5/27.5 degrees C (night/day) and were subjected to treatments of removing all leaves (LR), removing all leaves followed by cutting at half the plant height (HC), and removing all aboveground tissue (WC). The species, temperature, and damage extent had significant effects on the shoot number, leaf mass ratio, leaf area ratio and ratio of belowground to aboveground dry matter, and the species had a significant effect on the net assimilation rate, specific leaf area, and total biomass. The three species grew well under the HC and LR treatments, and high temperatures (15/25 degrees C and 17.5/27.5 degrees C) significantly promoted the regrowth of the three species. Medicago sativa grew faster than the two Artemisia species. Medicago sativa can be used for fertilizing or vegetation restoration in unimportant conservation areas, and the two Artemisia species can be effectively used for vegetation restoration in the Mu Us Sandland. Due to the low labor costs and the local climate conditions, plants should be clipped before the beginning of the main growing season (end of May or early June) to ensure rapid growth.

AB Forest edges created by silvicultural treatment influence micro-climatic conditions and available light in forest stands Studies regarding the impacts of forest edges on regeneration is limited in mixed Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky)-Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands In this study, the influences of forest edges on height growth, root-collar-diameter growth and density of seedlings in an adjacent stand of Oriental beech-Scots pine were observed. In addition, the effects of stand basal area and height-to-crown on height growth, root-collar-diameter growth and seedlings density were monitored. The study was conducted within Samatlar Forest Planning Directorate, in Kastamonu city, Turkey. In the selected Oriental beech-Scots pine stand, twenty-five transects were installed perpendicular to the forest edge, and all the measurements were taken within these transects. There were statistically significant relationships between the distance from the forest edge and the growth of Scots pine seedlings (p<0.05), while the stand edge did not have any effect on the growth of Oriental beech seedlings. Density of Scots pine seedlings decreased, while Oriental beech seedling density increased from the edge into the intact stand (p<0.05). Stand basal area and height-to-crown did not significantly change from the edge into the intact stand (p>0.05). The differences in seedling growth and seedling density between the two species can be associated with their dissimilar tolerance to shade. The initial results obtained in this study point out the importance of forest edges on the regeneration of Oriental beech and Scots pine seedlings. Data suggest that regeneration of mixed Oriental beech-Scots pine should be successful using group methods rather than traditional shelterwood method within entire stand.

AB Numerous ideas have emerged on the definitions, consequences of introduction, causes of damage, population dynamics and mode of propagation, prevention, and adaptibility of invasive species along with their impact on native species directly or indirectly by way of alteration of ecosystem dynamics. An Invasive species is defined as a species having been introduced outside its native range through human activities which are likely to cause economic or ecological harm. Estuaries and Coastal-Estuarine - Mangrove ecosystems being the most productive and sensitive ecosystems in the world, have appeared to be very much susceptible to introductions of non-native species because of lot of possibilities out of different ecological and people oriented activities in and around these eco-regions such as shipping and boating, ecotourism, fisheries, aquaculture etc. Alongside, several ecological perturbations such as eutrophication, global warming, biomagnification and biotransformation of persistent pollutants, etc. along with the negative impacts of introduced species on marine estuarine flora and fauna by outcompeting them for basic life support resources, human health risk associated with transmission of pathogens, and higher bioaccumulation capabilities of invasive species than native species have threatened this ecologically sensitive region considerably.
   This book chapter aims at highlighting the prospective consequences of the bioinvasion on the coastal-estuarine networks of West Bengal, India which is unique because of the presence of more than hundred of deltas endowed with world's largest mangrove chunk and associated flora and fauna giving emphasis on ecosystem processes and functions. In view of the different threats as imposed by invasive species on native ones, even leading to their extinction, proper holistic eco-management strategies are being suggested giving emphasis on the selfsustaining ecosystem functioning of coastal-estuarine -mangrove ecosystem where species do not inevitably spread rapidly and extensively beyond control.

AB Premise of research.Tolerance to herbivory is the capacity of plants to reduce the negative effects of damage on fitness. Increased growth rate and photosynthesis are two important mechanisms behind tolerance to herbivory. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm, which reflects photosynthetic performance, has been used to characterize stress effects on plants. Here, we tested the hypothesis that photosynthetic performance, estimated from Fv/Fm, may predict tolerance to herbivory.Methodology.In the greenhouse, we evaluated whether Fv/Fm values measured in recently damaged seedlings of the temperate rainforest tree Aextoxicon punctatum predict relative growth rate (RGR) measured 30 d after damage. RGR was earlier associated with tolerance to herbivory in tree species from this forest. In the field, we determined whether Fv/Fm values in experimentally damaged seedlings of 13 tree species are correlated with their reported levels of tolerance to herbivory.Pivotal results.RGR showed positive associations with Fv/Fm measured 3 h and 30 d after damage but no association with Fv/Fm measured before damage. In undamaged control seedlings, RGR was not related to Fv/Fm at any time evaluated. The across-species comparison in the field showed that Fv/Fm values were positively correlated with reported levels of tolerance to herbivory.Conclusions.The parameter Fv/Fm is an accurate predictor of RGR and tolerance to herbivore damage. We advocate the use of this rapid methodology to estimate plant tolerance to herbivory in natural populations.

AB Measuring land-use, land-cover change in biodiverse, tropical countries is critical for conservation management and sustainable planning because it provides quantifiable data regarding broad environmental changes. This project uses Landsat satellite imagery to document vegetation cover change on Ambergris Caye, Belize, from 2000 to 2017. The close proximity of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System has made Ambergris Caye the most popular tourist destination and economic hub in Belize. As a result, the region has undergone intense commercial and residential development coupled with rapid population growth over the past two decades. Understanding general trends in landscape dynamics is critical for the natural resource-based tourism industry of Belize to continue to thrive. Unsupervised classification methods and a per pixel postclassification comparison were used with Landsat imagery to estimate loss in vegetation cover and increases in urban and barren land. The results indicate a 10.85 percent decrease in vegetation and a 39 percent increase in urban and barren land during the seventeen-year study period with an annual forest loss rate of 0.67 percent per year using a compound interest rate formula. The results of this analysis represent a baseline study of vegetation change on Ambergris Caye to inform management and conservation efforts.

AB In Amazonia, the main causes of deforestation are systems based on slash-and-burn agriculture. The objective of this work was to evaluate temporal changes in the soil chemical attributes after the vegetation has been slashed and burned in an area of native forest in the Western Amazon. For this study, four hectares of forest in Cruzeiro do Sul, State of Acre, Brazil, was slashed and burned. The soil in the study area was classified as Ultisol (Argissolo Amarelo Distreifico tipico). Soil samples were collected over the course of one year, the first one being collected 16 hours after the burn and the others at 30, 60, 90, 150, 210, 270, and 360 days after the burn. The soil surface layers were more sensitive to fire action. Ashes from vegetation burn increased pH values, basic cations, and C values only in the first months, resulting in higher basal saturation values (V%). The practice of slash-and-burn after 12 months resulted in lower values of pH, Ca, Mg, K, and P and higher values of Al and H, as well as saturation by aluminum in the soil, indicating this practice contributes to the reduction of soil fertility.

AB The agricultural conversion of natural habitats is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. In the similar to 2 million km(2) Brazilian cerrado biome, a global biodiversity hotspot, vast areas have been converted into croplands and cattle pastures. Because the cerrado biome is overwhelmingly contained within private lands, Brazil's environmental legislation should serve as a decisive instrument in protecting these natural ecosystems. We assessed the role of Legal Reserves (LRs), legally defined as the minimum proportion of private landholdings set aside to protect natural vegetation, in the conservation of the cerrado biome. We assume that the property-scale allocation of LRs is primarily based on economic decision-making, creating a bias against cerrado protection. We therefore assessed the area ratio between forest vegetation (FV) and grassland vegetation (GV) areas across LRs within 48,762 landholdings, 9 formal protected areas (PAs) and 34 Indigenous Lands (ILs) within the cerrado (sensu lato) of the 903,357-km(2) state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. We show that there are 7.26 ha of forest lands for each hectare of native grasslands within private RLs of the cerrado biome within Mato Grosso, a ratio almost three-fold larger than that found in formal PAs and ILs. ILs protect in absolute values (hectares) six-fold more native grassland vegetation than PAs. We discuss the policy relevance of this severe land-use bias in maintaining the heterogeneity of cerrado habitats for biodiversity conservation within private properties, which account for 90% of the entire cerrado biome.

AB 1. The mechanistic links between nitrogen (N) availability and investment in plant phosphorus (P) acquisition have important implications for plant growth, species distributions, and responses to CO2 fertilization under global change, especially in P-poor tropical ecosystems. Currently, it is unclear whether investment in strategies that enhance plant P acquisition (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM; colonization or root phosphatase activity, RPA) are determined primarily by phylogeny, or whether these strategies differ among N-2-fixing legumes and nonfixing plants as a result of differing N availability.
   2. We hypothesized that plant N status, which can vary widely independent of N fixation, correlates with investment in P acquisition, because: (a) N and P concentrations scale in plant tissue indicative of coupled demand and (b) plants with more N may have more resources available to allocate to acquisition strategies.
   3. We grew seedlings of eight tropical tree species from three families (including three N-2-fixing and one nonfixing legume) under greenhouse conditions in native forest soil for four months. Species represented almost the full range of foliar N observed in tropical trees.
   4. Neither foliar N nor P concentrations correlated with investment in P acquisition. Across all species, we found an inverse relationship between investment in AM colonization and RPA, but this trade-off was unrelated to foliar N or P and did not differ between functional types (i.e., N-2 fixers vs. nonfixers).
   5. Within legumes (family Fabaceae), two strategies were evident that were unrelated to fixation status. High-fixing Inga and nonfixing Dialium displayed high foliar N and P concentrations and greater proportional investment in RPA versus AM, while lower fixing Ormosia species were characterized by lower foliar nutrient concentrations and proportionally more investment in AM.
   6. Synthesis.Investment in P acquisition strategies in tropical trees is not dependent on foliar N or functional group, but instead may be controlled in part by resource trade-offs. High diversity in nutrient strategies between related species cautions again the use of simple functional groupings to draw conclusions about nutrient acquisition in tropical trees.

TI CACHE MARKING UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS DOES NOT AFFECT NUT RECOVERY RATE

AB Scatter-hoarder birds can play a key role in the dispersal and recruitment of forest tree species through caching seeds, but accurate evaluation of their importance in this respect would require detailed monitoring of post-dispersal seed fate. To quantify seed fate under wild conditions researchers often use visual marks to locate the seed caches. However, the effect that these marks may have on scatter-hoarder birds, and hence on the estimation of post-dispersal seed fate, has so far been neglected. In this study, we experimentally analyse whether different visual marks used to locate caching sites may affect the removal rate of cached seeds by a scatter-hoarder corvid, the Eurasian Magpie Pica pica. We used three different procedures (treatments) to mark the caches: a small wooden stake placed at 50cm from the cache, a large wooden stake placed at the same distance, and no stake (no visual mark). Dispersal of walnuts placed in feeders was monitored with radio-tracking, and assigning the dispersed nuts to each procedure followed a stratified process that allowed us to create similar conditions across treatments. We found that mark type did not affect the recovery rate of cached nuts, which validates the results of the recovery rate in previous studies of this system. Marking cached nuts with wooden stakes up to 20cm above ground as done in this study seems therefore to be an appropriate way to assist researchers to locate sampling points when studying nut dispersal by magpies.

AB This article investigates whether protected areas are efficient instruments against deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia. A Dynamic Spatial Durbin Model taking into account both the location bias and the spatial spillover effects between municipalities allows to assess the impact of the different types of protected areas (integral protected areas, sustainable protected areas and indigenous lands) on deforestation. We show that deforestation decisions are strategic complements. The econometric results differ according to the type of protected area. It is shown that: i) integral protected areas and indigenous lands allow for reducing deforestation; ii) sustainable use areas do not help to reduce deforestation; and iii) the spillover effects generated by integral protected areas and indigenous lands lead a reduction in deforestation in their vicinity. A 10% increase in the surface area of integral protected areas (indigenous lands) allows an estimated 9.32 sq. km (10.08 sq. km) of avoided deforestation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Cerrado biome corresponds to an extensive area of Brazil and is considered a biodiversity hotspot. Frequent fires are a natural feature in this biome and have influences on vegetation structure and composition. However, continuous anthropogenic actions are promoting changes in fire frequency and seasonality. Despite the high biodiversity of the Cerrado, little is known about its microbiome, with few publications describing some aspects of the bacterial and fungal communities found on this biome and almost no references about archaea. In this study, we describe the archaeal diversity in Cerrado sensu stricto soils, comparing the archaeal communities from soils of an area long protected from fires to one exposed to biennial fires, using both 16S rRNA and amoA genes as molecular markers. Almost all 16S rRNA sequences from both studied areas were affiliated with I.1b and 1.1c Thaumarchaeota, groups commonly detected in terrestrial environments. A higher relative abundance of I.1b thaumarchaeal subgroup was detected in the frequently burned area even though no statistically significant differences were observed in archaeal 16S rRNA richness and diversity between the investigated areas. Many ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are affiliated with this group, which is consistent with the higher amoA diversity and OTU numbers detected in the area periodically burned. Taken together, our results suggest that, although total archaeal community richness and diversity do not seem to greatly differ between the investigated conditions, alterations in wood cover and vegetation structure caused by frequent fires likely cause long-term effects in AOA diversity in Cerrado soils.

AB Secondary forests (SF) are important carbon sinks, removing CO2 from the atmosphere through the photosynthesis process and storing photosynthates in their aboveground live biomass (AGB). This process occurring at large-scales partially counteracts C emissions from land-use change, playing, hence, an important role in the global carbon cycle. The absorption rates of carbon in these forests depend on forest physiology, controlled by environmental and climatic conditions, as well as on the past land use, which is rarely considered for retrieving AGB from remotely sensed data. In this context, the main goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of polarimetric (quad-pol) ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data for estimating AGB in a SF area. Land-use was assessed through Landsat time-series to extract the SF age, period of active land-use (PALU), and frequency of clear cuts (FC) to randomly select the SF plots. A chronosequence of 42 SF plots ranging 3-28 years (20 ha) near the Tapajos National Forest in Para state was surveyed to quantifying AGB growth. The quad-pol data was explored by testing two regression methods, including non-linear (NL) and multiple linear regression models (MLR). We also evaluated the influence of the past land-use in the retrieving AGB through correlation analysis. The results showed that the biophysical variables were positively correlated with the volumetric scattering, meaning that SF areas presented greater volumetric scattering contribution with increasing forest age. Mean diameter, mean tree height, basal area, species density, and AGB were significant and had the highest Pearson coefficients with the Cloude decomposition (3), which in turn, refers to the volumetric contribution backscattering from cross-polarization (HV) ( = 0.57-0.66, p-value < 0.001). On the other hand, the historical use (PALU and FC) showed the highest correlation with angular decompositions, being the Touzi target phase angle the highest correlation (phi s) ( = 0.37 and = 0.38, respectively). The combination of multiple prediction variables with MLR improved the AGB estimation by 70% comparing to the NL model (R-2 adj. = 0.51; RMSE = 38.7 Mg ha(-1)) bias = 2.1 +/- 37.9 Mg ha(-1) by incorporate the angular decompositions, related to historical use, and the contribution volumetric scattering, related to forest structure, in the model. The MLR uses six variables, whose selected polarimetric attributes were strongly related with different structural parameters such as the mean forest diameter, basal area, and the mean forest tree height, and not with the AGB as was expected. The uncertainty was estimated to be 18.6% considered all methodological steps of the MLR model. This approach helped us to better understand the relationship between parameters derived from SAR data and the forest structure and its relation to the growth of the secondary forest after deforestation events.

AB Woody encroachment is becoming common in tropical savannas. We studied natural seed rain and performed seed addition experiments in a Brazilian savanna that had not been burned for several decades. We found greater abundance of fire-sensitive species in the seed rain, likely contributing to woody encroachment. Flexible fire management policies that allow for natural and prescribed fires may be required to maintain savanna diversity.

AB Attalea princeps is an important palm species that shapes the forest-savanna mosaic in Beni, Bolivia, as it dominates the two principal forest landscape elements (forest islands and gallery forest), and provides a vital microhabitat, food, and nesting source for numerous plant and animal species. The forest-savanna mosaic is used for extensive grazing, and the palm population is declining on the forest islands due to a low regeneration rate, which threatens the maintenance of this landscape. We therefore examined the (a)biotic factors that influence the population structure of Attalea in the centers and edges of forest islands and gallery forests. Ninety-one 0.1-ha plots were established, and 500 palm adults and 3,700 juveniles were measured for their size, health condition, and fire damage. For each plot, habitat characteristics, such as landscape position, grazing pressure, and soil conditions, were measured. Attalea population density was significantly lower on the forest islands than in the gallery forests, especially in the juvenile life stage. A structural equation model showed that juvenile density is positively related to the health condition of juveniles and amount of fruits present, where the amount of fruits is positively affected by the condition of adults. Juvenile density is negatively influenced by grazing, affecting the health condition of the juvenile, as well as organic matter and phosphate availability in the soil. Therefore, it is recommended to decrease the grazing pressure by decreasing livestock densities, fencing off vulnerable forest islands, or by rotating cattle.

AB Despite the recent rapid growth of tropical dry forest succession ecology, most studies on this topic have focused on plant community attribute recovery, whereas animal community successional dynamics has been largely overlooked, and the few existing studies have used taxonomic approaches. Here, we analyze the successional changes in the bee community in a Mexican tropical dry forest, by integrating taxonomic (species, genus, and family diversity) and functional (sociability, nesting strategy, and body size) information for bees. Over one year, in a successional chronosequence (2-67 years after abandonment) we collected 469 individual bees, representing five families, 36 genera, and 69 species. Linear modeling showed decreases in taxonomic diversity with succession, more strongly so for species. Bee species turnover along succession ranged from moderate to high, decreasing slightly at intermediate stages. An RLQ analysis (ordination method that allows relating environmental variables with functional attributes) revealed clear relations between bee functional traits and the plant community. RLQ axis 1 was positively related to vegetation structural and diversity variables, and to eusociality, while solitary, parasociality, and ground nesting was negatively associated with it. Early successional fallows attract mostly solitary and parasocial bees; older fallows tend to attract eusocial bees with aerial nesting. The continuous taxonomic turnover observed by us and the functional analysis suggest that the disappearance of old fallows from agricultural landscapes would likely result in significant reductions and even local extinctions of particular bee guilds. Considering the low viability of preserving large mature tropical dry forest tracts, the conservation of older successional stands emerges as a crucial component of landscape management.

AB Urbanization of coastal habitats is increasing worldwide. However, most man-made structures are poor surrogates for the habitats they replace and can strongly impact the diversity and functioning of coastal habitats. The value of coastal engineering can be enhanced by the provision of microhabitats that facilitate colonization by marine life. One step forward is moved in this research by combining species coexistence theory, resource patchiness and applied ecology in order to find ways that maximize the biological diversity of coastal defence structures. Featureless areas of a seawall were modified by the addition of microhabitats (resource) that were distributed in different configurations of patchiness. Gastropod diversity peaked at intermediate levels of microhabitat patchiness. This appeared to be driven by different patterns of resource use among species. Gastropods dispersed longer distances on unmodified seawalls than on natural rocky shores, but when microhabitats were added the dispersal decreased. The ability to find microhabitats differed among species. Our results confirm that patchiness in microhabitat distribution affects biodiversity. The extent of microhabitat patchiness could potentially be tailored by coastal engineers to meet specific conservation priorities: increasing diversity versus increasing number of individuals.

AB Lantana camara L. (sensu lato) primarily invades open, well-lit environments. However, the species is expanding its range in shaded habitats. To decipher the strategies behind the species' invasive success in contrasting light environments, key performance-related architectural and functional traits of sun and shade-dwelling individuals were estimated. L. camara exhibited significant differences in performance-related traits at whole plant, branch, and leaf-level in response to light. DNA ploidy level of each sampled individual was also estimated to determine whether observed trait differences in response to light can be related to adaptive trait modulations or to the ploidal differences. L. camara individuals dwelling in sun and shade were of similar ploidy level. Consequently, the performance of L. camara in variable light is a function of structural and functional trait differences, but not an attribute of ploidy. Sun-dwelling L. camara exhibited alterations in architecture, affecting the reproductive output, which exert local/regional propagule pressure. However, shade-dwelling individuals exhibited architectural alterations affecting plant expanse which attributes local ingress, creating a local masking effect. Both the strategies boost performance and invasive success of L. camara in contrasting light environments. The present study gives an insight that physical removal of the plant in sun and shade would imply differential benefits in the local environment.

ID DIVERSITY; HERBIVORES
AB Pathogenic interactions between fungi and plants facilitate plant species coexistence and tropical rainforest diversity. Such interactions, however, may be affected by forest fragmentation as fungi are susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance. To examine how fragmentation affects fungus-induced seed and seedling mortality, we sowed seeds of six plant species in soils collected from 21 forest fragments. We compared seedling establishment in unmanipulated soils to soils treated with fungicides. Fungicides increased germination of Toona ciliata seeds and decreased mortality of Syzygium rubicundum and Olea dioica seedlings. The fungus-induced mortality of one of these species, S. rubicundum, decreased with decreasing fragment size, indicating that its interactions with pathogenic fungi may weaken as fragments become smaller. We provide evidence that a potential diversity-maintaining plant-fungus interaction weakens in small forest fragments and suggest that such disruptions may have important long-term consequences for plant diversity. However, we emphasize the need for further research across rainforest plant communities to better understand the future of diversity in fragmented rainforest landscapes.

AB Trait-based approaches and functional diversity have been previously used to enlighten our knowledge on the structure of community assemblages which are driven by species interactions or abiotic factors. We assess what amphibian functional diversity implies for the community assembly of amphibians of Europe and whether the use of different Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) affects the results. We used presence/absence atlas with 50kmx50km grain size and three functional diversity indices (FRic, RaoQ and FDiv) which reflect functional richness and divergence to estimate functional diversity patterns calculated for three FTGs: Morphological, Habitat-related, Reproductive and the complete set of traits. To identify the two key processes (environmental filtering and limiting similarity) that may shape amphibian communities and how the relative importance of these processes could change using different FTGs, we used null models to test for non-random patterns of functional diversity accounting or not for the difference in regional species pool. We show that for the same grid cell, for one FTG we might observe lower than randomly expected functional diversity (i.e., trait convergence or environmental filtering as the dominant community assembly process) while for another FTG or for the complete set of traits, higher than randomly expected functional diversity (i.e., trait divergence or limiting similarity as the dominant community assembly process). This highlights the role of trait selection on the inference drawn regarding community assembly. Furthermore, the number of traits (complete set vs. FTGs) used to quantify functional diversity also affects the conclusions regarding community assembly.

AB Population studies are essential for understanding different aspects of species' biology, estimating extinction probability, and determining evolutionary and life history. Using the mark-recapture method, we studied the abundance and population structure of dung beetle species (Deltochilum mexicanum and Dichotomius satanas) over one year in a human-modified landscape in Mexico. We captured 1960 individuals with a net recapture rate of 11%. Deltochilum mexicanum had a higher rate of recapture (14%) than Dichotomius satanas (5%). Annual variation in abundance was similar for both species, with maximum abundance occurring in summer and a marked reduction during winter. Deltochilum mexicanum was dominant inside the forest, and its abundance was influenced by vegetation cover, temperature, and humidity. Dichotomius satanas was more frequent outside the forest, and none of the considered environmental variables affected its abundance. The adult sex ratio of Deltochilum mexicanum was female-biased, whereas that of Dichotomius satanas was male-biased. The maximum estimated population size was similar for both species, but Deltochilum mexicanum had a higher number of new individuals and survival rate. Since species with different biological attributes presented a similar pattern of abundance and population structure, we conclude that environmental conditions are the main regulator of dung beetle populations in the human-modified landscape.

AB Shrub encroachment in grasslands is a worldwide problem that has many ecological consequences, transforming previously open environments into dense forests. Disruption of natural fire regimes is one of the main causes of shrub encroachment, and the use of prescribed fire is a common strategy used to restore these ecosystems. In this study, we provide information about how a palm tree savanna under a process of shrub encroachment responds to the reintroduction of fire. We describe the effects of a first fire event on vegetation composition and structure using an experimental approach. We examine a species-specific response to the fire. After one prescribed fire event applied to four study areas of 16 ha each, we analyzed the change in vegetation physiognomy and composition in burned and control plots for 1 year. Low-intensity prescribed fire decreased height and cover of most shrub species and increased herbaceous vegetation cover over time. We classified shrub and herbaceous species response to fire according to the time they became present and their phenological characteristics. Our results can help stakeholders to determine if prescribed fire is helpful at reducing shrub encroachment in short term in similar ecosystems, considering how plant community responds to the reintroduction of fire after decades of fire suppression.

AB Ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera) are important components of forest ecosystems and can be affected by fuel reduction forest management practices. We assessed the impact of repeated applications of fuel reduction treatments on abundance and diversity of ants within upland mixed-hardwood forests in the Southern Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina, USA. We established three replicate blocks (similar to 56 ha each) and split each block into four fuel reduction treatments, which included prescribed burning (B), mechanical felling (M), a combination of prescribed burning and mechanical felling (MB), and a control (C; i.e., no treatment). We implemented treatments multiple times (two mechanical thinnings and four prescribed burns) over the course of a 15-yr period. Due to tree mortality and resultant canopy gaps from high-severity burns, forest structure was dramatically altered in MB. Over a 3-yr period (2014-2016), we captured 54,219 ants comprised of 23 genera using pitfall and colored pan traps. Prenolepis imparis was the most common ant species collected, and it was significantly lower in abundance in MB than all other treatments. However, the non-native species Brachyponera chinensis was more abundant in MB than all other treatments. Thus, some fuel reduction treatments may have consequences for invasive ant colonization in forests. Most ant taxa did not differ in abundance among treatments, suggesting that some fuel reduction practices may affect some, but not all ant species. Our results indicate that some fuel reduction treatments can alter forest ant communities, thus contributing to changing forest ecosystem dynamics. Monitoring of ants and other bioindicators after repeated rounds of fuel reduction treatments could provide useful knowledge that can be used to help balance forest management and biological diversity.

AB Highly variable patterns in temperature and rainfall events can have pronounced consequences for small mammals in resource-restricted environments. Climatic factors can therefore play a crucial role in determining the fates of small mammal populations. We applied Pradel's temporal symmetry model to a 21-year capture-recapture dataset to study population dynamics of the pinyon mouse (Peromyscus truei) in a semi-arid mixed oak woodland in California, USA. We examined time-, season- and sex-specific variation in realized population growth rate () and its constituent vital rates, apparent survival and recruitment. We also tested the influence of climatic factors on these rates. Overall monthly apparent survival was 0.81 +/- 0.004 (estimate +/- SE). Survival was generally higher during wetter months (October-May) but varied over time. Monthly recruitment rate was 0.18 +/- 0.01, ranging from 0.07 +/- 0.01 to 0.63 +/- 0.07. Although population growth rate () was highly variable, overall monthly growth rate was close to 1.0, indicating a stable population during the study period ( +/- SE = 0.99 +/- 0.01). Average temperature and its variability negatively affected survival, whereas rainfall positively influenced survival and recruitment rates, and thus the population growth rate. Our results suggest that seasonal rainfall and variation in temperature at the local scale, rather than regional climatic patterns, more strongly affected vital rates in this population. Discerning such linkages between species' population dynamics and environmental variability are critical for understanding local and regional impacts of global climate change, and for gauging viability and resilience of populations in resource-restricted environments.

AB Aim The hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively influences biodiversity stems from island biogeography and metapopulation theory which predict negative impacts of decreasing patch size on richness and distribution patterns. Empirical support of this idea is weak in terrestrial systems, though tests of fragmentation effects are typically confounded with landscape composition and potentially obscured by imperfect detection. Here, we used multispecies occupancy models and a mensurative experimental design to test competing hypotheses about how forest fragmentation influences distributions of breeding forest bird species and communities. Location Southern Indiana, USA. Methods During the breeding seasons of 2011-2013, we recorded over 80,000 bird detections in 202 forest fragments using a sampling design that isolated the effects of patch size per se from the effects of forest amount within a 2 km radius, edge distance, local vegetation and sampling area. We modelled the effects of these covariates on distributions of individual species categorized by ecological trait groups (i.e., forest, forest interior or forest edge), and evaluated how forest loss and fragmentation impact species richness. Results Though our results indicated little effect of patch size on total species richness, decreasing patch size had a negative effect on interior species, and a positive effect on edge species. The effects of total forest amount were much more variable, and surprisingly had a negative influence on many species, particularly cavity nesters. Main conclusions Our results do not support theoretical predictions that forest patch size should positively influence bird species richness. However, composition of bird communities shifted towards edge species from interior species with decreasing patch size. Maintaining large forest patches is thus critical for supporting forest interior species, which tend to be of the greatest conservation concern.

AB Ants play a fundamental role in coffee pest control. Despite this, there is a lack of understanding about how landscape configuration and composition regulate the ecosystem service provided by ants in sun coffee farms within highly fragmented landscapes. We measured whether landscape structure influences ants' ability to regulate coffee berry borer (CBB) in sun coffee farms in Southeastern Brazil. Considering the ecological interactions between ants and CBB at three different stages of pest control (reduction of CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB bean damage), we measured pest control among 10 landscapes that represented a gradual difference in forest and coffee cover. We manipulated ants through exclusion experiments and tested whether interactions between ants and different landscape structure metrics (distance to forest fragments, 2-km-level forest cover, and 300-m-level forest and coffee cover) influenced pest control. The presence of ants reduced CBB presence and CBB damage by up to 40%. We show how pest control service indicators change depending on the landscape level. The probability of CBB presence increased with expanding coffee and forest cover at the 300-m-level but decreased at the 2-km-level. CBB infestation reduced further after 25 m from forest edges, suggesting ants that provide these ecosystem services are adapted to matrix conditions in sun coffee farms. Ants reduced CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB damage in landscapes with at least 40% 2-km-level forest cover. Beyond this threshold, there is a turning point for ecological processes involved in pest control. Synthesis and applications. This is the first long-term branch-level exclusion experiment to present strong evidence of ants as efficient providers of pest control in sun coffee farms. We show how landscape structure modulates key ecological processes involved in three different ant-CBB interactions that regulate CBB populations. Forest cover measured at different landscape levels yielded different results for CBB presence, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale studies for landscape management. Considering surrounding forest cover and crop proximity to forest fragments in planning the spatial arrangement of coffee farms can thus both improve pest control as well as contribute to biodiversity conservation.

AB Soft sediment shores in the tropics are highly dynamic environments, where behavioural patterns of organisms are constrained by tidal conditions, and environmental temperatures during an organisms' activity periods can exceed their thermal tolerance levels. In such extreme habitats, behavioural responses to environmental changes are key to survival, driving differential performance. We investigated sponging behaviour (water uptake from sediments) of the deposit-feeding crab, Scopimera intermedia, on tropical sandy shores to determine its thermoregulatory function. The thermal physiology of the crabs and their habitat conditions were quantified by measuring thermal performance curves and recording environmental temperatures during the crabs' activity periods. Environmental temperatures were combined with experimental data to investigate the role of sponging on the thermal performances of the crabs by simulating field body temperatures. Sponging rate was strongly and positively correlated with feeding rate, as sponging replenishes water for flotation feeding. Sponging, however, also reduced body temperatures on average by 1.3 degrees C. Simulated populations of crabs which were unable to sponge had more variable body temperatures, which exceeded the critical thermal maximum of the crabs (39 degrees C) nearly 2000 times more often than crabs able to sponge. Sponging is, therefore, a multifunctional behavioural trait important for both feeding and thermoregulation. The evolution of such multifunctional traits is likely to be a widespread, but overlooked phenomenon in intertidal species, as maintaining a functional body temperature is energetically costly in habitats where environmental conditions fluctuate strongly such as on tropical shores.

AB Prolonged droughts exacerbated by climate change have been widely documented to interact with consumers to decimate vegetation in many ecosystems. Although climate change is increasing within-year variation in precipitation and temperature, how weather fluctuations affect the impact of consumers on vegetation processes remains poorly understood. In a salt marsh that has recently experienced drought-associated vegetation die-off, we investigated how top-down control of plant recovery by a prominent salt marsh grazer varies with weather. Our results showed that grazing-driven plant mortality varied strongly with weather in spring, with intense grazing occurring during cool, wet days immediately following rain. Intense grazing on cool, wet days across the generally dry spring season had a strong impact that eliminated plant seedlings that could otherwise have become tolerant of grazing in the following summer, thereby restricting vegetation recovery and contributing to the persistence of an unvegetated salt barren state. Thus, weather fluctuations can modulate the impact of consumers on vegetation recovery, a fundamental process underlying the fate of ecosystems after disturbances. A multi-timescale perspective on top-down control that combines the impact of short-term fluctuations in weather and that of long-term variation in mean climate can not only help understand ecosystem dynamics in an increasingly variable climate, but may also inform conservation strategies or recovery plans for ecosystems that are already lost to climate change.

AB Land use and land cover changes (LULCC) within a highly anthropized Mediterranean landscape dominated by industrial tree plantation leads to degradation of soil physical properties. This process has been more intense in the coastal range of south-central Chile due to its soils, which are highly susceptible to erosion, combined with a long history of intensive land use changes during the last century, transitioning from native forest (NF) to agriculture and the more recent establishment of Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. exotic tree plantations. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess the statuses of soil physical properties over different land cover situations. Historical land cover maps were determined via supervised classifications using the maximum likelihood classifier applied to satellite imagery. Five land use and land cover categories (LULC) were defined according to main land cover transitions associated with active and abandoned forestry operations that have been reported in the region: Ni, pine plantation (P), eucalyptus plantation (Eu), early successional (E-S), and secondary successional (S-S). Successional stages were generated using change detection statistics considering changes between 2001 and 2014 maps. Soil samples were collected at three depths in 39 plots that describe the five LULC. High clay contents were found in all the LULC except Eu and P. These sites have shown more signs of degradation, with lower organic matter (SOM) and macropores and higher shear strength (ShS). Soil organic matter was consistent with litter contribution and quality, establishing lower bulk density (Db) for NF and S-S and higher values for Eu and E-S. ShS and dispersion rate (DR) exhibit a correlation with SOM with lower ShS and higher DR when SOM increased. Relevant differences were identified for structural stability index (SSI) between LULC depending on soil physical quality, besides a positive correlation with SOM. Those results show the need to generate appropriate conditions of vegetation cover in order to recover soils subjected to current forestry management of industrial plantations.

AB International commitments for ecosystem restoration add up to one-quarter of the world's arable land. Fulfilling them would ease global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity decline but could displace food production and impose financial costs on farmers. Here, we present a restoration prioritization approach capable of revealing these synergies and trade-offs, incorporating ecological and economic efficiencies of scale and modelling specific policy options. Using an actual large-scale restoration target of the Atlantic Forest hotspot, we show that our approach can deliver an eightfold increase in cost-effectiveness for biodiversity conservation compared with a baseline of non-systematic restoration. A compromise solution avoids 26% of the biome's current extinction debt of 2,864 plant and animal species (an increase of 257% compared with the baseline). Moreover, this solution sequesters 1billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent (a 105% increase) while reducing costs by US$28 billion (a 57% decrease). Seizing similar opportunities elsewhere would offer substantial contributions to some of the greatest challenges for humankind.

AB Copernicus is the World's largest single Earth Observation (EO) programme, whose satellite constellations are planned to be launched between 2014 and 2025. Among the constellations, Sentinel-1 (S-1) is a C-band SAR able to support land cover mapping. Although optical data are commonly used for land cover monitoring, the low availability of cloud-free scenes along the year hinders the mapping process. In such a way, S-1 presents an important source of data, able of providing all-weather and day-and-night imagery of EO. In this study, we investigate the potential of using S-1 data to distinguish targets in Remote Sensing images in three different Brazilian biomes, Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest. Based on that, we proposed a methodology to classify SAR images, which was validated considering a different area from the ones used for sampling purposes. The results showed that through S-1 data, it is possible to detect mainly water and urban area targets, with overall accuracy of 0.90, evidencing that our approach is reproducible in other regions.

AB Forest fragmentation and defaunation are considered the main drivers of biodiversity loss, yet the synergistic effects of landscape changes and biotic interactions on assemblage structure have been poorly investigated. Here, we use an extensive dataset of 283 assemblages and 105 species of small mammals to understand how defaunation of medium and large mammals and forest fragmentation change the community composition and diversity of rodents and marsupials in tropical forests of South America. We used structured equation models to investigate the relationship between small mammal species, functional and phylogenetic diversity with forest size, forest cover and the occurrence of medium and large mammals. The best-fit model showed that defaunation reduced functional diversity, and that species diversity of small mammals increased with forest patch size. Forest cover did not affect functional and phylogenetic diversity. Our results indicate that occurrence of medium and large sized mammals (probably acting as predators, or competitors of small mammals) and forest patch size help to retain species and functional diversity in small mammal communities. Further, the number of species in a small mammal community was critical to the maintenance of phylogenetic diversity, and may have a pronounced influence on the ecological functions played by small mammals. Identifying how phylogenetic and functional diversity change in function of human pressures allows us to better understand the contribution of extant lineages to ecosystem functioning in tropical forests.

AB Few studies have inquired about the relationship between myrmecological activity and the granulometry and mineralogy of sediments of a palaeontological site. The objectives of this article are to determine the sedimentological or mineralogical distinctions produced by ants of the species Messor barbarus when excavating their nests and extracting grains and vertebrate fossil remains from the Miocene palaeontological site of Somosaguas (Madrid, Spain), to evaluate the degree of taphonomic influence this myrmecological activity has on the fossil remains, and to decide whether or not it can be used as a tool for palaeontological prospection. Results show that Messor barbarus does not alter fossil remains when examined under a 10 x binocular magnifying glass. Ants preferentially extract from the ant nest grains of medium sizes (0.25-2 mm) compared to the non-ant-modified soils, and also extract a higher quantity of feldspars. These significant granulometric and mineralogical modifications should be considered when carrying out compositional, sedimentological or stratigraphical studies, since these can become biased and alter geological interpretations as provenance or palaeoclimatic signal. Grain size selection could be due to Messor barbarus' physical capacities or the use of clay particles as cementing elements in nests. Mineralogical distinction may be related to feldspars' embayments and pits filled with finer material (mainly smectites), making transportation and pheromone impregnation easier.
   Results show that the ant mounds had increasing concentrations of fossil remains the nearer they were from the main excavation area, therefore the study of ant mounds in potentially fossiliferous zones can indeed be used as a new method of palaeontological prospection.

AB Most of the planet's diversity is concentrated in the tropics, which includes many regions undergoing rapid climate change. Yet, while climate-induced biodiversity changes are widely documented elsewhere, few studies have addressed this issue for lowland tropical ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the floristic and functional composition of intact lowland Amazonian forests have been changing by evaluating records from 106 long-term inventory plots spanning 30 years. We analyse three traits that have been hypothesized to respond to different environmental drivers (increase in moisture stress and atmospheric CO2 concentrations): maximum tree size, biogeographic water-deficit affiliation and wood density. Tree communities have become increasingly dominated by large-statured taxa, but to date there has been no detectable change in mean wood density or water deficit affiliation at the community level, despite most forest plots having experienced an intensification of the dry season. However, among newly recruited trees, dry-affiliated genera have become more abundant, while the mortality of wet-affiliated genera has increased in those plots where the dry season has intensified most. Thus, a slow shift to a more dry-affiliated Amazonia is underway, with changes in compositional dynamics (recruits and mortality) consistent with climate-change drivers, but yet to significantly impact whole-community composition. The Amazon observational record suggests that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is driving a shift within tree communities to large-statured species and that climate changes to date will impact forest composition, but long generation times of tropical trees mean that biodiversity change is lagging behind climate change.

AB Landscape fire is a key but poorly understood component of the global carbon cycle. Predicting biomass consumption by fire at large spatial scales is essential to understanding carbon dynamics and hence how fire management can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase ecosystem carbon storage. An Australia-wide field-based survey (at 113 locations) across large-scale macroecological gradients (climate, productivity and fire regimes) enabled estimation of how biomass combustion by surface fire directly affects continental-scale carbon budgets. In terms of biomass consumption, we found clear trade-offs between the frequency and severity of surface fires. In temperate southern Australia, characterised by less frequent and more severe fires, biomass consumed per fire was typically very high. In contrast, surface fires in the tropical savannas of northern Australia were very frequent but less severe, with much lower consumption of biomass per fire (about a quarter of that in the far south). When biomass consumption was expressed on an annual basis, biomass consumed was far greater in the tropical savannas (>20 times that of the far south). This trade-off is also apparent in the ratio of annual carbon consumption to net primary production (NPP). Across Australia's naturally vegetated land area, annual carbon consumption by surface fire is equivalent to about 11% of NPP, with a sharp contrast between temperate southern Australia (6%) and tropical northern Australia (46%). Our results emphasise that fire management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should focus on fire prone tropical savanna landscapes, where the vast bulk of biomass consumption occurs globally. In these landscapes, grass biomass is a key driver of frequency, intensity and combustion completeness of surface fires, and management actions that increase grass biomass are likely to lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions from savanna fires.

AB What causes individual tree death in tropical forests remains a major gap in our understanding of the biology of tropical trees and leads to significant uncertainty in predicting global carbon cycle dynamics. We measured individual characteristics (diameter at breast height, wood density, growth rate, crown illumination and crown form) and environmental conditions (soil fertility and habitat suitability) for 26 425 trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height belonging to 416 species in a 52-ha plot in Lambir Hills National Park, Malaysia. We used structural equation models to investigate the relationships among the different factors and tree mortality. Crown form (a proxy for mechanical damage and other stresses) and prior growth were the two most important factors related to mortality. The effect of all variables on mortality (except habitat suitability) was substantially greater than expected by chance. Tree death is the result of interactions between factors, including direct and indirect effects. Crown form/damage and prior growth mediated most of the effect of tree size, wood density, fertility and habitat suitability on mortality. Large-scale assessment of crown form or status may result in improved prediction of individual tree death at the landscape scale.

AB Quantifying nutritional dynamics of free-living saprotrophs and symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in the field is challenging, but the stoichiometry of fruiting bodies (sporocarps) may be an effective methodology for this purpose. Carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations of soils, foliage and 146 sporocarp collections were analyzed from 14 Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii stands across a podzolization gradient on Vancouver Island (Canada). N and P concentrations were considerably higher in saprotrophic fungi. Fungal N% increased with soil N content at a greater rate for saprotrophs than ectomycorrhizal fungi, while fungal P% of saprotrophs was more constrained. Fungal N : P was more responsive to soil N : P for ectomycorrhizal fungi (homeostatic regulation coefficient 'H' = 2.9) than saprotrophs (H = 5.9), while N : P of ectomycorrhizal fungi and host tree foliage scaled almost identically. Results underscore the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi as nutrient conduits, supporting host trees, whereas saprotrophs maintain a greater degree of nutritional homeostasis. Site nutrient constraints were shared in equal measure between ectomycorrhizal fungi and host trees, particularly for P, suggesting neither partner benefits from enhanced nutrition at the expense of the other. Sporocarp stoichiometry provides new insights into mycorrhizal relationships and illustrates pervasive P deficiencies across temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.

AB Environmental services from the perspective of the State have as a public policy objective the conservation of natural environments as well as the coverage of plants that provide environmental services to society, while, from the owners' point of view, decisions on the use of forests, whether through forest extraction activities or the change of land use for agricultural or urban activities, depend on the opportunity costs, the conditions of production, and access to economic resources. This chapter conceptualizes the understanding of environmental services from the economic point of view. The contrast and the workings of the payments for ecosystem services and the community forest management are analyzed; whereas in the last section, it examines the current design of ecological flows to appreciate the environmental services provided by rivers and wetlands. This is exemplified in a case study (Capulalpam de Mendez, Oaxaca). From this perspective, this chapter analyzes the current institutional framework that regulates environmental services such as the recognition of the ecological flow and the payment system for environmental services, emphasizing the contrast with the management of forest resources by forest owners and managers.

AB The native vegetation within tree plantations increases the suitability for native biodiversity; however, the regeneration of this vegetation depends on the movement of seeds from the native forest by vertebrates and wind. In the present study, we examined functional patterns of seed dispersal between the native forest and tree plantations with different degrees of contrast. We expected that the movement of seeds between the native forest and plantations would depend on the degree of edge contrast, the dispersal syndrome, and the size/weight of seeds. We sampled the seed rain by using seed traps, and measured vegetation structure in the ecotone between four different plantations and the native forest (300 m inside both the native forest and the plantations) in the Atlantic forest of Argentina during a 12-month period. We weighed wind-dispersed seeds and measured vertebrate-dispersed seeds. Edge effects acted as a filter for seed size/weight of both vertebrate- and wind-dispersed seeds. The abundance and functional diversity of seeds arriving at tree plantations increased with plantation age; large seeds were more sensitive to habitat disturbance than small seeds, independently of the dispersal syndrome. Our results highlight that seed movements between the native forest and human-created habitats largely depend on the interaction between dispersal syndrome, seed size, distance to the edge and habitat contrast. Our results also showed that long-term plantation cycles will increase the functional diversity of seeds in the seed bank and facilitate the regeneration of the native vegetation, and that small mature stands close to the native forest will largely facilitate the arrival of seeds and increase the suitability for native fauna.

AB Tree species selected for planting should exhibit both high survival and fast growth. The growth of a tree or forest plantation is affected by the resource supply (light, water and nutrients), the fraction of resources acquired and resource use efficiency. Leaf traits related to the last two processes have the potential to explain the growth rates. In this study, we evaluated 24 leaf traits (morphological and physiological) at the individual level to investigate whether simple leaf traits can be used to predict the variation in relative growth rates of eight native tree species in a mixed plantation in disturbed areas in Central Amazonia 15 months after planting. Tachigali vulgaris and Trattinnickia rhoifolia exhibited the highest growth rates in both height and diameter, which were approximately three and two times higher than those of Bombacopsis macrocalyx, respectively. Species exhibited different establishment strategies as indicated by the functional leaf trait performance. Tachigali vulgaris, Ochroma pyramidale, Trattinnickia rhoifolia and Ceiba pentandra are efficient resource use species, have high light-saturated photosynthetic rates and are tolerant to high irradiance stress. Endlicheria anomala exhibited the worst performance based on functional traits, with the lowest light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A,) and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F-V/F-M). Of all traits analyzed, 12 leaf traits were correlated with the relative growth rate (RGR). Leaf traits related to resource acquisition, such as individual leaf area, chlorophyll content, leaf water potential and leaf nutrient concentration, were not good predictors of growth. Only stomatal conductance (g(s)) was related to the RGR. Leaf traits related to photosynthetic use efficiency (carbon use efficiency and photosynthetic nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency) explained, on average, 20% and 30% of tree growth in height and diameter, respectively. Resource use efficiency traits were better predictors of growth than the individual physiological traits g(s) and A(max), which explained, on average, 12% and 19% of the growth in height and diameter, respectively. Photosynthetic efficiency-related traits are good predictors of tree growth, and species with high efficiency - such as T. vulgaris, O. pyramidale, T. rhoifolia and C. pentandra - can achieve high growth in Amazonian disturbed areas. The identification of species with better performance during initial establishment can improve the design of mixture plantations in disturbed areas. Additionally, the selection of traits most correlated with growth performance can be more informative for reforestation monitoring; consequently, previous silvicultural interventions can be adopted prior to the reduction in both growth and survival rates.

AB Tree age derived from annual-ring counts provides fundamental information on forest stands and individual trees in temperate forests. However, discontinuous growth in the trunk may cause inaccuracies in annual-ring counts, and the effect of radial growth rate and interspecific differences on discontinuous ring formation have not been evaluated in the same forest stand. We investigated the occurrence of discontinuous rings at the base of 435 tree trunk disks of 16 evergreen and 15 deciduous hardwood tree species growing in a temperate forest of Japan. The effects of tree age and radial growth rate on frequency of discontinuous rings and their interspecific differences were evaluated by a generalized linear mixed-effect model. Discontinuous rings were observed in 29 of the 31 species in 330 individuals, which is about 75% of the total number of individuals examined. The number of discontinuous rings proportionally decreased with the growth rate and increased with the tree age. On the other hand, the effects of the growth rate were different among species. The majority of species at the study site contained frequent discontinuous rings in the trunk base. Annual-ring counts from a single core would lead to underestimation of tree ages in this case. Stem disks or increment cores taken in multiple directions at ground level would be useful for accurate estimation of tree age in temperate hardwood forests.

AB Terrestrial hermit crabs play a significant role in coastal ecology. For example, as seed dis-persers and debris scavengers in coastal forests, they accelerate the decomposition of organic substances. In the Indo-Pacific Ocean, Coenobita rugosus, C. brevimanus, and C. cavipes are the three most common species of terrestrial hermit crab. Because the mechanisms that contribute to the sympatry of these three species of crab have not been identified, this study investigated the three most likely explanations: niche differences, competition, and predation. The results showed that the three species displayed niche differences in terms of seasonal activity, habitat, utilization of shells, and food preference, suggesting that competition for resources is avoided. The habitat of terrestrial hermit crabs in Taiwan is closely associated with that of humans. Our study helps improve our understanding of the ecology of terrestrial hermit crabs and their conservation.

AB The ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are affected by deforestation. Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
   Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies.
   The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC=0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: "Protected areas-Intangible zone" (PC=24%, PI=12.4%), "timber harvesting programs" (PC=21.7%, PI=4.7%), "road network" (PC=18.9%, PI=7.7%), and "poverty rate" (PC=3.7%, PI=6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable "temperature" (PC=7,9%, PI=22.3%) provided information in the overall model.
   The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A test of the biogeographical regionalization of the Mexican Transition Zone (MTZ) is presented, resulting from a Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) based on the distributional patterns of 575 species of the family Curculionidae. The analysis was carried out in three stages. First, a PAE was carried out to define a general regionalization scheme for the MTZ, identifying areas and microareas of endemism for the entire area. Then PAEs were undertaken for each province. Third, a PAE was carried out to determine the relationship between the provinces of the MTZ. The analysis of the entire MTZ resulted in four areas and 57 microareas of endemism, while in the independent analysis of each province, five areas and 67 microareas of endemism were obtained. Both analyses coincide basically in the location of the areas and microareas of endemism, which are subordinated to biogeographic units defined by different authors. In the consensus cladogram of the third stage of the analysis, the Transmexican Volcanic Belt (TVB) is the sister area to the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMOC); then, they are the sister area to the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMOR); and finally the previous provinces are united in a trichotomy with the Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS) and the Chiapas Highlands (CHIS). It is assumed that the differences found when comparing our results with different cladistic biogeographic studies of the MTZ reflect the complexity of the study area. Since the data used to perform the analyses are not uniform, and both geographical units and taxa are different, the comparison between different analyses is difficult.

AB Excessive nitrogen (N) application combined with water shortage has a negative effect on crop production, particularly wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the North China Plain. This study examined root growth and water and nitrogen use efficiencies in wheat grown on loam soil in the North China Plain, from 2012 to 2014 using a fixed-position experiment initiated in 2010. The experiment followed a completely randomized split-plot design with four replications, taking irrigation [no irrigation (WO) versus irrigation at jointing plus flowering (W2)] as the main plot and N treatment (0, 180, 240, and 300 kg N ha(-1)) as the subplot. Compared with WO, W2 increased grain yield and root weight density (RWD) by up to 91.3 and 57.7% in 2012-2013, and 15.5 and 43.0% in 2013-2014, respectively, across all N application rates. Irrigation had no effect on grain water use efficiency (VVUEy), but caused a decrease in biomass WUE at vegetative growth stage (VVUEF) and at grain-filling stage (WUEm). Significant improvements in grain yield and biomass WUE during vegetative growth stage, and reductions in nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) and RWD, were observed with increasing N application. Compared with non-N treatment, N treatment increased yield by up to 98.9 and 93.7% in 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, respectively, decreasing RWD by 12.0 and 16.9%. Correlation analysis further revealed that RWD was positively correlated with grain yield, evapotranspiration (ET) and NUE. NUE was also positively correlated with nitrogen uptake efficiency (UPE). Overall, the findings suggest that optimal N application improves NUE by increasing above-ground nitrogen uptake as a result of optimized RWD and a synchronous increase in WUE, thus increasing yield. Under the experimental conditions, an N application rate of 240 kg N ha(-1) plus irrigation at jointing and flowering is recommended.

AB Habitat quality and its availability affect the structure of communities at a variety of different spatial and environmental scales, including habitat and landscape levels. Analyses conducted at multiple scales have demonstrated the importance of landscape patterns with regard to community structure. We used a multi-scale approach to better understand the composition of small mammal communities in central Brazil. We delimited 24 sampling units for the purpose of investigating the response of small mammal composition at the habitat, patch, and landscape scales, while evaluating quality and availability of habitat in each patch, as well as landscape configuration and landscape composition. We used a Mantel correlogram to check for spatial autocorrelation, and partial redundancy analysis to correlate the matrix of species composition with the matrix of environmental variables. Small mammal composition was spatially structured and correlated with variables at all environmental scales: vegetation structure (fallen logs, lianas, and canopy cover), habitat patch (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]), and landscape composition (total core area-a forest cover metric). Our findings show evidence of the limited dispersal capacity of small mammals and the importance of habitat quality at habitat and patch scales, and habitat availability at the landscape scale, for small mammal composition. This study highlights the importance of a multi-scale approach for understanding community structure in a human-altered landscape.

AB The diversification of ecological roles and related adaptations in closely related species within a lineage is one of the most important processes linking plant evolution and ecology. Plant architecture offers a robust framework to study these processes as it can highlight how plant structure influences plant diversification and ecological strategies. We investigated a case of gradual evolution of branching architecture in Atractocarpus spp. (Rubiaceae), forming a monophyletic group in New Caledonia that has diversified rapidly, predominantly in rainforest understory habitats. We used a transdisciplinary approach to depict architectural variations and revealed multiple evolutionary transitions from a branched (Stone's architectural model) to a monocaulous habit (Corner's architectural model), which involved the functional reduction of branches into inflorescences. We propose an integrative functional index that assesses branching incidence on functional traits influencing both assimilation and exploration functions. We showed that architectural transitions correlate with ecologically important functional traits. Variation in ecologically important traits among closely relatives, as supported by the architectural analysis, is suggestive of intense competition that favored divergence among locally coexisting species. We propose that Pleistocene climatic fluctuations causing expansion and contraction of rainforest could also have offered ecological opportunities for colonizers in addition to the process of divergent evolution.

AB The present study evaluated the floristic and structural composition of a tree community in a Lowland Atlantic Rainforest along a forest continuum in Brazilian southeast, assessing the species distribution among ecological groups. For this purpose, we sampled all trees with PBH >= 15 cm, including palm trees and tree ferns, in a total area of one hectare, divided into subplots of 10x10 m. The studied community was also analyzed through the Shannon diversity index and Pielou equability, and its species distribution among dispersal syndromes and successional classes. We recorded 1,120 living individuals distributed in 131 species of 40 families. The richest families were Myrtaceae (32 species), Fabaceae (12) and Rubiaceae (11), and Euterpe edulis was the most abundant species (11.1% of the total). In the study area, there were found four species on the Livro Vermelho da Flora do Brasil and recorded a dominance of zoochoric species (86.7% of species classified) and non-pioneers (71.6%). The general results of the community structure and species composition were similar with other surveys carried out in the same region of this study. Finally, our results corroborate the great diversity of trees and a dominance of zoochoric and non-pioneer species in the Atlantic Rainforest continuous.

AB In the past decade, floristic studies have rebounded as checklists are fundamental for executing meta-analyses which address ecological, biogeographic and evolutionary questions of broad geographic scope. Despite the importance of checklists as baseline records of local diversity and distributions, few attempts have been made to quantify sampling effort and species detectability within and among study sites. Quantitative floristics, which combines the use of checklists with statistical methods for estimating local richness, is a promising method for characterizing the completeness of checklists especially for cryptic components of biodiversity. For bryophytes, quantifying levels of detectability among substrate types is of central importance, especially in tropical forests where much of their diversity is harbored in difficult to access habitats such as the tree canopy. In light of the need to establish quantifiable protocols of detectability in poorly studied tropical regions, we present a bryophyte checklist for the Jai National Park (JNP), located in the heart of the Amazon, and estimate local species richness and detectability as it relates to five substrate types (epiphytes, epiphylls, epixylic, epipetric and soil). Identifications from 712 collections made during four excursions over the past decade to JNP revealed 150 species consisting of two new country records and five new state records, along with 20 rarely collected Amazonian endemics. Despite our intensive sampling, which included systematic canopy collections during one of the excursions, Chao richness index estimated that ca. 46 species (nearly one-third of those presently observed) remain undetected from JNP. Furthermore, levels of detectability among substrates varied widely, where observed epiphyte richness, in contrast to the other substrates types, most closely approximated the estimates. Our results illustrate the need for quantitative richness estimates as a means to increase the accuracy of checklist data, particularly when used in meta-analyses addressing global-scale questions.

AB Understanding how species are distributed in space and time is a focal element guiding conservational efforts under ongoing climate change and the Holocene extinction. Freshwater habitats are currently one of the most threatened ecosystem types, and studies aiming to unravel factors that govern biodiversity of tropical stream micro-organisms are especially scarce. Diatoms play an important role as primary producers in streams and are widely used as ecological indicators. However, relatively little is known about which factors affect diatom communities in the tropics.
   Here, we studied benthic diatom diversity across 67 tropical streams spanning stream orders 1-5 in Kenya. We examined whether the hypothesis of latitudinal diversity gradient applies for benthic diatoms, i.e. whether tropical streams encompass more species than boreal streams using a comparable boreal dataset. In addition, we studied which environmental, land use and spatial factors control benthic diatom communities using redundancy analysis. We also examined the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity, factors contributing to diatom species richness, and the uniqueness of the communities across stream orders by using boosted regression trees and local contribution to beta diversity. Finally, we studied whether environmental heterogeneity and beta diversity are related across stream orders and tested their relationship using tests of homogeneity of dispersion and regression analysis.
   Species richness was not higher in tropical streams than in boreal ones. Tropical diatom communities were controlled jointly by local environmental and spatial factors. Although water chemistry was the most important controlling factor, also physical variables contributed significantly to community variation. Land use had also a significant effect on diatom communities as broad leaved forest streams harboured different diatom communities compared with streams with higher human impact and conductivity, stressing the importance of forests to water quality and diatom biodiversity. Headwater streams encompassed the highest species turnover, whereas nestedness was higher in higher order streams. Species richness was significantly higher in higher order streams than in headwaters, whereas the uniqueness of the communities peaked in headwaters. Environmental heterogeneity was the highest in headwater streams and was related to high beta diversity, which highlights the importance of habitat heterogeneity to biodiversity. Our results stress the management and conservational importance of headwater streams and tropical montane forests as these environments harbour unique diatom communities important for regional diversity.

AB River floodplains are subject to different inundation scenarios, mainly related to the flood pulse. Moreover, the ecology of floodplain lakes is modulated by exchanges of water with the main stream. On Amazonian flood plains, the water level fluctuates seasonally, with four distinct stages during the year: rising, high, falling, and low water. This study evaluated how/which three functional approaches to phytoplankton (FG, functional groups; MFG, morphofunctional groups; and MBFG, morphology-based functional groups) showed the largest relation to the environmental variations in response to rising and falling water periods, using data of the seven lakes sampled during rising and falling water periods, on the Curuai Floodplain system, Para state, Brazil. We used a Principal Coordinates Analysis to check for differences in phytoplankton species composition between the rising and falling water periods and a Redundancy Analysis to evaluate the relationship between functional approaches and environmental. Electrical conductivity, silica, and pH were the most important environmental variables to structuring the phytoplankton. The biological dissimilarity was computed using Bray-Curtis index for species biovolume and indicated greater similarity among the species compositions in the lakes during the falling water period. During rising water species is adapted in almost all lentic ecosystems (FG Y) and autotrophic organisms typical from the meroplanktonic that can be found in phytoplankton samples of the shallow lakes (FG MP); cryptomonads (MFG 2d), large centrics (MFG 6a), and large pennates (MFG 6b); and non flagellated organisms with siliceous exoskeletons (MBFG VI) and unicellular flagellates of medium to large size (MBFG V) were predominant. During falling water, species that tolerate eutrophic to hypertrophic environments with low nitrogen content predominated all shallow lakes (FGs H1 and M; MFGs 5e and 5b; and MBFGs III and VII) and Dolichospermum spp. formed blooms. Morphology-based functional groups were the larger relation with the environmental variations than did functional groups and morphofunctional groups. MBFGs provides a relatively simple and objective classification and were the best in characterizing phytoplankton dynamics on the Curuai floodplain. Therefore, we recommend using these groups to study phytoplankton ecology in shallow floodplain lakes.

AB The tropical dry forest (TDF) is one the most threatened ecosystems in South America, existing on a landscape with different levels of ecological succession. Among satellites dedicated to Earth observation and monitoring ecosystem succession, CHRIS/PROBA is the only satellite that presents quasi-simultaneous multi-angular pointing and hyperspectral imaging. These two characteristics permit the study of structural and compositional differences of TDFs with different levels of succession. In this paper, we use 2008 and 2014 CHRIS/PROBA images from a TDF in Minas Gerais, Brazil to study ecosystem succession after abandonment. Using a -55 degrees angle of observation; several classifiers including spectral angle mapper (SAM), support vector machine (SVM), and decision trees (DT) were used to test how well they discriminate between different successional stages. Our findings suggest that the SAM is the most appropriate method to classify TDFs as a function of succession (accuracies similar to 80 for % for late stage, similar to 85% for the intermediate stage, similar to 70% for early stage, and similar to 50% for other classes). Although CHRIS/PROBA cannot be used for large-scale/long-term monitoring of tropical forests because of its experimental nature; our results support the potential of using multi-angle hyperspectral data to characterize the structure and composition of TDFs in the near future.

AB Ants are abundant and ecologically dominant insects in most terrestrial communities. In subtropical ecosystems, there is a high turnover of species from the canopy to the top layers of the soil. Additionally, ant communities are often influenced by inter-specific competition. Collectively, these two processes (abiotic filtering and competition) make ants ideal for studies of community structure. We examined composition, co-occurrence, and species interactions in a sub-tropical forest ant community to examine how ground-foraging ant species partition microhabitats. We used four methods: pitfall traps, litter samples, surface baits, and subterranean baits. Surface baiting was employed at three different time periods to examine how foraging activity and species interactions at baits varied with time of day and temperature. Each method sampled a particular assemblage of the 97 total ant species. Pitfall traps shared similar to 50% of species with surface baits and litter samples. Subterranean baits had the fewest total species but included some uncommonly sampled ants.The majority of interactions between species at baits were neutral, but a few agonistic interactions were also observed when bait occupancy was highest. Species co-occurrence patterns suggest that this ant community may not be heavily influenced by interspecific competition. Our results reinforce the advantages of applying complementary sampling techniques to examine ant community structure, and suggest that competition and dominance is best considered in the context of resource type, foraging strategy and time of sampling. Finally, we discuss the lack of two conspicuous Neotropical groups in our samples, leaf-cutting ant and army ants.

AB Although ecological theory has historically focused on negative interactions among populations, like competition and predation, ecologists and conservation biologists highlight the significance of interdependence. It is not clear, however, what is asserted in the causal hypothesis that one population is interdependent on others. This essay argues that the most informative causal regularities for representing dependencies are those connecting populations through environmental constraint variables. Interdependence among populations can thus be understood as constraint-mediated dependency relations connected in a circuit.

AB Tree growth in the tropics is strongly influenced by climate. However, reported tree growth responses to climate are largely inconsistent, varying with geographic location, forest type, and tree species. It is thus important to study the growth responses of tropical trees in sites and species that are under-represented so far. Bangladesh, a country influenced by the Asian monsoon climate, is understudied in terms of tree growth response to climate. In the present study, we developed a 121-year-long regional ring-width index chronology of Chukrasia tabularis A. Juss. sampled in two moist forest sites in Bangladesh to investigate tree growth responses to climate in monsoon South Asia. Standard dendrochronological methods were used to produce the ring-width chronologies. The climate sensitivity of C. tabularis was assessed through bootstrap correlation analysis and the stationarity and consistency of climate-growth relationships was evaluated using moving correlation functions and comparing the regression slopes of two sub-periods (1950-1985 and 1986-2015). Tree growth was negatively correlated with the mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures, particularly during the early growing season (March). Likewise, precipitation negatively influenced tree growth in the later growing season (October). Besides, radial growth of Chukrasia sharply ceased in years following strong and moderate El Nino events. In parallel with a significant positive trend in local temperatures, tree growth sensitivity to early growing season (March-April) mean temperatures and July minimum temperatures increased in recent decades. Tree growth sensitivity to October precipitation and April vapor pressure deficit also increased. Overall, climate-growth relationships were stronger during the period 1986-2015 than during 1950-1985. Changes in climate sensitivity might be linked to a warming trend that induced an increase in the dry season length during recent decades. With a further predicted temperature increase at our study sites, our results suggest that radial growth of C. tabularis will further decline in response to climate warming.

AB A study involving several Clavariadelphus species present in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (FVTM, for short from Spanish: Faja Volcanica Transmexicana) was carried out to recognize patterns in richness and endemism. The study area was divided into a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude grid where 240 records from 14 national collections, specialized literature and institutional database were located. The data obtained show that the species richness present are heterogeneously distributed, where the highest number of species and records are concentrate at the central and eastern portions of the FVTM. The Complementarity Index (IC) for each combination of grid-cells resulted in relatively high values. Within the FVTM, 5 grid-cells are enough to represent the complete range of species from the genus Clavariadelphus in central Mexico. The grid-cell with the highest species richness and value of endemism coincides with the Natural Protected Area known as the Corredor Biologico Chichinautzin-Tepozteco, Morelos-Ciudad de Mexico-Estado de Mexico. It is concluded that the FVTM is a biodiverse zone of species of Clavariadelphus within which 68.4% of the total species known to the world are concentrated.

AB In the present article, a summary and analysis of literature published in Mexico on the removal and burial of dung by dung beetles, a primary function that represents an ecosystem service of great importance for livestock production, is presented. Studies from distinct ecosystems are examined, emphasizing the findings in livestock pastures with active grazing in several different states of Mexico. In addition, the unpublished results of the authors obtained in pastures across an altitudinal gradient in central Veracruz are presented for a dung exposure time of 24 hours. No significant differences were found in species richness among sites. However, differences were found in the dung removal rate; higher values were found at the sites with higher elevation and lower values at sites with lower elevation. The species with the highest biomass included the 3 largest species and small but very abundant species. Nocturnal tunnelers reincorporated the largest quantity of dung over the first 24 hours; in contrast, rollers only removed dung at the lowest areas of the gradient (< 250 m asl). However, much more information is still required regarding the capacity of the different functional groups and dung beetle species for dung burial in the livestock production zones of Mexico.

AB Theoretical and experimental research studies have shown that ecosystems governed by non-transitive competition networks tend to maintain high levels of biodiversity. The theoretical body of work, however, has mainly focused on competition networks in which the outcomes of competition events are predetermined and hence deterministic, and where all species are identical up to their competitive relationships, an assumption that may limit the applicability of theoretical results to real-life situations. In this paper, we aim to probe the robustness of the link between biodiversity and non-transitive competition by introducing a three-dimensional winning probability parameter space, making the outcomes of competition events in a three-species in silico ecosystem uncertain. While two degenerate points in this parameter space have been the subject of previous studies, we investigate the remaining settings, which equip the species with distinct competitive abilities. We find that the impact of this modification depends on the spatial dimension of the system. When the system is well mixed, it collapses to monoculture, as is also the case in the non-transitive deterministic setting. In one dimension, chaotic patterns emerge, which tend to maintain biodiversity, and a power law relates the time that species manage to coexist to the degree of uncertainty regarding competition event outcomes. In two dimensions, the formation of spiral wave patterns ensures that biodiversity is maintained for moderate degrees of uncertainty, while considerable deviations from the non-transitive deterministic setting have strong negative effects on species coexistence. It can hence be concluded that non-transitive competition can still produce coexistence when the assumption of deterministic competition is abandoned. When the system collapses to monoculture, one observes a "survival of the strongest" law, as the species that has the highest probability of defeating its competitors has the best odds to become the sole survivor.

AB Fire is a constitutive ecological force in savanna ecosystems, but few studies have monitored its short-term effects on plant community dynamics. This study investigated changes in plant diversity in the South American savanna (Cerrado) after severe disturbance by fire. We monitored 30 permanent plots (10 m x 5 m) distributed in two Cerrado physiognomies (tipico: more forested; ralo: grass-dominated), being 10 plots in the area disturbed by fire, and five in a preserved control area (undisturbed). From August 2010 to June 2011, we evaluated changes in species richness, abundance and composition of savanna vegetation. Monitoring started one week after the fire; disturbed plots were surveyed monthly, while control plots were surveyed every two months. We observed rapid reassembling in both physiognomies: plots affected by fire showed rapid increase in species richness and plant density during the first four months after the disturbance. Concerning species composition, disturbed plots in the cerrado tipico tended to converge to control plots after one year, but each local assemblage followed particular temporal trajectories. A different pattern characterized cerrado ralo plots, which showed heterogeneous trajectories and lack of convergence between disturbed and control plots; the structure of these assemblages will likely change in next years. In conclusion, our results showed that fire significantly affected plant diversity in the two savanna physiognomies (cerrado tipico and ralo), but also indicated that community reassembling is fast, with different dynamics between Cerrado physiognomies.

AB Natural enemies of plants such as insect herbivores can contribute to structuring and maintaining plant diversity in tropical forests. Most research in this area has focused on the role of specialized enemies and the extent to which herbivory on individual plant species is density-dependent. Relatively few insect herbivores specialize on a single host plant species. Insect herbivores that feed on more than one plant species may link the regeneration dynamics of their host species through "apparent competition" or "apparent mutualism." We investigated herbivory and survival of seedlings of two tropical tree species (Cordia alliodora and Cordia bicolor) in the forests of Barro Colorado Island (Panama). We used experiments and observations to assess seedling fate in relation to the presence of conspecifics and heterospecifics across a range of spatial scales. Herbivory significantly increased seedling mortality and was highest at high local densities of C. alliodora seedlings. There was also evidence that high local densities of C. alliodora increased herbivory on co-occurring C. bicolor seedlings. Synthesis. The elevated rates of seedling herbivory at high densities of conspecifics documented in our study are consistent with the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, which explains how so many plant species can coexist in tropical forests. Our data also highlight the possibility that herbivore-mediated density-dependence, facilitated by herbivores that feed on multiple plant species, can also occur across plant species. Enemy-mediated indirect effects of this sort have the potential to structure plant communities.

AB Fire plays an intrinsic role in shaping the biophysical attributes of savanna ecosystems. Savanna fires limit vegetation biomass below their climatically determined potential, but the magnitude of this effect and how it varies across heterogeneous landscapes are poorly understood. In this study, we explore woody tree structure and canopy characteristics across a fire manipulation experiment that has been maintained for 63 yr in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Our study design assessed three late dry-season fire regimes (biennial, triennial, and unburnt) across a precipitation gradient (737-496 mm/yr) spanning four different landscapes with a mixture of sandy and clay soils. We used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to quantify tree height, canopy cover, and aboveground carbon storage across the experimental treatments. Vegetation physiognomy was influenced by the interaction between landscape and fire frequency. In the absence of fire, woody height, cover, and biomass increased with increasing rainfall. The presence of fire acted to reduce structure and biomass as expected, but the magnitude of this effect increased with increasing rainfall. We found minimal difference between the effects of biennial or triennial burning-except at the wettest site where the triennial fire plots had half the biomass of those burnt biennially. The rainfall dependent fire-vegetation relationships shown here provide empirical quantification of top-down constraint by fire and highlight the challenges of predicting responses to disturbances in these inherently heterogeneous ecosystems. Robust quantification of 3D structure and dynamics through TLS will be useful for constraining carbon stock models and predicting trajectories of change under future climate and land-use conditions.

AB The carnivorous keystone muricid species Concholepas concholepas (Bruguiere, 1789) is known in Chile as "loco," in Peru as "pata de burro, tolina, or chanque." and in international markets as "false abalone." The loco is present along the coast of Chile, in the Archipelago of Juan Fernandez and in southern and central Peril, and its range of distribution spans over 5,000 kin of intertidal and shallow subtidal reefs. In Chile, the loco is a traditional food resource and has been heavily exploited since the early Holocene by intertidal food-gathers and free divers, and since the 1950s; 60s by a small-scale artisan fleet of hookah-divers. In Chile, since the mid-1970s, the species has been mainly exported (foot-meat) to Asian markets, and between 1976 and 1980 market demands acted as a major driving force behind overexploitation of the loco. Since the 1990s, its fishery moved from an open access regime to a comanagement regulated policy based on territorial user rights for fisheries (TURF) and reproductive fishery bans. The loco, as an iconic species, played a key role in the implementation of TURF. In Peru, the loco fishery operates under a reproductive ban fishery regime and its export started in the late 1990s. In Chile, the loco is by far the most intensely studied of all exploited shellfishes in terms of evolution, paleobiogeography, biogeography, life history, behavior. physiology, ecology. genetics, and fishery. Moreover, the loco has been used as a biological model to study responses to global stressors such as ocean warming and acidification.
   During the past 20 y, several laboratory experimental attempts have been made to advance experimental, pilot, and commercial aquaculture of the loco. Nevertheless, the available information shows that no reliable and repeatable pilot or massive aquaculture protocols have yet succeeded. In this study, the extensive field and laboratory information for the most relevant life history phases of the loco, such as reproduction, mating, brood-stock holding, egg capsule deposition, larval posthatching, growing to competence, larval feeding, settlement and metamorphosis to juvenile stages, and pilot growing experiences to adult sizes are reviewed. In light of the available information, the most critical aquaculture bottlenecks are identified. Among them, the existence, from hatching to competence, of a long larval planktonic phase of about 3-4 mo, and the existence of cannibalism during postsettlement confined laboratory conditions are highlighted. Moreover. key aspects of the larval rearing of the loco. such as densities, field and laboratory food items, and temperatures are reported. The field collection of (1) competent larvae of locos in inshore coastal plankton; (2) new settlers from rocky shores; and (3) new settlers from fishery-discarded conspecific shells are also discussed. The collection of competent larvae was followed by laboratory induction to settlement and by two consecutive postsettlement rearing/growing phases (laboratory and field conditions) to overcome difficulties associated with the long larval phase and to speed up the time required to reach trading sizes. Furthermore, collection of new settlers was followed by rearing experiments under both laboratory and field conditions. The need of high demands of live prey (mainly mussels) during the laboratory rearing of the early benthic stages of loco is discussed, emphasizing that to implement ecologically sustainable aquaculture practices, parallel aquaculture of the appropriated prey is needed. A review of what is already known regarding the biology of C. concholepas is provided along with progress and pit-falls for the aquaculture of this species. The practicality for its aquaculture and the main challenges ahead are also discussed.

AB Coffee agroforestry systems are a promising approach to the challenge of sustaining both biodiversity and livelihoods in tropical landscapes. However, coffee farmers' response to the unrelenting coffee leaf rust (CLR) outbreak may have repercussions for the potential of coffee agroforestry systems to contribute to biodiversity conservation. Adaptations in management practices could affect the extent to which farmers rely on ecological processes vs. external inputs (e.g., agrochemicals) to support production. This study investigates farmers' response to CLR outbreak through a study in a forest frontier in a Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted household surveys and fieldwork before the CLR outbreak in 2011-2012 (n = 59), and follow-up surveys after the outbreak in 2016 (n = 48). Before CLR outbreak, farmers were cultivating Arabica coffee varieties in agroforestry systems and generally following agroecological approaches. Most farmers (82%) were certified organic and did not employ synthetic agrochemicals. Farmers (66%) had plans to expand their Arabica coffee agroforests either into forest (35%) or fallow (31%) in response to high farm gate prices. After CLR outbreak, 94% of farmers had CLR-resistant hybrid coffee varieties (HCV) in their possession and were either incorporating them by substituting affected Arabica coffee plants in existing fields, or by establishing new coffee fields with HCV at lower elevations. In attempts to control CLR, farmers (54%) also applied agrochemicals at least once and, to a lesser extent (19%), removed shade trees. Among the farmers (63%) who were planning on expanding coffee production with HCV, more farmers were planning on expanding on fallow (46%) than forest (17%) compared to the period before CLR outbreak (p-value < 0.05). Public and private actors promoted and distributed saplings of HCV and agrochemicals along with technical assistance. The promotion of HCV along with fertilizers may result in a substitution of ecosystem functions with agrochemicals, and the need to acquire seeds and saplings outside of farmers' own resource base and networks. This shift in management strategies generates new instabilities and risks by introducing a new market for HCV about which little is known and by making external agents the holders of productive resources and knowledge.

AB More than half of Brazilian territory (54%), or approx. 463 million ha, is covered by forests. Public forest ownership dominates with up to 80%, private forests cover cca. 20% and cca. 8% is unclaimed. In public forests the practice of concessions is growing, with the expectation of reducing the problem of Amazonian illegal loggings. Private forests are mainly under plantation management, which generates 5.5% of the country's industrial gross domestic product. Relevance of both is accordingly high, although not dominant in forest share. A key question for forest policy is how successfully the state regulates both issues in practice. Our paper accordingly focuses on the Brazilian Forest Service and the Ministry of Agriculture, which are state forest institutions in charge of forest concessions and planted forests. We look at their performance against legally based forestry goals and rely on primary (participatory observation, semi-structured personal interviews and questionnaire) and secondary sources (documents) for empirical evidence. The 3 L Model serves as a theoretical basis. It was selected while applying criteria and indicators for evaluation of public institutions' comprehensive performance with respect to sustainable forest management. The results show that Brazilian forest policy strives toward sustainable forest management, as an overall goal. In more particular, the performance of both examined state forest institutions is more market (than public demand) oriented and moves towards strengthening market competences. At the same time, there are constrains in sustaining forest stands. Due to permanent and strong conflicts related to land use changes in Brazil, the relevance of a mediator, aiming to harmonize all different interests related to forest protection and use, is high, but this role is still not taken, at least not by the evaluated state forest institutions. This represents new task for the forestry practice, while facilitating diverse interests in Brazilian forests could not only be a contribution toward conflict management between environmental, forestry and agribusiness actors but could also grant stronger political role to respective state forest institution(s). For attending this role, the performance evaluation of the whole and rather complex forest-related institutional setting in Brazil could provide relevant science-based policy arguments. This paper shows that the 3 L Model could be applied for such evaluation, as it was possible to adapt it to a non-European country and get a comprehensive overview of Brazilian plantation and concession forestry in practice.

AB Tree physiological processes are affected not only by environmental conditions, but also by phenological leaf stages. During foliar expansion, rapid changes occur, such as the activation of metabolic processes that encompass a hydraulic link between xylem and phloem pathways at a whole-tree level. Daily and seasonal changes in stem diameter may reveal different temporal dynamics of water use and recharge in tree reservoirs. Foliar phenological patterns were studied in relation to stem dimensional changes in 10 canopy tree species with different phenological patterns (three deciduous, three brevideciduous and four evergreen species). Additionally, we assessed (i) daily sap flow fluctuations in branch and main stem, (ii) diurnal changes in sapwood volumetric water content and (iii) stem radius variations during leafless, expanding and mature leaves periods in three of the 10 tree species (two deciduous and one brevideciduous). During the leaf expansion phase, the diameter of trees decreased in all 10 species, with a larger impact on deciduous and brevideciduous species. For the subset of deciduous and brevideciduous species, the movement of long-distance water transport occurred first near the branches and then in the main stem during the leafless stage. Changes in stored water use and a decrease in the volumetric water content and the radius of the main stem during this period suggest that there is a contribution of water from internal stem reservoirs toward the construction of new leaves.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the drought tolerance, compensatory growth, and different plant traits between two native perennial caespitose grasses and two native rhizomatous grasses in response to drought and defoliation. A randomized complete block design at the Swift Current Research and Development Centre (SCRDC) of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) examined the effects of water stress and clipping on the plant biomass, plant morphological traits, and relative leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD value) of four native grasses (caespitose grass: Hesperostipa comata and H. curtiseta; rhizomatous grass: Pascopyrum smithii and Elymus lanceolatus). Drought drastically decreased the shoot and root biomass, plant height, number of tillers and leaf growth of P. smithii and E. lanceolatus, as well as the rhizome biomass and R/S ratio of P. smithii. Defoliation had a positive effect on the shoot biomass of P. smithii and E. lanceolatus under well water treatments (100% and 85% of field capacity). However, the compensatory growth of P. smithii and E. lanceolatus significantly declined with increased water stress. In addition, there are no significant changes in plant biomass, plant height, number of tillers and leaves, and SPAD value of H. comata and H. curtiseta under relative dry condition (70% of field capacity). Consequently, these results demonstrated that the rhizomatous grasses possessed a stronger compensation in response to defoliation under wet conditions, but the positive effects of defoliation can be weakened by drought. The caespitose grasses (Hesperostipa species) exhibited a greater drought tolerance than rhizomatous grasses due to the relatively stable plant traits in response to water stress.

AB With ongoing rapid anthropogenic deforestation and habitat degradation, it is critical that we understand the role of human-disturbed areas in conserving the biodiversity of the world. Despite intensive deforestation in Southeast Asia, there are few studies investigating faunal communities in human-modified landscapes there. We assessed herpetofauna in dry dipterocarp forest, disturbed forest, and Eucalyptus plantations in the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve of Thailand. In May and June of 2015, we conducted surveys using 12 passive trapping arrays with funnel and pitfall traps. We captured 436 individuals representing 38 species, with 266 amphibians (13 species) and 170 reptiles (25 species). The Eucalyptus plantations and highly disturbed forest sites hosted higher amphibian abundance and richness than protected areas of dry dipterocarp forest. Reptile species richness did not differ between habitat types, but capture rates in the Eucalyptus plantations were significantly higher than in the dry dipterocarp forest. Funnel traps yielded significantly higher reptile capture rates than pitfall traps. For reptiles, the results support other studies, which have concluded that reptiles are less sensitive than amphibians to disturbance and possibly positively affected by human disturbance in some cases. The terrestrial amphibian abundance and species richness documented here indicate that disturbed habitats may provide suitable areas for these species.

AB Riverine systems are primary habitats for aquatic species. Great efforts have been made to understand interaction between aquatic organism and various environmental factors in specific reaches of a river, yet little was known about how to identify habitats in river networks. In this paper, a comprehensive approach was proposed for identification of aquatic habitats in hierarchical river systems in terms of integrated geocodes synthesized through over-layer of multiple factors such as geologic periods, climatic conditions, water sources, geomorphic characteristics and river patterns. Using this approach in the Yellow River Basin over an area of 758,600 km(2), six groups of aquatic habitats were classified by clustering of 85 geocodes, and 313 sub-habitats were further identified by considering both surface composition (e.g., lithological features and soil texture) and topographic property (e.g., elevation and slope) in the loess geomorphic regions. Consequently, the contribution of the headwater streams to diversity of aquatic habitats among rivers and mid-sized rivers to the diversity within a river has been revealed by coupling of the geocode-based habitats and the river networks. The present study is of significance to efficient capture of habitat diversity and better understanding of biodiversity in rivers of different stream orders.

AB Forest-habitat loss and fragmentation reduce connectivity, presenting dispersal challenges for many forest-dependent species with deleterious effects on community structure and diversity. It is expected that avian forest specialists are vulnerable to fragmentation, yet seasonal migrants may be more resilient to isolation effects than sedentary specialists. We surveyed bird communities in 138 habitat patches of the critically endangered Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, South Africa, across a range of isolation distances from mainland forests during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. We quantified taxonomic and functional diversity per patch based on species' traits and performed 26 generalized linear mixed-effects models on the effects of isolation and the amount of habitat in the surrounding matrix on avian trait-diversity measurements. We compared diversity measures between seasons for evidence of resilience to isolation effects for migrants and compared linear regressions of isolation-distance effects to segmented regressions at various isolation distances to explore dispersal limits of sedentary forest specialists. All avian diversity measures were higher during the breeding season. The amount of surrounding habitat was a positive driver of all diversity measures. Isolation-distance effects had the most negative effect during the breeding season, and on sedentary forest specialists, which were unable to disperse across isolation distances >500m. Sedentary forest specialists are a conservation priority given (a) their value in perpetuating ecosystem services and (b) their vulnerability to isolation effects. Migratory forest specialists exhibited resilience to the isolation effect during non-breeding; thus, certain specialized niches may be occupied given the vagility of migratory forest specialists.

AB As marine systems are threatened by increasing human impacts, mechanisms to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are needed. Protecting areas of conservation importance may serve as a proxy for maintaining these functions, while also facilitating efficient use and management of limited resources. Biodiversity hotspots have been used as surrogates for spatial conservation importance; however, as many protected areas have been established opportunistically and under differing criteria, it is unclear how well they actually protect hotspots. We evaluated how well the current protected area network and priority areas selected through previous systematic conservation planning exercises preserve biodiversity hotspots in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We also determined spatial congruence between biodiversity hotspots based on different criteria, which may determine their ability to be used as surrogates for each other. We focus on the Gulf of California because it is a megadiverse system where limited information regarding species diversity and distribution has constrained development of strategies for conservation and management. We developed a species occurrence database and identified biodiversity hotspots using four different criteria: species richness, rarity, endemism, and threatened species. We interpolated species occurrence, while accounting for heterogeneous sampling efforts. We then assessed overlap of hotspots with existing protected areas and priority areas, and between hotspots derived by distinct criteria. We gathered 286,533 occurrence records belonging to 12,105 unique species, including 6388 species identified as rare, 642 as endemic, and 386 as threatened. We found that biodiversity hotspots showed little spatial overlap with areas currently under protection and previously identified priority areas. Our results highlight the importance of distinct spatial areas of biodiversity and suggest that different ecological mechanisms sustain different aspects of diversity and multiple criteria should be used when defining conservation areas.

AB The environmental impacts of energy generation plants, especially those with large dams, have been widely discussed in the Amazon region, but little attention has been paid to the impacts of the associated transmission lines. These impacts are likely to be substantial given the wide geographic extent of the lines and the relatively high forest cover in the traversed areas. Publicly available information about the location and extent of the transmission line network in the Amazon is neither accurate nor current, and its environmental impacts on terrestrial ecosystems have not been assessed on a large scale. This study estimates the scale of the impact of the current and planned transmission and distribution line network using a hand-digitized dataset and the predicted impact area determined from Environmental Impact Assessments.
   The Legal Amazon region contains 39,625 km of verified transmission and distribution lines, estimated to directly impact 23,467 km(2) of land. We find that the transmission line network directly impacts double the area flooded by hydroelectric reservoirs in the Legal Amazon. Of the direct impact area, 5.1% is within protected areas and 10.3% overlaps with intact forest. By 2026, the transmission line network is estimated to grow by 37% in the Legal Amazon, increasing the direct impact to forests by 70% and to protected lands by 29%. Transmission lines are impacting enough land to be considered a serious conservation threat and should be treated as such in research and environmental planning in the Amazon region.

AB One of the main goals of community ecology is to measure the relative importance of environmental filters to understand patterns of species distribution at different temporal and spatial scales. Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats arc defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi-Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity' associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.

AB Tropical dry forests (hereafter TDFs) have been extensively logged and converted into croplands or grasslands worldwide. Tumbesian forests in southwest Ecuador are among the most diverse and endangered TDFs. They face seasonal droughts of varied severity and are also subjected to episodic very wet and cloudy conditions during El Nino events. However, we lack a local quantification of their responses to regional climate (temperature, precipitation, cloud cover) and El Nino which could change across sites. Here we use dendrochronology to quantify the radial-growth rates and the responses to climate (mean temperatures, precipitation amount, cloud cover and drought severity) of two major tree species forming annual rings (Geoffroea spinosa, Handroanthus chrysanthus) in three TDFs with different local climate conditions. The lowest (1.0 mm yr(-1)) and the highest (2.1 mm yr(-1)) radial-growth rates of both tree species were found in the hottest-driest and moderately hot sites, respectively. G. spinosa growth responded positively to wet, cool and cloudy conditions in the hottest-driest and moderately hot sites, but the most intense response to drought was observed in the driest site at 1-5 months long scales. H. chrysanthus growth reacted positively to high growing-season precipitation in all sites, particularly in the driest site, and to cloudy conditions in moderately hot sites. The growth of H. chrysanthus was negatively associated to the Southern Oscillation Index in the dry-hot and in the moderately hot sites. Tree species coexisting in TDFs show varied growth responses to regional weather variability, drought severity and El Nino events across sites with different local climate conditions.

AB Forest fragmentation can lead to habitat reduction, edge increase, and exposure to disturbances. A key emerging policy to protect forests is payments for ecosystem services (PES), which offers compensation to landowners for environmental stewardship. Mexico was one of the first countries to implement a broad-scale PES program, enrolling over 2.3 Mha by 2010. However, Mexico's PES did not completely eliminate deforestation in enrolled parcels and could have increased incentives to hide deforestation in ways that increased fragmentation. We studied whether Mexican forests enrolled in the PES program had less forest fragmentation than those not enrolled, and whether the PES effects varied among forest types, among socioeconomic zones, or compared to the protected areas system. We analyzed forest cover maps from 2000 to 2012 to calculate forest fragmentation. We summarized fragmentation for different forest types and in four socioeconomic zones. We then used matching analysis to investigate the possible causal impacts of the PES on forests across Mexico and compared the effects of the PES program with that of protected areas. We found that the area covered by forest in Mexico decreased by 3.4% from 2000 to 2012, but there was 9.3% less forest core area. Change in forest cover was highest in the southern part of Mexico, and high-stature evergreen tropical forest lost the most core areas (-17%), while oak forest lost the least (-2%). Our matching analysis found that the PES program reduced both forest cover loss and forest fragmentation. Low-PES areas increased twice as much of the number of forest patches, forest edge, forest islets, and largest area of forest lost compared to high-PES areas. Compared to the protected areas system in Mexico, high-PES areas performed similarly in preventing fragmentation, but not as well as biosphere reserve core zones. We conclude that the PES was successful in slowing forest fragmentation at the regional and country level. However, the program could be improved by targeting areas where forest changes are more frequent, especially in southern Mexico. Fragmentation analyses should be implemented in other areas to monitor the outcomes of protection programs such as REDD+ and PES.

This model is applied to cases with less effective ("diluted") incentives, in two ways: the sponsor must compensate all farmers in a group instead of only the single farmer targeted ("group incentives"); and a fraction of REDD+ payments is captured by an elite not directly involved in forest protection, and not worthy of support by a benevolent sponsor ("elite capture"). I extend the traditional REDD + literature by including "benevolent" sponsors who are fully concerned with the welfare of the target (farmer) group. Payments are then increased, perhaps dramatically; but reduced by a selfish sponsor. An efficient solution can then be attained by a benevolent sponsor, albeit only for a high PES payment. With elite capture, payments are reduced for all sponsors, and full efficiency never attained. With selfish sponsors no viable PES scheme may exist. When the group incentive scheme rewards only farmers who save their forests, incentives are not eroded by the scheme.

AB Are communities limited by biotic interactions, or are they random draws from regional species pools? One way to tell is to compare total species counts in geographic regions to average counts in ecological samples falling within those regions. If species richness is limited regionally, then the relationship should be curvilinear even in a log-log space. Global sets of samples including trees and 10 groups of animals are analysed to test this hypothesis. Most relationships are indeed curvilinear. To explain these patterns, a simple model is proposed that invokes biotic interaction-limited speciation or immigration rates combined with extinction or extirpation rates that fall as the number of occupied patches increases. Local and regional richness come into balance as the rates trade off, causing global richness to also be limited. Surprisingly, however, the data for trees break the pattern, suggesting that the great adaptive radiation of seed plants may still be unfolding.

AB Biological diversity depends on the interplay between evolutionary diversification and ecological mechanisms allowing species to coexist. Current research increasingly integrates ecology and evolution over a range of timescales, but our common conceptual framework for understanding species coexistence requires better incorporation of evolutionary processes. Here, we focus on the idea of evolutionarily stable communities (ESCs), which are theoretical endpoints of evolution in a community context. We use ESCs as a unifying framework to highlight some important but under-appreciated theoretical results, and we review empirical research relevant to these theoretical predictions. We explain how, in addition to generating diversity, evolution can also limit diversity by reducing the effectiveness of coexistence mechanisms. The coevolving traits of competing species may either diverge or converge, depending on whether the number of species in the community is low (undersaturated) or high (oversaturated) relative to the ESC. Competition in oversaturated communities can lead to extinction or neutrally coexisting, ecologically equivalent species. It is critical to consider trait evolution when investigating fundamental ecological questions like the strength of different coexistence mechanisms, the feasibility of ecologically equivalent species, and the interpretation of different patterns of trait dispersion.

AB Identifying the drivers of bushmeat consumption and hunting is important for informing conservation strategies and recognizing challenges to human food security. However, studies often neglect the importance of landscape context, which can influence bushmeat supply and demand. Here, by quantifying bushmeat consumption and hunting in 262 households in a post-frontier region in Amazonia, we tested the hypotheses that bushmeat consumption and hunting are positively associated with two landscape characteristics: (1) forest cover, which has been shown to define game availability; and (2) remoteness, which is related to limited access to marketed meat. Bushmeat consumption was widespread but more likely in remote forested areas. Hunting was more likely in more forested areas, especially nearer to urban centres. Our findings suggest that bushmeat remains an important food source even in heavily altered forest regions and that landscape context is an important determinant of bushmeat consumption and hunting. Although people living in remote, forested areas are likely to be the most dependent on bushmeat, those living in more populous, peri-urban areas are likely the actors contributing most to total hunting effort, due to a higher probability of hunting combined with higher human population densities. This finding undermines the assumption that rural-urban migration in the tropics will deliver a much-needed reprieve for many overhunted species.

AB Fire is a major disturbance event that affects biomes worldwide, altering vegetation structure and flora and fauna assemblages. Here, we investigated the effects of an extensive wildfire (similar to 6240ha) on small mammal assemblages in savanna woodland (cerradAo) at two spatial scales (meso- and macrohabitat) in a neotropical savanna (Brazilian Cerrado). At each spatial scale, we assessed relationships between habitat structure and small mammal species composition and abundance before and after the fire in four natural patches (one burned, three unburned) using partial redundancy analysis. From July 2009 to October 2013, we captured 1319 individuals belonging to 14 species. Our results showed that the fire had consequences for small mammal assemblage at both scales. After the fire, the burned patch differed from the other patches in vegetation attributes and species composition. At a fine scale, fire increased the herbaceous layer and decreased the litter layer and understory obstruction. On a larger scale, the main consequences of fire on vegetation structure were increased variation in litter depth, tree diameter, and distance to the nearest tree. We observed a relationship between mesohabitat structure and the abundance of species with different habitat requirements during the post-fire succession. Fire favored the invasion of generalist species from open Cerrado habitats (rodents Calomys tener, Calomys expulsus, Cerradomys scotti, and Necromys lasiurus) at the expense of more specialized forest species. Our results reinforce the relevance of incorporating multi-scale habitat heterogeneity in future studies assessing the effects of fire on wildlife.

AB In this study, we examine the effect of 13 microenvironmental variables, 3 landscape variables and 8 anthropogenic pressure variables on species richness, abundance and diversity in the distribution of plant communities and the pattern of species diversity using multivariate statistics. Results of TWINSPAN classification have identified three compositional types of edge. DCA clearly distinguished these groups by the first two DCA axes. Both classification and ordination resulted in a clear demonstration of the vegetation pattern in the study area. The results obtained from the SEM showed that microenvironmental variations (canopy openness, litter layer) determine, to a large extent, the species composition of edges, and that landscape properties are correlated with these environmental variations, but anthropogenic pressures had no significant effect on them. This final model can be used as a tool for the application of management and conservation strategies in fragmented forests, as it contributes to identify the direct and indirect effects with the largest impacts on floristic variation.

AB Many studies have examined individual environmental drivers of tropical tree species distributions, but edaphic and successional gradients have not been considered simultaneously. Furthermore, determining how functional traits influence species distributions along these gradients may help to elucidate mechanisms behind community assembly. To assess the influence of environmental filtering on tropical dry forest (TDF) tree species distributions, we used forest inventory data from sites with large edaphic and successional gradients in NW Costa Rica. Our goals were to determine (1) whether edaphic or successional factors are more important determinants of the abundance of individual tree species in regenerating TDF, (2) how species-level functional traits are related to edaphic and/or successional niche associations of tree species and (3) correlations between species-level edaphic and successional niche associations. The distributions of 82 focal tree species were strongly driven by both edaphic and successional gradients. Overall, 94% of species responded to soil chemistry, 89% to soil texture and 94% to stand age gradients. Some functional traits were correlated with the edaphic and successional niche associations of TDF tree species. Species that specialized on soils with high total nutrient concentrations had higher foliar nutrient concentrations (nitrogen and phosphorus) and lower leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Species with wider stand age niches had lower LDMC and wood density. There were no correlations between edaphic and successional niche optima of TDF tree species. Our results indicate that successional and edaphic gradients concurrently drive community assembly in regenerating TDF. Moreover, our work underscores the importance of considering how the functional characteristics of TDF trees dictate species distributions across environmental gradients.

AB Secondary forests (SFs) regenerating on previously deforested land account for large, expanding areas of tropical forest cover. Given that tropical forests rank among Earth's most important reservoirs of carbon and biodiversity, SFs play an increasingly pivotal role in the carbon cycle and as potential habitat for forest biota. Nevertheless, their capacity to regain the biotic attributes of undisturbed primary forests (UPFs) remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of SF recovery, using extensive tropical biodiversity, biomass, and environmental datasets. These data, collected in 59 naturally regenerating SFs and 30 co-located UPFs in the eastern Amazon, cover >1,600 large- and small-stemmed plant, bird, and dung beetles species and a suite of forest structure, landscape context, and topoedaphic predictors. After up to 40 years of regeneration, the SFs we surveyed showed a high degree of biodiversity resilience, recovering, on average among taxa, 88% and 85% mean UPF species richness and composition, respectively. Across the first 20 years of succession, the period for which we have accurate SF age data, biomass recovered at 1.2% per year, equivalent to a carbon uptake rate of 2.25 Mg/ha per year, while, on average, species richness and composition recovered at 2.6% and 2.3% per year, respectively. For all taxonomic groups, biomass was strongly associated with SF species distributions. However, other variables describing habitat complexity-canopy cover and understory stem density-were equally important occurrence predictors for most taxa. Species responses to biomass revealed a successional transition at approximately 75 Mg/ha, marking the influx of high-conservation-value forest species. Overall, our results show that naturally regenerating SFs can accumulate substantial amounts of carbon and support many forest species. However, given that the surveyed SFs failed to return to a typical UPF state, SFs are not substitutes for UPFs.

AB Climate change will increase the unpredictability, magnitude, and frequency of both slow and rapid onset disaster events. Although large-scale engineered interventions have been common for the purposes of risk reduction and adaptation in the past, emerging ecosystem-based approaches are gaining attention. In contrast to 'hard' infrastructure, ecosystem-based solutions that integrate risk management priorities with natural processes are touted as being more cost effective, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable. Current developments in ecosystem-based approaches to climate adaptation (EbA) and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) tend to focus on scientific projections, engineering techniques, and their respective roles in shaping economic benefits. However, recent studies show that effective implementation of such solutions is dependent on the governance practices and interactions between relevant actors, interests, and institutional structures. In response, this paper reviews the current status of governance studies in the context of EbA and Eco-DRR. The analysis is grounded in the interdisciplinary theories of governance, socio-ecological systems, infrastructure studies, and multilevel politics, with sources derived from scientific databases including Scopus and Science Direct advanced query. Based on the review, we evaluate existing governance theories, assessment methods, and implementation through illustrating emblematic examples from around the world. The paper concludes with a synthesis of governance gaps and opportunities, and notes that while emerging ecological engineering approaches provide distinct opportunities, there is a lack of comprehensive assessment beyond diagnosing potential financial, institutional, and political shortfalls. We therefore highlight the need for future research on the socio-ecological, spatial/scalar, and political dimensions of EbA and Eco-DRR.

AB Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) mediate many ecological functions that are important to maintain the ecosystem functioning of terrestrial environments. Although a large amount of literature explores the dung beetle-mediated ecological processes, little is known about the individual contribution from distinct species. Here, we aimed to examine the intra and interspecific variations in dung burial rates performed by two roller dung beetle species (Canthon smaragdulus Fabricius, 1781 and Canthon sulcatus Castelnau, 1840). Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between dung beetle biomass and dung burial rates. We set up a laboratorial experiment with three treatments (two males, two females, and a couple) and 10 replicates per treatment for each dung beetle species, and dung burial rates were measured after exposing 100 g of mixed pig and human excrement for 48 hours. Our results demonstrate that dung burial rates of males, females, and couples within each species do not differ. However, C. smaragdulus individuals performed a larger dung burial than C. sulcatus individuals did. In addition, we found no effect of individual biomass on the amount of dung burial on intra and interspecific levels. These findings highlight the need for further research considering that distinct species, even from the same genus, may perform different rates of ecological processes, as well as about the importance for considering the beetle biomass when measuring their ecological functions. We call for studies to fill in the knowledge gap about the individual species' contribution to the maintenance of different dung beetle-mediated ecological processes.

AB Edge effects threaten organisms and ecological processes in habitat remnants, but they have been poorly studied in non-humid forests such as cerradAo, a tropical dry forest sometimes derived from fire-suppressed savanna in Brazil. The diverse ecosystem functions performed by arthropods may be disrupted by edge effects, and there is pressing need for more studies on this subject. We sampled fragments of cerradAo facing either a road or fire breaks, assessing edge effects in: beta diversity and community composition of epigaeic (litter-dwelling) arthropod orders, ant species, and ant functional groups; ant species richness and diversity; leaf litter depth; and colony residence time of a predatory ground-dwelling ant, Odontomachus chelifer (Ponerinae). None of the variables measured differed between edge and interior of the sites sampled. Dry forests have high micro-climatic variations caused by discontinuities in the canopy cover and, as such, changes in abiotic variables in cerradAo edges might not be as clear as those observed in tropical rainforests. Our study demonstrates that edge effects may not be so prevalent in cerradAo facing roads or fire breaks, which possibly increases the chances of survival of a higher fraction of the original arthropod fauna compared to rainforest fragments.

AB The presence of riparian vegetation provides microclimatic regulation of stream conditions [e.g. luminosity (lux), air temperature (degrees C) and relative humidity (%)], which varies naturally throughout the day. These variables explain the diurnal behaviour patterns of ectotherms such as Odonata in natural areas. However, human land uses (e.g. pastures) modify the abiotic conditions of riparian environments, favouring the presence of disturbance-tolerant species. In this context, we assess relationships between riparian land use (control streams-natural areas and pasture), abiotic conditions habitat integrity index (in control and pastures streams), (air temperature, luminosity and humidity in control streams), and Odonata diversity (between pasture and control streams and throughout the time of day) in Brazilian savannah (Cerrado) streams. First, the control streams had higher habitat integrity index than pasture. Higher abundance and difference in composition of Odonata species were observed in streams surrounded by pasture relative to natural areas. The conversion of natural areas to pasture near streams was also accompanied by an increase in overall body size of Odonata species. Odonata species richness and abundance in natural areas varied throughout the day, but peaked around 12:00h, coinciding with changes in air temperature and luminosity. Our study highlights that changes in the physical characteristics of streams through conversion of natural habitats to pasture will change environmental conditions and act as a filter on the distribution and persistence of Odonata species in Cerrado streams.

AB We estimate habitat loss and fragmentation in a hoverfly, Aneriophora aureorufa, used as a representative forest specialist species. This species is a pollinator specialist of two native trees, forming a triad endemic to the South American Temperate Rainforest (SATR). We combine species distribution models with species-specific requirements to estimate the habitat range of A. aureorufa over two non-overlapping time periods (before human settlement to 2000, and from 2000 to 2014). We analyzed the predicted distribution range of A. aureorufa in Chile, quantifying habitat loss in both periods and fragmentation in the latter. In addition, we evaluated the representativeness of the Chilean protected areas system in relation to the current habitat of the species. We found that the total habitat of A. aureorufa decreased by 68.3% compared to historic pre-settlement levels; in the period 2000-2014 the loss was 4.9%. The northern zone was the most affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, with an estimated total loss of 89.9% from the historic period to 2014, with the loss of 238.2km(2) per year between 2000 and 2014. Eighteen percent of the habitat of A. aureorufa occurs within protected areas. We found an overrepresentation in the southern zone (24.79%) and an underrepresentation in the northern zone (3.44%). We propose that forest specialist species of the northern zone of the SATR could be threatened due to the high pressure of habitat loss and the underrepresentation of the Chilean protected areas systems.

AB ContextSmall fragments of natural habitats with an increased proportion of edges are common landscape traits following agricultural expansion. Consequences of habitat fragmentation are widely documented. However, functional and mechanistic approaches are still needed in order to understand these changes.ObjectivesWe studied habitat loss and edge effects on ant communities, addressing changes in species and functional group diversity, and the relative importance of -diversity components.MethodsIn an endangered Neotropical forest, we sampled ants in edge and interior habitats using pitfall traps, during three summers (28 sites). We calculated taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and partitioned taxonomic and functional -diversity into replacement and loss/gain components.ResultsWe found more species and functional groups at edge than interior habitats, and four species were edge indicators. Habitat loss negatively affected total abundance and that of particular functional groups (fungus-growers and cryptic species) but had a positive effect on taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity as well as abundance of opportunists and predators. Species and functional group replacement drove -diversity, being linked to habitat loss. However, interactions between habitat loss and edges explained the loss/gain of taxonomic and functional composition.ConclusionsFragmentation led to enriched ant communities at edges, possibly resulting from a higher influx of matrix species as edges become pervasive. This highlights the need to assess the spillover between habitats to understand its influence. Moreover, species replacement and the decrease of functional groups due to habitat loss could have an impact on ecosystem processes in which ants play an important role.

AB ContextUnderstanding how landscape patterns affect species diversity is of great importance in the fields of biogeography, landscape ecology and conservation planning, but despite the rapid advance in biodiversity analysis, investigations of spatial effects on biodiversity are still largely focused on species richness.ObjectivesWe wanted to know if and how species richness and species composition are differentially driven by the spatial measures dominating studies in landscape ecology and biogeography. As both measures require the same limited presence/absence information, it is important to choose an appropriate diversity measure, as differing results could have important consequences for interpreting ecological processes.MethodsWe recorded plant occurrences on 112 islands in the Baltic archipelago. Species richness and composition were calculated for each island, and the explanatory power of island area and habitat heterogeneity, distance to mainland and structural connectivity at three different landscape sizes were examined.ResultsA total of 354 different plant species were recorded. The influence of landscape variables differed depending on which diversity measure was used. Island area and structural connectivity determined plant species richness, while species composition revealed a more complex pattern, being influenced by island area, habitat heterogeneity and structural connectivity.ConclusionsAlthough both measures require the same basic input data, species composition can reveal more about the ecological processes affecting plant communities in fragmented landscapes than species richness alone. Therefore, we recommend that species community composition should be used as an additional standard measure of diversity for biogeography, landscape ecology and conservation planning.

AB This study describes the structure and temporal dynamics of brachyuran crab assemblages established in association with seaweed beds of two localities on the southeastern Brazilian coast. Collections were conducted each month over the course of 1 year from algal beds of Sargassum cymosum in a rocky intertidal zone on Grande (GR) and Domingas Dias (DD) beaches at low tide. A total of 1948 specimens (1115 in GR and 833 in DD) were obtained, which were distributed in six superfamilies, nine families, 13 genera, and 23 species. Epialtus bituberculatus was observed with highest density in GR (d=5.97ind./L) and DD (d=12.10ind./L), where it was observed in 100% and 91.7% of samples, respectively. Cross-correlations were observed between the volume of algae and richness in GR (1 lag time; r=0.796; p<0.05) and between algae volume and density in DD (0 lag time; r=-0.595; p<0.05). Positive correlations were observed between algae volume at GR and volume at DD (0 lag time; r=0.868; p<0.05), richness at GR and richness at DD (0 lag time; r=0.761; p<0.05), and density at GR and density at DD (0 lag time; r=0.690; p<0.05). Crab assemblages in the beds of Sargassum algae were diverse in both localities, represented by different taxonomic groups characterized by distinct lifestyles and feeding strategies. A temporal variation in the assemblage structure was observed between localities. This study shows that this temporal variation in crab assemblages may be related to seasonality in the structural complexity of algae beds as a result of bottom-up and top-down drivers acting on the algae.

AB Tropical rainforests are characterized by having high structural complexity, stratification, and species diversity. In Colombia, tropical rainforests are critically endangered with only 24% of their area remaining. Forest fragments are often valued based on the presence of vertebrate taxa despite that small habitat remnants may still harbor diverse invertebrate communities. We surveyed the ant fauna associated with rainforest fragments and their surrounding landscape elements (including mature forests, flooded forests, gallery forests, live fences, and pastures) in the Magdalena River watershed. Pitfall traps and litter samples were used to estimate ant richness and diversity, and to compare ant composition among landscape elements. We found 135 species from 42 genera, representing 16% of the species and 43% of the genera known for Colombia. Our surveys also uncovered 11 new ant records for the Colombian inter-Andean region and 2 new records for the country of Colombia: Mycocepurus curvispinosus (Mackay) and Rhopalothrix isthmica (Weber). The highest species richness was found in forest-covered sites, and richness and diversity was lower in the disturbed landscapes surrounding the forest patches. Species composition varied significantly between all habitat types, but was most similar between forest types suggesting that a loss of structural complexity has the greatest effect on ant communities. Across our study sites, ten species showed the greatest response to habitat type and could qualify as indicator taxa for this region. We conclude by discussing the value of conserving even small forests in this landscape due to their ability to retain high diversity of ants.

AB Symbiosis between plants and ants include examples in which the plant provides shelter and/or food for ants that, in turn, act in the defense or in the dispersion of seeds from the host plant. Although traditionally referred as mutualistic, the results of these interactions may vary with the ecological context in which patterns are involved. A range of species have facultative association with Turnera subulata (Turneraceae). Here, using behavioral bioassays, we investigated the effects of the most frequent ant species associated with T. subulata (Brachymyrmex sp.1, Camponotus blandus (Smith), Dorymyrmex sp.1, Crematogaster obscurata Emery, and Solenopsis invicta Buren) in the dispersion of plant host seeds and in the number of seedlings around the associated ant nests. We also evaluated the effects of these ant species in the germination of T. subulata seeds, in the consumption of elaiosome, and in the attractiveness to elaiosome odor. Our results showed that the ant species associated with T. subulata presented variation in the attraction by the odor and in the rate of consumption of the elaiosomes. However, none of the ant species studied contributed significantly to the increase of seed germination and seedling growth. Our results suggest that the consumption of the elaiosome by ant species is not a determinant factor to the success of germination of T. subulata. However, such species could contribute indirectly to seed germination by carrying seeds to sites more fertile to germination. In general, our results help to elucidate the results of ecological interactions involving ants and plants.

AB Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations were historically considered rare or absent from tropical ecosystems. Although most tropical forests are dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees, ECM associations are widespread and found in all tropical regions. Here, we highlight emerging patterns of ECM biogeography, diversity and ecosystem functions, identify knowledge gaps, and offer direction for future research. At the continental and regional scales, tropical ECM systems are highly diverse and vary widely in ECM plant and fungal abundance, diversity, composition and phylogenetic affinities. We found strong regional differences among the dominant host plant families, suggesting that biogeographical factors strongly influence tropical ECM symbioses. Both ECM plants and fungi also exhibit strong turnover along altitudinal and soil fertility gradients, suggesting niche differentiation among taxa. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are often more abundant and diverse in sites with nutrient-poor soils, suggesting that ECM associations can optimize plant nutrition and may contribute to the maintenance of tropical monodominant forests. More research is needed to elucidate the diversity patterns of ECM fungi and plants in the tropics and to clarify the role of this symbiosis in nutrient and carbon cycling.

AB A major objective in ecology is to determine how local species abundances relate to their functional trait values (i.e. trait-abundance relationship), under a combined influence of 1) environmental filters affecting local species performance conditionally to trait values, 2) neutral demographic and immigration dynamics affecting abundances independently from these trait values, and 3) varying availability and frequency of species at regional level. We examined the nature and strength of the trait-abundance relationship in 30 000 simulated communities covering a gradient of the relative importance of niche-based environmental filtering and neutral stochastic processes, with heterogeneous regional species frequencies. We explored scenarios of directional, stabilizing and disruptive filtering differently affecting the success of species in communities, depending on their relative trait values. We evaluated how the four first moments of the trait distribution in a local community (i.e. abundance-weighted mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) were influenced by immigration, environmental filtering and neutral dynamics. Then we determined whether including constraints related to these moments in a Bayesian maximum entropy regression improved the prediction of the trait-abundance relationships. First, we found pervasive influence of regional frequencies on local species abundances, related to regular input of immigrants. Second, the first four moments of the local trait distribution were affected by environmental filtering, the shape of the response depending on the type of filtering. Third, with decreasing immigration rate, the imprint of local demographic stochasticity overrode the impact of environmental filtering on trait-abundance relationships. Lastly, accounting for the mean and variance of local trait distribution appeared sufficient to explain the trait-abundance relationships in our regression framework, although their contribution differed depending on the type of environmental filtering. Therefore, the mean and variance of trait values in communities, two pillars of trait-gradient analyses in functional ecology, can capture the key influence of environmental filtering on local trait-abundance relationships.

AB Tropical forests are paramount in regulating the global carbon cycle due to the storage of large amounts of carbon in their biomass. Using repeat censuses of permanent plots located at 15 sites in the Andes Mountains of northwest Colombia, we evaluate: (1) the relationship between aboveground biomass (AGB) stocks, AGB dynamics (mortality, productivity, and net change), and changes in temperature across a ca. 3000-m elevational gradient (approximate to 16.1 degrees C); (2) how AGB mortality and AGB productivity interact to determine net AGB change; and (3) the extent to which either fine-grain (0.04-ha) or coarse-grain (1-ha) processes determine the AGB dynamics of these forests. We did not find a significant relationship between elevation/temperature and biomass stocks. The net AGB sequestered each year by these forests (2.21 +/- 0.51Mgha(-1)year(-1)), equivalent to approximately 1.09% of initial AGB, was primarily determined by tree growth. Both forest structural properties and global warming influenced AGB mortality and net change. AGB productivity increases with greater inequality of tree sizes, a pattern characteristic of forest patches recovering from disturbances. Overall, we find that global warming is triggering directional changes in species composition by thermophilization via increased tree mortality of species in the lower portions of their thermal ranges and that the inclusion of small-scale forest structural changes can effectively account for endogenous processes such as changes in forest structure. The inclusion of fine-grain processes in assessments of AGB dynamics could provide additional insights about the effects that ongoing climate change has on the functioning of tropical montane forests.

AB This study uses longitudinal semi-structured interview data to understand the role of social capital in environmental migration. I investigate how rural agricultural households displaced by the Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon used ties to family and close friends in both the origin and destination during the course of migration, from pre-migration planning through post-migration livelihood reconstruction. I discover that the majority of households made strategic use of strong ties, relying on local and translocal social capital to help them find and purchase new property. Also, numerous households migrated to the same destinations as other displaced households and/or to places where family and friends had already lived beforehand. Maintaining strong ties in the destination was a priority for many households, as it facilitated the process of rebuilding livelihoods by providing social, financial, and emotional support. This study sheds light on how households make use of social networks during environmental migration, which can in turn help us better understand how social ties may shape migration decisions, capabilities, and destination choices among those displaced due to future environmental change.

AB We studied the impacts of light availability and soil flooding on biomass accumulation and tissue biomass fractions in Lindera melissifolia (Walt.) Blume, an endangered woody shrub of the southeastern United States. Our experiment was located in a large-scale flooding research facility where plants were established and grown for three years while receiving combinations of 70%, 37%, or 5% of full sunlight with either 0, 45, or 90 days of soil flooding. We hypothesized that biomass accumulation would decrease with decreasing light availability and that soil flooding would further reduce plant mass. In the absence of soil flooding, shrubs receiving 37% light accumulated the greatest biomass (972 g), shrubs receiving 10% light were intermediate in biomass accumulation (737 g), and shrubs receiving 5% light accumulated the least biomass (14 g). Shrubs raised beneath 31% light had root biomass fractions less indicative of water stress than shrubs raised beneath 70% light, and leaf and stem biomass fractions less indicative of light deprivation than shrubs raised beneath 5% light. The light environment also influenced how soil flooding affected L melissifolia biomass accumulation. Soil flooding had no detectable effect on the amount of biomass accumulated by shrubs acclimated to 5% light. However, shrubs acclimated to 70% or 31% light showed a 26% decrease in biomass accumulation after 90 days of soil flooding. Our findings demonstrate a responsive plasticity of L. melissifolia biomass accumulation relative to light availability and soil flooding, and this plasticity was driven by shifts among leaf, stem, and root biomass fractions. This plasticity supports development of silvicultural options for active management of this endangered species in floodplain forests of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.

AB Urbanization generates shifts in wildlife communities, with some species increasing their distribution and abundance, while others decline. We used a dataset spanning 15years to assess trends in distribution and habitat dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog, a highly interactive species, in urban habitat remnants in Denver, CO, USA. Both available habitat and number of prairie dog colonies declined steeply over the course of the study. However, we did observe new colonization events that correlated with habitat connectivity. Destruction of habitat may be slowing, but the rate of decline of prairie dogs apparently remained unaffected. By using our estimated rates of loss of colonies throughout the study, we projected a 40% probability that prairie dogs will be extirpated from this area by 2067, though that probability could range as high as 50% or as low as 20% depending on the rate of urban development (i.e. habitat loss). Prairie dogs may fulfill important ecological roles in urban landscapes, and could persist in the Denver area with appropriate management and habitat protections.

AB Forest gaps can change stand structure and affect forest regeneration dynamics. The gap partitioning hypothesis claims that tree species would regenerate along gap environmental gradients owing to their different resource demands. However, many studies that examined this hypothesis in uncontrolled gap conditions have yielded inconsistent conclusions and there are limited studies testing the hypothesis taking into account biomass allocation. In this study, we examined the gap partitioning hypothesis in a temperate secondary forest ecosystem where gap formation drives forest regeneration. We created gaps with different sizes and planted two commercially important native tree species with contrasting shade tolerance in nine positions along four cardinal directions within the gaps. We found that shade tolerance was the main factor affecting seedling regeneration performance within gaps. For the light-demanding Manchurian walnut (Juglans mandshurica Maxim.), seedling growth varied significantly along the light intensity gradients, which indicated that seedlings could greatly benefit from high light areas within gaps, especially when the gap size increased. Seedling biomass in gap centers and transitions (54.0 g) were much higher than in gap edges (13.7 g) and forest understories (8.6 g). High light environments contributed to higher biomass allocation to the leaves and accelerated carbon assimilation. Low light conditions resulted in increasing proportions of stem biomass, which might promote seedling height growth, although the promotion effects were relatively limited. However, for the shade-tolerant Korean spruce (Picea koraiensis Nakai), little evidence of seedling divergence was found within gaps. Mostly, seedlings only showed growth and biomass allocation differences between gaps and forest understories. Korean spruce showed high adaptability to various gap environments and might be a generalist species rather than being limited to small gaps. The performance of Manchurian walnut strongly supported the gap partitioning hypothesis, but Korean spruce provided little evidence for gap partitioning. Therefore, planting scenarios in silvicultural practices could be suitably designed, with Manchurian walnut in high light gap areas and Korean spruce in most positions within gaps, during the early stage after competition elimination.

AB We investigated the relative and combined effect of topography and light environment on the recruitment of seedlings in a subtropical forest after snow damage to the canopy. The tree seedling community in an old-growth subtropical forest was monitored using 500 2 m x 2 m seedling plots at six-month intervals for 2 years. With a focus on recruitment following canopy damage, we related abiotic and biotic environmental variables to seedling dynamics, and we tested if significant topographic and light habitat associations were present for seedlings recruiting via a torus translation test. Then, we used variance partitioning to examine the relative effects of spatial, topographic and light variables on the temporal assemblages of seedlings. A total of 3047 seedlings from 58 species recruited in the first 2 years following snow damage. At the community level, increases in seedling abundance and richness were positively correlated with canopy openness and negatively correlated with elevation. At the species level, both pioneer and late-successional tree species had more recruits in high light environment than in low light environment. 84.3% of the recruiting seedlings were significantly associated to either light environment (35.7%), topography (26.5%) or both (22.1%). Despite this, at the plot level, spatial variables (PCNM) explained the majority of the variability in seedling composition over time. Our results suggest that snow damage to the canopy increases species richness and abundance via light-facilitated seedling recruitment, and that the composition of recruiting seedlings was largely spatially dependent. Topographic habitat filtering acts as a persistent force in determining the recruitment of seedlings and increases in strength with increased light-facilitated seedling recruitment. Our results highlight that, in this subtropical forest, both light requirement and topographic specialization interact over time to play a key role in promoting coexistence of tree species through selection of individuals at the seedling stage. We also suggest exploring the possibilities of management intervention to speed up the recovery of this forest.

AB The biogeography of the Peruvian Eastern Pacific coast has been described based on oceanographic parameters and qualitative species occurrence data. This has generated disagreement about the limits and existence of different biogeographic units. In this study, the distribution of rocky-shore macrobenthic communities were recorded over 41 sites along the Peruvian coastline (3.5 degrees S-13.5 degrees S) and analyzed together with historic abiotic data in order to quantitatively evaluate the biogeographic zonation of rocky intertidal communities throughout the region and its relationship with environmental variables to propose an update bioregionalization. Clusters and non-metric multidimensional scaling were performed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices from abundance data to evaluate biogeographic patterns of dissimilarities of rocky-shore communities. Significant turnover of taxa among defined biogeographical units was tested using permutational multivariate dispersion. Relationships between of the biogeographical community's structure and environmental factors were examined using Random Forest analysis on datasets available at Bio-Oracle and Jet Propulsion Laboratory-California Institute of Technology. Variation of community structure of 239 taxa depicted three biogeographical units along the region matching Panamic, transitional and Humboldt provinces. Beta diversity analysis indicated a significant turnover of taxa within the transitional unit. Random forest analysis showed a strong correlation between biogeographic units with phosphate, sea surface temperature, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, cloud fraction, and silicates. Our results set the putative limits of three biogeographic units for rocky-shore communities along the coast of Peru, providing base-line information for understanding further biogeographic changes on communities associated with the ongoing regional coastal cooling and impacts of El Nino events.

AB Roads negatively affect many vertebrate species, whereas edge effect may favor some generalist species. This study aims to: 1) present a new way to calculate "line integral effects", represented by LIE and AVLIE, through new computer software, making this concept accessible to a broad audience of researchers interested in the study of Road Ecology and Tropical Forest Ecology; and, 2) test the performance of LIE and AVLIE indices, applied to road effect (LIE_road and AVLIE road) and to edge effect (LIE edge and AVLIE_edge), other road effect indices and forest area, using a data set on small mammal abundance in a human modified landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Road and edge effects were represented by new metrics: Line Integral Effect (LIE) and Average Integral Effect (AVLIE), calculated using Line Integral from Differential Calculus of Several Variables through new free software developed by the second author. LIE road and LIE edge measure the total sum of the effect of roads (represented by lines) and edges (polygons), respectively, in relation to the forest fragment (point). AVLIE_road and AVLIE edge measure the average of road and edge effect, respectively, in relation to the same sampling point. We used generalized linear regression models to explore the relationships between the abundance of the two groups of small mammals (forest specialists and habitat generalists) and the independent variables representing road, edge and forest effects. For forest specialists, the best model included AVLIE_road (negatively associated with abundance) and AVLIE edge (negatively associated), while for habitat generalists, the best model included AVLIE road (negatively associated) and LIE edge (positively associated). Thus, there are more small mammals where road effect is lower. Forest fragments with higher edge effect showed more habitat generalists and less forest specialists. LIE and AVLIE could be useful metrics to explore edge effect separately to road effect on wildlife in forest fragments.

AB Background: The production and subsequent turnover of aboveground litter is an important process in the ecosystem carbon (C) cycle. Litterfall links above- and belowground processes by transferring organic material to the soil where it becomes available to heterotrophs, fueling nutrient cycling. Little is known about how litter fluxes respond to experimental manipulation of tree species richness.
   Methods: We sampled litterfall in a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China. Litter was collected at monthly intervals during peak senescing season for two years and throughout the whole year in 2016, using 0.75 m x 0.7 5m litter traps, in plots with a tree species richness of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 species.
   Results: Cumulated annual litter production increased with tree species richness from an average of 1.96 +/- 0.25Mg.ha(-1).yr.(-1) in monocultures to 4.39 +/- 1.15Mg.ha(-1).yr.(-1) in 16-species mixtures. At site B, the doubling of species richness resulted in a positive effect with peak litter production increasing from 0.09 Mg.ha(-1) when trees were 5years old in 2015, to 0.14 Mg.ha(-1) in 2016. The intra-annual distribution of litter production varied strongly among species, leading to a larger community niche for seasonal distribution of litter in species-rich than in species-poor plots. Community-niche size was positively correlated with litter production, thus providing an explanation for the species richness effects.
   Conclusions: Different species had complementary temporal dynamics of litterfall, which led to a more or less constant litter supply in species-rich stands over the whole year. This caused positive richness effects on litter production which in turn may positively affect mineralization and subsequent tree growth.

AB Several studies on the geographical limits and regionalization of the Neotropics have recognized this region as a biogeographical unit. Recent regionalization proposals recognize the existence of a Mesoamerican dominion within the Neotropics, extending from the northern portion of the Mexican Pacific coast into the lowlands of south-central Mexico and most of northern Central America (Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua). In this study, we assessed the biogeographical identity of the Mesoamerican dominion through the analysis of the geographical patterns of diversity of 356 species included in 28 genera and 16 families of plants, with a preferential distribution in the seasonally dry tropical forests of Mexico and Central America. Occurrence data were obtained from online databases (e.g., GB1F, SNIB, MEXU and TROPICOS) and refined using taxonomic and geographical information. We used the Biodiverse 2.0 program to obtain maps of species richness, centres of endemism and conducted analyses of similarity among areas. The analyses led to corroborate the geographical limits of the Mesoamerican dominion. With respect to the species with distributions that extend to America arid, the Brazilian sub-region and Florida and the Greater Antilles. From these analyses, we could identify for the Mesoamerican dominion two highly diverse areas in southern Mexico: the Balsas Basin (more than 60 species) and the Central Valleys of Oaxaca (28). We also identified seven areas of higher dissimilarity corresponding to river basins throughout the study area: Grande de Santiago, Anneria-Coahuayana, Tepalcatepec (western Balsas), Eastern Balsas, Papagayo, Verde, higth Papaloapan (Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Valley) and Tehuantepec. The high values of dissimilarity in the Pacific watershed of southern Mexico are responsible for the high species turnover observed for the seasonally dry tropical forests in the Mesoamerican dominion.

AB Urbanization fragments, isolates or eliminates natural habitats, and changes the structure and composition of assemblages living in the remaining natural fragments. Knowing assembly rules is necessary to support and/or maintain biodiversity in urban habitats. We hypothesized that forest communities in rural sites are organized by environmental filtering, but this may be changed by urbanization, and in the suburban and urban forest fragments replaced by randomly organized assemblages, influenced by the colonization of species from the surrounding matrix. Evaluating simultaneously the functional and phylogenetic relationships of co-existing species, we showed that at the rural sites, co-existing ground beetle species were functionally and phylogenetically more similar than expected by chance, indicating that environmental filtering was the likely process structuring these communities. Contrary to this, in urban and suburban sites, the co-occurring species were functionally and phylogenetically not different from the null model, indicating randomly structured assemblages. According to our findings, changes in environmental and habitat characteristics accompanied by urbanization lead to assemblages of randomly colonized species from the surrounding matrix, threatening proper ecosystem functioning. To reassemble stochastically assembled species of urban and suburban fragments to structured, properly functioning communities, appropriate management strategies are needed which simultaneously consider recreational, economic and conservation criteria.

AB South American coralsnakes are characterized by inconspicuous and poorly known species, which are potentially very sensitive to climate change. Here, we assess the impact of future climate change on the distributions of the Micrurus lemniscatus species complex after addressing the Wallacean shortfalls and refining the knowledge about their current geographic distributions. We also evaluate the efficiency of the current reserve network to protect the species in the present and future. We applied ecological niche model tools through a carefully examined set of occurrence records to generate potential present distributions and to project these distributions into future scenarios of climate change. Specific thresholds based on occurrence records along with expert opinions were used to delineate the geographic distribution of each species. A hierarchical ANOVA was applied to evaluate the uncertainties in species distributions across niche modeling methods and climate models and nested into the time factor (present and future). Multiple regression models were used to infer the relative importance of the climatic variables to determine the species' suitability. A gap analysis was performed to address the representativeness of species distributions into protected areas. Predicted geographic distributions were compatible with the known distributions and the expert opinions, except for M. I. carvalhoi. New areas for field research were identified. Variation in precipitation was the most important factor defining the habitat suitability for all species, except for M. diutius. All taxa (except M. L lemniscatus) will shrink their distributions in the future; less than 50% of the present suitable areas are protected in reserve networks, and less than 40% of these areas will be held in reserves in the future. We found strong evidence that coralsnakes may be highly sensitive to the ongoing changes and must be protected.

AB The beneficial effects of organic acids (OAs) excretion from plant roots were first proposed as being associated with the mechanism of superior phosphorus utilization by the cluster roots of white lupin (Lupinus albus L.), and these effects are now widely accepted as pleiotropic effects associated with stress tolerance of plants. Excreted OAs detoxify rhizotoxic aluminum, recruit beneficial bacterium for induced systemic resistance, and modify root architecture to enhance phosphorus starvation. OA excretion is probably optimized in the carbon economy and is coordinately regulated with other traits that additively confer each stress factor. Here we present an overview of the molecular physiology of OA excretion from roots, how plants activate OA excretion, and how this excretion can be managed as a specific response.

AB The temporal dynamics of plant phenology and pollinator abundance across seasons should influence the structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks. Nevertheless, such dynamics are seldom considered, especially for diverse tropical networks. Here, we evaluated the temporal variation of four plant-pollinator networks in two seasonal ecosystems in Central Brazil (Cerrado and Pantanal). Data were gathered on a monthly basis over 1year for each network. We characterized seasonal and temporal shifts in plant-pollinator interactions, using temporally discrete networks. We predicted that the greater floral availability in the rainy season would allow for finer partitioning of the floral niche by the pollinators, i.e. higher specialization patterns as previously described across large spatial gradients. Finally, we also evaluated how sampling restricted to peak flowering period may affect the characterization of the networks. Contrary to our expectations, we found that dry season networks, although characterized by lower floral resource richness and abundance, showed higher levels of network-wide interaction partitioning (complementary specialization and modularity). For nestedness, though, this between-seasons difference was not consistent. Reduced resource availability in the dry season may promote higher interspecific competition among pollinators leading to reduced niche overlap, thus explaining the increase in specialization. There were no consistent differences between seasons in species-level indices, indicating that higher network level specialization is an emergent property only seen when considering the entire network. However, bees presented higher values of specialization and species strength in relation to other groups such as flies and wasps, suggesting that some plant species frequently associated with bees are used only by this group. Our study also indicates that targeted data collection during peak flowering generates higher estimates of network specialization, possibly because species activity spans longer periods than the targeted time frame. Hence, depending on the period of data collection, different structural values for the networks of interactions may be found.Synthesis. Plant-pollinator networks from tropical environments have structural properties that vary according to seasons, which should be taken into account in the description of the complex systems of interactions between plants and their pollinators in these areas.

AB The nitrogen is a macronutrient essential for the functioning of the metabolism of living beings. However, due to the changes that the planet has been passing in the Anthropocene, the nitrogen cycling has been altered. Deforestation combined with changes in land use are primarily responsible for the change in their cycling. Emissions of greenhouse gases such as N2O were increased due to this deforestation and inadequate soil management practices, and this contributed to the fact that these changes in nitrogen cycling occurred. Considering the importance of nitrogen and the changes that it has undergone in the last decades, this work of revision aims to describe the role of nitrogen and the changes in its cycling due to the processes of land use change that occurred in the Anthropocene in forest areas tropical and eucalyptus plantations in Brazil.

AB In temperate forests, red wood ants (Formica aquilonia) arc considered ecosystem engineers affecting ecosystem properties and functions. Possible effects of F. aquilonia ants on species communities of invertebrates and plants were studied in the pine-dominated Geitaknottane forest reserve, Norway. Species richness of carabids, lichens and epiphytes (tree-living lichens and bryophytes) was negatively affected by ant mound density. Species of all groups, except for lichens and snails, were affected either positively or negatively by ant presence. Food availability and interference competition are plausible explanations of decreased species richness and negative species associations in carabids; while collecting, foraging and changed chemical environment may explain decreased species richness in lichens and epiphytes. Thirteen out of 15 plant and invertebrate species were weakly associated with ant mound density. Associations of only two species (Carabus violaceus and Drusilla canaliculata) were negative, while Pella humeralis and Agroeca proxima were associated positively and very center dot strongly with ant mounds. Positive associations with ants of those invertebrates may be a response to excessive abundance of food and chemical mimicry.

AB The Brazilian Amazon contains the largest remaining contiguous forest in the tropics, but also faces strong development pressures and one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world. In the 30 years since the murder of the rubber tapper leader Chico Mendes and the subsequent creation of Extractive Reserves (ERs), this protected area model continues to be a conservation and development strategy that strives to secure land for forest-dependent smallholders and stem the advance of large-scale deforestation in the region. As of August 2018, 76 federal and state ERs have been created in the Brazilian Amazon, spanning over 14 million ha. Despite three decades of ER implementation and its importance to people-based conservation, there has not yet been a region-wide analysis of this model. In order to fill this gap, we analyze the spatial and temporal trajectory of ERs and how the implementation of this policy played out differently across Amazonian states. Grounded in a political ecology framework, we identify four phases of ERs implementation (inception, consolidation, expansion, and stagnation). We assess the land allotted in each state to ER protection and examine the federal and state-level political and institutional dynamics that may have favored or limited the growth of the ER model. Although ERs made an impressive impact, and remain in the spotlight of environmental policy debates in Brazil, challenges remain to combat continued pressures at Amazon development frontiers. This paper contributes to better understanding the current condition of the ER model and provides lessons for its continued implementation in the Brazilian Amazon, and its role in forest conservation.

AB Questions Long-term fragmentation and land use in Europe have created a landscape pattern where small forest patches are embedded among agricultural landscapes. These small forest patches can be one of the few habitats left to maintain the species richness and ecosystem functions within intensively managed agroecosystems. We ask, which factors determine vascular plant species richness, community composition and forest community integrity in small forest patches in an agricultural landscape? Location NE Estonia. Methods We combine island biogeographic theory (patch area and isolation) with the properties of the surrounding landscape and local environmental conditions within a patch to study the drivers of species richness and community integrity. Results Patch area together with local environmental factors (understorey light conditions and soil reaction) determined both species richness and community integrity. Total species richness and forest generalists were related to patch area alone, whereas forest specialists were additionally dependent on patch light conditions. Species richness of grassland specialists in the forest patches increased with the amount of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape, while the presence of synanthropic species was positively related to soil reaction. Forest community integrity was higher in larger, more shaded patches with low soil reaction, which together defined suitable conditions for forest communities and hindered the intrusion of species from other habitats. Conclusions Under a suitable set of conditions, encompassing both favourable landscape and local environmental conditions, even small forest patches can provide habitat for both forest and grassland communities in agricultural landscapes. Comprehensive approaches, considering species composition, environment and landscape conditions simultaneously, are needed for making reliable predictions of biodiversity patterns.

AB Given the accelerating worldwide expansion of agriculture, biofuel production and managed forest plantations, the future of many tropical mammals depends on understanding why or when some species successfully survive in anthropogenically modified habitats, while others do not. Armadillos are potentially able to adapt to agricultural landscapes and play a key role as ecosystem engineers. However, it is not clear how dependent armadillos are on natural areas in agricultural landscapes and, more specifically, how or if armadillos can use sugar cane or managed forests as alternative habitats. Here, we assessed the relative effects of landscape features, composition and configuration, anthropogenic impacts and degree of protection, as potential predictors of landscape occupancy of the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus). We deployed 203 camera trap stations in three agricultural landscapes of the Brazilian Cerrado, where sugar cane or managed forest cover most (>50%) of the landscape. We found that cover by native forests and proximity to watercourses strongly and positively affect the occupancy of nine-banded armadillo. In contrast, managed forests mostly composed of Eucalyptus spp. had a negative effect on this armadillo's landscape occupancy. We did not detect the effect of sugar cane, although this particular result might be biased due to our sampling design. Overall, our findings indicate that even disturbed native forest strips, particularly those close to watercourses, are important habitats for this armadillo in agricultural matrices, demonstrating the utmost importance of native forests existing both within and outside protected areas. The Brazilian Forest Code protects native vegetation existing in rural private properties in Brazil, but adherence to this law by rural owners is still weak. Therefore, our study supports the strategic role this law plays in conservation in Brazil. Although not endangered by extinction, maintaining the nine-banded armadillo is important for a broader biota because of its putative role as an ecosystem engineer. The effective implementation of the Forest Code is therefore key not only to maintain this armadillos' populations but also to increase ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.

AB Forest fragmentation and deforestation are subjects of great concern in tropical regions, namely in South America and Africa, contributing to a rapid loss of tropical forest area and with serious implications for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation. Despite the decrease in deforestation rates In recent years, the Brazilian Amazon, with the largest continuous region of tropical forest in the world, has suffered the greatest recorded losses, which have been contributing to continuous habitat fragmentation and a reduction in the territory occupied by Amerindian populations. In an attempt to preserve the remaining habitats and forests, Brazil has been adopting land conservation policies, including the implementation of protected areas. Protected areas (PAs) possess the potential to significantly reduce habitat fragmentation by conserving large, contiguous areas of land. In order to examine how effective PAs are at conserving forest area in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, patterns of deforestation are analyzed and compared, inside and outside the PM, through landscape metrics calculated using the Patch Analyst and V-LATE extensions of a Geographic Information System. Two different sources (the Hansen Global Forest Change Dataset and the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research's (INPE) PRODES project) of annual forest cover-loss data derived from satellite imagery at medium-to-high spatial and temporal resolutions are compared at two-yearly intervals across 2002-2016. Additionally, fragmentation levels associated with deforestation patterns are assessed through an index modeled using a set of uncorrelated landscape metrics, and the associated change factors and trend are discussed. Results show that there is greater fragmentation in some PAs located in Mato Grosso and Para States, especially those near the "arc of deforestation", and that Yanomami Indigenous Lands (YIL) are tending towards more fragmentation. Although some PM are in a critical condition, findings show they all actively contribute to improved conservation of the native ecosystem and, in conjunction with sustainable management policies, will continue to help reduce or avoid forest fragmentation and degradation processes.

AB We developed a pilot study on the potential of aquatic plants as indicators of ecological quality in tropical rivers to provide an index of biotic integrity for monitoring, conservation, and restoration purposes. We used floristic, environmental, and anthropogenic disturbance data from a 950 km(2) river basin in the southern littoral area of Sao Paulo State, Brazil (Itanhaem River Basin), and proposed a five-step methodological framework for the development of a macrophyte index in tropical river basins. Field surveys were carried out in 137 sites (Spring 2013-2014) of Itanhaem River for the index development and in 27 sites of Itapanhad River (Spring 2015) for its validation. A total of 44 aquatic plant species were recorded in the study area, and 11 metrics were evaluated as potential core metrics of the index. Principal Component Analysis distinguished two river types mostly related to geomorphological characteristics - the Upper river type in the mountainous region (average slope 23.7 degrees) and the Middle-low river type (average slope 9.2 degrees) in the floodplain. The Upper river catchment was characterized by extensive areas occupied by banana plantations, low water conductivity, sandy substrates, and homogeneous aquatic vegetation, whereas the Middle-low river catchment had more urban settlements and displayed high nitrogen and phosphorus contents in water and sediments. The index (MIBI-ITA) is preliminary and was based on species richness and life forms (e.g. submerged hydrophytes, helophytes). MIBI-ITA could only be developed for the lowlands and displayed a high discriminatory ability for distinguishing disturbance and a good performance with external data. Bioassessment in tropical rivers require further investigation on biogeography and long-term responses of macrophyte populations to stressors, as well as knowledge-base on river typology and functional traits of macrophytes, other than morpho-anatomic traits and diversity measures.

AB The delineation of unique areas in biodiversity is crucial for conservation planning. However, identification of distinct biotas is a challenging task. In this study, we use an objective analytical process to test if bird and plant species composition of three different forest formation in the Atlantic forest Biome is sufficiently distinct to merit the recognition of ecoregions. We also evaluated how current climatic and spatial factors shape the distribution of plants and birds. Sampling localities were selected in three forest types of southern Brazil: mixed rain forest (MF), seasonal semi-deciduous forest (SF) and dense rain forest (DF). The point-centred quarter method and point counts were used to sample plants and birds respectively. Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate species composition, while the Rank Occupancy Abundance Profile was used to determine the association of bird species with each forest type. We used variation partitioning to determine which factors, that is climatic, spatial or tree species abundance (in the case of birds) better explained the distribution of plants and birds. A total of 176 tree species and 270 bird species were recorded. The bird species composition was sufficiently distinct among the three forest types, but the plant species composition was only distinct between DF and MF. Moreover, 61% of bird species were associated with only one forest type. This high association and the different species composition suggest that these forest types are sufficiently distinct to merit the recognition of ecoregions. Plant distribution was mainly affected by climatic variables, while bird distribution was mainly influenced by forest type and less so by climatic variables. Our data suggest that all three forest types should be conserved, but conservation strategies are urgent in MF where only 0.39% of its original cover is under protection.

AB Differences in pollinator effectiveness modulate the evolution of specialized pollination systems and reliance on specific pollinators for plant reproduction. Some Neotropical plant families rely predominantly on hummingbirds for pollination, including Bromeliaceae. However, apparently hummingbird-specialized bromeliads are known to be visited by other floral visitor groups, which may contribute to their reproduction. Here, we investigated the importance of hummingbird pollination in two bromeliads from the open restinga vegetation in the Atlantic rainforest, with contrasting levels of morphological specialization and differences in breeding systems: the more generalist, self-incompatible Aechinea nudicaulis and more specialized, self-compatible Vriesea neoglutinosa. Experimental exclusion of hummingbirds showed that fruit set is considerably reduced in both species when only insects are allowed to visit the flowers. Single visitation experiments revealed that in A. nudicaulis hummingbirds are more efficient than ants in facilitating pollination per visit, but in V neoglutinosa, hummingbirds are as efficient as bees and ants. One hummingbird species, Amazilia fimbriata, has a pivotal role in the maintenance of ecosystem functionality by pollinating these dominant plants in the system. However, the relative efficacy of hummingbirds seems to be more related to the breeding system of the plants than the morphological specialization of flowers.

AB Numerous Neotropical rainforest species are distributed in both Amazonia and Central America, reflecting a rich history of biotic interchange between regions. However, some plant lineages are endemic to one region, due in part to the dispersal barrier posed by the Northern Andean Cordilleras and adjacent savannas. To investigate the role of biogeographic filtering across the northern Andes in regional community assembly, we examined environmental tolerances, functional traits, and biogeographic distributions of >1000 woody plant species (trees, shrubs, lianas) locally co-occurring in forest plots in lowland Panama (542 species) and Amazonian Ecuador (667 species). High regional abundance was strongly predictive of the probability of being geographically widespread (i.e. present on both sides of the Andes). However, we also found that species with broad environmental tolerances (those that are able to inhabit high elevations and areas of low mean annual precipitation) were more likely to have a cross-Andean distribution even after accounting for regional abundance, suggesting that biogeographic filtering for these traits has mediated cross-Andean dispersal. Regional abundance and environmental tolerances were additionally associated with a suite of life-history traits related to high dispersal-colonization ability, but most traits reflecting dispersal-colonization ability were not predictive of biogeographic distribution. Our results highlight how the process of biogeographic filtering, based primarily on environmental tolerances, has mediated regional-scale floristic assembly of Neotropical rainforests. The impacts of this process, which we term filter-dispersal assembly, are likely to be especially important to forests in Central America, where biotic interchange with Amazonia has heavily influenced regional community composition.

AB A central problem in ecology is to understand how human impacts affect plant-animal interactions that lead to effective seed dispersal services for plant communities. Seed dispersal services are the outcome of plant-frugivore interactions that often form local networks of interacting species. Recent work has shown that some frugivorous bird species are more critical to network organization than others. Here, we explore how patch size and the potential local extinctions of obligate frugivorous birds affect the reorganization of seed dispersal networks. We examined the structure of 20 empirical seed dispersal networks documented across tropical avian assemblages occupying widely variable habitat patch sizes, a surrogate of the amount of remaining habitat. Networks within small forest patches consistently supported both lower plant and bird species richness. Forest patch size was positively associated with nestedness, indicating that reductions in patch size disrupted the nested organization of seed dispersal networks. Obligate frugivores, especially large-bodied species, were almost entirely absent from small forest patches. Analysis at the species level showed that obligate frugivores formed the core of interacting species, connecting species within a given seed dispersal network. Our combined results revealed that patch size reduction erodes frugivorous bird diversity, thereby affecting the integrity of seed dispersal networks. We highlight the importance of conserving large forest patches to maintain tropical forest functionality.

AB Mechanisms by which the productivity of tropical ecosystems is limited by nutrients is a long-standing question, but little information is available on the nutrient dynamics supporting the masting phenomenon in Southeast Asian evergreen rainforests. In this study we examined the nutrient sink and potential nutrient sources of masting in a Bornean tropical forest. We investigated if nutrient flux in fine litter, tree stems, and soils changed temporally in response to intense flower and fruit production. Fifty-five litter traps were installed in a 2-ha plot at the onset of flowering (April 2010), and litter and nutrient fluxes were monitored for more than 4years (May 2010-December 2014). Wood cores of trunks and coarse roots of abundant species (Shorea spp.) and soil samples were collected in May 2010, September 2010, and September 2011 (coinciding with peak flowering, peak fruiting, and 1year after fruiting, respectively). The P and K fluxes in the total litter were significantly greater in the mast year (2010) than non-mast years, whereas the Mg, N, and Ca fluxes did not vary in relation to masting. In line with the nutrient fluxes, P and K concentrations in coarse roots of flowering individuals of S. multiflora decreased in September 2011. The present results suggest that tropical trees require extraordinary amounts of P and K for masting, and may retranslocate stored nutrients to meet the elevated nutrient demands for masting.

AB Wetlands are important centers of biodiversity. Coastal wetlands are subject to anthropogenic threats that can lead to biodiversity loss and consequent negative effects on nature conservation. We investigated relationships between wetland vegetation and habitat conditions in a coastal Nature Reserve in Northern Italy that has undergone seawater intrusion and eutrophication for several decades. The wetland vegetation in the Nature Reserve consisted of nine communities of hygrophytic and helophytic vegetation and five communities of waterplant vegetation. The hygrophytic and helophytic communities were arranged according to a salinity gradient, from salt-free habitats to strongly saline habitats. The saline habitats had high nutrient levels, due to the influx of nitrate-rich saltwater from an adjacent lagoon. The waterplant communities were all typical of freshwater habitats. Water-table depth and concentration of dissolved nutrients in the water were the main factors structuring waterplant vegetation. The main driver of future changes in the wetland vegetation of the Nature Reserve is the ongoing increase in salinity levels which may enhance expansion of halophilic species and communities, thus outcompeting locally rare freshwater species. If nutrient, especially nitrate, load further increases in the next future, this may exert negative effects on wetland species and communities preferring nutrient-poor habitats.

AB Environmental changes can affect the distribution and conservation of plant populations, therefore the study of the ability to modulate reproductive and vegetative traits is of large interest. Cistus laurifolius is a shrub typically occurring in Mediterranean open vegetation, often under different degrees of habitat light intensity. In the present work, we investigated reproductive and leaf traits to assess the ability of this species to cope with unfavorable / suboptimal conditions.
   We quantified fruit set, seed set and seed mass under different conspecific plant density and light conditions, whereas vegetative traits were assessed through the measurement of plant height, Specific Leaf Area (SLA), and Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC).
   Results show that plants of Cistus laurifolius are able to adjust both SLA and LDMC under shaded conditions, but produce fewer seeds with reduced seed mass compared with plants under full light. We conclude that plants are able to modulate their vegetative traits maximizing the carbon gain under shaded conditions, but they are not able to offset the carbon balance deficit and therefore fail to convoy adequate resources to reproductive traits. Our results also highlight that the reproductive fitness is positively affected by conspecific plant density, but negatively affected by canopy coverage.

AB The identification of tree species in the field is often a subjective process and misidentifications cause many problems for forest management in the Amazon Forest. Near infrared spectra from dried leaves of herbarium specimens are able to distinguish species in tropical forests. However, toolsto improve species identification directly in the field are needed. In this study, we tested whether spectral reflectance of bark tissues (rhytidome and phloem) collected with a portable spectrometer in the field can be used for the discrimination of tree species. Spectral data was collected for 254 trees of 8 families, 10 genera and 11 species from terra firme forests in Central Amazon with an ASD field spectrometer. Data consisted of reflectance values within 350-2500 nm wavelengths. We compared the rate of correct species recognition for different datasets using linear discriminant models. The rate of correct species assignment using this technique was 98% when using spectra from the inner bark (phloem) and 94% with outer bark (rhytidome) spectra. We suggest that the application of this technique can improve the quality of species identification directly during field inventories, fostering better forest management practices.

AB Many of the sustainability concerns of bioenergy are related to direct or indirect land use change (LUC) resulting from bioenergy feedstock production. The environmental and socio-economic impacts of LUC highly depend on the site-specific biophysical and socio-economic conditions. The objective of this study is to spatiotemporally assess the potential LUC dynamics resulting from an increased biofuel demand, the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the potential effect of LUC mitigation measures. This assessment is demonstrated for LUC dynamics in Brazil towards 2030, considering an increase in the global demand for bioethanol as well as other agricultural commodities. The potential effects of three LUC mitigation measures (increased agricultural productivity, shift to second-generation ethanol, and strict conservation policies) are evaluated by using a scenario approach. The novel modelling framework developed consists of the global Computable General Equilibrium model MAGNET, the spatiotemporal land use allocation model PLUC, and a GIS-based carbon module. The modelling simulations illustrate where LUC as a result of an increased global ethanol demand (+26x10(9)L ethanol production in Brazil) is likely to occur. When no measures are taken, sugar cane production is projected to expand mostly at the expense of agricultural land which subsequently leads to the loss of natural vegetation (natural forest and grass and shrubland) in the Cerrado and Amazon. The related losses of above and below ground biomass and soil organic carbon result in the average emission of 26gCO(2-)eq/MJbioethanol. All LUC mitigation measures show potential to reduce the loss of natural vegetation (18%-96%) as well as the LUC-related GHG emissions (7%-60%). Although there are several uncertainties regarding the exact location and magnitude of LUC and related GHG emissions, this study shows that the implementation of LUC mitigation measures could have a substantial contribution to the reduction of LUC-related emissions of bioethanol. However, an integrated approach targeting all land uses is required to obtain substantial and sustained LUC-related GHG emission reductions in general.

AB Although aquaculture sometimes lessens the negative effects of fishing by lowering the need to capture wild animals and plants, some aquaculture practices still require the exploitation of wild populations. A largely overlooked case is the use of wild populations to provide seed to sea farms. Mussel farming in Northwest Spain involve the capture of thousands of tons of young mussels (0.5-2 cm long) from the nearby rocky intertidal every year to supply floating rafts. Despite its volume, the impact of this activity on other sessile organisms remains unassessed. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we monthly monitored the sessile intertidal assemblage of five protected and six exploited sites during the closed season in 2016 following a nested sampling plan. Like the by-catch typical of other fisheries, harvesting young mussels for aquaculture was detrimental to the abundance and diversity of the associated sessile assemblage not directly targeted by this activity. Coverage and richness were also significantly lowered by the exploitation of mussel seed, and the community structure of protected and exploited sites was significantly different. These differences continued until the next open season, suggesting that the closed season was too short for the recovery of the associated non-target sessile assemblage. Given the size of the local mussel industry, the incomplete recovery along the closed season implies that mussel aquaculture must be putting a sustained pressure on a sizeable portion of the rocky intertidal of Northwest Spain.

AB 1. Achieving global targets for forest restoration will require cost-effective strategies to return agricultural land to forest, while minimizing implementation costs and negative outcomes for agricultural production.
   2. We present a landscape approach for optimizing the cost-effectiveness of large-scale forest restoration. Across three different landscapes within Brazil's Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, we modelled landscape scenarios based on spatially explicit data on the probability of natural regeneration, restoration costs, land opportunity costs, and forest restoration outcomes for increasing carbon stocking and landscape connectivity. We compare benefits of our cost-reduction approach to the legally mandated riparian restoration and randomly distributed approaches.
   3. Compared with riparian prioritization and considering both implementation and opportunity costs, our cost-reduction scenario produced the greatest savings (20.9%) in mechanized agricultural landscapes.
   4. When only considering implementation costs, our cost-reduction scenario led to the highest savings (38.4%) in the landscape with highest forest cover where natural regeneration potential is highest and enables cost-effective carbon stocking and connectivity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We present a guide for forest restoration planning that maximizes specific outcomes with minimal costs and reduction of agricultural production. Furthermore, we show how policies could encourage prioritization of low-cost restoration via natural regeneration, increasing cost-effectiveness. While our study focuses on Brazil's Atlantic Forest, the approach can be parameterized for other regions.

AB Aim Understanding how spatial distributions of rare and common species are associated with environmental and spatial processes is essential to understanding community assembly. We addressed the following questions: (a) does the relative importance of space and topography vary from rare to common tree species? (b) Are the contributions of topography and space equal? (c) Are the variances explained by topography or space correlated with elevational ranges (ER) at the local scale? (d) Does cell-size influence those postulated associations? Location Major taxa studied China and the Americas. Tree species. Methods Results We partitioned the variation in species richness and composition of rare and common tree species by topography and space across a range of extents and grain sizes in eight communities. We calculated contribution ratio (CR) between space and topography to quantify their relative importance. We employed Kendall's rank correlation to determine the relation between CR and commonness. Mixed effect models were used to identify the influence of cell-size on the results. The majority of CR values were positively related to increasing commonness, especially for composition. The explained variances by space were always higher than that by topography regardless of commonness. At local scale, variances explained by space or topography were not correlated with ER. Main conclusions Our results indicate that the relative importance of space compared to topography increases from rare to common species across forests. We suggest that future studies of community assembly need to account for both space and topography to adequately describe differences in rare and common species assembly mechanisms at range of spatial extents and grain sizes.

AB Individual-level interactions with neighbours and their surrounding environments are key factors influencing performance that ultimately shape and maintain diversity in tropical plant communities. Theory predicts that the strength of these interactions depends on the similarity among neighbours, the turnover in composition caused by individuals that enter as new recruits and individuals that die, and fitting to local conditions. Despite considerable phenotypic variation among individuals and high community dynamics, these three factors have rarely been considered together for understanding growth variation, especially for seedling communities in the tropics. We address this outstanding challenge by quantifying the influence of trait dissimilarity among neighbours, temporal turnover in neighbours, and individual trait variation on seedling growth, based on an unprecedented dataset containing individual-level demographic and functional trait data for tropical tree seedlings. The results showed that trait dissimilarity associated with resource acquisition does not influence growth. However, conspecific negative density-dependent effects on growth were evident through the initial density of conspecifics and the increase in conspecifics during the study period. Also, individuals with relatively larger investments in leaf biomass allocation attained higher growth rates, suggesting that seedlings adjust their resource allocation to tissues related with light capture.Synthesis. Together, these findings indicate that tropical seedling communities are structured by local abiotic factors that ultimately result in individual variation in resource acquisition traits and by biotic interactions driven by negative density dependence. These biotic interactions are highly dynamic and depend on conspecifics turnover, even at short temporal scales. Thus, to gain further insights into the forces structuring seedling communities, future studies should account for temporal variability in immediate neighbours and individual-level phenotypic variation that influence individual interactions.

AB ContextThe classical theory of island biogeography explains loss of species in fragmented landscapes as an effect of remnant patch size and isolation. Recently this has been challenged by the habitat amount and habitat continuum hypotheses, according to which persistence in modified landscapes is related to total habitat amount rather than habitat configuration or the ability of species to use all habitats to varying degrees. Distinguishing between these theories is essential for effective conservation planning in modified landscapes.ObjectiveIdentify which factors of habitat type, amount and configuration predict the persistence of a keystone woodland specialist, the eastern bettong Bettongia gaimardi, in a fragmented landscape.MethodIn the Midlands region of Tasmania we carried out camera surveys at 62 sites in summer and winter. We included habitat and landscape features to model whether habitat amount or patch size and isolation influenced the presence of the eastern bettong, and to measure effects of habitat quality.ResultsHabitat amount within a 1km buffer was a better predictor of occupancy than patch size and isolation. Occupancy was also affected by habitat quality, indicated by density of regenerating stems.ConclusionOur results support the habitat amount hypothesis as a better predictor of presence. For a species that is able to cross the matrix between remnant patches and utilise multiple patches, the island biogeography concept does not explain habitat use in fragmented landscapes. Our results emphasize the value of small remnant patches for conservation of the eastern bettong, provided those patches are in good condition.

AB PurposeConversion of shaded agroforests to unshaded monocultures endangers the resilience of tropical landscapes. Landscape-scale impacts of alternative shade managements have rarely been assessed. This study explored plantation- and landscape-level impacts of different shade management strategies on aboveground biomass, functional group diversity, and economic potential of cocoa production in northern Ecuador.MethodsWe simulated several cocoa shade management scenarios, using the dynamic forest model LANDIS-II: (i) baseline' projections representing the current mosaic of traditional agroforests, planted agroforests, and unshaded monoculture plantations; (ii) traditional' agroforestry shaded by native fruit and timber trees; (iii) planted' agroforests shaded by planted fruit trees; and (iv) monoculture' unshaded plantations. The impacts of setting aside 20, 30, and 40% of cocoa plantations for natural regeneration was tested for the monoculture scenario.ResultsTraditional agroforests shaded by native trees stored up to 7% more aboveground biomass and had higher abundances of rare functional groups compared to monocultures after 50years of simulation. Smaller effects were found for planted agroforests. Shaded plantations and land set aside for natural regeneration reduced forest fragmentation at the landscape level. The estimated yield gap for monoculture and shaded plantations could not be compensated by additional revenues for carbon storage at current carbon market price.ConclusionsImproving payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes are needed to incentivize smallholders to maintain substantial non-cocoa tree cover that may provide an environmental-friendly way to improve economic potential and food security for smallholders, while supporting biomass and functional group diversity at the landscape level.

AB The nitrogen (N) cycle in terrestrial ecosystems is strongly influenced by resorption before litter fall and by mineralization after litter fall. Although both resorption and mineralization make N available to plants and are influenced by climate, their linkage in a changing environment remains largely unknown. Here, our synthesis study shows that, at the global scale, increasing N-resorption efficiency negatively affects the N-mineralization rate. As temperature and precipitation increase, the increasing rates of N cycling closely correspond to a shift from the more conservative resorption pathway to the mineralization pathway. Furthermore, ecosystems with faster N-cycle rates support plant species that have higher foliar N:P ratios and microbial communities with lower fungi:bacteria ratios. Our study shows an ecosystem scale trade-off in N-acquisition pathways. We propose that incorporating the dynamic interaction between N resorption and N mineralization into Earth system models will improve the simulation of nutrient constraints on ecosystem productivity.

AB Germination responses of non-dormant seeds to temperature and thermal requirements are affected by the geoclimatic origin of the species, along with specific attributes such as life form, life cycle or seed size. We evaluated the relationship of these attributes and temperature to germination in 18 species that inhabit a convergence area of two biogeographic realms. Seeds were sown at different constant temperatures. Base temperature (T-b) and thermal time for 50% germination ((T(50))) were determined. For T-b, (T(50)) and seed size, we performed a cluster analysis and then applied a discriminant analysis (DA). DA was also performed using geoclimatic origin, life form and life cycle as grouping variables. Seed that did not germinate were transferred to the benefit temperature for germination. Finally, ethylene was applied to the remaining seeds that did not germinate. Temperature significantly affected final germination. T-b varied between 5 and 13 degrees C in 15 species and 19.0-21.5 degrees C in the remainder; (T(50)) was 7-30 degrees Cd in eight species and 50-109 degrees Cd in the remainder. Cluster analysis showed three groups, and DA evidenced the relevance of T-b and (T(50)) for this separation. Differences in life cycle were related to (T(50)). The geoclimatic origin was not significant. Thermoinhibition or thermodormancy were found in some species.T-b overlaps with environmental temperature of the growth season. Thermal traits for germination mainly reflect the species' life cycle, which is related to the main differences in reproductive performance among annuals and perennials. Local adaptation might mask the effect of geoclimatic origin of a species.

AB The southeastern Amazon region has been intensively occupied by human settlements over the past three decades. To evaluate the effects of human settlements on land-cover and land-use (LCLU) changes over time in the study site, we evaluated multitemporal Landsat images from the years 1984, 1994, 2004, 2013 and Sentinel to the year 2017. Then, we defined the LCLU classes, and a detailed "from-to" change detection approach based on a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was employed to determine the trajectories of the LCLU changes. Three land-cover (forest, montane savanna and water bodies) and three land-use types (pasturelands, mining and urban areas) were mapped. The overall accuracies and kappa values of the classification were higher than 0.91 for each of the classified images. Throughout the change detection period, similar to 47% (19,320 km(2)) of the forest was preserved mainly within protected areas, while almost 42% (17,398 km(2)) of the area was converted from forests to pasturelands. An intrinsic connection between the increase in mining activity and the expansion of urban areas also exists. The direct impacts of mining activities were more significant throughout the montane savanna areas. We concluded that the GEOBIA approach adopted in this study combines the advantages of quality human interpretation and the capacities of quantitative computing.

AB The Brazilian Cerrado is considered to be the most species-rich savannah region in the world, covering 2 million km(2). Uncontrolled late season fires promote deforestation, produce greenhouse gases (similar to 25% of Brazil's land-use related CO2 emissions between 2003 and 2005) and are a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. Governmental institutions therefore implemented early dry season (EDS) prescribed burnings as part of integrated fire management (IFM) in protected areas of the Cerrado, with the aim to reduce the area and severity of late dry season (LDS) fires. The planning and implementation of EDS prescribed burning is supported by satellite-based geo-information on fuel conditions, derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel -2 data. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering algorithm was used to analyse the data, and the relationship between the resulting matched fractions (dry vegetation, green vegetation and soil) and in situ surface fuel samples was assessed. The linear regression of in situ data versus matched filter scores (MF scores) of dry vegetation showed an r(2) of 0.81 (RMSE = 0.15) and in situ data versus MF scores of soil showed an r(2) of 0.65 (RMSE = 0.38). To predict quantitative fuel load, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with MF scores of NPV and soil as predictors (adjusted r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.001; standard error = 0.075). The fuel load maps were additionally evaluated by fire managers while planning EDS prescribed burning campaigns. The fuel load mapping approach has proven to be an effective tool for integrated fire management by improving the planning and implementation of prescribed burning, promoting pyrodiversity, prioritising fire suppression and evaluating fire management efforts to meet overall conservations goals. National and state level authorities have successfully institutionalized the approach and it was incorporated into IFM policies in Brazil.

AB Biochar is anticipated to be an effective option for mitigating nitrogen (N) leaching and improving the hydraulic characteristics of soil, particularly sandy soil. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the effect of biochar on N leaching and hydraulic conductivity (K) in fine-textured soil. Additionally, whether different biochar application methods have different effects on N leaching and K remains unclear. Therefore, our objective in this study is to determine the effects of biochar with different application methods on nitrate/ammonium leaching and K in silty clay soil. The three biochar application patterns were as follows: A, biochar was mixed into 0-10 cm of surface soil; B, biochar was mixed into 10-20 cm of subsurface soil; and C, biochar was mixed evenly into 0-20 cm of plow layer soil. In addition, biochar was added at three rates, namely, 1%, 2% and 4% (mass ratios), and a soil column without biochar addition served as the control (CK). Our results demonstrated that the choice of biochar application method significantly influenced N leaching and soil K and balance between the soil K and N leaching, particularly for nitrate. Additionally, the leaching of N in silty clay soil occurred mainly in nitrate form. Compared with the CK, all 1% biochar treatments increased nitrate leaching (except C1%, which showed no differences from the CK) and tended to decrease K. However, all 4% biochar treatments increased nitrate leaching due to a high K. All 2% biochar treatments significantly reduced nitrate leaching by 8.3-17.0%, and B2% significantly increased the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of soil by 20.9%. Hence, the mixing of biochar at a rate of 2% into the subsurface soil effectively mitigated N leaching and increased K in silty clay soil. These findings could have some implications for the field application of biochar. For instance, the combination of subsurface biochar application with that of fertilizer to roots in orchards or with deep tillage in fields, which would mimic the B2% model, would yield multiple benefits, including lower costs.

AB Groups of species that are widely distributed along an environmental gradient can exhibit adaptations and plasticity, resulting from susceptibility to different pressures. Certain groups of rodents and rabbits that are distributed throughout the Neotropical region are ideal models to evaluate such trait changes. Using geometric morphometric procedures, our objective was to analyse the influences of allometric, environmental, and geographical variables on the skull shape of Cuniculus paca, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, Nectomys spp., and Sylvilagus brasiliensis. Our results indicate the effect of allometry was particularly evident in Nectomys, which should be related, in part, to the sexual dimorphism present in that genus. The environment was a determinant of the skull shape in all taxa, but was most prominent in H. hydrochaeris. A smaller effect of geographical distance (geography) on skull shape was present in all taxa, but was more relevant in H. hydrochaeris and C. paca, suggesting a spatially-structured environmental dependence. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of different biological processes acting on smaller-sized and less mobile taxa, compared to larger and more dispersive taxa. Therefore, we can dissociate the neutral and niche processes that relate to the characteristics of each taxon. This includes environmental filtering in more dispersive taxa, which is responsible for changing shape structures in a relevant manner, such as the larger auditory bulla found in more arid and climatically seasonal sites.

AB Remnants of lowland rain forest remain following deforestation, but the longer-term effects of fragmentation remain poorly understood, partly due to the long generation times of trees. We study rain forest trees in three size classes: seedlings (<1 cm dbh), saplings (1-5 cm dbh), and trees (>5 cm) that broadly reflect pre- and post-fragmentation communities, and we examine the impacts of fragmentation on forest regeneration in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We found that seedling richness (measured as the number of genera per plot) in fragments was about 30 percent lower than in plots in undisturbed forest, and about 20 percent lower than in an extensive tract of selectively logged forest, providing evidence of recruitment declines in fragments. Seedling richness was lowest in small, isolated, and disturbed fragments, potentially signaling an extinction debt given that these fragmentation impacts were not observed in trees. Unlike seedlings, saplings showed no declines in richness in fragments, suggesting that density dependent mortality (where rare individuals have a higher survival rate) and/or year-to-year variation in which species are recruiting could potentially compensate for the reductions in seedling richness we observed. Longer-term studies are required to determine whether sporadic or failed recruitment in small fragments will eventually translate into reduced richness of mature trees, or whether the processes that currently retain high sapling richness will continue in fragments.

AB Reef ecosystems are amply distributed and ecologically relevant in Mexico, however, there is not an integrated inventory of these ecosystems, and information about uses and pressures is disperse. With the aim of generating updated information that allows to know the presence and distribution of the different types of reefs (coral, rocky-coral, rocky, and rocky with Macrocystis pyrifera), as well as to know the uses and pressures to which they are subjected. In this article we present an inventory of the 755 reef ecosystems known in Mexico based in a literature review of 194 documents and validated by informal interviews to key Mexican experts. Mexican reefs are distributed in seven regions identified for reef management purposes, according to the combination of eight maritime regionalization proposals of the Mexican seas. The main uses of reef ecosystems are fishing, tourism, nautical, and mining, which produce eight main pressures: pollution, habitat fragmentation, coral bleaching, overfishing, exotic species introduction, sedimentation, coral mortality, and coral diseases. These uses and pressures are distributed heterogeneously in the seven reef regions. The main conservation tool used by Mexican Federal Government to protect these reefs are the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Almost 45% of the listed reefs are within one of the 30 Mexican MPAs, being the coral reefs the ones that predominate in this protection scheme. In this research we present relevant information for the management of the reef ecosystems of Mexico, which support the debate on the analysis of public policies for their conservation.

AB Woody encroachment is occurring globally: however, the tropical grassy ecosystems, which dominate Africa, are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon. Encroached ecosystems experience significant changes in biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and service provisioning. One such vital ecosystem service is the provisioning of grazing. As encroachment can reduce grass production through the shading out of shade-intolerant grasses, there is a need to better predict these impacts particularly, since multiple woody species act as encroachers and little is known on their differential effects. Encroacher species may affect grass production differently, depending on the architecture of their canopies. This study therefore aimed to compare the effects of two structurally different encroaching species (a shrub vs a tree) (Dichrostachys cinerea and Terminalia sericea) on grass biomass. We tested the effects of canopy architectural traits of these two species on grass biomass using field sampling in a savanna conservation area in southern Zimbabwe. Canopy cover was a strong predictor of grass biomass, where increasing canopy cover significantly reduced grass biomass under both species. However, the architecture of the shrub D.cinerea, typified by a large crown diameter and crown height and a small crown base-height, created more shade, which had a significantly greater negative effect on grass biomass than the canopies of T.sericea at the same stem density. Architectural traits are therefore considered useful in predicting impacts of encroaching species on grass biomass. The findings show that encroachment of D.cinerea holds the potential to cause a regime shift from an open system to a closed system as a result of its extensive canopy cover. (C) 2018 SAAB.

AB Information on the wildlife of the middle and upper reaches of the Purus in Brazil is scarce, and this region is one of the major remaining gaps in our understanding of the distributions and population status of mammals in the Brazilian Amazon. In this paper, we present information on the diversity of mammals of the middle Purus, in the south of Amazonas State, Brazil. Based on rapid inventories in four protected areas, and line-transect censuses in one of them, we provide locality records that indicate expansions of the known range of six primate species and a squirrel. Species more frequently seen during censuses were small and mid-sized primates and rodents, while records of larger mammals, which are more sensitive to subsistence hunting, were infrequent or lacking. Deforestation in the area is relatively low, but the area is close to the so-called "arc of deforestation" that is moving north and west from the north of the state of Mato Grosso into the states of Acre and Amazonas. The middle and upper Purus basin has been little explored, but is far from pristine, and populations of most of the species that are vulnerable to forest degradation and hunting are already reduced, especially close to the major rivers.

AB Phototrophic microbial mats dominated terrestrial ecosystems for billions of years, largely causing, through cyanobacterial oxygenic photosynthesis, but also undergoing, the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.5 billion years ago. Taking a space-for-time approach based on the universality of core metabolic pathways expressed at ecosystem level, we studied gene content and co-occurrence networks in high-diversity metagenomes from spatially close microbial mats along a steep redox gradient. The observed functional shifts suggest that anoxygenic photosynthesis was present but not predominant under early Precambrian conditions, being accompanied by other autotrophic processes. Our data also suggest that, in contrast to general assumptions, anoxygenic photosynthesis largely expanded in parallel with the subsequent evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. Finally, our observations might represent space-for-time evidence that the Wood-Ljungdahl carbon fixation pathway dominated phototrophic mats in early ecosystems, whereas the Calvin cycle probably evolved from pre-existing variants before becoming the dominant contemporary form of carbon fixation.

The agenda calls for developing a system of refugia and a scientific methodology for predicting impacts of the infrastructure development vision for the region. It also calls for a collaborative approach to conservation planning, in the interest of fruitful engagement with decision-makers and stakeholders. The ideas explored here emerged from the collaboration of peers over a decade, which culminated in a panel presentation, Scientific Analysis, and Simulation Models to Support Conservation and Development Decision-Making, at the Tools and Strategies Workshop held at the University of Florida in October, 2017.

AB Command-and-control policies are often criticized as insufficient to tackle tropical deforestation. Over the past two decades, both academics and policy-makers have promoted incentive-based policies, notably REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), as attractive alternatives to curb forest loss, while also potentially contributing to the poverty reduction of forest-dwelling populations. Governments have been the driving force behind the largest incentive-based forest conservation programs in Latin America. Many science-based recommendations on how to design effective incentive-based policies have, however, not found much resonance within policy circles. To understand the gap between recommendations and practice, it is important to analyze how these schemes are designed towards achieving environmental and non-environmental outcomes. To this end, we analyzed the comprehensive history of governance dynamics behind two government-led incentive schemes in Ecuador and Peru. We found that electoral interests and bureaucratic politics exerted pressure on policy design teams, which eventually traded off long-term societal efficiency concerns against short-term administrative goals. Priority was often given to non-environmental concerns, due to perceptions of political feasibility, the influence of non-environmental government agencies, and beliefs in particular government roles or public response. These findings are especially relevant for scholars studying the design, implementation and impacts of incentive-based conservation policies, and for practitioners aiming to enhance policy efficiency.

AB We established a greenhouse experiment to investigate the interactive impact of irradiance (100%, 25% and 4% of full sunlight) and water (100%, 50%, and 25% water-holding capacity) on seedling growth of five tropical dry-forest tree species (Acacia catechu, Dalbergia sissoo, Lagerstroemia parviflora, Bridelia retusa, Terminalia arjuna) with varying growth rate, light requirement and drought tolerance. It was observed that across irradiances relative growth rate (RGR) was determined by net assimilation rate (NAR) as compared to leaf area ratio and specific leaf area. Acacia catechu was found to be most drought hardy while Dalbergia sissoo most drought sensitive showing decline in RGR from 21 to 46%, respectively under extreme water stress and high irradiance. NAR and RGR were substantially declined in light demanders under shade irrespective of water level and the maximum decline was observed in Dalbergia sissoo (49 and 58%, respectively). Light demander species showed greater modulation in physiological attributes than the shade tolerant across irradiances. These modulations in structural and physiological attributes of the selected tree species indicate the growth strategies adopted by the tropical dry-forest plants against environmental uncertainties in terms of light availability and precipitation during their growth period.

TI Role of traditional homegardens in biodiversity conservation and

SO TROPICAL ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE Crops; homegarden; Northeast India; Tangkhul; traditional community
AB Traditional communities in various parts of the world are facing various challenges owing to shrinking per capita land availability and growing market economy. This has led to shift in land use in which polyculture of variety of traditional crops are being slowly replaced by market driven monoculture system of cultivation to meet the demands to market on one side and maximization of production on the other side. As a result, the traditional crops in homegarden are being threatened in many areas. A study on conservation of tradition crops in homegarden in Tangkhul community in Ukhrul District of Manipur, India was carried out to assess the impact of such change in terms of crop species and their socioecological significance. A total of 73 plant species of economic, social and cultural values belonging to 27 families were recorded in homegardens. Result of this study shows that Tangkhul traditional community has vast indigenous knowledge on conservation of biodiversity in limited homegarden sites. Understanding traditional knowledge concerning HGs and how this form the knowledge for choice of species across the local community could help developing better strategies for sustainable management of traditional homegarden. Conservation of such rich biodiversity by traditional communities should be encouraged and proper support can be provided by government so as to withstand market-driven pressure.

AB Demography varies in response to multiple interactive drivers at varying scales. However, these relationships are often assessed piecemeal, particularly without consideration of drivers at the landscape level. We developed a model to predict population dynamics of an endangered, perennial herb Hypericum cumulicola across a range of landscape drivers. We estimated vital rates using 22years of annual census data from 15 populations (10,910 and 38,313 unique observations) and additional seeding experiments, considering four landscape drivers (time-since-fire, patch area, patch aggregation and patch elevation). We combined these models into integral projection models to assess population parameters. Predictions of occupancy and density were compared with an independent dataset of 33 habitat patches. We also evaluated the effect of fire-return interval on population persistence. The landscape drivers had interactive effects on vital rates and demography. Occupancy was predicted for most patches, including many that were unoccupied. Abundances were poorly predicted, primarily because projections were unreliable for patches having intermediate areas and aggregation. When these patches were removed, the model explained 42% of the variance in abundance. Projected population growth was greater and extinction risk lower under more frequent fire-return intervals, at higher elevations, and in larger and more aggregated patches. Our modelling suggests that fire can be prescribed less often in larger than smaller patches to support a viable metapopulation of H. cumulicola.Synthesis. The integration of landscape-level drivers and detailed demographic data is a valuable tool for understanding species abundances, distributions and dynamics at large scales. We evaluated the effect of interactions among fire, patch elevation, area and aggregation on the demography of a rare and endangered plant. Our findings reinforce the importance of regional dynamics. These drivers and their interactions suggest locations that can support higher vital rates, occupancy and abundance, and what fire-return intervals are optimal depending on landscape characteristics. This approach demonstrates a link between plant demography and landscape variables, although further work is needed to improve ecological predictions.

AB Global climate change has been reported to affect tree growth around the world and such impacts are predicted to be intensified under future climate change particularly in the tropics. It is therefore important to study the climate-growth relationships of tropical trees to understand how they have responded to the past climate variability and to predict how they will respond to future climatic changes. We investigated tree radial growth responses to regional climatic changes in Bangladeshi moist tropical forests. We selected three species based on their distinct growth-ring boundaries and their wide distribution around the tropics. First, we simulated growth responses to climate for the past 66 years (1950-2015) based on the climate-growth relationships. Next, we projected tree-growth until the end of current century (2016-2100) under different climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP). All the three species produced statistically robust ring-width index chronologies covering the current and the past century. Climate-growth analysis revealed that temperature (monthly, annual and seasonal) significantly negatively affected tree radial growth in all three species. Precipitation prior to the current growing season negatively and current year post monsoon precipitation positively influenced radial growth. Tree radial growth was also influenced by Nino 3.4 region Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies mainly through the modulation of local climate. We projected tree radial growth to be declined in all three species by 20% under high concentration scenario (RCP 8.5) followed by 11.3% and 9% under medium (RCP 6.0) and low-medium concentration scenarios (RCP 4.5). If these species show similar growth responses to climatic changes in other native ranges across the tropics, this could have severe consequences for the carbon balance of tropical forests.

AB The terrestrial biogeochemical cycle of mercury has been widely studied because, among other causes, it presents a global distribution and harmful biotic interactions. Forested ecosystems shows great concentrations from Hg and Litterfall is known as the major contributor to the fluxes at the soil/air interface, through the superficial adsorption on the leaves and by the gas exchange of the stomatal pores. The understanding of which processes control the stage of Hg cycle in these ecosystems is still not totally clear. The influences of physiological and morphological parameters were tested against the Hg concentrations in the leaves of 14 endemic species of an evergreen tropical forest in south-eastern Brazil, and an exotic species from Platanus genus. Pathways were studied through leaf areas and growing tree parameters, where maximum rate of net photosynthesis (Pnmax), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (Gs) were examined. The results obtained in situ indicated a positive correlation between Pnmax and the Hg concentration; Cedrela fissilis and Croton floribundus were the most sensitive species to the accumulation of Hg and the most photosynthetically active in this study. The primary productivity from Tropical forest should be a proxy of Hg deposition from atmosphere to soil, retained there while forests stand up, representing an environmental service of sequestration of this global pollutant. Therefore, forests and trees with great photosynthetic potential should be considered in predictions, budgets and non-geological soil content regarding the global Hg cycle. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper evaluates microscale evidence for "land sparing" in a von Thunen framework. A panel dataset of household lots in Rondonia, Brazil is used to test the hypothesis that the closer a household is to market the more likely it will adopt land-sparing patterns of cattle production in response to rising demand for beef and milk. Results from a fixed effects model suggest that, consistent with theory, pasture area declines and forest is spared in lots located closer to market. Other results differ, however, depending on forest type and commodity. Greater initial endowments of forest are associated with more deforestation.

AB Survey costs and a lack of taxonomists are often the main impediments to biodiversity inventories. The use of a higher-taxon approach that is efficient in representing species patterns within a short period of time is one way to overcome these constraints, especially if these responses are consistent at various spatial scales and sampling techniques. Here, we evaluated whether the use of pitfall trapping or Winkler extraction influenced the utility of genus as a surrogate to predict patterns of species richness and composition related to environment. The study sites were spread along 10 degrees of latitude, covering phytophysiognomies with different topographic characteristics. We recorded 450 ant species/morphospecies distributed in 70 genera. Pitfall-traps captured a larger proportion of species (77-98%) and genera (71-100%) per site. Genus was efficient in predicting variations in richness, and assemblage composition detected at the species level, using pitfall-traps or Winkler extractors. The higher-taxon approach saved approximately 40% of the surveys costs. The negative effect of the species-genus ratio was detected only on species composition, but it did not affect the quality of predictions using genera. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that genus can be used as a proxy for broader sets of species independent of sampling technique or environmental heterogeneity. The use of pitfall-traps or Winkler extractors for genus-level identification proved to be cost-efficient and time-efficient and should work well in other regions requiring conservation effort and monitoring programs.

We sampled woody trees (>= 1 cm dbh) from 21 forest patches in the upper Nilgiri hills (> 2000 m elevation) and recorded a total of 35,146 individuals of 61 species, 45 genera and 30 families. Species richness and abundance of sapling/shrubs (>= 1 to < 10 cm dbh) increased significantly with increasing patch size, but the species richness and abundance of small, medium and larger trees (>= 10 to < 30, >= 30 to < 60 and >= 60 cm dbh, respectively) did not. Overall, forest interior species richness and abundance increased significantly with increasing patch size but edge species richness did not. Species richness and abundance of shade-tolerant and shade-demanding tree species also increased with increasing patch size. The abundance of zoochory dispersed tree species was significantly related to increasing patch size, but those dispersed by autochory did not display any clear relationship between patch size and species richness or abundance. Our findings suggest that with increasing forest patch area, tree compositional patterns may be driven by species specific shade-tolerance adaptations and dispersal patterns. Differential responses in these traits by the plant community within the individual habitat zones of forest edge and interiors likely plays a major role in determining the inherent plant community and thus the subsequent ecological processes of forest patches, including their responses to increasing patch area.

AB Environmental policies have highlighted the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss. A crucial issue for landscape managers is how to reconcile conservation measures that benefit all species and the maintenance of human activities. This study aimed to promote landscape multifunctionality, i.e., improving connectivity for several species without significantly modifying human activities. The objectives were to identify the most strategic natural landscape types to prioritize for preservation and to propose landscape management actions in highly anthropized areas that would benefit a majority of species. The analysis combined landscape types and bird species observation data to model landscape suitability for six species profiles defined by their affinity for wetlands, agricultural areas, urban areas and three types of forested landscapes. By graph modelling, we analysed the functional connectivity of the ecological networks of these species profiles. The results revealed that only ten landscape types out of 72 were core habitats for three species profiles simultaneously. These were primarily forested landscape types - either strict or associated with open areas (wasteland, forest clearing). Conversely, some anthropogenic landscapes dominated by built areas and sometimes shared with agriculture were completely unfavourable for all species profiles. The graph modelling analysis showed that the transformation of some landscape types could potentially improve connectivity for four species profiles presenting different ecological requirements. This coupling approach thus provided guidance to propose some landscape management actions that benefit the majority of species while preserving land uses.

AB Tropical forests harbor diverse ecological communities of plants and animals that are organized in complex interaction networks. The diversity and structure of plant-animal interaction networks may change along elevational gradients and in response to human-induced habitat fragmentation. While previous studies have analyzed the effects of elevation and forest fragmentation on species interaction networks in isolation, to our knowledge no study has investigated whether the effects of forest fragmentation on species interactions may differ along elevational gradients. In this study, we analyzed main and interaction effects of elevation and forest fragmentation on plant-frugivore interaction networks at plant and bird species level. Over a period spanning two years, we recorded plant-frugivore interactions at three elevations (1000, 2000 and 3000 m a.s.l.) and in two habitat types (continuous and fragmented forest) in tropical montane forests in southern Ecuador. We found a consistent effect of elevation on the structure of plant-frugivore networks. We observed a decrease in the number of effective bird partners of plants and, thus, a decline in the redundancy of bird species with increasing elevation. Furthermore, bird specialization on specific plant partners increased towards high elevations. Fragmentation had a relatively weak effect on the interaction networks for both plant and bird species, but resulted in a significant increase in bird specialization in fragmented forests at high elevations. Our results indicate that forest fragmentation may have stronger effects on plant-frugivore interaction networks at high compared to low elevations because bird species richness declined more steeply towards high elevations than plant species richness. We conclude that conservation efforts should prioritize the maintenance of consumer diversity, for instance by maintaining stretches of continuous forest. This applies in particular to species-poor communities, such as those at high elevations, as the ecological processes in these communities seem most sensitive towards forest fragmentation.

AB Biodiversity extinction thresholds are abrupt declines in biological diversity that occur with habitat loss, associated with a decline in habitat connectivity. Matrix quality should influence the location of thresholds along habitat loss gradients through its effects on connectivity; however these relationships have seldom been explored empirically. Using field data from 23 independent 1254 ha landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we evaluated how tropical avian biodiversity responds to native forest loss within habitat patches embedded either in homogeneous pasture matrix context (with a high proportion of cattle pastures), and heterogeneous coffee matrix context (with high abundance of sun coffee plantations). We considered taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, and tested if matrix type and choice of diversity metric influenced the location of biodiversity thresholds along the forest cover gradient. We found that matrix type postponed the abrupt loss of taxonomic diversity, from a threshold of 35% of forest cover in homogeneous pasture matrix to 19% in heterogeneous coffee matrix. Phylogenetic diversity responded similarly, with thresholds at 30 and 24% in homogeneous-pasture and heterogeneous-coffee matrices, respectively, but no relationship with forest cover was detected when corrected for richness correlation. Despite the absence of a threshold for functional diversity in either matrix types, a strong decline below 20% of habitat amount was detected. Finally, below 20% native habitat loss, all diversity indices demonstrated abrupt declines, indicating that even higher-quality matrices cannot postpone diversity loss below this critical threshold. These results highlight that taxonomic diversity is a more sensitive index of biodiversity loss in fragmented landscapes, which may be used as a benchmark to prevent subsequent functional and phylogenetic losses. Furthermore, increasing matrix quality appears an efficient conservation strategy to maintain higher biodiversity levels in fragmented landscapes over a larger range of habitat loss.

AB We analyzed floristic variations in fern's metacommunity at the local scale and their relationship with abiotic factors in an Atlantic Forest remnant of northeastern Brazil. Floristic and environmental variations were accessed on ten plots of 10 x 20 m. We performed cluster analyses, based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index to establish the floristic relationship. The influence of abiotic factors: luminosity, temperature, relative air humidity and relative soil moisture was evaluated from a redundancy analysis. We found 24 species belonging to 20 genera and 12 families. The fern's flora showed high floristic heterogeneity (>75% for most of the plot's associations). The fern's metacommunity was structured along an abiotic gradient modulated by temperature, luminosity, and relative soil moisture.

AB The Atlantic Forest has been threatened by frequent human disturbances that affect its ecological processes. Lianas are an important component of tropical forest dynamics and, under chronic disturbance, may proliferate vigorously, potentially arresting secondary succession and hindering forest recovery. Our study aims to analyze abundance and diversity of liana and trees in different life stages in a disturbed semidecidual seasonal tropical forest fragment in southeast Brazil. We sampled the species richness and relative abundance in the following life stages of lianas and trees: I-seed (as seed arrival and seed bank processes), II-seedling, III-juvenile, and IV-adult. Lianas are more abundant than trees after the seedling stage, while trees showed more rarefied species richness only at the seed rain stage. Our results show that dispersal does not seem to be a bottleneck for either liana or tree community in disturbed fragments, but competition at the seedling stage may give lianas advantage over trees. Lianas may proliferate abundantly in forest fragments, even decades after disturbance. We recommend interventions for the management and restoration of disturbed forest fragments dominated by lianas to target this life form in life stages where they suppress the forest community, such as after the seedling stage.

AB Rocky intertidal habitats harbor unique and diverse ecosystems that, when located in accessible area, result highly attractive to human visitors. It is known that many activities caused by humans, such as, rock overturning, trampling and organisms' collection harm rocky shore ecosystems, reducing the biodiversity, modifying abundance and altering normal ecosystem functioning. Despite that the collection of edible macroinvertebrates, such as clams, gastropods, sea urchins, anemones and crabs is a very common practice along the Spanish near shore coast, their effects on the ecosystem are poorly documented. This study aims to assess and quantify the human impact on the intertidal rocky shore macroinvertebrate community in two Spanish beaches located together but with very different grade of anthropization, one open to visitors (Santibariez beach) and other with restricted human access (Torregorda beach). A total of 345 intertidal boulders were sampled during one year on the upper and lower intertidal zones. The richness, density, diversity, and evenness of macroinvertebrates were determined and compared. A total of 21,329 individuals were recorded in both beaches belonging to 73 taxa (56% gastropods, 13% crustaceans, 11% bivalves, 8% echinoderms, 12% other groups).
   Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses revealed significant differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity between beaches, tidal zones and, to less extent, between visitor seasons. Although differences observed in the assemblages of the two beaches can be partially due to natural ecological differences, human impacts were also detected. The most obvious effect of the visitors was a significant reduction of some top predators, as the crabs Eriphia verrucosa and Xantho poressa, and an increased number of disturbed boulders at the visited beach (78.3%) versus the restricted beach (2.3%), suggesting that human recreational activities cause effects on target species and on the ecosystem structure. Moreover, restricted beach had lower number of species and densities than visited beach (56 and 64 taxa, 195.1 and 554.6 ind. m(-2), respectively), which could be partially due to the higher density of some top predators at the restricted beach.

AB Selection and drift are universally accepted as the cornerstones of evolutionary changes. Recent theories extend this view to ecological changes, arguing that any change in species composition is driven by deterministic fitness differences among species (enhancing selection) and/or stochasticity in birth and death rates of individuals within species (enhancing drift). These forces have contrasting effects on the predictability of ecological dynamics, and thus understanding the factors affecting their relative importance is crucial for understanding ecological dynamics. Here we test the hypothesis that dispersal increases the relative importance of ecological selection by increasing the effective size of the community (i.e., the size relevant for competitive interactions and drift). According to our hypothesis, dispersal increases the effective size of the community by mixing individuals from different localities. This effect diminishes the relative importance of demographic stochasticity, thereby reducing drift and increasing the relative importance of selective forces as drivers of species composition. We tested our hypothesis, which we term the "effective community size" hypothesis, using two independent experiments focusing on annual plants: a field experiment in which we manipulated the magnitude of dispersal and a mesocosm experiment in which we directly manipulated the effective size of the communities. Both experiments, as well as related model simulations, were consistent with the hypothesis that increasing dispersal increases the role of selective forces as drivers of species composition. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces affecting community dynamics, as well as the management of species diversity, particularly in patchy and fragmented environments.

AB Microclimate within forests influences ecosystem fluxes and demographic rates. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as selective logging can affect within-forest microclimate through effects on forest structure, leading to indirect effects on forests beyond the immediate impact of logging. However, the scope and predictability of these effects remains poorly understood. Here we use a microclimate thermal proxy (sensitive to radiative, convective, and conductive heat fluxes) measured at the forest floor in three 1-ha forest plots spanning a logging intensity gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We show (1) that thermal proxy ranges and spatiotemporal heterogeneity are doubled between old growth and heavily logged forests, with extremes often exceeding 45 degrees C, (2) that nearby weather station air temperatures provide estimates of maximum thermal proxy values that are biased down by 5-10 degrees C, and (3) that lower canopy density, higher canopy height, and higher biomass removal are associated with higher maximum temperatures. Thus, logged forests are less buffered from regional climate change than old growth forests, and experience much higher microclimate extremes and heterogeneity. Better predicting the linkages between regional climate and its effects on within-forest microclimate will be critical for understanding the wide range of conditions experienced within tropical forests.

AB Enrichment planting is a strategy to increase tree diversity and reintroduce desirable species in restored forests, mainly in fragmented landscapes. However, the conditions that improve the performance of enrichment planted seedlings are not yet fully known. Here, we evaluate the role that overstory taxonomic diversity and mean overstory to seedling phylogenetic distance have as predictors of early performance of native tree seedlings planted beneath mixed-species restoration plantations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. By applying a phylogenetic approach, our study responds to recent calls for testing the application of such tools in restoration. We planted 12 mid- to late-successional species beneath a mixed-species restoration plantation with three nested tree diversity levels of 19, 58, and 107 species and estimated the mean phylogenetic distance between each seedling species and the overstory community. Seedling performance was not significantly affected by overstory diversity or mean phylogenetic distance. Overall good performance of the seedlings shows that enrichment planting beneath a mixed-species overstory can be successful even under variations in overstory species number and phylogenetic distance. However, significant species-specific differences in performance highlight the importance of an informed selection of which species to enrich plant.

AB Dogs (Canis familiaris) are among the most abundant and widely distributed carnivores worldwide, and their presence can have negative impacts on native fauna. This study investigated the invasion of cacao agroforests by free-ranging dogs in Brazil. By monitoring the behavior of dogs using direct observations, we assessed whether direct (chasing and predation) and indirect (urine and fecal deposition) interactions with wildlife are more common when dogs enter the agroforests with humans than when they stay outside. We also compared the time that dogs spent inside versus outside the agroforests, and estimated their areas of use. The dogs (n = 10) spent a small fraction of the time without their owners, and only when moving inside the cacao agroforests. The dogs fed and rested more in open habitats and house surroundings than in agroforests, but they were more active and depredated wildlife exclusively in the latter. Kernel estimates of space use at the 50% and 95% levels ranged from 1 to 46 ha and 6 to 202 ha, respectively. Most of the area used by dogs was within cacao agroforest, while core areas were concentrated near human residences and in places of owner permanence in cacao agroforest. Human movement was a key determining factor in the use of space by the dogs. Changes to human behaviors toward their dogs must be considered if the direct and indirect impacts of dogs on wildlife are to be mitigated.

AB Shade tolerance, the minimum light requirement for plant survival, is a key trait for understanding community assembly and forest dynamics. However, it is poorly defined for tree species to date. Current methods of measuring shade tolerance vary considerably in their performance. For instance, some measures of shade tolerance are unreliable except under some specific conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the performance of these methods to provide guidance of choosing appropriate shade tolerance measures in future studies. We collected a large dataset of light traits and other life history traits for 137 understory wood species in a subtropical forest and tested the performance of five commonly used shade-tolerance indices. Results showed that all the shade-tolerance measures, except the low-light abundance index, performed poorly in distinguishing and ranking shade tolerance of the tested species. The shade tolerance quantified by the low-light abundance was consistent with empirical classification of shade-tolerance/intolerance groups and successional seral stages of species. Comparison of the shade tolerance between trees of different diameter at breast height (DBH) or height classes further confirmed the reliability of low-light abundance. We conclude that low-light abundance is the most objective and practical of the five most commonly-used methods for measuring and ranking shade tolerance of understory wood species in our study forest, and likely in other forests as well. The simplicity of the method should greatly facilitate the assessment of light niche differentiation between species and thus contribute to understanding coexistence of tree species in forests.

AB We hypothesized that due to the absence of specialist herbivores in introduced ranges, invasive plants have evolved decreased allocation to carbohydrate storage for regrowth ability and as a consequence allocate more to growth. In this study, we compared plant growth, carbohydrate storage and regrowth ability of invasive and native Jacobaea vulgaris in response to complete shoot defoliation. We used invasive J. vulgaris genotypes from three geographically and climactically distinct regions and compared these with native genotypes from Europe. We found that invasive genotypes initially grew larger while native genotypes regrew larger after defoliation. Before defoliation, the carbohydrate storage in roots of invasive genotypes was 38% lower than native genotypes. Biomass after regrowth increased with root carbohydrate storage while it decreased with structural root mass, showing that it is crucial to study root storage and structural components separately in order to investigate plant regrowth. All studied traits of invasive populations from the three geographically and climatologically distinct regions changed in the same expected direction suggesting that the shifts in herbivore guild were causal to the observed change in growth and regrowth ability rather than environmental factors.

AB Biodiversity experiments have shown that species loss reduces ecosystem functioning in grassland. To test whether this result can be extrapolated to forests, the main contributors to terrestrial primary productivity, requires large-scale experiments. We manipulated tree species richness by planting more than 150,000 trees in plots with 1 to 16 species. Simulating multiple extinction scenarios, we found that richness strongly increased stand-level productivity. After 8 years, 16-species mixtures had accumulated over twice the amount of carbon found in average monocultures and similar amounts as those of two commercial monocultures. Species richness effects were strongly associated with functional and phylogenetic diversity. A shrub addition treatment reduced tree productivity, but this reduction was smaller at high shrub species richness. Our results encourage multispecies afforestation strategies to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change.

AB Population surveys are a prerequisite for evaluating the demographic trends of species. Moreover, they are indispensable for assessing conservation measures implemented to protect threatened species. Accurate surveys require robust methods that can be easily reproduced over time. The aim of this study conducted on Grand Rouveau Island was to test the applicability of a long-term monitoring method to a threatened cryptic and nocturnal species: the European leaf-toed gecko Euleptes europaea. The method consisted of constructing artificial refuges attractive to the species to simplify monitoring of the population. To this end, two types of shelters were tested: one type was constructed from honeycomb brick and the other from curved ceramic roof tiles covered with piles of stones. The results showed that the system consisting of three superimposed tiles was particularly suitable for the desired objectives. It is simple to construct, easy to monitor and little affected by temporal, meteorological or observer bias. The shelters of this type placed in May 2014 were rapidly colonized by the species on a long-term basis, as indicated during the first four years of monitoring. This method could allow future studies to better define the ecological requirements of this species and to assess the success of the ecological engineering actions carried out on the island, which include the elimination of the invasive exotic ice plant Carpobrotus edulis and the black rat Rattus rattus.

AB The knowledge about the early development of seedlings is critical to the success of reforestation and planting in natural forests. The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial development and efficiency of water and nitrogen use by seedlings of four native and exotic species (Calophyllum brasiliense (native). Eucalyptus urograndis (exotic), Mona ciliata (exotic) and Mbebuia impetiginosa (native)) with age of approximately 120 days after sowing for 120 days after transplantation in green-house conditions. Destructive samples were carried out to assess the dry biomass (Leaf, Stern, Root and Total), leaf area, the root shoot ratio and total nitrogen in seedlings. Based on these variables, it was calculated the physiological parameters of growth and efficiency of water use, which was obtained by the ratio between the total dry biomass accumulation and evapotranspiration of vessels in the period, determined by daily weighing in a balance bench. At the end of 240 days after sowing, Calophyllum brasiliense and Tabebuia impetiginosa produced more total biomass and Toona ciliata showed higher root shoot ratio. There were no differences between the relative growth rate of the species evaluated. Eucalyptus urograndis, Toona ciliata and Calophyllum brasiliense showed the highest values of leaf area ratio, Toona ciliata, Tabebuia impetiginosa and Eucalyptus urograndis showed the highest values of specific leaf area, Eucalyptus urograndis and Calophyllum brasiliense show the highest values for leaf mass ratio and Tabebuia impetiginosa, Toona ciliata and Eucalyptus urograndis showed the highest values of net assimilation rate. Based on quantification of total nitrogen, Tabebuia impetiginosa and Toona ciliata were the most efficient species in the use of nitrogen. Eucalyptus urograndis presented the highest evapotranspiration while Calophyllum brasiliense and Tabebuia impetiginosa were the most efficient species in water use.

ID FIRE
AB The species Tabebuia roseoalba, present in the native flora of cerrado, exhibits vegetative propagation in the natural environment. The presence of underground systems that produce buds in woody tree species is related to survival under environmental disturbances. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze and characterize anatomically the underground system producing shoot-buds in the Tabebuia roseoalba species. The material used in the investigation (plagiotropic roots) were cut into ten centimeters long segments, rinsed with water and planted in plastic pots with vermiculite. The segments were kept in a thermostatic chamber during 60 days. After, the material was hand sectioned and then stained with safranin and methylene blue for the microscopic examination. The results indicate that the underground system analyzed has a characteristic arrangement of roots with the protoxylem poles on the outer side (exarch) and the center of the structure is made up entirely of xylem. The characteristics observed in this work lead to propose that the buds are reparative in which their formation is linked to any environmental disturbance in the underground system.

TI Plant responses to variable timing of aboveground clipping and
   belowground herbivory depend on plant age

AB Aims
   Plants use different types of responses such as tolerance and induced defense to mitigate the effects of herbivores. The direction and magnitude of both these plant responses can vary with plant age. However, most studies have focused on aboveground herbivory, whereas important feeding occurs belowground. Here, we tested the hypothesis that plant tolerance and defense following shoot damage or root herbivory depends on plant age.
   Methods
   In order to test our hypothesis, we exposed the perennial grass species Holcus lanatus to defoliation and root nematode inoculation at three growth stages (young, intermediate and old plants), and examined responses of plant traits related to tolerance (regrowth following defoliation) and defense (leaf and root nitrogen and phenolics).
   Important Findings
   Defoliation overall reduced plant shoot and root biomass as well as foliar concentrations of phenolics regardless of plant age at defoliation. In contrast, defoliation increased foliar N concentrations, but only when defoliation occurred at intermediate and old plant age. Inoculation with root-feeding nematodes reduced root N concentrations after a prolonged period of growth, but only when nematodes had been inoculated when plants were young. The relative shoot regrowth rate of plants increased immediately after defoliation but this was independent of the plant age at which defoliation occurred, i.e. was not stronger in plants that were defoliated at a more advanced age, as hypothesized. Similarly, relative root growth rates increased shortly after defoliation, but this was only observed for plants defoliated when they were young. We conclude that plant responses to aboveground and belowground herbivory in traits related to both defense and tolerance are affected by plant age, but do not generally change with plant age.

AB The definition of conservation strategies and ecological assessment schemes requires understanding ecosystem patterns over multiple spatial scales. This study aimed to determine if macro-scale structural and functional (processes) patterns associated with stream ecosystems differed among three neotropical biomes (Cerrado, Amazon, Atlantic Forest). We compared the aquatic communities (benthic invertebrates and hyphomycetes) and processes (decomposition rates, primary production and biofilms growth and aquatic hyphomycetes reproduction rates-sporulation) of Cerrado stream sites (neotropical savannah) against those of stream sites in the connecting biomes of the Atlantic Forest and Amazon (rainforests). We expected that, contrary to the biome dependency hypothesis the community structure and processes rates of streams at the biome-scale would not differ significantly, because those ecosystems are strongly influenced by their dense riparian forests, which have a transitional character among the three biomes. Fifty-three stream sites were selected covering a wide range of geographic locations (Table 1), from near the Equator (2 degrees S) in the Amazon, to intermediate latitudes in the Cerrado (12-19 degrees S), and latitudes closer to the tropic of Capricorn in the Atlantic Forest (19 degrees-25 degrees S). We found that: 1) at the abiotic level, the aquatic ecosystems of the three biomes differed, which was mostly explained by large-scale factors such as temperature, precipitation and altitude; 2) functional and structural variables did not behave similarly among biomes: decomposition and sporulation rates showed larger differences among biomes than invertebrate and aquatic hyphomycete assemblages structure; 3) invertebrate assemblages structure differed between the rainforests and Cerrado but not between rainforests (Amazon and Atlantic Forest) whereas aquatic hyphomycetes were similar among all biomes; 4) biofilm growth and algae concentration in biofilms of artificial substrates were highly variable within biomes and not significantly different between biomes. Overall, aquatic ecosystem processes and community structure differed across biomes, being influenced by climatic variables, but the variation is not as pronounced as that described for terrestrial systems. Considering the potential use of these functional and structural indicators in national-wide ecological assessments, our results indicate the need to define different reference values for different biomes, depending on the variable used. The approach followed in this study allowed an integrative analysis and comparison of the stream ecosystems across three tropical biomes, being the first study of this kind. Future studies should try to confirm the patterns evidenced here with more sites from other areas of the three biomes, and especially from the Amazon, which was the least represented biome in our investigation.

AB Euterpe precatoria Mart. has been demanded due to the functional characteristics of its fruits and, therefore, its planting has been encouraged. However, there is a lack of information about the seedling production system of this palm tree. Neither a favorable environment nor the amount of fertilizer in the substrate have been defined for the production of healthy and vigorous seedlings. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of environments and doses of a slow-release fertilizer on the production of E. precatoria seedlings. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design, with three replications and ten plants per plot. The treatments were arranged in a 4 x 5 factorial scheme, with four environments (under shading levels of 20 %, 30 %, 50 % and 75 %) and five doses of a slow-release fertilizer (0.0 kg m(-3), 2.5 kg m(-3), 5.0 kg m(-3), 7.5 kg m(-3) and 10.0 kg m(-3) of substrate). The seedling height; root collar diameter; number of leaves; leaf, shoot, root and total dry mass; and the Dickson quality index were analyzed. There were significant interactions between the shaded environments and slow-release fertilizer doses for all the analyzed variables. The 75 %-shaded environment yielded better quality seedlings. The slow-release fertilizer can be used to produce E. precatoria seedlings in environments under shading levels of 50 % and 75 %, being the 4.60 kg m(-3) and 8 kg m(-3) doses, respectively, the most recommended ones.

AB 1. In the Mediterranean Sea, dense populations of the gorgonian Paramuricea clavata shape marine animal forests, characterizing the seascapes of coralligenous habitats. Despite concerns for its health, with several anthropogenic threats and recent mass mortality events, mainly triggered by thermal anomalies, the understorey of its forests and the ecological processes that they promote are still little known. Here, the abundance and composition of epibenthic assemblages inside and outside P. clavata forests were investigated across the central and western Mediterranean Sea, by applying a multifactorial sampling design. 2. In spite of the large variability in the structures of epibenthic assemblages at local and regional scales, the gorgonian understoreys share some common features, such as higher abundances of calcareous builder organisms and reduced invasion by the non-indigenous alga Caulerpa cylindracea, compared with the adjacent unforested rocky bottoms. Paramuricea clavata showed non-linear density-dependent relationships with algal turfs and non-encrusting algae belonging to the genus Peyssonnelia. Moreover, by entrapping benthic mucilaginous aggregates with their branches, these gorgonians risk topical necrotic lesions, but may reduce the suffocation risks for understorey organisms. 3. Overall, P. clavata forests may enhance bioconstruction processes and increase resistance and resilience of the benthic assemblages in the Mediterranean coralligenous habitats. This species and its forests, together with their understoreys, should be considered as essential elements of the ecology of the Mediterranean Sea, and therefore worthy of specific and effective protection measures. 4. Conservation strategies should reduce the risk of mechanical damage by regulating fishing activities, anchorages, and scuba diving where gorgonian forests are present. Moreover, when evident alterations are documented, restoration actions should be implemented to recover the integrity of gorgonian forests.

AB Understanding temporal change and long-term persistence of species and communities is vital if we are to accurately assess the relative values of human-modified habitats for biodiversity. Despite a large literature and emerging consensus demonstrating a high conservation value of selectively logged tropical rainforests, few studies have taken a long-term perspective. We resampled small mammals (<= 1 kg) in a heavily logged landscape in Sabah, Borneo between 2011 and 2016 to investigate temporal patterns of species-level changes in population density. We found that small mammal population density in heavily logged forest was highly variable among years, consistent with patterns previously observed in unlogged forest, and uncovered evidence suggesting that one species is potentially declining towards local extinction. Across nine species, population densities varied almost sevenfold during our 6-year study period, highlighting the extremely dynamic nature of small mammal communities in this ecosystem. Strictly terrestrial murid species tended to exhibit strong temporal dynamics, whereas semi-arboreal foraging species such as treeshrews had more stable dynamics. We found no relationships between population density and fruit/ seed mass, and therefore no evidence that our patterns represent responses to inter-annual mast fruiting of the dominant canopy dipterocarp trees. This may be due to the removal of most of the canopy during logging, and hence the dipterocarp seed resource, although it possibly also reflects spatiotemporal limitations of our data. Our results underline the importance of understanding long-term variability in animal communities before developing conservation and management recommendations for human-altered ecosystems.

AB Predicting community responses to disturbance is a major challenge for both ecology and ecosystem management. A particularly challenging issue is that the same type and intensity of disturbance can have different impacts in different habitats. We investigate how habitat contingency influences ant community responses to disturbance in arid Australia, testing the hypothesis that disturbance has a greater impact in more complex habitats. We also assess the effectiveness of a highly simplified ant assessment protocol that considers larger species only. We sampled ants at 46 sites from two habitats (Chandler, low chenopod shrubland; and mulga, low woodland) with contrasting complexity, using distance from water as a surrogate for variation in grazing intensity. We assessed variation in habitat structural variables (basal area of perennial grass, and cover of herbs, litter, and bare ground) and ant communities in relation to habitat and distance from water, first using data from the entire ant community and then for larger ants (>4mm body length) only. Site species richness was almost twice as high in mulga, the more structurally complex habitat, than in Chandler, and ant communities in mulga showed far more variation in relation to distance from water. Litter cover was the key environmental variable associated with the interaction between grazing and habitat: it increased with increasing distance from water in mulga and was virtually absent from Chandler. Analysis of only larger species revealed the same patterns of variation in ant abundance, species richness and composition in relation to habitat and grazing as shown by entire ant communities. Our findings support the hypothesis that disturbance impacts on faunal communities increase with increasing habitat complexity. An appreciation of such habitat contingency is important for a predictive understanding and therefore effective management of disturbances such as rangeland grazing. Our findings also show that simplified assessment can provide robust information on the responses of highly diverse ant communities to disturbance, which enhances their feasibility for use as bio-indicators in land management.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is thought to promote plant species diversity. Theoretical studies showing the importance of CNDD often assumed that all species are equally susceptible to CNDD; however, recent empirical studies have shown species can differ greatly in their susceptibility to CNDD. Using a theoretical model, we show that interspecific variation in CNDD can dramatically alter its impact on diversity. First, if the most common species are the least regulated by CNDD, then the stabilising benefit of CNDD is reduced. Second, when seed dispersal is limited, seedlings that are susceptible to CNDD are at a competitive disadvantage. When parameterised with estimates of CNDD from a tropical tree community in Panama, our model suggests that the competitive inequalities caused by interspecific variation in CNDD may undermine many species' ability to persist. Thus, our model suggests that variable CNDD may make communities less stable, rather than more stable.

AB In forest ecosystems, disturbances that cause tree mortality create canopy gaps, increase growth of understory vegetation, and alter the abiotic environment. These impacts may have interacting effects on populations of ground-dwelling invertebrates that regulate ecological processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. A manipulative experiment was designed to decouple effects of simultaneous disturbances to the forest canopy and ground-level vegetation to understand their individual and combined impacts on ground-dwelling invertebrate communities. We quantified invertebrate abundance, richness, diversity, and community composition via pitfall traps in response to a factorial combination of two disturbance treatments: canopy gap formation via girdling and understory vegetation removal. Formation of gaps was the primary driver of changes in invertebrate community structure, increasing activity-abundance and taxonomic richness, while understory removal had smaller effects. Families of Collembola and Diplopoda, as well as some families of Coleoptera, increased in combined canopy and understory disturbance treatments, whereas Curculionidae and Nitidulidae were more abundant in undisturbed forest. Gaps increased light availability, height and cover of understory vegetation, and soil moisture levels, and decreased depth and cover of leaf litter compared to undisturbed forest. Decoupling of canopy and understory vegetation disturbances revealed gap formation as an important short-term driver of ground-dwelling invertebrate community structure and composition. Our findings increase understanding of how ground-dwelling invertebrate communities respond to disturbance and inform sustainable management of forest ecosystems to foster biodiversity and resilience.

AB Dung consumption and removal is a fundamental ecological process carried out by dung beetles that drive soil nutrient cycling and associated ecosystem services. In this study, the removal rate of small droppings by dung beetles was estimated in natural subtropical rainforests of southern Brazil located along an elevational gradient, in order to understand the factors influencing variation in dung removal. To do that, the comparative explanatory capacity of three main types of variables was quantified: assemblage characteristics, local climatic and habitat conditions, and seasonal variation. The complete disappearance of dung within 48 h after deposition occurs in 73% of occasions. The highest explanatory capacity correspond to the combined effects of the three types of variables; however, average air temperature during the sampling period, total volume of dung beetles collected in the traps in which dung removal was measured, and the seasonal transition from summer to winter were the most important and representative predictors of dung removal. Thus, the dung nutrient incorporation into the soil will most likely be greater during spring-summer conditions, when the air temperature at the time of dung deposition is high and the biomass of the dung beetle assemblage is bigger.

AB The palm swamps (i.e. Veredas) in the Cerrado, Brazilian Savanna, are priority areas for conservation. The Veredas' hydrological characteristics are fundamental for the maintenance of biodiversity and economic activities in this region. However, despite this importance, only a few studies have been carried out in these areas, primarily surveys for dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata). Here, we sampled twenty-live palm swamps in a Cerrado region. We found 56 species of Odonata. ten of which were new records for the Mato Grosso do Sul State: Coenagrionidae (6), Libellulidae (3) and Aeshnidae (1). The Veredas harbor both lentic and lotic systems which contribute to the great regional diversity of Odonata. Our results increase our knowledge about Odonata diversity in Veredas areas of the Cerrado, show the importance of these environments for Odonata species. and emphasize the importance of maintaining the Veredas as Permanent Preservation Areas.

AB With rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, land-use practice, while satisfying the ever-increasing desires of our material civilisation in the short term, may undermine natural ecosystems on a local, regional and global scale in the long run. Innovative and sustainable land-use practices should be developed in response, so that eco-environmental problems can assessed and dealt with during the whole process of land-use planning, construction, operation, maintenance and management. Using a bibliometric analysis, this study has traced global trends in land-use research from 1992 to 2016, as indexed in the Science Citation Index EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). A novel method called word cluster analysis' has revealed that hotspot analysis is one of the emerging techniques, tools and strategies used to respond to, improve, and protect deteriorating ecosystems during land use. Based on involving various elements, the emerging analytical techniques and tools, including geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing, have attracted attention for their ability to assess and solve increasingly serious eco-environmental problems, such as climate change, deforestation, soil erosion, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eutrophication. Ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, protected areas, and sustainable development are also potential resilience strategies used to confront eco-environmental destruction. The maximum benefits that can be derived from natural ecosystems should be pursued to achieve environmentally sustainable land-use development, strengthening the socio-economy and eco-environment, as well as enhancing the well-being of people and nature.

AB Intensively managed timber plantations represent 7% of global forest cover and may partially compensate for deforestation-related biodiversity loss, yet are often criticized as 'green deserts' which support limited biodiversity. Growing concerns about the environmental impact of plantations in Chile have prompted numerous calls for a new forestry paradigm. Here, we systematically review the literature on biodiversity maintenance or loss in Chilean timber plantations and outline a new framework for biodiversity conservation therein, envisioning plantations as potential habitat that can be improved through informed management. Our review (N = 67 relevant publications) shows a strong taxonomic bias towards plants, mammals, birds, and invertebrates, as well as biases in the age and species composition of plantations studied. Most studies (78%) examined Pinta radiata plantations, 48% examined mature stands, and 46% did not specify stand age. Research to date is difficult to translate into conservation policy, since most studies simply compare biodiversity within versus outside of plantations, and do not evaluate alternative management options. To better inform conservation, we identify six critical stages of plantation development during which management decisions may greatly influence biodiversity outcomes. Within each stage we discuss the effects of specific management practices on Chilean biodiversity, highlighting opportunities and key knowledge gaps. Strategies which promote structural complexity, understory cover, and landscape connectivity should help convert plantations into a less hostile matrix that provides adequate habitat for substantial native biodiversity. Given the global proliferation of plantations and their consequences for biodiversity, similar studies are needed in multiple regions of the world.

AB Erythrophleum fordii Oliv. is a valuable rosewood species indigenous to the tropical and warm sub-tropical zones of Vietnam, Laos, and South China. The natural forests have been heavily fragmented mostly due to over-exploitation and over-utilization, and alteration to croplands and fast-growing plantations. Therefore, it has been included in the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species as an endangered species. In the present study, genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 11 populations were estimated by SSR makers in South China. Five high polymorphic loci were studied with a total of 34 alleles, among which, seven were private alleles. The mean number of alleles per locus (A), the mean number of efficient alleles per locus (Ae), the observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity, and Shannon's index (I) of the 11 populations were 3.40, 2.31, 0.52, 0.56, and 0.90, respectively. Correlation analysis between genetic parameters and geographical factors showed that He and I were in significant negative correlation with longitude, indicating that genetic diversity of E. fordii reduced gradually from West to East in south China. F-IS of eight populations with above five samples was on average 0.01, most loci conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in these populations; their genetic differentiation coefficient (F-ST) was 0.18, indicating that genetic differentiation among populations was relatively low and there existed 18% genetic variation among populations. Gene flow (Nm) between these populations was 1.28. The Mantel test showed that genetic distance was not significantly correlated with geographical distance (p > 0.05). It was concluded that populations with high genetic diversity or private alleles, especially Longmen, Wuming and Pingxiang populations should be a priority for in situ conservations, meanwhile more populations and as many families as possible in each population should be collected for ex situ conservations of germplasm resources of this species in the future.

AB Animal populations have undergone substantial declines in recent decades. These declines have occurred alongside rapid, human-driven environmental change, including climate warming. An association between population declines and environmental change is well established, yet there has been relatively little analysis of the importance of the rates of climate warming and its interaction with conversion to anthropogenic land use in causing population declines. Here we present a global assessment of the impact of rapid climate warming and anthropogenic land use conversion on 987 populations of 481 species of terrestrial birds and mammals since 1950. We collated spatially referenced population trends of at least 5years' duration from the Living Planet database and used mixed effects models to assess the association of these trends with observed rates of climate warming, rates of conversion to anthropogenic land use, body mass, and protected area coverage. We found that declines in population abundance for both birds and mammals are greater in areas where mean temperature has increased more rapidly, and that this effect is more pronounced for birds. However, we do not find a strong effect of conversion to anthropogenic land use, body mass, or protected area coverage. Our results identify a link between rapid warming and population declines, thus supporting the notion that rapid climate warming is a global threat to biodiversity.

AB Background & Aims: We assessed the joint role of shrub cover and UV-B on decomposition in a Sonoran Desert grassland. UV is considered an important driver of biogeochemistry in arid grasslands and shrub proliferation in these landscapes can alter both abiotic and biotic drivers of biogeochemistry.
   Methods: We manipulated ambient solar UV-B exposure of Prosopis velutina leaf litter under and away from shrub canopies and assessed decomposition responses over 320 days.
   Results: Leaf litter mass declined 40% during the first 50 days, but only an additional 10% during the remaining 270 days. Decomposition was slower under shrubs, where ground temperatures and total solar radiation were lower than locations away from shrubs. However, the presence/absence of UV-B radiation had no detectable influence on mass loss either under or away from shrubs. UV-B exposure decreased N immobilization suggesting UV-B photodegradation is facilitating microbial access to litter N.
   Conclusions: Higher decomposition of litter away from shrubs may reflect a combination of greater rates of thermal degradation and photodegradation. While UV-B did not directly influence decomposition rates, exposure may alter litter nutrient dynamics. Our study suggests landscape-scale decomposition could decline with increases in woody plant canopy cover owing to shrub-driven changes in microclimate.

AB Wind erosion exerts a fundamental influence on the biotic and abiotic processes associated with ecosystem carbon (C) cycle. However, how wind erosion under different land use scenarios will affect ecosystem C balance and its capacity for future C sequestration is poorly quantified. Here, we simulated different intensities of land uses in Inner Mongolia: control, 50% of vegetation mowed (50M), 100% vegetation mowed (100M), and tillage (TI). We monitored abiotic C flux caused by wind erosion, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and soil characteristics from 2013 to 2016. We found that the frequency of heavy wind exerts a fundamental control over the severity of soil erosion, and its interaction with precipitation and vegetation characteristics explained 69% of the variation in erosion intensity. With increases in land use intensity, the abiotic C flux induced by wind erosion increased rapidly, equivalent to 33%, 86%, 111%, and 183% of the NEE of natural steppe in the control, 50M, 100M, and TI sites, respectively. The erosion-induced decrease in fine fraction soils led to 31%, 43%, and 85% permanent losses of C sequestration potential in the surface soil for 50M, 100M, and TI sites. Overall, our study demonstrates that the abiotic C flux associated with wind erosion is too large to be ignored. The loss of C-enriched fine particles not only reduces the current ecosystem C content but also results in an irreversible loss of future soil C sequestration potential. These dynamic soil characteristics need to be considered when projecting future ecosystem C balance in aeolian landscapes.

AB Extreme events associated with global warming, such as ocean heat waves, can have contrasting fitness consequences for different species, thereby modifying the structure and composition of marine communities. Here, we examined the effects of a laboratory simulated heat wave on the physiology and performance of two Indo-Pacific crustacean species: the shrimp Rhynchocinetes durbanensis and the hermit crab Calcinus laevimanus. We exposed the crustaceans to a control temperature or to a +5 degrees C temperature (25 degrees C vs 30 degrees C) for two consecutive weeks, and weekly analyzed protective proteins, antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxides in muscle and visceral mass. Fulton's K, total protein, %C, and C:N molar ratio of muscle tissue were also analyzed at the end of the experiment. Results showed that 1) the most responsive tissues were the muscle in the shrimp species and the visceral mass in the hermit crab species; 2) biomarker responses in both species occurred mostly after 7 days of exposure; 3) temperature stress led to an increase in biomarker levels; 4) highest biomarker fold-changes were detected in protective chaperones and antioxidants superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase; 4) integrated biomarker indices suggested poorer health status in individuals subjected to the heat wave; 5) performance changes at the organism level were only detected in R. durbanensis; and 6) mortality rates of both species remained unchanged with the heat wave. Finally, we concluded that these species are capable of physiological adjustments in response to rapid environmental changes, which ultimately confers them with enough thermal tolerance to withstand this simulated heat wave without major consequences for fitness.

AB New remote sensing data on vegetation cover and restoration opportunities bring hope to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the hottest of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots. Available estimates of remaining vegetation cover in the biome currently range from 11% to 16%. However, our new land-cover map, prepared at the highest resolution ever (5 m), reveals a current vegetation cover of 28%, or 32 million hectares (Mha) of native vegetation. Simultaneously, we found 7.2 Mha of degraded riparian areas, of which 5.2 Mha at least must be restored before 2038 by landowners for legislation compliance. Restoring the existing legal debt could increase native vegetation cover in the Atlantic Forest up to 35%. Such effort, if well planned and implemented, could reduce extinction processes by increasing connectivity of vegetation remnants and rising total native cover to above the critical biodiversity threshold established for different taxonomic groups. If undertaken, this process can be adaptive to climate change and boost sustainable development in this most populous biome in Brazil, turning it into a hopespot.

AB Tropical dry forests and savannas provide important ecosystem services and harbor high biodiversity, yet are globally under pressure from land-use change. Mapping changes in the condition of dry forests and savannas is therefore critical. This can be challenging given that these ecosystems are characterized by continuous gradients of tree and shrub cover, resulting in considerable structural complexity. We developed a novel approach to map, separately, continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover across the South American Gran Chaco (1,100,000 km(2)), making full use of the Landsat-8 optical and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image archives. We gathered a large training dataset digitized from very-high resolution imagery and used a gradient-boosting framework to model continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover at 30-m resolution. Our regression models had high to moderate predictive power (85.5% for tree cover, and 68.5% for shrub cover) and resulted in reliable tree and shrub cover maps (mean squared error of 4.4% and 6.4% for tree- and shrub cover respectively). Models jointly using optical and SAR imagery performed substantially better than models using single-sensor imagery, and model predictors differed strongly in some regions, especially in areas of dense vegetation cover. Mapping tree and shrub cover separately allowed identifying distinct vegetation formations, with shrub-dominated systems mainly in the very dry Chaco, woodlands with large trees mainly in the dry Chaco, and tree-dominated savannas in the wet Chaco. Our tree and shrub cover layers also revealed considerable edge effects in terms of woody cover away from agricultural fields (edge effects extending about 2 km), smallholder ranches (about 1.2 km), and roads and railways (about 1.4 and 0.9 km, respectively). Our analyses highlight both the substantial footprint of land-use on remaining natural vegetation in the Chaco, and the potential of multi-sensoral approaches to monitor forest degradation. More broadly, our approach shows that mapping canopy structure and distinct layers of woody vegetation in dry forest and savannas is possible across large areas, and highlights the value of the growing Landsat and Sentinel archives for doing so.

AB The rhizosphere harbors complex microbial communities, whose dynamic associations are considered critical for plant growth and health but remain poorly understood. We constructed co-occurrence networks for archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities associated with the rhizosphere and bulk soil of wheat fields on the North China Plain. Rhizosphere co-occurrence networks had fewer nodes, edges, modules and lower density, but maintained more robust structure compared with bulk soil, suggesting that a less complex topology and more stable co-occurrence pattern is a feature for wheat rhizosphere. Bacterial and fungal communities followed a power-law distribution, while the archaeal community did not. Soil pH and microbial diversity were significantly correlated with network size and connectivity in both rhizosphere and bulk soils. Keystone species that played essential roles in network structure were predicted to maintain a flexible generalist metabolism, and had fewer significant correlations with environmental variables, especially in the rhizosphere. These results indicate that distinct microbial co-occurrence patterns exist in wheat rhizosphere, which could be associated with variable agricultural ecosystem properties.

AB Indigenous reserves are increasingly common throughout the tropical world. This is particularly true in Amazonia, where they make up >50% of protected land area. While these reserves offer tremendous opportunities for conservation, hunting represents a considerable threat to primate populations. As eliminating hunting may not be feasible, conservationists must work collaboratively with indigenous groups to promote sustainable management. This requires an understanding of the sociocultural drivers of hunting, quantitatively assessing sustainability, and developing co-management strategies that are commensurable with indigenous ontologies. In this article, we integrate ethnography with sustainability modeling to assess the importance of primate hunting to the livelihoods and culture of indigenous Waiwai in the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area, Guyana and to simultaneously promote sustainable co-management. We collected quantitative data on Waiwai harvesting through hunter self-monitoring and used semistructured interviews, unstructured interviews, and participant observation to understand the cultural importance of hunting to Waiwai society. We incorporated these data into spatially explicit biodemographic models to assess sustainability for four primate species. Primates, particularly spider monkeys (Ateles pansicus), were among the most important Waiwai prey and primate hunting played an important role in the construction of both individual and collective Waiwai identity. Our biodemographic models indicated that hunting will cause relatively little depletion for most primates in 20years, although spider monkeys are predicted to disappear from a majority of the Waiwai catchment area. We argue that successful co-management of hunting in indigenous reserves requires truly integrative approaches that combine quantitative sustainability assessments with detailed concurrent ethnographic research.

AB Seed depredation is recognized as a determining factor in plant community structure and composition. Ants are primary consumers of seeds influencing abundance of epiphytes on trees. This study was conducted in two subunits of a tropical dry forest established on different soil substrates in San Andres de la Cal, Teportlan, in Morelos, Mexico, and experimentally tested whether seed removal activity is higher in tree species with smaller epiphyte loads compared to those with greater epiphyte loads. Five trees were selected at random from six species of trees with high (preferred hosts) or low (limiting hosts) epiphyte loads. Seed removal differed among hosts and different soil substrates in the forest. On relating seed removal to the abundance of arboreal ants, the most consistent pattern was that lower seed removal was related to lower ant abundance, while high seed removal was associated with intermediate to high ant abundance. Epiphyte seed removal by ants influences epiphyte abundance and can contribute considerably to a failure to establish, since it diminishes the quantity of seeds available for germination and establishment.

AB Biodiversity conservation requires understanding how disturbance influences biodiversity patterns at multiple spatial scales. Because the total diversity of species within a given region (gamma diversity) is influenced by both local diversity (alpha diversity) and dissimilarity in community composition (beta diversity), understanding disturbance effects on both components of diversity is essential, especially if disturbance impacts alpha and beta diversities differently. In this three-year study, we examined how a disturbance (annual harvesting of grasslands) and environmental gradients in the proportion of sand locally, habitat size, and landscape diversity influenced the abundance and alpha and beta diversities of ants within tallgrass prairie habitat in Wisconsin. We used a null-model approach to examine how harvest and environmental factors influence beta diversity. Following three years of treatments, we found that ant abundance was greater in harvested sites compared to control sites and ant abundance was positively correlated with soil sandiness. We also found that alpha diversity was lower in harvested sites compared to control sites and none of the measured environmental gradients influenced alpha diversity. The effects of harvest on alpha-diversity patterns may have been mediated through the competitive interactions of the two dominant ant species (Formica montana and Lasius neoniger). In contrast, beta diversity (after adjusting for random effects and changes to alpha diversity) was higher in harvest sites compared to control sites, and variability in community composition was largely driven by the occurrence of rare species. The proportion of sand in the local habitat and habitat size positively influenced beta diversity suggesting that community dissimilarity was due in part to environmental filtering and the size of species pools. Because biomass harvest had contrasting effects on ant alpha and beta diversities, trade-offs in maintaining alpha vs. beta diversity might need to be considered in land management and conservation efforts.

AB Linking the distribution of plant species to geology has generally been biased by the over-simplification of landscape evolution and the lack of understanding of complex geological processes. The Amazonian lowlands have forests in different successional stages, and a growing perception is that such heterogeneity results from long-term environmental changes. This hypothesis is investigated by designing an analytical model based on past and present-day vegetation and successions of the plant communities, combined with an advanced understanding of geological history. An area of southwestern Amazonia was selected for floristic inventories, and we interpreted the paleovegetation based on C/N and delta C-13 analyses of sedimentary organic matter. These data were examined in the context of the geological evolution on the basis of new sedimentological and chronological data. The topographically high Late Pleistocene deposits had continuous and highly diversified late-successional terra firme forests as well as local fluvial paleolandforms of younger ages with less diversified campinarana forests. Late Pleistocene-Holocene terrains in intermediate elevations had terra firme forests, but shorter trees with lower basal areas and ecotonal forests appeared near the confines of the forest-savanna, while Holocene deposits recorded only seasonally flooded varzea forests. Several deposits of Late Pleistocene and Late Pleistocene-Holocene age recorded an expansion of C-4 terrestrial plants before the establishment of the forest from similar to 20,000 cal yr BP to 7578 cal yr BP, which is not related to past arid episodes. We recorded forests with onsets at 6130-3533 cal yr BP, 3402-2800 cal yr BP, and 1624-964 cal yr BP to terra firme, varzea, and ecotonal forests, respectively. However, not all forests have reached maturity stages due to their location on terrains with a diverse history of terrace downcutting and deposition, which had a direct impact on local hydrology with the interaction of topographic gradients. The hydrology of the study area was also controlled by the distance from the main river valley. Capturing long-term disturbances over this region of still pristine forests may help elucidate the potential mechanisms that also determine trends in tree growth and forest diversity in other Neotropical regions.

AB Explaining the high diversity of tree species in tropical forests remains a persistent challenge in ecology. The analysis of spatial patterns of different species and their spatial diversity captures the spatial variation of species behaviors from a plant's eye view' of a forest community. To measure scale-dependent species-species interactions and species diversity at neighborhood scales, we applied uni- and bivariate pair correlation functions and individual species area relationships (ISARs) to two fully mapped 2-ha plots of tropical evergreen forests in north-central Vietnam. The results showed that (1) positive conspecific interactions dominated at scales smaller than 30 m in both plots, while weak negative interactions were only observed in P2 at scales larger than 30 m; (2) low numbers of non-neutral interactions between tree species were observed in both study plots. The effect of scale separation by habitat variability on heterospecific association was observed at scales up to 30 m; (3) the dominance of diversity accumulators, the species with more diversity in local neighborhoods than expected by the null model, occurred at small scales, while diversity repellers, the species with less diversity in local neighborhoods, were more frequent on larger scales. Overall, the significant heterospecific interactions revealed by our study were common in highly diverse tropical forests. Conspecific distribution patterns were mainly regulated by topographic variation at local neighborhood scales within 30 m. Moreover, ISARs were also affected by habitat segregation and species diversity patterns occurring at small neighborhood scales. Mixed effects of limited dispersal, functional equivalence, and habitat variability could drive spatial patterns of tree species in this study. For further studies, the effects of topographical variables on tree species associations and their spatial autocorrelations with forest stand properties should be considered for a comprehensive assessment.

AB Climate warming enables plant species to migrate to higher latitudes and altitudes. Within Europe, the Mediterranean harbours many species that might expand their ranges towards Western Europe. Small seed size may facilitate dispersal, however, it may impair establishment of the range-expanding plant species in the novel vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we examined effects of average seed size of Mediterranean plant species on their establishment in a mixed community of Western European plant species. Applying two levels of densities of the natives and a herbivory treatment, we tested how seed size is linked to response in plant growth and fitness in novel vegetation. While all non-native plant species showed a negative response to increased planting density, species with small seeds showed a less negative response. This effect persisted under herbivory. Our data suggest that small-seeded non-native plant species may tolerate competitive pressure from novel plant communities better than large-seeded species, so that small seed size may confer a higher probability of establishment of non-native species in novel communities.

AB Recent studies on ecological networks have quantified the contribution of ecological, historical, and evolutionary factors on the structure of local communities of interacting species. However, the influence of species' biogeographical traits, such as migratory habits or phylogeographical history, on ecological networks is poorly understood. Meta-networks, i.e., networks that cover large spatial extensions and include species not co-occurring locally, enable us to investigate mechanisms that operate at larger spatial scales such as migratory patterns or phylogeographical distributions, as well as indirect relationships among species through shared partners. Using a meta-network of hummingbird-plant interaction across Mexico, we illustrate the usefulness of this approach by investigating (1) how biogeographical and morphological factors associate with observed interactions and (2) how species-specific biogeographical characteristics associate with species' network roles. Our results show that all studied hummingbird and plant species in the meta-network were interrelated, either directly or through shared partners. The meta-network was structured into modules, resulting from hummingbirds and plants interacting preferentially with subsets of species, which differed in biogeographical, and, to a lesser extent, morphological traits. Furthermore, migrants and hummingbirds from Nearctic, Transition, and widespread regions had a higher topological importance in the meta-network. Our study illustrates how meta-networks may contribute to our current knowledge on species' biogeographical traits and biotic interactions, providing a perspective complementary to local-scale networks.

AB Although biodiversity has value for the global community, biodiversity protection often imposes costs on local communities. Correcting this misalignment requires appropriate local incentives. Conservation agreements (i.e. negotiated transactions in which conservation investors finance social benefits in return for conservation actions by communities) are a form of direct incentive. The results of this approach depend on effective monitoring of ecological and socio-economic impacts to verify that environmental and development objectives are met. Monitoring is also needed to verify that parties to the agreements comply with their commitments. Ecological monitoring results for agreements between Conservation International and communities in the Colombian Amazon show positive conservation impacts. These agreements are designed to protect forest areas and two threatened fish species that are important to local livelihoods and have high commercial value. We show how effective monitoring is essential for identifying long-term sustainability options. Lessons learned from this project inform reflection on emerging frameworks for scaling up the approach to the national level.

AB Abiotic constraints and biotic interactions act simultaneously to shape communities. However, these community assembly mechanisms are often studied independently, which can limit understanding of how they interact to affect species dynamics and distributions. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian neighborhood modeling approach to quantify the simultaneous effects of topography and crowding by neighbors on the growth of 124,704 individual stems 1cm DBH for 1,047 tropical tree species in a 25-ha mapped rainforest plot in Amazonian Ecuador. We build multi-level regression models to evaluate how four key functional traits (specific leaf area, maximum tree size, wood specific gravity and seed mass) mediate tree growth response to topography and neighborhood crowding. Tree growth is faster in valleys than on ridges and is reduced by neighborhood crowding. Topography and crowding interact to influence tree growth in similar to 10% of the species. Specific leaf area, maximum tree size and seed mass are associated with growth responses to topography, but not with responses to neighborhood crowding or with the interaction between topography and crowding. In sum, our study reveals that topography and neighborhood crowding each influence tree growth in tropical forests, but act largely independently in shaping species distributions. While traits were associated with species response to topography, their role in species response to neighborhood crowding was less clear, which suggests that trait effects on neighborhood dynamics may depend on the direction (negative/positive) and degree of symmetry of biotic interactions. Our study emphasizes the importance of simultaneously assessing the individual and interactive role of multiple mechanisms in shaping species dynamics in high diversity tropical systems.

AB The loss of forest cover has been considered to be an important factor in the decline of turtle populations. We used Species Distribution Models (SDM) to identify the potential distribution areas of several turtle species in the Brazilian Amazon and to calculate amount of area possibly lost to deforestation (vulnerability). We then used the software Zonation to prioritize areas for turtle conservation. We assigned higher conservation weight to terrestrial, semi-aquatic and threatened turtles and forced the exclusion of deforested areas. Different scenarios were run to assess the effectiveness of PM in protecting turtles. Priority areas for turtle conservation are located in central-northern Amazon. These regions usually do not encompass high deforestation areas. Areas that turtles are most vulnerable to deforestation are located in central-northeastern Amazon, but only three species lost more potential distribution area to current and predicted deforestation than the percentage of total deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Pluynops geoffroanus, Podocnemis uraftlis, Mesoclemmys gibba and Kinosternon scorpioides had a highest proportion of their potential distribution area lost due to deforestation. Many priority sites for turtle conservation are located outside of PM, even when considering only the top 17% of priority sites. Although we did not explicitly take into consideration the social importance of turtles as a food resource in our analysis, our results highlight the most important regions for investing in conservation of turtles in the Brazilian Amazon. These results have significant practical implications for conservation.

AB When entering a new community, introduced species leave behind members of their native community while simultaneously forming novel biotic interactions. Escape from enemies during the process of introduction has long been hypothesized to drive the increased performance of invasive species. However, recent studies and quantitative syntheses find that invaders often receive similar, or even more, damage from enemies than do native species. Therefore, invasives may be those more tolerant to enemy damage, or those able to maintain competitive ability in light of enemy damage. Here, we investigate whether tolerance and competitive ability could contribute to invasive plant success. We determined whether invasive plants were more competitive than native or noninvasive exotic species in both the presence and absence of simulated herbivory. We found competition and herbivory additively reduced individual performance, and affected the performance of native, invasive, and noninvasive exotic species' to the same degree. However, invasives exerted stronger competitive effects on an abundant native species (Elymus canadensis) in both the presence and absence of herbivory. Therefore, while invasive species responded similarly to competition and simulated herbivory, their competitive effects on natives may contribute to their success in their introduced range.

AB Introduced species may suppress or enhance ecological functions, or they may have neutral effects in ecosystems where they replace or complement native species. Few studies, however, have explicitly tested for these trajectories, and for the effect these might have for native species. In this study, we experimentally test the trajectory and scale of change in the function of 'carrion removal' at different carrion loads along ocean beaches in Eastern Australia that have different numbers of introduced red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and several species of native raptors. We hypothesized that the 'positive' effect of foxes on carrion removal would be greatest at high carrion loads, because competition for resources between native and introduced species is lower. Scavenger abundance, fox occurrences, and carrion consumption by these species differed widely between locations and times. Despite distinct spatial differences in the structure of vertebrate scavenger assemblages, total carrion consumption was not significantly different between locations at any carrion load. This lack of variation in functional rates indicates potential functional plasticity in the scavenger assemblage and possible functional accommodation of red foxes. Neutral fox effects on ecological functions or the ecosystem more broadly are, however, very unlikely to extend beyond carrion consumption.

AB Two strategies for using a model as null are distinguished. Null modeling evaluates whether a process is causally responsible for a pattern by testing it against a null model. Baseline modeling measures the relative significance of various processes responsible for a pattern by detecting deviations from a baseline model. When these strategies are conflated, models are illegitimately privileged as accepted until rejected. I illustrate this using the neutral theory of ecology and draw general lessons from this case. First, scientists cannot draw certain conclusions using null modeling. Second, these conclusions follow using baseline modeling, but doing so requires more evidence.

AB In the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Veracruz, Mexico, managers and farmers of two communities have promoted the cultivation of Chamaedorea hooperiana amid primary forest (P-F) on the assumption that this would provide viable economic income while contributing to forest sustainability. The aim of this study was to test whether or not C. hooperiana is able to grow in P-F without canopy management, and to compare its growth pattern to the one observed in secondary forest (S-F) (acahual) managed by farmers. The performance of C. hooperiana was evaluated for nearly a thousand days in patches of forest from two communal lands dedicated to palm extraction. The results indicate that the palms grew four to five times faster in the S-F than in the P-F, although the number of leaves was only about one-and-a-half times greater. Also, a different growth pattern was detected at each site in terms of plant height and length of leaves, i.e., allometric growth was negative in the P-F (the length of leaves increased more slowly than the height of the palms) and positive in the S-F (length of leaves increased faster than the height of the palms). It was concluded that although C. hooperiana may be defined as a shade-tolerant plant species growing best under intermediate light, seedlings will not grow under a closed canopy of P-F, except at those gaps with enough light. Growing the Mayan palm under S-F opens up the possibility of rehabilitating deforested areas.

AB Human populations and their socio-economic conditions, such as road networks and poverty, are thought to be the main drivers of deforestation. However, a high deforestation rate can also alter the species composition of forests, providing further feedback to the socio-economic drivers of deforestation as well as weakening the community forest management institutions. In this paper, we model the feedback linkages associated with the degradation of forests and the weakening of the local institutions to understand how they impact the long-term sustainability of these linked socio-economic-ecological systems. In particular, we explore the impact of excessive harvesting of forests for fuelwood and fodder on a shift in the species composition from oak to pine trees in the central Himalayan region of India. This shift provides adverse feedback to the communities' livelihoods and erodes the quality of their participatory management institutions. A change in the species composition also increases forest fire risks, which further exacerbates the ecological as well as socio-economic feedback effects. We develop and apply a dynamic optimization model of community forest management where, through optimally controlling harvesting efforts over time, a weighted sum of community and environmental objectives is maximized. Findings indicate that factors such as population size, the extent of dependence of the community on fuelwood, the strength of community institutions, and the degree of feedback effects, affect the long-term sustainability of forests. When faced with forest fire risks, there is a discounting effect present which increases deforestation and institutional entropy.

AB As deforestation and land-use/land-cover change advance in tropical forest regions, an understanding of how plants adjust phenology and reproductive dynamics to altered landscapes can provide insights into plasticity, productivity, and population persistence. We compared the reproductive phenology, sex expression, and flower and fruit production of two monoecious Amazonian palms, Attalea phalerata and Attalea speciosa, in old-growth forest and as remnant trees growing in actively grazed pastures. Using 2 years of phenology data collected from natural populations near Vila Extrema, Rondonia, and eastern Acre, Brazil, we compared flowering and fruiting in the two habitats and tested for effects of palm height, crown size, and light availability on inflorescence and sex expression. Forest conversion to pasture stimulated greater overall flowering and fruiting in individual Attalea palms. As a population, remnant pasture palms continuously bore flowers and fruits year-round, while forest palms flowered seasonally in isolated peaks with consecutive months of inactivity. Crown size and greater light exposure affected flowering and fruiting dynamics in A. phalerata and A. speciosa, respectively, and increased light availability shifted A. speciosa sex expression towards greater female investment, primarily through regulation of sex determination and bud abortion. Removal of tropical forest does not always lead to the downfall of remnant tree populations, and under favorable conditions, such as abandonment of cropland and pasture, higher levels of reproduction can facilitate recovery of future generations. Tree species with flexible sex expression may be particularly resilient in the face of land-use and land-cover change.

AB Gevuina avellana (Proteaceae) is a typical tree from the South American temperate rainforest. Although this species mostly regenerates in shaded understories, it exhibits an exceptional ecological breadth, being able to live under a wide range of light conditions. Here we studied the genetic basis that underlies physiological acclimation of the photosynthetic responses of G.avellana under contrasting light conditions.
   We analyzed carbon assimilation and light energy used for photochemical processes in plants acclimated to contrasting light conditions. Also, we used a transcriptional profile of leaf primordia from G.avellana saplings growing under different light environments in their natural habitat, to identify the gene coexpression network underpinning photosynthetic performance and light-related processes.
   The photosynthetic parameters revealed optimal performance regardless of light conditions. Strikingly, the mechanism involved in dissipation of excess light energy showed no significant differences between high- and low-light-acclimated plants. The gene coexpression network defined a community structure consistent with the photochemical responses, including genes involved mainly in assembly and functioning of photosystems, photoprotection, and retrograde signaling.
   This ecophysiological genomics approach improves our understanding of the intraspecific variability that allows G.avellana to have optimal photochemical and photoprotective mechanisms in the diverse light habitats it encounters in nature.

AB Interpreting morphological variability in terms of species delimitation can be challenging. However, correcting species delineation can have strong implications for the sustainable management of exploited species. Up to now, species delimitation between two putative timber species from African forests, Entandrophragma congoense and E. angolense, remained unclear. To investigate their differences, we applied an integrated approach which combines morphological traits and genetic markers. We defined 13 morphological characters from 81 herbarium specimens and developed 15 new polymorphic microsatellite markers to genotype 305 samples (herbarium samples and specimens collected in the field across the species distribution ranges). Principal component analysis (PCA) of morphological data and the Bayesian clustering analyses of genetic data were used to assess differentiation between putative species. These analyses support two well-differentiated groups (F (ST) = 0.30) occurring locally in sympatry. Moreover, these two groups present distinct morphological characters at the level of the trunk, leaflets, and seeds. Our genetic markers identified few individuals (4%) that seem to be hybrids, though there is no evidence of genetic introgression from geographic patterns of genetic variation. Hence, our results provide clear support to recognize E. congoense as a species distinct from E. angolense, with a much lower genetic diversity than the latter, and that should be managed accordingly. This work highlights the power of microsatellite markers in resolving species boundaries.

AB Coexistence of highly similar species is at odds with ecological theory of competition; coexistence, then, requires stabilizing mechanisms such as differences in ecological niche. In the bacterivore nematode Litoditis marina species complex, which occurs associated with macro-algae, four cryptic lineages (Pm I-IV) co-occur in the field along the south-western coast and estuaries of The Netherlands. Here we investigate the temporal and/or spatial niche differentiation in their natural environment using a qPCR-based detection and relative quantification method. We collected different algal species (i.e. two Fucus species and Ulva sp.) and separated algal structures (i.e. receptacula, thalli, non-fertile tips and bladders) at different sampling months and times (i.e. twice per sampling month), to examine differences in microhabitat use between coexisting L. marina species. Results demonstrate that the cryptic species composition varied among different algal species and algal structures, which was also subject to temporal shifts. Pm I dominated on Fucus spp., Pm II showed dominance on Ulva sp., while Pm III overall had the lowest frequencies. Microhabitat partitioning was most pronounced between the two cryptic species which had similar microbiomes (Pm I and Pm II), and less so between the two species which had significantly different microbiomes (Pm I and Pm III), suggesting that species which share the same microhabitats may avoid competition through resource partitioning. The interplay of microhabitat differentiation and temporal dynamics among the cryptic species of L. marina implies that there is a complex interaction between biotic components and abiotic factors which contributes to their coexistence in the field.

AB Mammals represent the largest-bodied elements of the world's surviving megafauna and provide several key ecosystems services, yet their populations are often under steep decline throughout the tropics. Anthropogenic defaunation is one the most important contemporary threats to modern mammal faunas. Although the Atlantic Forest biome of South America shows several clear signs of defaunation, the extent to which this biome has lost its mammal fauna remains poorly understood. Here, we collate and analyze a comprehensive body of secondary data to quantitatively assess the spatial patterns of defaunation of all medium-to large-bodied Atlantic Forest mammals which were then classed by morpho-ecological traits. We used a Defaunation Index, which was scaled-up to the entire biome using kriging interpolation, to examine the integrity of site-specific mammal faunas. We further use environmental and socioeconomic predictors to explain the drivers of defaunation. Our results show high levels of defaunation (>0.5) for most of the Atlantic Forest. Apex predators, other carnivores, large-bodied mammals and large herbivores were among the most defaunated functional groups. Remaining native vegetation cover, forest fragment size, and the largest neighboring forest remnant were the main negative predictors of defaunation. We conclude that medium-to large-bodied Atlantic Forest mammals are under high levels of threat due to historical population losses that continue today. A conservation action plan thus becomes imperative to prevent this biome from becoming an even "emptier forest", severely compromising patterns of diversity, ecological processes and ecosystem functioning.

AB Animal-mediated seed dispersal shapes key ecological processes including seedling recruitment and demography. Anthropogenic activities have substantively impacted tropical habitats, yet the degree of sensitivity exhibited by different frugivores to changes in habitat quality and how this may impact seed dispersal outcomes remains poorly understood. This is particularly true in contexts of low to moderate habitat alteration. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized the diurnal disperser community for an ecologically important canopy palm, Oenocarpus bataua, in continuous forest with differing degrees of human modification in northwest Ecuador. Our specific goal was to assess the degree to which visitation and fruit removal rates vary in relation to fine-scale forest structure. Frugivory and seed dispersal (i.e., removal of fruits with intact seeds) was dominated by three large bird species; smaller birds and some mammals visited fruiting trees but did not substantively contribute to seed dispersal. One of the three effective dispersal agents, the Long-wattled Umbrellabird (Cephalopterus penduliger), an endangered species threatened by habitat loss and degradation, exhibited higher visitation and fruit consumption rates in areas characterized by denser canopies, suggesting preference for foraging in undisturbed habitat. In contrast, two relatively common toucan species, Choco Toucan (Ramphastos brevis) and Chestnut-mandibled Toucan (R. swainsonii), exhibited no variation in foraging behavior in relation to the habitat metrics we assessed. These findings highlight the degree to which differences in sensitivity to habitat disturbance among frugivore species may impact foraging ecology and suggest that variation in forest structure within continuous forest can impact seed removal and seed dispersal processes.

AB For a long time, interaction between plants in both general plant and forest science has been somewhat limited to competition, although an intuitive, non-scientific understanding of facilitation has influenced the development of a wide range of forest management techniques including silvicultural systems. Despite this, competition has dominated many ecological theories and the interpretation of density effects. Ongoing research in tree mechanics and in verifying the stress-gradient hypothesis reveal that our understanding of tree interactions is still incomplete. Promising research is currently underway attempting to uncover the physiological receptors and processes related to interaction whilst in the past largely plant performance, e.g. plant size and growth rates, was used for verifying competition. We give an overview of quantification methods and suggest a standardisation by common construction principles. Plant performance has been much used for providing empirical evidence of interactions, but when used in isolation it can be a confounding criterion leading to misinterpretations despite promising new developments in quantifying tree interaction. We therefore suggest using pattern-oriented modelling in analyses of tree interactions, where several plant traits are applied simultaneously.

AB The synergism between climatic change and human action has provided conditions for the occurrence of forest fires in the Amazon. We used annual mapping to reconstruct the history of fire in Brazil's state of Acre to understand the forest-fire regime over a period of 33 years (1984-2016). The bum-scar index (BSI) derived from the fractions of soil and of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic material was generated by CLASlite (c) software using Landsat-TM and OLI satellite images. The area of forest-fire scars totaled 525,130 ha in the period analyzed. This total includes forests that fire affected only once (388,350 ha), twice (59,800 ha) and three times (5727 ha). The years 2005 and 2010 represent 90% of the total area of forest fires in Acre, coinciding with severe droughts caused by the anomalous warming of the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. The most heavily impacted portion of Acre was in the eastern part of the state, which has the greatest forest fragmentation, consolidation of agricultural activity and presence of settlement projects. In 2005, the municipalities of Acrelandia, Placid de Castro and Senador Guiomard accounted for more than 50% of the forest remnants impacted by fire. Of the total extent of forest fires in Acre, 43% occurred in settlement projects administered by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and 16% in conservation units administered by the Ministry of Environment (MMA). The area of forest fires was 36 times greater in the 16 years after 2000, compared to the 16 years before 2000. The frequency of fires increased dramatically from one fire episode roughly every ten years (period from 1984 to 2004), to one fire every five years (period from 2005 to 2016). With the projections of warmer climate and advancing deforestation, the forest fires in Acre will tend be more intense and frequent.

AB A positive biodiversity - aboveground biomass relationship is often attributed to the niche complementarity hypothesis. This hypothesis has received much less support when based on functional trait diversity and when tested in complex natural forests. Here, we hypothesized that niche complementarity (high trait diversity) in the understorey and niche overlap (low trait diversity) in the overstorey would drive whole-community aboveground biomass. To test this hypothesis, we used multiple linear regression models to evaluate how functional trait diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) of overstorey, understorey, and whole community determine aboveground biomass across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest of Eastern China. A structural equation model was used to evaluate whether the functional trait diversity of overstorey affects the relationships between understorey functional trait diversity and whole-community aboveground biomass while considering for the effect of environmental factors. We additionally considered the effects of mass ratio (i.e. community-weighted mean of trait values) and stand structural complexity. The strong negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the functional dominance and/or niche overlap rather than niche complementarity effect. The negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass was also partially mediated by its direct negative effect on understorey functional evenness. The weak positive effect of understorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the niche complementarity effect. We conclude that functional evenness of overstorey and understorey strata affect whole-community aboveground biomass differently through opposing mechanisms, regardless of the effects of mass ratio and stand structural complexity.

AB Mammals play important ecological roles in tropical regions but are difficult to study due to discrete habits, low population densities, and large home ranges. Thus, the use of attractive substances has frequently been adopted to quantify the distribution and abundance of elusive mammals. However, the insight generated from studies using attractants is often limited by a lack of methodological standardization. To inform the use of attractants in the Neotropics, we reviewed 30 years of the scientific literature that used some type of attractant in mammal studies. From a total of 60 studies, the majority (65%) did not use any control (or pseudocontrol) in their sampling design and only 40% used some statistical test to explicitly evaluate the efficiency of the attractant used. A wide range of edible (animal or vegetal origin) and inedible substances (e.g., scent lures) were used alone or in combination and the effects differed greatly among orders and species. Most studies (67%) targeted or registered carnivores, and this order had the largest number of substances (edible and inedible) used across all studies. There seems to be only a consensus in the use and attraction effect with frugivorous bats (Phyllostomidae) with fruits, essential oils, and floral compounds. The lack of standardization of use of attractants in mammal studies undermines the comparability of results among studies. We conclude with some general guidelines to maximize comparability among studies and to enhance the potential usefulness of the use of attractants for mammals.

AB Humid mountain forest (BHM) in Mexico circumscribes a set of very heterogeneous forest communities that differ in structure, floristic composition and environmental complexity. To contribute to the knowledge of the effect of environmental variation on the floristic composition of a BHM located in the sierra de Cacoma, in western Mexico, this research aims to answer the following research questions: i) What are the environmental factors that explain the floristic composition of the BHM of the sierra de Cacoma, in western Mexico? ii) What is the correspondence between the micro-physiography, with the floristic variation of the juvenile layer of the BHM? iii) Is there floristic similarity in the adult-juvenile relationship, adult-seedling and juvenile-seedling? The database was derived from a permanent plot of 1 ha (100 x 100 m) divided into 25 permanent sub-plots (400 m(2) each). In each sub-plot, woody species were categorized into 3 stages of the life cycle (adults, juveniles and seedlings). In addition, 24 variables were registered, analyzing the vegetation-environmental variation relationship with canonical correspondence analysis. The results suggest that micro-physiography, along with soil depth, elemental chemical composition (Ca, Fe, Mg), rock cover, azimuth, slope and leaf area index (LAI), were the variables that best correlates with the floristic composition of the BHM (variance accounted was 44.1%, 41.9% and 30.6% in adults, juvenile and seedlings, respectively). The floristic similarity between the 3 stages of the life cycle, according to the Mantel test, showed a high correlation in adults-seedlings and adults-juveniles. However, no correlation was found between juvenile-seedlings, which suggests that the passage from one life cycle to another is a difficult phase to progress and where the ability to the species establish is likely defined.

AB There is an increasing demand for forest plantations that combine the restoration of native tree species with economic return for landowners. Cedrela fissilis is an endangered native species in Brazil with a great potential to the forestry industry due to its high timber value. However, its susceptibility to damage from the mahogany shoot borer (Hypsipyla grandella) and frost may restrict its forestry application. The aim of this study was to evaluate the viability of C. fissilis plantation under mixed-species forest plantations with the loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). Four experimental mixed plantations were set up in randomized blocks with three varying conditions: presence/absence of P taeda cover, density of C. fissilis seedlings, and the size of the clearing area. Three sets of measurements taken at different times during the study indicate that cover from pine trees increased survival of C. fissilis, and that smaller clearings were associated with significant growth increments. The mixed-species forest plantation with C. fissilis under P taeda coverage at four years of age indicated silvicultural benefits for the first species. Future studies should focus on reducing stress levels during the growth stage, selection of genetic material, and integration of appropriate silvicultural techniques into local management practices.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Habitat filtering and non-habitat processes are two major processes affecting spatial distributions of species. Because trees at different life stages perform differently, the life stage of tree species could play an important role in shaping the spatial distribution of species and community assembly. Here, we examined the possible changes of spatial distributions of species and evaluated the shifts in the relative importance of habitat filtering and non-habitat processes across life stages in a 50-ha subtropical forest plot in China.
   METHODS: We modeled species distribution with and without life stages using three point process models. The performance of these models, with and without considering life stages, was evaluated by comparing the species-area curve and the degree of clustering. The relative effects of habitat filtering and non-habitat processes across life stages were quantified using a spatial variance decomposition method.
   KEY RESULTS:The incorporation of life stage considerably improved the goodness-of-fit of these point process models at both the community and species levels. Non-habitat processes explained about 90% of the total variation in spatial distribution, while habitat filtering explained about 10%.The relative importance of habitat filtering only increased slightly from sapling to adult stages.
   CONCLUSIONS: Point process models performed better when life stages are included, indicating the importance of considering life stage when modeling spatial distributions for understanding community assembly.The finding that habitat acts weakly and non-habitat processes act dominantly in determining spatial distributions of species suggests a strong dependence of spatial patterns on non-habitat processes.

AB Colonization by ecosystem engineers, such as ants, have important but occasionally unnoticed roles in regulating soil carbon cycles. However, little information is available pertaining to ant effects on changing molecular features of soil organic matter. In this study, we characterized total soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen, water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) as well as molecular characteristics of humic acids (HAs) of ant mound soils (Soil (Ant)) and the surrounding soils (Soil(con)) using pyrolysis-chromatography/mass (py-GC/MS). SOC, total nitrogen and WEOC contents of Soil(Ant) were significantly lower than those of Soil(con). Soil (Ant) samples had significant higher nitrogen containing compounds proportions in pyrolysis products of HAs as opposed to Soil(con )samples. Another remarkable characteristic was that no polysaccharides, lignin, and phenols were identified in HAs of Soil(Ant) samples. It indicated that ant colonization significantly changed the molecular composition of soil organic matter.

AB Species persistence in fragmented landscapes is intimately related to the quality, structure, and context of remaining habitat remnants. Riparian vegetation is legally protected within private landholdings in Brazil, so we quantitatively assessed occupancy patterns of terrestrial mammals in these remnants, examining under which circumstances different species effectively use them. We selected 38 riparian forest patches and five comparable riparian sites within continuous forest, at which we installed four to five camera-traps per site (199 camera-trap stations). Terrestrial mammal assemblages were sampled for 60 days per station during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. We modelled species occupancy and detection probabilities within riparian forest remnants, and examined the effects of patch size, habitat quality, and landscape structure on occupancy probabilities. We then scaled-up modelled occupancies to all 1915 riparian patches throughout the study region to identify which remnants retain the greatest potential to work as habitat for terrestrial vertebrates. Of the ten species for which occupancy was modelled, six responded to forest quality (remnant degradation, cattle intrusion, palm aggregations, and understorey density) or structure (remnant width, isolation, length, and area of the patch from which it originates). Patch suitability was lower considering habitat quality than landscape structure, and virtually all riparian remnants were unsuitable to maintain a high occupancy probability for all species that responded to forest patch quality or structure. Beyond safeguarding legal compliance concerning riparian remnant amount, ensuring terrestrial vertebrate persistence in fragmented landscapes will require curbing the drivers of forest degradation within private landholdings.

AB As natural forest ecosystems increasingly face pressure from deforestation, it is ever more important to understand the impacts of habitat fragmentation and degradation on biodiversity. Most studies of anthropogenic change in the tropics come from Southeast Asia and South America, and impacts of habitat modification are often taxon-specific. Here we empirically assessed the impact of habitat fragmentation and recent (within 25 yr) and historic (>25 yr ago) selective logging on the diversity of ants in the Kakamega rain forest in western Kenya, and asked whether these forms of degradation interact as multiple stressors. We found that the severity of recent selective logging was negatively related to overall species richness and abundance as well as the richness and abundance of forest specialists, but found no detrimental effect of past selective logging or habitat fragmentation on ant diversity, although habitat fragment size was correlated with estimated species richness. There was also no effect of any form of habitat degradation on the richness or abundance of open habitat specialists, even though these species often exploit niches created in disturbed environments. Ultimately, this study reveals the detrimental impact of even moderate forms of habitat degradation on insect biodiversity in the understudied African rain forests.

AB In the "Cerrado"-Amazon ecotone in central Brazil, recent studies suggest some encroachment of forest into savanna, but how, where, and why this might be occurring is unclear. To better understand this phenomenon, we assessed changes in the structure and dynamics of tree species in three vegetation types at the "Cerrado"-Amazon ecotone that are potentially susceptible to encroachment: open "cerrado" (OC), typical "cerrado" (TC) and dense woodland (DW). We estimated changes in density, basal area and aboveground biomass of trees with diameter >= 10 cm over four inventories carried out between 2008 and 2015 and classified the species according to their preferred habitat (savanna, generalist, or forest). There was an increase in all structural parameters assessed in all vegetation types, with recruitment and gains in basal area and biomass greater than mortality and losses. Thus, there were net gains between the first and final inventories in density (OC: 3.4-22.9%; TC: 1.8-12.6%; DW: 0.2-8.3%), in basal area (OC: 8.3-18.2%; TC: 2-12.7%; DW: 2.3-8.9%), and in biomass (OC: 10.6-16.4%; TC: 1-12%; DW: 5.2-18.7%). Furthermore, all vegetation types also experienced net gains in forest and generalist species relative to savanna species. A decline in recruitment of savanna species was a likely consequence of vegetation encroachment and environmental changes. Our results indicate, for the first time based on quantitative and standardized multi-site temporal data, that concerted structural changes caused by vegetation encroachment are occurring at the ecotone between the two largest biomes in Brazil.

AB The global sprawl of urban centres is replacing complex natural habitats with relatively flat and featureless infrastructure that supports low biodiversity. In a growing countermovement, artificial microhabitats are increasingly incorporated into designs for "Green" and "Blue" infrastructure. In order to maximise the ecological value of such interventions, we need to inform the designs with observations from natural systems and existing Green and Blue infrastructure. Here, we focussed on water retaining features mimicking intertidal rock pools, as this is a widely used intervention in coastal ecosystems. Using a meta-analysis and a qualitative literature review, we compiled information on diversity and function of rock pools on natural rocky shores and built structures to assess the potential ecological benefits of water retaining microhabitats and the design metrics of rock pools that affect diversity and function. Our meta-analysis showed higher species richness in rock pools compared to emergent surfaces on built structures, but this was variable among locations. The qualitative review revealed that rock pools on both natural and artificial shores generally hosted species that were not present on emergent rock and can also host non-indigenous species, suggesting that the addition of these features can sometimes have unwanted consequences and local ecological knowledge is essential to implement successful interventions. Relationships between species richness and design metrics, such as height on shore, volume, surface area and depth of pool were taxa-specific. For example, results from the meta-analysis suggest that building larger, deeper pools could increase diversity of fish, but not benthic organisms. Finally, this study highlights major gaps in our understanding of how the addition of rock pools and design metrics influence diversity and the variables affecting the ecological functioning of rock pools. Based on the knowledge gathered so far, recommendations for managers are made and the need for future studies to add knowledge to expand these recommendations is discussed.

AB Functional traits and functional diversity measures are increasingly being used to examine land use effects on biodiversity and community assembly rules. Morphological traits are often used directly as functional traits. However, behavioral characteristics are more difficult to measure. Establishing methods to derive behavioral traits from morphological measurements is necessary to facilitate their inclusion in functional diversity analyses. We collected morphometric data from over 1,700 individuals of 12 species of dung beetle to establish whether morphological measurements can be used as predictors of behavioral traits. We also compared morphology among individuals collected from different land uses (primary forest, logged forest, and oil palm plantation) to identify whether intraspecific differences in morphology vary among land use types. We show that leg and eye measurements can be used to predict dung beetle nesting behavior and period of activity and we used this information to confirm the previously unresolved nesting behavior for Synapsis ritsemae. We found intraspecific differences in morphological traits across different land use types. Phenotypic plasticity was found for traits associated with dispersal (wing aspect ratio and wing loading) and reproductive capacity (abdomen size). The ability to predict behavioral functional traits from morphology is useful where the behavior of individuals cannot be directly observed, especially in tropical environments where the ecology of many species is poorly understood. In addition, we provide evidence that land use change can cause phenotypic plasticity in tropical dung beetle species. Our results reinforce recent calls for intraspecific variation in traits to receive more attention within community ecology.

AB In the last decades, an increasing fishing effort and a decreasing trend in fish catches have been observed in southern Brazil. Considering that marine mammals and fisheries usually compete for the same resources, it is reasonable to presume that the feeding ecology of these predators is affected by the current scenario. To evaluate this hypothesis, long-term variation in the diet of the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) relative to fisheries exploitation was analyzed for two periods (1993-2003 versus 2004-2014). The degree of overlap between the relative biomass of the sea lions' diet and the target species of six types of local fishery was analyzed. An increase in prey overlap between sea lions and fisheries was observed in the more recent sampling period, along with an increase in prey diversity, richness, and niche breadth of the sea lions' diet. These results suggest that the overfishing scenario could partly explain the modified feeding ecology of the sea lions. In this context, we recommend a review and better regulation of the current fishing effort in the region, which we believe will be an important step to maintain the fish stocks and minimize the impact of fishing on marine top predators.

AB Aim: We investigated habitat heterogeneity and patterns of avian taxonomic and functional diversity change across a decreasing patch-size gradient in a critically endangered, fragmented forest-system to elucidate: (1) habitat patch-size and structural drivers of avian diversity change, (2) potential patch-size thresholds at which avian diversity and habitat heterogeneity changes occurred and (3) avian species/communities within thresholds that indicated distinct patch-size categories.
   Location: Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, South Africa.
   Methods: We conduced habitat-structure and fixed-radius point-count surveys during the avian breeding season across 123 habitat patches (range 0.06-386.9 ha). We calculated taxonomic and functional diversity/patch (alpha) using a distance matrix of all traits present in the avian community (gamma) and described community change across the patch-size gradient (beta). We compared linear regressions of patch-size effects on avian functional alpha-diversity and habitat-structural heterogeneity to segmented regression at five bands, determined by mean patch sizes responsible for provisioning avian functional alpha-diversity at <50%, 50%-62.5%, 62.5%-75%, 75%-87.5% and 87.5%-100% of avian functional gamma-diversity to explore patch-size thresholds, and tested for significant avian indicator species of categories identified.
   Results: Avian taxonomic and functional alpha-diversity significantly decreased with decreasing patch size and habitat heterogeneity; correlations between taxonomic and functional diversity declines and a positive significant influence of habitat heterogeneity on avian functional diversity indicated selective extinction pressure on niches and concomitant functional traits. Species turnover significantly increased in smaller patches. Segmented regressions of patch size-effect on avian functional diversity and habitat heterogeneity out-performed linear regressions at three patch-size thresholds (157, 96 and 9 ha). Forest-dependent specialists were significant indicators of high-diversity patches >90 ha. Species characterizing small patches <9 ha were generalists, but many were also present in larger patches, highlighting nested-community subsets of alpha-diversity.
   Main conclusions: Specialized niches and concomitant species became locally extinct at patch-size thresholds. We present replicable methodology and recommendations for conservation of forest systems using a critically endangered biome containing disproportionately high avifauna.

AB 1. The Cerrado Domain of central Brazil houses the largest extent of savanna in the Neotropics, but despite its simple characterization as a giant savanna, it contains considerable vegetation heterogeneity that is poorly understood.
   2. We aimed to determine how vegetation types in the Cerrado diverge in their tree species composition and what role ecological factors play in driving compositional patterns.
   3. We used a dataset of 1,165 tree species inventories spread across the Cerrado Domain, which come from six vegetation types that have a substantial arboreal component: woody savannas, dystrophic cerradao, mesotrophic cerradao, seasonally dry tropical forests, semideciduous forests and evergreen forests. We found three extremes in terms of tree species composition, with clear underlying ecological drivers, which leads us to propose a ternary model, the Cerrado Vegetation Triangle, to characterize woody vegetation in the Cerrado. At one extreme, we found that semideciduous and evergreen forests are indistinguishable floristically and are found in areas with high water availability. At another extreme lie seasonally dry tropical forests which are found on more fertile soils. At the third extreme, we found that all types of savanna, and dystrophic cerradao, are highly similar in tree species composition and are commonly found in areas of poor soils and high flammability. Mesotrophic cerradao is transitional in tree species composition between savannas and seasonally dry tropical forest.
   4. The lack of variation in tree species composition attributed to climatic variables indicates that within homogeneous macroclimatic zones, many types of forest and savanna co-exist due to complex mosaics of local substrate heterogeneity and fire history.
   5. Synthesis. Our findings highlight the complexity of forest-savanna transitions in the Cerrado Domain, with relevance for understanding the future of Cerrado vegetation under environmental change. If nitrogen deposition is extensive, some savannas may be more likely to transition to mesotrophic cerradao or even seasonally dry tropical forest, whereas if water availability increases these same savannas may transition to semideciduous or evergreen forest. Our "Cerrado Vegetation Triangle" model offers a simple conceptual tool to frame discussions of conservation and management.

AB Mexico is a megadiverse country. Presently, 22126 species of angiosperms have been registered within its territory and 11001 are considered to be endemic. However, their geographical distributions are far from homogeneous. In addition, Mexico is the center of diversification of several groups. Our analysis focused on such groups. The aims were to identify areas of species richness and endemism. A data matrix with 766 species and 25579 geographical records was analyzed. It included Calochortus (Liliaceae); Bletia (Orchidaceae); Tigridieae (Iridaceae); Amaryllidaceae; Poliantheae, Echeandia (Asparagaceae); Crassulaceae; Hylocereus (Cactaceae); Solanum, Lycianthes and Physalinae (Solanaceae); Salvia section Membranaceae (Lamiaceae); and Cosmos and Dahlia (Asteraceae). Using Geographic Information Systems, we determined richness and distribution based on: (i) Mexican political divisions, (ii) biogeographical regions and provinces, (iii) a grid of 0.5x0.5 degrees cells, and (iv) elevation. The areas of endemism were estimated using the endemicity analysis. The highest number of taxa and endemic plants were concentrated within the Transmexican Volcanic Belt in the Mexican Transition Zone. This mountain range has been recognized as a province on the basis of geologic, tectonic, geomorphologic, physiographic and biogeographic criteria. It is a 1000km long volcanic arc that extends east to west through Central Mexico and is variably from 80 to 230km wide, between 17 degrees 30 to 20 degrees 25N and 96 degrees 20 to 105 degrees 20W. Our results represent a local deviation from the global richness latitudinal gradient of angiosperm species.

AB The Darwin's fox is one of the most threatened carnivores worldwide and was thought to occur in only two isolated areas. Recently this canid was found in the Valdivian Coastal Range, between the previously known populations, but other than their presence, little is known about these populations. Here we report the results of camera trap surveys conducted between 2012 and 2016 (18,872 camera days), including surveys in 30 different sites-distributed along c. 400 km-and monitoring in two contiguous protected areas. Darwin's fox detection rate was higher when forest cover was higher or when domestic dog (Canis familiaris) detection rate was lower. Given confirmed presence, the detection rate was higher for sites in Chiloe Island, than in the mainland's Coastal Range. In mainland, we found evidence of dogs' presence in most of the sites we detected Darwin's foxes. In the protected areas monitored, Darwin's foxes were found to use 12% and 15% of the area sampled in 2015 and 2016 respectively, although there was high uncertainty in the 2016 estimates due to low probability of detection. We did not detect Darwin's foxes in forestry plantations. Our findings provide support for a continuous distribution along the mainland's Coastal Range and Chiloe Island but we hypothesize-based on the major differences observed in detection rates between these areas-that local densities are lower in mainland than in Chiloe Island. Finally, Darwin's fox appears to be sensitive to human disturbance and these disturbances, especially dogs, are ubiquitous within its newly discovered range.

AB Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary disease that is characterized by defective mucociliary clearance, airway obstruction, chronic infection, and persistent inflammation. Cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation (CFPE) majorly causes the morbidity of CF patients. Although CF has been demonstrated to change the composition of lung microbial community, previous studies have not made efforts to study the differences in the mechanism of assembly and diversity maintenance of lung microbial community in CF patients. In this study, we applied the neutral theory of biodiversity to comparatively investigate the assembly and diversity maintenance of the lung microbial community before and after the antibiotic treatment by reanalyzing the dataset from Fodor et al's study. We found that no one sample in the lung microbial communities of the sputum samples of Exacerbation group, nor those of End-of-treatment group satisfied the predictions of neutral model, suggesting that the neutral-process does not dominate in CF patients before and after antibiotic treatments. By comparing the biodiversity parameter between Exacerbation and End-of-treatment group, we found that the former had the significantly higher biodiversity, but the change in diversity parameter is slight and the P value is close to. 05 (P value = .41). Therefore, our second finding is that although CFPE may increase the biodiversity of lung microbial community, the change is not essential.

AB Knowledge of spatial patterns and interactions of tree species allows for understanding the ecological processes of spatiotemporal structures of tropical forests, becoming essential for the establishment of strategies for the conservation and management of their resources in the long term. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial patterns and interactions of Astronium lecointei, Dinizia excelsa and Peltogyne paniculata, three dominant timber tree species in the Jamari National Forest, Rondonia, Brazilian Amazon. The Kernel estimator was used aiming to verify the possible influence of first-order factors on species distributions. Inhomogeneous K-functions were applied to analyze species spatial patterns and interactions by means of second-order factors. Univariate analyses revealed different scale-dependent spatial patterns for the species. Aggregation related to ecological characteristics, such as habitat preference and dispersal limitation, was verified for A. lecointei and R paniculata. D. excelsa presented a random spatial pattern, explained by specific features of its establishment, such as the need for clearings due to light requirements. Interspecific associations were evidenced by bivariate analyses, in which spatial attraction of species resulted from the same preference for microhabitats and the repulsion was a result of niche segregation.

AB Temperate desert is one of the globally important biomes with unique and valuable biodiversity, which might be threatened by environmental stresses and human disturbance associated with rapid development. However, few studies have documented the spatial distribution of the multifaceted plant diversity of the temperate desert and their relationships with external impacting factors. We sampled multifaceted plant species diversity including taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity in the Alashan Desert along Beijing-Xinjiang Expressway (G6) in Northern China to identify the key factors and process which regulate the multifaceted plant diversity of the temperate desert. We found that the dynamics of species richness, functional richness, and phylogenetic richness along the elevational gradient corresponded to the unimodal model. Species phylogenetic development shifted from aggregation to divergence, while species functional traits were the opposite along the elevational gradient. The sites at an elevation around 1200-1400 m were the key habitats for the occurrence of high plant diversity including species richness, functional richness and phylogenetic richness. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in plant diversity at different distances from the road (500 m, 1000 m and 1500 m) and human disturbances (the distance from the nearest human settlements). Temperature, temperature variability, precipitation, precipitation variability, soil physical and chemistry properties showed no significant effects on plant diversity. It was concluded that evolutionary history and functional traits, not environmental or anthropogenic factors were the key determinants of the pattern of multifaceted plant diversity.

AB Solar radiation mediated photodegradation of leaf litter has been studied substantially as it plays important roles in the cycling of carbon (C) and nutrients in dryland ecosystems. However, the mechanism by which ultraviolet (UV) radiation and its interaction with litter quality and microbial degradation affect dryland litter decomposition is still uncertain. A field experiment was carried out in semiarid Mu Us inland dunes of Inner Mongolia, China to investigate the effects of UV radiation and litter position on leaf litter decomposition of eight contrasting species (three perennial grasses, three shrubs, two annual forbs) representing different litter qualities over a whole year of incubation. The results showed that UV radiation increased mass loss of suspended litters for two perennial grasses and two annual forbs, but had no significant effect on the other four species considered; across species the percentage increase in mass loss ranged from 4.5 to 27.3% with an average of 13.7%. C release from suspended litters in response to UV radiation showed similar patterns with mass loss. Nitrogen (N) release from litters on the soil surface was lower than in suspended position because the former was involved in N immobilization driven by microbial decomposition. There were no net effects of UV radiation on decomposition rates of surface litters possibly due to the positive effects of photochemical process offsetting negative effects on microbes. Multiple linear regressions showed that the C:N ratio of initial leaf litter and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) could predict the rate of litter decomposition, in which litter C:N ratio had stronger influence. The findings, based on multiple species, highlight the importance of photodegradation on litter nitrogen and/or carbon mineralization in drylands as mediated by different abiotic and biotic drivers.

AB This study examined the impact of land use changes on phosphorus (P) transformations in soils of different pedogenesis with little or no addition of P in the humid tropical region. The sequential extraction method was used to determine P fractions, and structural equations modeling was employed to investigate the P cycle in soils under plantations of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), rubber tree + cocoa (Theobroma cacao), rubber tree + acai palm (Euterpe oleracea), rubber tree -- cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum) and cocoa - erythrina (Elythrina glauca) as well as pastures (Brachiaria decumbens) and natural forests. The distribution of P fractions in soil appears to be affected by land use in all soil orders. Agroforestry systems of rubber tree + acai palm and rubber tree + cocoa showed high capacity to increase the concentrations of all the P fractions in soil compared to natural forest in soils of advanced stage of weathering. Pastures and rubber plantations provided higher concentrations of inorganic P fractions. The P fractionation method revealed the potential of labile fractions (resin-Pi + NaHCO3-Pi + Po) to supply appropriately the demand of all vegetation types evaluated in all soil orders. The structural model enabled to identify functional pools of P in soil, and to identify transformation processes of P in soil, in which organic P pool was the main P source for the available P pool and which part of the occluded P pool (recalcitrant) can be available for the plants.

AB Disturbance plays a key role in shaping forest composition and diversity. We used a community phylogeny and long-term forest dynamics data to investigate biotic and abiotic factors shaping tropical forest regeneration following both human and natural disturbance. Specifically, we examined shifts in seedling phylogenetic and functional (i.e., seed mass) community structure over a decade following a major hurricane in a human-impacted forest in Puerto Rico. Phylogenetic relatedness of the seedling community decreased in the first five years post-hurricane and then increased, largely driven by changes in the abundance of a common palm species. Functional structure (based on seed mass) became increasingly clustered through time, due to canopy closure causing small-seeded, light-demanding species to decline in abundance. Seedling neighbor density and phylogenetic relatedness negatively affected seedling survival, which likely acted to reduce phylogenetic relatedness within seedling plots. Across the study site, areas impacted in the past by high-intensity land use had lower or similar phylogenetic relatedness of seedling communities than low-intensity past land use areas, reflecting interactive effects of human and natural disturbance. Our study demonstrates how phylogenetic and functional information offer insights into the role of biotic and abiotic factors structuring forest recovery following disturbance.

AB The general aim of this research was to determine whether the cherry root cambium possesses similar water-stress adaptation abilities as the scion. Specifically, this study aimed to determine whether there is a shift in root xylem structure due to precipitation fluctuations and temperature increase during the growing season in two cherry species. Oblainska sour cherry and European ground cherry roots with secondary structure were anatomically surveyed in detail, and correlated with meteorological conditions occurring during the vegetation when the roots were formed. Under environmental signals, both investigated species altered their radial root growth imprinting stops and starts in a cambial activity that resulted in the occurrence of intra-annual false growth rings. Changing environmental conditions triggered the shifts of large and small vessels throughout the false growth rings, but their size seemed to be mainly genetically controlled. Taking into consideration all the above, genotypes with moderate vessel lumen arealesser or around 1200 m(2) in the inner zone, as well as no greater than 1500 m(2) in the outer zoneare presumed to be both size-controlling and stable upon the drought events. Thus, further field trials will be focused on the SV2 European ground cherry genotype, and OV13, OV32, and OV34 Oblainska sour cherry genotypes.

AB The study of plant behavior in environments with different luminous intensities offers information about their ability to modify their growth and performance in response to light. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of shading on the development of Dimorphandra gardneriana Tul. Different levels of shading were used, with 0% shading (full sun) - (T-1), 30% - (T-2), 50% - (T-3) and 70% shading - (T-4). The different levels of shading were obtained by means of black polyolefin screens, sombre type, each treatment consisting of four replicates of 15 plants. The evaluated characteristics were: number of leaves, plant height, neck diameter, survival percentage, shoot length and primary root, green and dry mass of shoots and roots, total dry mass, Dickson quality index and (AP/MSPA), shoot height and diameter (A/DC), aerial part and root dry mass (MSPA/MSR), shoot height and dry mass (CPA/CR), as well as the percentage of roots (%R). The shading influenced negatively the quality of D. gardneriana seedlings, being those grown in full sun the ones that presented the best quality. Based on the morphological parameters studied, it can be affirmed that the D. gardneriana Tul., seedlings, produced in an open environment with high luminosity showed superior qualities in relation to the shaded seedlings.

AB The South-East Asian ranges of two narrow-geographical range species, Germain's Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron germaini (GPP) and Orange-necked Partridge Arborophila davidi (ONP) have been shrinking due to pressures from anthropogenic activities. To improve our knowledge of population densities of Germain's Peacock Pheasant and the Orange-necked Partridge in their remaining habitats, their current and historical distribution range, and the contraction of their distribution range as a surrogate for population declines, we carried out line and point transect surveys in protected areas in southern Vietnam to estimate their density and subsequently model their habitat associations. Our results consistently showed that the density of the GPP was not significantly different among mosaic, evergreen, or mixed deciduous forests, but appeared to be notably lower in bamboo forest, while the density of the ONP was highest in evergreen and mosaic forests and lower in bamboo, with no detections in mixed-deciduous forest. GPP was mostly found close to water sources in mosaic, evergreen and mixed-deciduous forests. The presence of ONP was positively associated with elevation, evergreen and mosaic forest. Primary forest loss, mainly in the lowlands, within the ranges of both species was at least 70% over the last 70 years, suggesting that suitable habitats within the range of both species may have shrunk by at least 60-70%. In addition, a number of threats still occur in their remaining suitable habitats, making them increasingly vulnerable in the long-term, if conservation interventions, such as increased protection, are not implemented.

AB Many coastal habitats are actually replaced with hard infrastructures which alter the taxonomic/functional structure of natural ecosystems worldwide. Few information about habitat loss and species composition in South American coasts are available compared with other coasts. Here, I examine the distribution and identity of coastal artificial infrastructures, especially artificial breakwaters, present along the coast of Chile and the proportion of natural habitat loss derived from their construction. Differences in species taxonomic/functional composition in artificial breakwaters and natural habitats present in northern Chile are also examined. I also propose/discuss opportunities for coastal planning based on habitat rehabilitation and ecological engineering in Chile, which could guide future marine infrastructures construction. An important proportion of natural habitat has been replaced by artificial coastal defences along the coast of Chile, accounting for about 200 km of total coastal length. Given their specific uses and functions, artificial granite breakwaters are one of the most important coastal infrastructures present in Chile (62% of the total of artificial breakwaters present). Differences in taxonomic/functional structure between artificial breakwaters and natural adjacent habitats are significant, and appear related to contrasting spatial heterogeneity. Artificial infrastructures like granite breakwaters can facilitate presence of native and non-native species, which live in the marine-terrestrial interphase (crabs, rats). The present study highlights how the recent proliferation of coastal artificial infrastructures is replacing important natural habitats in Chile, and how the taxonomic/functional structure of coastal ecosystems can be negatively impacted. Furthermore, this study showed how artificial infrastructures can have direct consequences for human-health security and specific guidelines can be conducted to buffer impacts on ecosystem structure to match social livelihood and wellness.

AB Terrestrial invasive species have been identified as one of the largest threats to endemic plants and wildlife in Galapagos, and their spread remains one of the biggest challenges for the region. The management of these species is a common link among all land-use activities, and impacts all residents as economic activities in Galapagos are linked to its status as a unique landscape. The study aims, through the use of key informant interviews, policy documents and literature, to provide new insights into plant invasive species management by exploring two land-use interventionsand the associated challenges and opportunitiescurrently being proposed by policymakers, academics, and other relevant actors. These are (a) local sustainable agricultural production and (b) policies and mechanisms, specifically the 'Buen vivir' paradigm with/and payments for ecosystem services. It explores how these can create bridges and be beneficial to both conservation and development. However, although the initiatives offer real opportunities to manage and control invasive species, challenges remain in the form of how these activities will be carried out and by whom. Findings show that probable success is dependent on community inclusion with coordinated and integrated approaches from robust institutions with connectivity among land-use actors/managers. In addition, support is needed for organisations/stakeholders that are currently tackling the invasive species issue. Studies on land use remain crucial as relatively contained and pristine landscapes such as Galapagos are likely to be increasingly important as a means to detect human-induced alterations at the frontiers of ecology.

AB Several ambitious restoration targets have been set for recovering degraded ecosystems in Brazil (21 million hectares with a legal deficit of native vegetation). The development of scientific knowledge and skilled professionals is necessary to meet this demand and is fundamental for achieving success in medium- and long-term restoration. In this study, we describe the availability and profile of postgraduate courses on ecological restoration in Brazil. We surveyed 272 postgraduate programs, comprising six specific areas of concentration (forestry, soil sciences, botany, environmental engineering, ecology, and environmental science). We analyzed all selected courses in terms of location, approach (economic, social, and legal), and restoration techniques. Only 27% of the postgraduate programs analyzed offer ecological restoration courses, and 49% of these are offered in the southeast region of the country. Regions covered by nonforest ecosystems, such as Pampas, Caatinga, and Pantanal, were poorly represented. Legal aspects were considered in 51% of the courses, whereas social and economic approaches were only considered in 2.7 and 11% of the courses, respectively. Seedling planting (85%) and nucleation (68%) were the most frequently cited techniques of active restoration, and passive restoration was mentioned in 63% of the courses. Our findings highlight the need for increasing postgraduate courses in areas with nonforest ecosystems, especially due to a lack of knowledge about restoration of these areas. The incorporation of economic and social approaches is highly recommended, considering the importance of these attributes in achieving success in large-scale restoration initiatives.

AB Despite the fact that natural selection underlies both traits and interactions, evolutionary models often neglect that ecological interactions may, and in many cases do, influence the evolution of traits. Herein, we explore the interdependence of ecological interactions and functional traits in the pollination associations of hawkmoths and flowering plants. Specifically, we develop an adaptation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of trait evolution that allows us to study the influence of plant corolla depth and observed hawkmoth-plant interactions on the evolution of hawkmoth proboscis length. Across diverse modelling scenarios, we find that the inclusion of contemporary interactions can provide a better description of trait evolution than the null expectation. Moreover, we show that the pollination interactions provide more-likely models of hawkmoth trait evolution when interactions are considered at increasingly fine-scale groups of hawkmoths. Finally, we demonstrate how the results of best-fit modeling approaches can implicitly support the association between interactions and trait evolution that our method explicitly examines. In showing that contemporary interactions can provide insight into the historical evolution of hawkmoth proboscis length, we demonstrate the clear utility of incorporating additional ecological information to models designed to study past trait evolution.

TI Cambial patterns of Paullinia (Sapindaceae) in southwestern Amazonia,

ID WOOD ANATOMY; LIANAS
AB Paullinia comprises 220 species. In Brazil, there are 99 species of the genus distributed mainly in Amazonian forest and the Atlantic Forest, where there are 73 and 26 species, respectively. Until now, the stem anatomy of only 13 species of Paullinia has been investigated. Given the importance of information on cambial variants to the taxonomy of Sapindaceae, studies on the stem anatomy of species in the family are very relevant. The present study described the stem diversity of ten species of Paullinia, which were collected in areas difficult to access in Amazonian forest, in the state of Acre. Micro- and macroscopic analyses were carried out. Two types of cambial variants were identified: lobed stem and xylem interrupted by phloem wedges. The latter type was recorded for the first time in the genus. The anatomical study recorded different traits that might be useful for distinguishing taxa, including morphologically similar species, such as P. bracteosa and P. imberbes and P. fimbriata and P. rugosa. We believe that the results enrich the taxonomic descriptions of the analyzed species and will provide data for future evolutionary studies of the group.

AB Aim: Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is notorious for creating positive feedbacks that facilitate vegetation type conversion within sagebrush steppe ecosystems in the western United States. Similar dynamics may exist in adjacent lower montane forest. However, fire-forest-cheatgrass dynamics have not been examined. We used species distribution modeling to answer three questions about fire and invasibility in lower montane forests: (Q1) Does fire create more suitable habitat for cheatgrass? (Q2) If so, which site attributes are altered to increase site suitability? (Q3) Does fire increase connectivity among suitable habitat and enhance spread?
   Location: Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming, USA.
   Methods: We measured cheatgrass presence-absence in 93 plots within Interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) forests. Random Forests predicted cheatgrass distribution with and without fire using nine site attributes: elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, annual precipitation, maximum temperature in July, minimum temperature in January, forest canopy cover and distance to nearest trail or road. Additionally, invasion pathways and spread were mapped using Circuitscape.
   Results: Cheatgrass distribution was controlled by topographic and climate variables in the absence of fire. In particular, cheatgrass was most likely to occur at low elevation along dry, south- and east-facing slopes. High-severity fire increased potential cheatgrass distribution when forest canopy cover was reduced to below 30%. This process created new invasion pathways, which enhanced cheatgrass spread when modelled in Circuitscape.
   Main conclusions: Our study showed that in the absence of fire, drier south- and east-facing slopes at low elevation are most susceptible to cheatgrass invasion. However, high-severity fire increased the total area susceptible to invasion-allowing cheatgrass to expand into previously unsuitable sites within lower montane forests in the western United States. These results are important for present day management and reflect that integrating responses to disturbance in species distribution models can be critical for making predictions about dynamically changing systems.

AB Despite years of study, it remains unclear if and to what extent the effects of extra-floral nectaries (EFNs) on arboreal ants observed on individual trees scale up to larger spatial scales. Here, we address this issue in Brazilian savanna and tested three predictions: (i) Trees with EFN have higher richness of arboreal ant species than trees without; (ii) Arboreal ant species richness increases with the proportion of total EFN-bearing trees at the site scale, due to a higher occurrence of non-core ant species; (iii) Ant species composition changes with the proportion of EFN-bearing trees at the site scale. We sampled arboreal ants in 32 plots with EFN-bearing trees ranging from 0% to 60% of all trees. We sampled 72 ant species, from which 17 (mostly belonging to Camponotus, Cephalotes and Crematogaster) were identified as core species in at least one of the ant-EFN networks in the 32 plots. Ant species richness was significantly higher on EFN-bearing trees. We identified 11 ant species that preferentially occurred on EFN-bearing trees, all of which were core partners in networks. Species richness at the site scales increased with the proportion of EFN-bearing trees, regardless of tree density and richness; this pattern was due to a higher occurrence of non-core ant species. Finally, species composition also varied with the proportion of EFN-bearing trees. Therefore, we found that the presence of EFNs not only influences arboreal ants on individual trees but also has a substantial effect on the ant-EFN network on a broader community scale. The increase in non-core species site scale reveals that this interaction is unlikely to result in substantially enhanced protection services for EFN-bearing plants.

AB Biodiversity loss and anthropogenic environmental changes are known to impact ecosystem functions and services. However, there are still some uncertainties such as confounding environmental factors other than community attributes that affect ecosystem functioning. Our goal was to understand what factors influence the performance of Scarabaeinae dung beetle functions, testing the hypothesis that both community attributes and environmental variables influence the performance. Toward this aim, we collected dung beetles along an elevational gradient (800-1400m a.s.l.) in the Espinhaco mountain range (Brazil) and quantified dung beetle functions, that is, dung removal, soil excavation and secondary seed dispersal. We recorded data on environmental factors related to climate, soil and vegetation and evaluated their effects on dung beetle functions. Dung beetle ecological functions declined with elevation and the decrease was more pronounced than richness, indicating that there are other factors involved in functions performance besides diversity of beetles. Indeed, we found that the ecological functions measured were dependent on both dung beetle community attributes and environmental factors. Climate, soil and vegetation influenced dung beetle function performance as much as richness, abundance and body size. Dung beetle functional diversity did not explain any of the functions measured. Our study demonstrates that ecological functions are directly influenced by both community attributes and environmental variables and confirms the link between biodiversity, environment and ecosystem functioning.

AB The term "Ecosystem Services" was coined to indicate "all the multiple benefits humans obtain from 'natural capital' (i.e., the world's stock of natural assets geology, soil, air, water including living things and beings)" that make human life possible, such as natural water purification, flood control by wetlands, and others. The concept expanded to include, nowadays, socio-economic and conservation objectives, and has been further popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) in the early 2000s, as well as by the "Paris Agreement" reached at the 2015 UN Conference on Climate change (COP21). Payments for Ecosystems (or Environmental) Services (PESs) are financial incentives given directly to landholders to compensate them for implementing good land management, including conservation activities. Such compensation encourages them to "voluntarily" provide (or continue providing) such services, instead of monetizing their "natural capital" otherwise. This approach has been figuratively described as "making trees worth more standing than cut down" Examples of important PES schemes, implemented in China and in Europe, are described and analyzed in this paper, focusing on the methods applied, to assess their evolution over time, and attempt to identify which solutions could be most effective.

AB Premise of research.The duration and intensity of flowering overlap among plants are the first determiners of the potential for pollinator-mediated plant-plant interactions. Yet, our ability to describe community-wide patterns of coflowering, and thus understand its impact on the structure of plant-pollinator communities, is limited.Methodology.We present a conceptual framework for how network theory can reveal structural properties that are ecologically relevant in diverse coflowering communities. Coflowering modules, in particular, may suggest that groups of species coflower more strongly (clustering) with each other than with other species (overdispersion) in the community. Such a finding would indicate that competitive and facilitative interactions do not act alone but instead act simultaneously to mediate the assembly of coflowering communities. We illustrate our conceptual framework in four diverse coflowering communities in the serpentine seeps in northern California.Pivotal results.Our coflowering networks vary in size and degree but not in overall connectance, suggesting that both intrinsic community features (species richness) and ecological constraints (length of flowering season) play a role in mediating coflowering community structure (distribution of frequency and intensity of flowering overlap among plant species). We show, for the first time, that groups of species tend to coflower more strongly with each other than with other species in a community, supporting the idea that competition and facilitation are not mutually exclusive processes mediating coflowering community assembly. Our results show that the degree of modularity is not sensitive to the number of coflowering species within each community, suggesting that ecological factors may be more important in driving this pattern.Conclusions.Coflowering networks have the potential to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of flowering overlap in diverse plant communities by revealing a more in-depth and novel characterization of coflowering community structure. Such characterization will allow for a better understanding of the importance of coflowering patterns in mediating the structure of plant-pollinator interactions.

AB 1. Several decades of frustrated attempts to prevent fires in the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) have led to deleterious ecological and management consequences. In 2014, the first Integrated Fire Management (IFM) programme was launched in three protected areas (PAs).
   2. The IFM programme considers local practices, ecological information, management options and aims to create landscape mosaics of different fire histories to conserve biodiversity, reduce the prevalence of late-dry season (LDS) wildfires, protect fire-sensitive vegetation and reduce conflicts between PA managers and local communities.
   3. The first 3years of imposed fire management regimes led to 40%-57% reduction in LDS fires, improved dialogue between researchers, managers and local communities, generating fire management learning communities.

AB Ants accumulate heavy metals and respond to pollution with modification in species composition, community structure, altered behaviour and immunity. However, the levels of heavy metals in ants' nests and explicit individual-level responses towards heavy metals have not been revealed. We found that red wood ants Formica lugubris accumulate high and correlated values of such heavy metals as Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn both in ants and nest material near cobalt smelter in Finland. Relative differences in metal concentrations were higher in nests than in ants. The highest values were obtained for elements such as Co (36.6), Zn (14.9), Cd (9.7), Pb (8.5), Cu (7.4), Ni (6.4), As (4.7), Cr (2.9) and Fe (2.4) in nest material, and Co (32.7), Cd (6.3), Pb (6), Fe (2.8), Ni (2.9) and Zn (2.1) in ants. In industrial and reference areas, ants have no differences in size, but differed in dry and residual body mass. In polluted areas, E lugubris had less melanised heads, but not thoraxes. The sensitivity of cuticular colouration in red wood ants subjected to heavy metal pollution might be related to metal-binding properties of melanins. The overall results are useful for the improvement of biomonitoring techniques using ants as indicators of industrial contamination and for further discovery of novel ecotoxicological biomarkers.

AB The widespread Mediterranean Pinus pinea showed exceptionally low genetic diversity and low differentiation between traits in the adult phase. We explored the adaptation potential of seedlings from four main Iberian provenances during their regeneration phase. We assessed the variability of shoot growth, allometry, physiological traits, and phenotypic plasticity to the interactive effect of light and water environments during 8-month moderate water-stress cycle and after one-week heat wave. The effect of shade and drought was mainly orthogonal whatever the provenance. The inland La Mancha provenance showed higher shoot growth and biomass compared to the southern coastal Depresin-del-Guadalquivir provenance. Following the heat wave, La Mancha presented higher net photosynthetic rates, a lower decrease in maximal quantum efficiency of PSII, and a higher accumulated relative height growth, thus, showing an adaptive advantage. The observed differences corroborated the ecological grouping of the provenances along latitudinal and inland-coastal gradients. We confirmed the high adaptive plasticity of Pinus pinea to the unpredictable Mediterranean environment.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) fractions are critical for understanding soil P dynamics and availability. This paper provides a global dataset of soil P fractions separated by the Hedley method. The dataset also includes key environmental factors associated with soil P dynamics and availability, including climate factors, vegetation, soil and parent material types, soil age, and soil physiochemical properties such as particle size, bulk density, pH in water, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and extractable iron and aluminium concentrations. This dataset includes measures of Hedley P fractions of 802 soil samples and was gathered through a literature survey of 99 published studies. Plant availability of each soil P fraction was noted. We anticipate that the global dataset will provide valuable information for studying soil P dynamics and availability, and it will be fused into earth system models to better predict how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to global environmental changes.

AB Context The dominant role played by advance regeneration in natural regeneration processes after intense wind disturbances is still a matter of dispute.
   Aims We took advantage of a windstorm in one of our research plots to study the role of the seedling bank released by the disturbance in the regeneration processes.
   Methods We collected data in 70 plots, recording the survivorship of seedlings, annual height growth, and signs of browsing. The height ranking was analyzed with Kendall's concordance coefficient, and the height growth rates were compared using Dunn's test.
   Results The density of seedlings increased from 6.7/m(2) in 2008 to 8.1/m(2) in 2010 and then decreased to 1.2/m(2) in 2015. The density of saplings increased continuously from 0.14 to 1.9/m(2). The highest size differentiation occurred in sycamore maple; the individuals which were taller before the windstorm retained their position until the year 2015. The only species that was recruited mainly from germinants was European hornbeam.
   Conclusion The advance regeneration released by the windstorm played a major role in the regeneration process, while pioneer species occurred only sporadically. Seven years after the disturbance, the windthrow was already covered by a dense thicket of young trees.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are likely to affect individual condition as they usually alter the quality of habitat. However, responses of individuals of different species to these processes may be subtle and difficult to detect, despite that such responses may reveal interesting and diverse strategies of persistence of species in fragmented landscapes. Here, we used model selection to 1) compare the body condition (Scaled Mass Index) of 2 Neotropical marsupials (Didelphis aurita and Philander frenatus) from 6 continuous forest sites and 25 forest fragments, and 2) determine whether local habitat structure and landscape and temporal factors affect body condition in forest fragments. Body condition of both species was lower in forest fragments compared to continuous forest sites, but only in the super-humid season for D. aurita and in the humid season for P. frenatus. When only forest fragments were compared, body condition of D. aurita was higher in the humid season, in sites with fewer Cecropia trees and water courses, lower percent forest cover, and surrounded by a mixed matrix (plantation and cattle ranching), or located in small rural properties. Body condition of P. frenatus was slightly higher in the super-humid season, in sites surrounded by a mixed matrix, with fewer Cecropia trees and water courses, more lianas, and greater percent forest cover. Our results revealed negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on both species, but also different responses of each species to local extrinsic environmental factors. We suggest that body condition should not be used as a direct indicator of animal fitness or habitat quality. Nonetheless, body condition may still reveal subtle and previously undetected responses of species to habitat disturbance and fragmentation.

AB Restoration projects designed to promote one ecosystem service may have synergistic benefits to other services. Therefore, bundling them can be an effective way to maximize the return to the investments in programs of payments for ecosystem services (PES). Here, we investigated the additional gain of restoration actions-which were implemented as part of a PES program to protect a key watershed for water supply-on increasing functional landscape connectivity in the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Using a landscape ecology approach, we estimated the amount of forest cover before (2006) and after (2012) restoration activities by the PES program and changes in structural and functional landscape connectivity for birds with varying gap-crossing capabilities. Forest cover increased from 42.5 to 86.1 ha after the implementation of restoration projects by the PES program. In the simulated scenarios of landscape connectivity, the mean patch size of functionally connected forest increased by I,034%, 392%, 248%, and 94% for species with gap-crossing capabilities of 0, 20, 40, and 60 m, respectively. Our results highlight the potential for incorporating biodiversity conservation objectives into PES projects primarily designed to enhance water-related ecosystem services.

AB The agricultural matrix has increasingly been recognized for its potential to supplement Protected Areas (PAs) in biodiversity conservation. This potential is highly contextual, depending on composition and spatial configuration of matrix elements and their mechanistic relationship with biological communities. We investigate the effects of local vegetation structure, and proximity to a PA on the site-use of different guilds in a wintering bird community within the PA, and in wooded land-use types in the surrounding matrix. We used occupancy models to estimate covariate-guild relationships and predict site-use. We also compared species richness (estimated through capture-recapture models) and species naive site-use between the PA and the matrix to evaluate taxonomic changes. We found that tree cover did not limit the site-use of most guilds of the community, probably due to high canopy cover across all chosen sites. Exceptions to this were guilds comprising generalist species. Shrub cover and bamboo cover had important effects on some woodland-associated guilds, suggesting a change in limiting factors for site-use under adequate tree cover. Site-use across the matrix was high for all analyzed guilds. This was found to be due to three non-exclusive reasons: (i) presence of one or more ubiquitous species (found all across the landscape) within some guilds, (ii) redundancy of species within guilds that buffered against a decrease in site-use, and (iii) turnover in guild composition/abundances to more generalist species from PA to matrix. Estimated species richness was higher in the matrix (107 +/- 11; mean +/- SE) than in the PA (90 +/- 7), which may have been in part due to the addition of generalist species in the matrix. Understanding factors that limit biological communities is crucial to better managing the ever-increasing matrix for biodiversity conservation. Our study provides insights into the effects of different components of vegetation structure on the bird community in wooded land-use types in the matrix. We highlight the value of woodlands surrounding PAs in maintaining multiple guilds, and hence, the functionality of a wintering bird community. However, we caution that the matrix may fall short in retaining some specialized species of the community.

AB Floristic surveys and diversity indices are often applied to measure tree species diversity in mixed tropical forest remnants. However, these analyses are frequently limited to the overall results and do not allow to evaluate the spatial variability distributions of tree diversity, leading to develop additional tools. This study aimed to estimate the spatial variability of tree diversity and map their spatial patterns in a Brazilian mixed tropical forest conservation area. We used indices to measure the tree species diversity (dbh >= 10 cm) in 400 sampling units (25 m x 25 m) from a continuous forest inventory. Semivariograms were fitted to estimate spatial dependences and punctual kriging was applied to compose maps. Mean diversity values were constant in the continuous inventories, indicating a forest remnant in an advanced stage of ecological succession. On the other hand, tree diversity presented spatial patterns identified by geostatistics, in which the dynamics were composed of heterogeneous mosaics spatially influenced by tree species with different ecological features and densities, gap dynamics, advancement of forest succession, mortality, and Araucaria angustilofia's cohorts.

AB Secondary succession after agriculture abandonment (old-fields) is mostly dominated by exotic grass species. Non-native plant invasions may alter soil fauna, potentially inducing plant-soil feedbacks. Despite their importance in nutrient cycling and plant-soil interactions, meso and macrofauna received less attention than bacteria or fungi. Here we compared the composition of the soil arthropod community in native remnants and plant exotic-dominated old-fields grasslands in the Inland Pampa, Argentina. We sampled independent remnants and old-field grassland plots within a 100 km(2) agricultural landscape to test the hypothesis that the abundance of soil arthropod organisms is related to the quality of the plant biomass, whereas the diversity of the soil biota is related to plant species richness, resulting in a different soil biota composition because of differing plant communities. When compared to non-invaded remnant grasslands, soil activity and soil food-web characteristics of the old-fields sites included: 1. Higher total arthropod abundance, particularly of Isopoda, Pseudoescorpionida and Blattaria; 2. Lower abundance of Hymenoptera and Enthomobryomorpha (Collembola); 3. Lower diversity, and evenness, but similar richness of soil organisms orders; 4. Higher soil respiration rates and soil temperature; and 5. Higher total soil N and K+ content, but lower soil P content. These results illustrate that soil arthropod composition can vary widely within grasslands patches depending on plant species composition. Also, the more diverse plant community of remnant grasslands supports a more diverse soil biota, although soil activity is slower. Our results support the strong linkage between plant community and soil arthropod composition and suggest that changes in soil biota composition might promote plant-soil feedback interactions inducing the persistence of these alternative grassland states in new agricultural human-modified landscapes.

AB Monodominant forests are characterized by the strong influence of a single species on the structure and diversity of the community. In the tropics, monodominant forests are rare exceptions within the generally highly diverse tropical forest biome. Some studies have shown that tree monodominance may be a transient state caused by successional and demographic variation among species over time. Working in a Brosimum rubescens Taub. (Moraceae) monodominant forest at the southern edge of Amazonia, we tested the hypotheses that local-scale variation in intra- and interspecific spatial patterns of dominant tree species is affected by i) demographic rates of recruitment and mortality following severe droughts, ii) local variation in edaphic properties, and iii) occupation of species in the vertical layer of the forest. We quantified intra- and interspecific spatial patterns and edaphic associations of the five most abundant species using aggregation and association distance indices, and examined changes over time. We found some support for all hypotheses. Thus, intra- and interspecific spatial patterns of most species varied over time, principally after severe drought, emphasizing species-level variability and their interactions in sensitivity to this disturbance, even as B. rubescens monodominance was maintained. While positive and negative spatial associations with edaphic properties provide evidence of habitat specialization, the absence of negative spatial associations of B. rubescens with edaphic properties indicates that this species experiences little environmental restriction, and this may be one of the factors that explain its mono dominance. Spatial repulsion and attraction between species in the same and in different vertical layers, respectively, indicates niche overlap and differentiation, while changes over time indicate that the relationships between species are dynamic and affected by drought disturbance.

AB Domestic dogs are increasingly being recognized as a conservation threat for native species. In many places, their impacts may be as severe as other invasive predators such as cats and rats. We conducted the first ever sub-continent scale assessment of the impacts of dogs on native species in India using an online key informant survey and reports from national print media. Dogs reportedly attacked 80 species, of which 31 were IUCN Red list threatened species, including four Critically Endangered species. Larger bodied mammals such as ungulates and carnivores, were most commonly reported to be attacked, although this may be an observation bias. Approximately 68% of the attacks were carried out by dogs unaccompanied by humans. Most of the attacks were carried out by packs of dogs with 45% of these attacks leading to the death of the prey. Nearly 48% of the incidents were reported in and around wildlife protected areas, suggesting that dogs are an important large-scale edge effect around protected areas in India. For Critically Endangered species that are already suffering from serious population declines due to other causes, the impact of dogs may seriously impede population recovery efforts. Mitigating the impacts of dogs on wildlife requires a multi-pronged approach of responsible dog ownership, restriction in free-ranging behaviour, and strong population control measures, especially around sensitive conservation areas.

AB The ecosystem services (ES) provided by drylands are critical to human wellbeing (HWB). Maintaining ES sustainability and improving peoples livelihood in drylands are crucial to global sustainable development as 90% of the dryland population belongs to the developing countries. Global environmental changes have greatly altered ecosystem structure and process of dryland ecosystems and have led to significant changes in ES provision, supply-demand relationship and trade-offs at multiple scales. We reviewed research advances and identified knowledge gaps on dryland studies in line with the 'structure-function-service-wellbeing' cascade framework. Focus was put on ES and their contributions to HWB. ES concept and methodology are highly useful in understanding natural-social linkages of drylands and informing decision making. More empirical studies are needed to apply the ES methods and make regional comparisons.

AB In this study, we present the first tree-ring chronology for the tropical tree species Copaifera lucens and its climatic signal in southeastern Brazil. Tree-ring width series were compared with local climate indices using a drought index (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index -SPEI), in monthly, bi-monthly and four-monthly scales. We also calculated negative pointer years over the time-span of the tree-ring width. The radial growth of C. lucens showed a positive correlation with the SPEI of the current summer and autumn in all the three analyzed time scales, while the negative pointer years matched with drier years. The species was highly sensitive to very low summer precipitation, which may lead to a 49% reduction in growth. We conclude that the long-living C. lucens has a great potential for dendrochronological studies as it shows a marked climatic signal. Our study also reinforces the importance of rainfall in regulating radial growth in tropical forests and sheds light on the local climate influence on tree growth in recent decades.

AB Up to now, the development of dendrochronological records from tropical regions in South America has been limited to the lowlands with emphasis in the Amazon basin. In this contribution, we present the first chronology of Cedrela nebulosa, a species that develops in the tropical mountainous regions of South America. We collected samples from trees in Monobamba district in Peru, analysed the anatomical features that determine the growth rings, and processed following the methods commonly used in dendrochronology. The 133-years chronology covering the 1883-2015 period, showed large correlation between series. In order to determine the climatic variables that control tree growth, we performed correlation analyses between tree-growth and local and regional precipitation and temperature records. We found that precipitation triggers tree growth at the beginning of the spring season but temperature seems to be the main control in annual growth. Also, C. nebulosa chronology present coherent variations with Multivariate Enso Index (MEI) and Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures during summer months. This climate-sensitive tree-ring record indicates good potential for dendroclimatic studies and provides an opportunity to reconstruct climatic variations in montane forests of the tropical Andes.

AB Animal physiology and ecology are affected by increasing environmental temperatures, and this is particularly relevant in the tropics, where organisms are already living on the warm edge of their thermal windows. Here, we present data on sub-lethal effects of temperature (using molecular biomarkers), thermal tolerance, warming safety margins and body size shifts of a gastropod (Stramonita haemastoma) from tropical rocky shores, under an experimental setup of a climate warming scenario. Heat shock response, protein damage, antioxidant activity and lipid damage were all evaluated once a week during one month of exposure at a control temperature, and at an experimental temperature of plus 3 degrees C. Significant increase of heat shock protein response, lipid peroxides and catalase at the elevated temperature suggest the activation of cytoprotective pathways as response to an increased thermal load. Duration of exposure also had a significant influence in the animals' responses, since whole body thermal tolerance only showed acclimation potential in the short-term, but not in the long-term. Thermal safety margin was low for this species, suggesting a narrow ability to tolerate further warming. Smaller body sizes were observed in specimens exposed to increased temperature, suggesting the occurrence of slower growth and possible changes in energy metabolism. Hence, enduring thermal stress, as predicted if present day warming trends are not reversed, may compromise populations of tropical marine snails.

AB We refer to a theoretical trait space (TTS) as an n-dimensional hypervolume (hypercube) characterizing the range of values and covariations among multiple functional traits, in the absence of explicit filtering mechanisms. We previously constructed a 32-dimensional TTS for North American trees by fitting the Allometrically Constrained Growth and Carbon Allocation (ACGCA) model to USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Here, we sampled traits from this TTS, representing different individual "trees," and subjected these trees to a series of gap dynamics simulations resulting in different annual light levels to explore the impact of environmental filtering (light stress) on the trait space. Variation in light limitation led to non-random mortality and a refinement of the TTS. We investigated potential mechanisms underlying such filtering processes by exploring how traits and the environment relate to mortality rates at the tree, phenotype (a specific set of trait values), and stand (a specific gap scenario) levels. The average light level at the forest floor explained 42% of the stand-level mortality, while phenotype- and tree-level mortality were best explained by six functional traits, especially radiation-use efficiency, maximum tree height, and xylem conducting area to sapwood area ratio (gamma(X)). These six "mortality" traits and six traits related to the leaf and wood economics spectra were used to construct trait hypercubes represented by trees that died or survived each gap scenario. For trees that survived, the volume of their refined trait space decreased linearly with increasing stand-level mortality (up to similar to 50% mortality); the location also shifted, as indicated by non-zero distances between the hypercube centroids of surviving trees compared to dead trees and the original TTS. Overall, the patterns were consistent with empirical studies of functional traits, in terms of which traits predict mortality and the direction of the relationships. This work, however, also identified potentially important functional traits that are not commonly measured in empirical studies, such as gamma(X) and senescence rates of relatively long-lived tissues.

AB Increasing fire risk and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have the potential to alter plant community structure and composition, with consequent impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This study was conducted to examine short-term responses of understory plant community to burning and N addition in a coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest of the subtropical-temperate transition zone in Central China. The experiment used a pair-nested design, with four treatments (control, burning, N addition, and burning plus N addition) and five replicates. Species richness, cover, and density of woody and herbaceous plants were monitored for 3years after a low-severity fire in the spring of 2014. Burning, but not N addition, significantly stimulated the cover (+15.2%, absolute change) and density (+62.8%) of woody species as well as herb richness (+1.2species/m(2), absolute change), cover (+25.5%, absolute change), and density (+602.4%) across the seven sampling dates from June 2014 to October 2016. Light availability, soil temperature, and prefire community composition could be primarily responsible for the understory community recovery after the low-severity fire. The observations suggest that light availability and soil temperature are more important than nutrients in structuring understory plant community in the mixed forest of the subtropical-temperate transition zone in Central China. Legacy woody and herb species dominated the understory vegetation over the 3years after fire, indicating strong resistance and resilience of forest understory plant community and biodiversity to abrupt environmental perturbation.

AB Intra-specific negative density dependence promotes species coexistence by regulating population sizes. Patterns consistent with such density dependence are frequently reported in diverse tropical tree communities. Empirical evidence demonstrating whether intra-specific variation is related to these patterns, however, is lacking. The present study addresses this important knowledge gap by genotyping all individuals of a tropical tree in a long-term forest dynamics plot in tropical China. We show that related individuals are often spatially clustered, but having closely related neighbours reduces the growth performance of focal trees. We infer from the evidence that dispersal limitation and negative density dependence are operating simultaneously to impact the spatial distributions of genotypes in a natural population. Furthermore, dispersal limitation decreases local intra-specific genetic diversity and increases negative density dependence thereby promoting niche differences and species coexistence as predicted by theory.

AB Biotic resistance may influence invasion success; however, the relative roles of species richness, functional or phylogenetic distance in predicting invasion success are not fully understood. We used biomass fraction of Chromolaena odorata, an invasive species in tropical and subtropical areas, as a measure of invasion success' in a series of artificial communities varying in species richness. Communities were constructed using species from Mexico (native range) or China (non-native range). We found strong evidence of biotic resistance: species richness and community biomass were negatively related with invasion success; invader biomass was greater in plant communities from China than from Mexico. Harvesting time had a greater effect on invasion success in plant communities from China than on those from Mexico. Functional and phylogenetic distances both correlated with invasion success and more functionally distant communities were more easily invaded. The effects of plant-soil fungi and plant allelochemical interactions on invasion success were species-specific.

AB Photodegradation accelerates litter decay in arid grasslands where plant growth and litter decay are strongly controlled by precipitation and evapotranspiration. However, the effects of photodegradation on ecosystem C and N dynamics are not well understood. We examined the effects using an ecosystem biogeochemical model DayCent-UV with photodegradation explicitly represented and validated. The model was parameterized for a California grassland where photodegradation was documented to release CO2 from litter. The model was parameterized with an inverse modeling approach using an extensive data set of six years of daily observed carbon and water gas exchange (gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and evapotranspiration), soil temperature, and soil moisture. DayCent-UV correctly simulated the seasonal patterns of the observed gas exchange and closely simulated the inter-annual variation in the gas exchange and biomass production rates. The simulations suggested that the inter-annual variation is driven more by actual evapotranspiration than by precipitation because a large portion of precipitation is lost as runoff during wet years. Photodegradation in DayCent-UV accelerated C and N cycling, decreasing system C and N by 9.2% and 9.5% and C and N residence times by 9.4% and 18.2%. Accelerated N cycling made a greater fraction of system N available for plants, increasing net N mineralization and plant production for a given amount of system N. Increased net N mineralization was due to decreased immobilization by microbes in the aboveground organic matter. Photodegradation did not alter the control on plant production by evapotranspiration. These results suggest that at the ecosystem level, the central effect of photodegradation is to suppress microbial activity. We conclude that photodegradation accelerates N cycling at the expense of microbes in this grassland, making it more efficient in supporting plant growth for a given amount of N in the system.

AB Drought and nutrient deficiency are the principal factors limiting crop production in arid and semi-arid areas. Conservation tillage can maintain and increase grain yields by enhancing soil fertility and conserving more soil water in the field. However, farmers without access to mineral fertilizers cannot compensate for the soil nutrient deficiencies for crop production, and the crops will suffer yield reductions. Site-specific fertilizer application with conservation tillage practice management is the key to achieving a high and sustainable crop yield. A longterm (2007-2016) two-factor, spilt-plot experiment was established to assess the effects of fertilization {balanced fertilization (BF), low fertilization (LF), conventional fertilization (CF)} and conservation tillage practices {no tillage (NT), subsoiling (ST), conventional tillage (CT)} on grain yield, soil water and soil nutrients. The aim of this experiment was to select an optimal fertilization and tillage management system for crop production in the Loess Plateau, a typical semi-arid and rainfed area of China. Ten-year data showed that subsoiling with balanced fertilization (BST) increased the grain (6465 kg ha(-1)) and straw yield (9792 kg ha(-1)), but no tillage with balanced fertilization (BNT) was observed to provide the highest economic profit for farmers (6416 yuan ha(-1)). No tillage with low fertilization (LNT) was the optimal management for soil water conservation in fields that could preserve more soil water in fallow land (mean value: 425 mm) and provide more soil water during the wheat (mean value: 387 mm) and maize (mean value: 420 mm) growth season. The LNT consumed less soil water in the crop growth season (mean value: 105.4 mm), but the BST (18.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) showed a higher water use efficiency (WUE). The BF and NT showed better soil nutrient conditions (soil organic matter(SOM), available N, P and K) over the ten years and provided better soil water and balanced soil nutrient conditions for crop growth. The BNT and BST were recommended as the optimal and economic fertilization with tillage management systems for maintaining high grain yields by using soil water efficiently and enhancing soil fertility in a winter wheat-spring maize rotation on the Loess Plateau.

AB Many observational and short-term experimental studies have examined how boreal bird communities respond to forest harvesting. However, there are virtually no longitudinal studies that have assessed long-term effects of forest harvesting on boreal birds. The Calling Lake Fragmentation Study is a long-term experiment in northern Alberta's boreal forest, established in 1993. We have 24 years of avian point count data (1993-2016) from this study site, giving us the opportunity to study how the boreal songbird community has responded over 23 years to forest regeneration after harvesting. We ran multi-season occupancy models of 51 species surveyed at 72 stations (8 stations per 40-ha sampling area) within 3 unharvested forest sites, 3 harvest units that were cut in 1984 and treated to enhance conifer survival, and 3 harvest units that were cut in 1994 and left untreated to regenerate naturally. Eight of 21 species associated with older boreal forests (60-80 years old) used harvest units 23-33 years post-harvest. Eleven of 16 species associated with shrublands or younger forests used harvest units, before declining as harvest units regenerated, while four of 16 such species increased their probability of occupying harvest units over the monitoring period. Increased occupancy by 5 Neotropical migrants and 2 short-distance migrants was associated with increased El Nino weather events preceding a given breeding season. We also found evidence that increased occupancy of 3 species within harvest units was preceded by and correlated with increased occupancy by those species in unharvested forests, while occupancy of 4 species in unharvested forests was preceded by and con-elated with increased occupancy within harvest units. Our results indicate the importance of unharvested forests for some boreal songbird species, the utility of longitudinal studies with controls for assessing changes in occupancy due to forest regeneration in harvest units versus factors operating at larger spatial scales, and the potential of harvest units to serve as habitat for boreal birds up to 33 years post-harvest.

AB It is commonly acknowledged that ants improve the hydraulic properties of soils in which they build their nests. To date, however, most studies of such soil modifications have focused on one ant species and one type of ecosystem, rather than investigating how different ant species affect different types of land cover within the same landscape. Our study focused on modifications to water infiltration and surface texture of Haplic Luvisols by two ant species one of them present only in a forest and the other present only in a pasture. These two sites are located near each other in the Caatinga, a tropical dry forest region of Brazil, and have similar climatic conditions and soil type. We found that in the forest site, soils undisturbed by ant activity already showed water infiltration 13 times higher than the similarly undisturbed soils of the pasture site; and that the ant Dinoponera quadriceps more than doubled water infiltration in their nest annular zones compared with the surrounding forest areas. In addition, D. quadriceps increased clay content in their mound soils by 50% compared with the soils of the surrounding forest. In contrast, at the pasture site, the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata had a mixed effect on water infiltration: compared with pasture matrix soils, their nest-building activities led to a threefold increase in infiltration of the mound soils, but a threefold decrease in the nest annular zones. In addition, compared with the pasture matrix, A. laevigata almost doubled sand content in their mounds which explains the comparatively high infiltration rates. These results suggest that the contrasting soil modifications by the two species could lead to amplifying feedbacks in opposite directions: an ant species that depends on healthy forests is improving water infiltration and soil texture (and thus increasing water available to plants) in its environment, while another ant species that is known to profit from disturbances is having the opposite effect.

AB The response of primary (PF) and secondary (SF) rainforests to cyclones has broad implications for servicing fauna and the resilience of forest functions. We collected fine-scale data on the reproductive phenology of plant communities in Fijian PF and SF in 12 monthly surveys before and after Cyclone Tomas (2010). We generated a resource index from the reproductive loads of 2218 trees and 1150 non-trees (>190 species) and trunk and stem diameter to assess patterns in resource abundance for nectarivores and frugivores (hereafter NF resources). We aimed to determine (i) whether species richness of NF resources differed between forests; (ii) the patterns of resilience of NF resources at community level in both forests after a cyclone; and (iii) the effect of response on NF resources for plant-servicing bats (Pteropodidae). In 12months preceding the cyclone, NF resources were greater in PF trees; non-tree resources fluctuated and were greater in SF. Lower species richness of NF resources in SF indicated that fewer opportunities exist there for exploitation by a diverse fauna. More resources were available for bats in PF. In 12months following the cyclone, PF flowers and fruits, and SF fruits specifically used by pteropodid bats decreased for trees. Non-tree resources were especially susceptible to the cyclone. No universal pattern of decline was associated with the cyclone; instead, some NF resources declined and others were resilient or responded rapidly to a post-cyclone environment. Both PF and SF demonstrated resilience at the community level via increased flower survival (PF) and rapid flower production (SF). Reduced species richness of NF resources in SF will compromise future resilience and response to disturbance, including for threatened pteropodid bat species. These findings are critical for long-term management of forests, given predicted increases in cyclone frequency and intensity associated with anthropogenic climate change.

AB There are gaps in our understanding of plant responses under different insect phytophagy modes and their subsequent effects on the insect herbivores' performance at late season. Here we compared different types of insect feeding by an aphid, Lipaphis erysimi, and a lepidopteran, Plutella xylostella, and how this affected defensive metabolites in leaves of 2 Brassica species when plants gain maturity. Thiocyanate concentrations after P. xylostella and L. erysimi feeding activities were the same. Total phenolics was higher after the phloem feeder feeding than the folivore activity. The plants compensatory responses (i.e., tolerance) to L. erysimi feeding was significantly higher than the responses to P. xylostella. This study showed that L. erysimi had higher carbon than P. xylostella whereas nitrogen in P. xylostella was 1.42 times that in L. erysimi. Population size of the phloem feeder was not affected by plant species or insect coexistence. However, there was no correlation between plant defensive metabolites and both insects' population size and biomass. This suggests that plant root biomass and tolerance index after different insect herbivory modes are not necessarily unidirectional. Importantly, the interaction between the folivore and the phloem feeder insects is asymmetric and the phloem feeder might be a trickier problem for plants than the folivore. Moreover, as both plants' common and special defenses decreased under interspecific interference, we suggest that specialist insect herbivores can be more challenged in ecosystems in which plants are not involved in interspecific interference.

AB AimThousands of kilometres of rainforest edges are created every year through forest fragmentation, but we have little knowledge of the impacts of edges on spatial patterns of species turnover and nestedness components of -diversity.
   LocationA quasi-experimental landscape in the north-east Brazilian Amazon.
   MethodsWe sampled dung beetles and ants using a sampling design based on a fractal series of equilateral triangles that naturally allows examination at multiple spatial scales. We sampled two edge types (primary-secondary and primary-Eucalyptus forest) and three control sites immersed in primary, secondary and Eucalyptus forest. We measured -diversity between communities across the primary forest-matrix edge and within communities at up to 1km from the forest edge. We examined -diversity at multiple scales by partitioning the dissimilarity matrix into fractal orders representing inter-point distances of similar to 32, similar to 100, similar to 316 and similar to 1,000m and into turnover and nestedness components.
   ResultsTurnover but not nestedness was greater across the primary-Eucalyptus forest than primary-secondary forest edge. There was spillover of species across edges in both directions. Across edges and within controls, turnover was the main driver of -diversity. Within community, -diversity was increased for dung beetles at large scales (similar to 300-1,000m) at both edge types. This increase, however, was driven by elevated nestedness. Levels of -diversity were affected even similar to 300m into habitat interiors, but appeared to be at control levels by 1km.
   Main conclusionsThe effects of edges on the spatial dynamics of community composition penetrated far beyond the typical distances at which forest structure and microclimate are altered. This indicates that for a significant proportion of Amazonian communities, the underlying processes determining diversity may be impacted by deforestation.

AB Farming is a technique employed by both humans and animals to enhance crop yields, allowing their populations to increase beyond the natural carrying capacity of the environment. Using volcanic CO2 vents, we investigate how a species of herbivorous fish (the black scalyfin Parma alboscapularis) may use increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions to enhance its crop yields. We found that these farming fish can take advantage of this resource enrichment, to grow crops within smaller territories and increase the capacity of the environment to support more densely packed fish populations.

AB The fate of tropical forests under climate change is unclear as a result, in part, of the uncertainty in projected changes in precipitation and in the ability of vegetation models to capture the effects of drought-induced mortality on aboveground biomass (AGB).
   We evaluated the ability of a terrestrial biosphere model with demography and hydrodynamics (Ecosystem Demography, ED2-hydro) to simulate AGB and mortality of four tropical tree plant functional types (PFTs) that operate along light- and water-use axes. Model predictions were compared with observations of canopy trees at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We then assessed the implications of eight hypothetical precipitation scenarios, including increased annual precipitation, reduced inter-annual variation, El Nino-related droughts and drier wet or dry seasons, on AGB and functional diversity of the model forest.
   When forced with observed meteorology, ED2-hydro predictions capture multiple BCI benchmarks. ED2-hydro predicts that AGB will be sustained under lower rainfall via shifts in the functional composition of the forest, except under the drier dry-season scenario.
   These results support the hypothesis that inter-annual variation in mean and seasonal precipitation promotes the coexistence of functionally diverse PFTs because of the relative differences in mortality rates. If the hydroclimate becomes chronically drier or wetter, functional evenness related to drought tolerance may decline.

AB The easternmost part of Amazonia, east of the Tocantins River, in Brazil, is also known as the Belem Area of Endemism (BAE) and falls mostly within the Amazonian "arc of deforestation" with the highest rate of deforestation in the region. Even though only one reptile species may be strictly endemic to the BAE, according to present knowledge, recognition of this area is useful for conservation purposes. Herein, we present a revision of current knowledge on the diversity and distribution of Squamata in the BAE in order to support conservation strategies and detect the main sampling gaps. We searched the literature and databases of several herpetological collections to compose the list of species for the area. For each species, we recorded distribution, habitat, and microhabitat. We present species accumulation curves for the whole area and for the two municipalities with largest samples, and prepared maps with species richness per municipality, current vegetation coverage, and conservation units present in the region. Additionally, we compare the number of known forest species of Squamata with the proportion of current forest cover for the best-sampled municipalities to test if there is a relationship between the conservation state of the area and the number of species. Our sampling reports 23,598 records of 147 species, including 7 amphisbaenians, 39 lizards, and 101 snakes. Sixty species (40.8%) are restricted to Amazonia, 12 (8.2%) are shared only with the Cerrado and 19 (12.9%) only with the Atlantic Forest, 1 (0.7%) is introduced, and the remaining 55 (37.4%) are shared with other biomes. Amphisbaena anomala and Stenocercus dumerilii are mostly associated with the BAE, and Atractus hoogmoedi is only known from its type locality and might represent a BAE endemic. Two species are threatened at the national level (Brazilian Red List) and five at the state level (Para Red List). The largest samples and species richness are from the municipalities of Belem and Viseu; 9% of the municipalities have > 50 species, 32.4% have 1-10 species, and 38% remain unsampled. For 38 of the 50 municipalities with < 10% of forest cover, we have virtually no information on forest-dwelling species. Despite its high rate of deforestation, our knowledge of the herpetofauna of the BAE is based on a few limited areas; this fact hinders analyses of correlation with environmental factors and more appropriate definitions of conservation strategies. The largest tracks of forest remnants are mostly in indigenous lands, so it is important to develop strategies for studying these areas. The historically dynamic nature of the interchange between Amazonia and Cerrado biomes in the BAE might explain the tolerance of the species presented here to disturbed and secondary forests. Nonetheless, the increasing expansion of pastures, monocultures and urban areas in the area represent real and alarming threat.

AB Forest loss, fragmentation, and anthropization threaten the survival of forest species all over the world. Shifting agriculture is one of these threatening processes in Madagascar. However, when its cycle is halted and the land is left to regenerate, the resulting growth of secondary forest may provide a viable habitat for folivorous and omnivorous lemur species. We aimed to identify the response of nocturnal lemurs to different successional stages of regenerating secondary, degraded mature, and mature forest across a mosaic-type landscape. We surveyed four nocturnal lemur species (Avahi laniger, Microcebus cf. simmonsi, Allocebus trichotis, and Daubentonia madagascariensis) in four forest types of varying habitat disturbance in northeastern Madagascar. We estimated densities in mature and regenerating secondary forest for the eastern woolly lemur (Avahi laniger) and mouse lemur (Microcebus cf. simmonsi), two sympatric species with folivorous and omnivorous diets respectively. We did not estimate densities of Allocebus trichotis and Daubentonia madagascariensis owing to small sample size; however, we observed both species exclusively in mature forest. We found higher population densities of A. laniger and M. cf. simmonsi in secondary than in mature forest, showing the potential of regenerating secondary forest for lemur conservation. Several environmental factors influenced the detectability of the two lemur species. While observer and habitat type influenced detection of the eastern woolly lemur, canopy height and vine density influenced detection of mouse lemurs. Understanding how different species with different diets interact with anthropogenically impacted habitat will aid future management decisions for the conservation of primate species.

AB Tropical forest loss and fragmentation can change bee community dynamics and potentially interrupt plant-pollinator relationships. While bee community responses to forest fragmentation have been investigated in a number of tropical regions, no studies have focused on this topic in Australia. In this study, we examine taxonomic and functional diversity of bees visiting flowers of three tree species across small and large rainforest fragments in Australian tropical landscapes. We found lower taxonomic diversity of bees visiting flowers of trees in small rainforest fragments compared with large forest fragments and show that bee species in small fragments were subsets of species in larger fragments. Bees visiting trees in small fragments also had higher mean body sizes than those in larger fragments, suggesting that small-sized bees may be less likely to persist in small fragments. Lastly, we found reductions in the abundance of eusocial stingless bees visiting flowers in small fragments compared to large fragments. These results suggest that pollinator visits to native trees living in small tropical forest remnants may be reduced, which may in turn impact on a range of processes, potentially including forest regeneration and diversity maintenance in small forest remnants in Australian tropical countryside landscapes.

AB Tropical forest degradation is a global environmental issue. In degraded forests, seedling recruitment of canopy trees is vital for forest regeneration and recovery. We investigated how selective logging, a pervasive driver of tropical forest degradation, impacts canopy tree seedling recruitment, focusing on an endemic dipterocarp Dryobalanops lanceolata in Sabah, Borneo. During a mast-fruiting event in intensively logged and nearby unlogged forest, we examined four stages of the seedling recruitment process: seed production, seed predation, and negative density-dependent germination and seedling survival. Our results suggest that each stage of the seedling recruitment process is altered in logged forest. The seed crop of D. lanceolata trees in logged forest was one-third smaller than that produced by trees in unlogged forest. The functional role of vertebrates in seed predation increased in logged forest while that of non-vertebrates declined. Seeds in logged forest were less likely to germinate than those in unlogged forest. Germination increased with local-scale conspecific seed density in unlogged forest, but seedling survival tended to decline. However, both germination and seedling survival increased with local-scale conspecific seed density in logged forest. Notably, seed crop size, germination, and seedling survival tended to increase for larger trees in both unlogged and logged forests, suggesting that sustainable timber extraction and silvicultural practices designed to minimize damage to the residual stand are important to prevent seedling recruitment failure. Overall, these impacts sustained by several aspects of seedling recruitment in a mast-fruiting year suggest that intensive selective logging may affect long-term population dynamics of D. lanceolata. It is necessary to establish if other dipterocarp species, many of which are threatened by the timber trade, are similarly affected in tropical forests degraded by intensive selective logging.

AB Tree species distribution in lowland tropical forests is strongly associated with rainfall amount and distribution. Not only plant water availability, but also irradiance, soil fertility, and pest pressure covary along rainfall gradients. To assess the role of water availability in shaping species distribution, we carried out a reciprocal transplanting experiment in gaps in a dry and a wet forest site in Ghana, using 2,670 seedlings of 23 tree species belonging to three contrasting rainfall distributions groups (dry species, ubiquitous species, and wet species). We evaluated seasonal patterns in climatic conditions, seedling physiology and performance (survival and growth) over a 2-year period and related seedling performance to species distribution along Ghana's rainfall gradient. The dry forest site had, compared to the wet forest, higher irradiance, and soil nutrient availability and experienced stronger atmospheric drought (2.0 vs. 0.6kPa vapor pressure deficit) and reduced soil water potential (-5.0 vs. -0.6MPa soil water potential) during the dry season. In both forests, dry species showed significantly higher stomatal conductance and lower leaf water potential, than wet species, and in the dry forest, dry species also realized higher drought survival and growth rate than wet species. Dry species are therefore more drought tolerant, and unlike the wet forest species, they achieve a home advantage. Species drought performance in the dry forest relative to the wet forest significantly predicted species position on the rainfall gradient in Ghana, indicating that the ability to grow and survive better in dry forests and during dry seasons may allow species to occur in low rainfall areas. Drought is therefore an important environmental filter that influences forest composition and dynamics. Currently, many tropical forests experience increase in frequency and intensity of droughts, and our results suggest that this may lead to reduction in tree productivity and shifts in species distribution.

AB Tropical forests represent an important pool in the global carbon cycle. Their biomass stocks and carbon fluxes are variable in space and time, which is a challenge for accurate measurements. Forest models are therefore used to investigate these complex forest dynamics. The challenge of considering the high species diversity of tropical forests is often addressed by grouping species into plant functional types (PFTs). We investigated how reduced numbers of PFTs affect the prediction of productivity (GPP, NPP) and other carbon fluxes derived from forest simulations. We therefore parameterized a forest gap model for a specific study site with just one PFT (comparable to global vegetation models) on the one hand, and two versions with a higher amount of PFTs, on the other hand. For an old-growth forest, aboveground biomass and basal area can be reproduced very well with all parameterizations. However, the absence of pioneer tree species in the parameterizations with just one PFT leads to a reduction in estimated gross primary production by 60% and an increase of estimated net ecosystem exchange by 50%. These findings may have consequences for productivity estimates of forests at regional and continental scales. Models with a reduced number of PFTs are limited in simulating forest succession, in particular regarding the forest growth after disturbances or transient dynamics. We conclude that a higher amount of species groups increases the accuracy of forest succession simulations. We suggest using at a minimum three PFTs with at least one species group representing pioneer tree species.

AB Wildfires are one of the most prominent risks for Mediterranean forests, reducing the flow of ecosystem services and representing a hazard for infrastructure and human lives. Several wildfire prevention programs in southern Europe are currently incorporating extensive livestock grazers in fire prevention activities to reduce the high costs of mechanical clearance. Among these the Andalusian network of grazed fuel breaks, the so-called RAPCA program, stands out for its dimension and stability over time. RAPCA currently works with 220 local shepherds who, with their guided flocks maintain low biomass levels in almost 6000 ha of fuel breaks in public forests to meet fire prevention standards. This work analyses the institutional design and performance of the RAPCA payment scheme under a payment for environmental services (PES) framework. Results show effectiveness of the payment scheme while efficiency is achieved through savings relative to the mainstream mechanized biomass removal, as well as through reduced information asymmetry. High-level and stable political commitment has been crucial for the emergence and consolidation of RAPCA. Moreover, key intermediaries and sound monitoring practices increased levels of trust amongst involved actors. Beneficial side-effects include social recognition of shepherds' activities and reduction of their friction with forest managers.

DE Null hypothesis; Community ecology; Neutral theory; Comparative

ID ABUNDANCE; PARSIMONY
AB We evaluate a common reasoning strategy used in community ecology and comparative psychology for selecting between competing hypotheses. This strategy labels one hypothesis as a null on the grounds of its simplicity and epistemically privileges it as accepted until rejected. We argue that this strategy is unjustified. The asymmetrical treatment of statistical null hypotheses is justified through the experimental and mathematical contexts in which they are used, but these contexts are missing in the case of the pseudo-null hypotheses found in our case studies. Moreover, statistical nulls are often not epistemically privileged in practice over their alternatives because failing to reject the null is usually a negative result about the alternative, experimental hypothesis. Scientists should eschew the appeal to pseudo-nulls. It is a rhetorical strategy that glosses over a commitment to valuing simplicity over other epistemic virtues in the name of good scientific and statistical methodology.

AB During the development of green criminology, little attention has been paid to how Indigenous/Native Peoples (INP) are victimized by green crime and how they employ environmental activism to resist externally imposed ecological destruction. In the past decade, news services and environmental interest groups have reported on the killing of INP environmental activists who have resisted ecological destruction across the world. Here, we begin to develop a green criminological view of INP victimization and resistance to ecological destruction within the context of the global capitalist treadmill of production, while drawing upon concepts of colonization, imperialism, genocide and ecocide. Our analysis suggests that in the contemporary capitalist world system, expansion of the treadmill of production's ecological withdrawal process (i.e. the withdrawal of raw materials used in production) not only accelerates ecological disorganization in developing/underdeveloped nations, but may be harmful in nations where INP are dependent on access to nature for survival.

AB Payment schemes for environmental services face serious budget constraints in Mexico. Payments are equally distributed among forest owners, and the governmental agencies that make payments to beneficiaries do not evaluate the amount of environmental services produced by forested areas. This lack of evaluation could lead to economic and environmental deficiencies that restrict the possible benefits of such programmes. In general, these programmes do not achieve their conservation objectives, and local beneficiaries are not involved in the design or application of these programmes. Similarly, the Payments for Hydrological Environmental Services (PHES) programme of the State of Mexico, Mexico, makes equal payments to beneficiaries of forested areas considering tree density. The objective of the present work was to create a methodology for determining differentiated payments schemes for hydrological environmental services, prioritising areas that contribute the most to groundwater recharge and promote the participation of society. In the Nevado de Toluca Natural Protected Area, the environmental criteria of forest type, tree density and aquifer overexploitation as well as social participation were considered in a multi-criteria analysis implemented in a Geographic Information System. A methodology was developed to determine differentiated payments based on specific forest characteristics that influence the potential capacity of forests to recharge groundwater reserves in addition to the level of social participation. In particular, social participation is key as it could ensure the viability of PHES programmes as conservation alternatives in forested areas with high groundwater recharge potential.

AB Forest degradation and fragmentation of quality habitat across the tropics underpins an urgent need for the conservation of area-sensitive species. Management strategies adopted for small-scale landscape patches may not be suitable for conservation of different communities across large landscapes. In this context, we examined the relationship of bird community composition and different bird functional groups with tree cover and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at multiple landscape scales and also tested the effect of forest degradation on bird community composition. This study demonstrates the importance of core forest habitat for the conservation of area sensitive species. Forest degradation had negative impact on the bird community composition though some functional groups were associated with degraded areas. At the community level, bird density and richness was best explained by a combination of both NDVI at the patch level (50 m scale) and tree cover at the landscape level (500 m scale) where the patch level character was found to be more important than landscape level character. Most of the functional groups which preferred insects as primary or secondary diet items were sensitive to differences at the patch level (NDVI), whereas large frugivorous species were sensitive to differences at the landscape level (tree cover). High vegetation complexity should be conserved at the patch level (at least up to 50 m) for the conservation of insectivorous, nectarivorous and small to medium size frugivorous groups and tree cover should be conserved at the landscape level (at least up to 500 m) for the conservation of large-bodied frugivorous birds.

AB In an era of global change, thermal biology and ecology are becoming increasingly popular topics in invertebrate research, including molluscs. However, this area of research is still very limited, essentially due to the intrinsic spatial limitations of traditional single-point temperature measurements (e.g. thermocouples, iButtons and infrared thermometers). This is not the case, however, with infrared thermography, which has the desirable attribute of producing images that allow for simultaneous measurements of multiple molluscan individuals, species and communities. Infrared thermography allows for spatial and temporal monitoring of microclimates at scales relevant to individual organisms and hence may represent a first step to bridge the gap between field-based approaches (typically spanning from centimetres to tens of metres) to climatic scenarios (typically coarse-grained, i.e. 10 x 10 km). This review first provides a brief history of infrared thermography, followed by a description of the fundamental physical properties and quantities that bridge the gap between the physics of heat transfer and the physics of infrared thermography. We then thoroughly review the thermal biology and ecology of molluscs, and the previous biological and ecological applications of infrared thermography-including the very few in molluscan research. We provide detailed recommendations related to the proper use of infrared thermography. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of infrared thermography in molluscan research, based on case studies involving both terrestrial and intertidal molluscs, with emphasis on its use as a tool for monitoring impacts of climate change.

AB Whale-watching (WW) has gained considerable importance for coastal communities as a potentially sustainable form of marine resource use. However, as a common-pool resource, marine wildlife runs the risk of being overexploited, which can lead to negative effects on both animal populations and economic sustainability. Therefore, careful management and use regulation by capable institutions are required. But any governance arrangements that seek to comply with these exigencies need to be accepted by both (local) stakeholders and resource users. To assure compliance with regulations, the former must be involved in decision-making about management issues and should also partake in the economic benefits of WW. These two factors are major drivers of positive attitudes towards conservation governance. This article analyzes the nexus between governance and the economic impact of WW in the case of the coastal lagoons in the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve (EVBR), Baja California, Mexico, a globally-renowned WW destination.
   The results of our research show that a government-led WW governance arrangement evolved over time in the EVBR to prevent overexploitation and restrict resource use by non-local operators, thus ensuring that mainly local service providers will profit from WW. Moreover, the Reserves advisory board serves as a relatively effective negotiating platform that offers possibilities for participation by local stakeholders while also mitigating conflicts among actors that represent unequal powers. Therefore, these institutional arrangements are widely accepted and supported by local actors who often rely on economic rationalism in their arguments.
   We calculated the economic impact of WW using an input-output model: similar to 18,000 whale-watchers produce an annual regional economic impact of US-$0.7 million and generate 334 seasonal and 180 year-round jobs. The opportunity costs related to restrictions on resource use are adequately compensated, so the case of WW in the EVBR supports the general feasibility of the people-oriented protected area approach and the suitability of biosphere reserves as governing institutions for marine wildlife tourism.

AB Plant functional traits offer insights into the plant-environment relationship and may help to understand how plants influence ecosystem functions. Applying trait-based models on climate and land-use change to forests is often hindered by poor data quality, as many data are estimates and traits are often parameterized for juvenile and not adult trees. For advancing theory building and improving the quality of trait data with relevance for adult trees, we compiled a unique trait database for the complete tree flora of Central Europe (42 species from 11 families), covering 38 morphological and physiological traits mostly parameterized with sun and shade crown and root data from adult trees. Despite only small variation in climate, several traits vary largely in this tree species sample, likely reflecting regional edaphic variation, while the influence of phylogenetic diversity is low and restricted to the angiosperm-gymnosperm divergence. The well-established shade tolerance-drought tolerance and wood density-drought sensitivity trade-offs are not supported by our data set, possibly due to the explicit consideration of adult trees and the absence of extended climatic gradients. For the 11 major tree species with high information density, a principal components analysis (PCA) identified three key functional traits, (i) minimum light demand of the adult trees' shade leaves, (ii) stand leaf area index (LAI), and (iii) maximum tree height, which allows distinguishing five tree functional groups, among them a mid-successional tree group. Only a small minority of traits changes significantly along the early-to-late successional axis, contradicting a main paradigm in forest succession research. The functional contrast between early-and late-successional trees is smaller in the sun canopy of adults than in seedlings or saplings, suggesting that trait data from juveniles cannot simply be extrapolated to adults. Focusing on adult trees and on traits with a more direct link to the underlying processes may significantly improve tree functional classification and trait-based models in forest ecology and biogeochemistry.

AB The proportion of eukaryotic genomes composed of active or formerly active mobile elements (MEs) is known to vary widely across lineages, but the explanations for why remain largely unknown. Given that ME activity, like other forms of mutation, is thought to be (on average) slightly deleterious in terms of phenotypic effects, understanding the widespread proliferation of MEs in host genomes requires an evolutionary framework. To better develop such a framework, we review the spectrum of resolutions to the genetic conflict between MEs and their hosts: inactivation of MEs due to mutation accumulation, negative selection (or lack thereof) against hosts with high ME loads, silencing of MEs (by hosts or MEs), ME domestication by their hosts, and the horizontal transfer of MEs to new hosts. We also highlight ecological and evolutionary theory from which ME researchers might borrow in order to explain large-scale patterns of ME dynamics across systems. We hope that a synthesis of the surprisingly significant role played by MEs in the genome, as well as the spectrum of resolutions, applicable theory, and recent discoveries, will have two outcomes for future researchers: better parsing of known variation in ME proliferation patterns across genomes and the development of testable models and predictions regarding the evolutionary trajectory of MEs based on a combination of theory, the comparative method, experimental evolution, and empirical observations.

AB Aim: To evaluate Morrone's (2001, Biogeografia de America Latina y el Caribe. Zaragoza, Spain: CYTED, ORCYT-UNESCO, Sociedad Entomologica Aragonesa (SEA)) Neotropical regionalization by testing the prediction that biotas are more homogeneous within than among biogeographic units.
   Location: Neotropics.
   Methods: We conducted pairwise comparisons of beta diversity of Sapotaceae species within and between biogeographic units in the hierarchical regionalization proposed by Morrone (2001, Biogeografia de America Latina y el Caribe. Zaragoza, Spain: CYTED, ORCYT-UNESCO, Sociedad Entomologica Aragonesa (SEA)), at a spatial resolution of 1-degree cells. We used a null model to control differences in sampling effort across 1-degree cells and performed beta-diversity comparisons conditional on geographic distance to control for distance decay of biotic similarity. Results: None of the biogeographic units proposed by Morrone (2001, Biogeografia de America Latina y el Caribe. Zaragoza, Spain: CYTED, ORCYT-UNESCO, Sociedad Entomologica Aragonesa (SEA)) was biotically homogeneous with respect to all other units at the same hierarchical level. This was the case even for units commonly reported to be isolated and to host distinctive taxa like Choco. However, five of 45 biogeographic units were biotically homogenous relative to several other units. These units were Cuba, Chaco, Varzea, Cauca and Costa Pacifica Mexicana. Also, beta diversity within units was often lower than beta diversity between units at relatively short geographic distances.
   Main conclusions: The distribution of Sapotaceae species showed generally low biotic homogeneity within Morrone's (2001, Biogeografia de America Latina y el Caribe. Zaragoza, Spain: CYTED, ORCYT-UNESCO, Sociedad Entomologica Aragonesa (SEA)) biogeographic units and did not support his biogeographic regionalization. This result suggests a strong role for dispersal and biotic interchange among biogeographic units and across barriers like the Andes. It also casts doubt on the usefulness of Morrone's (2001, Biogeografia de America Latina y el Caribe. Zaragoza, Spain: CYTED, ORCYT-UNESCO, Sociedad Entomologica Aragonesa (SEA)) biogeographic units as tools for the identification of priority areas for the conservation of biodiversity. However, relatively high biotic homogeneity within some biogeographic units suggests that they capture significant spatial patterns. In particular, noteworthy biotic homogeneity within Cuba, Cauca and Costa Pacifica Mexicana could be explained by isolation. Also, in Costa Pacifica Mexicana, patterns of biotic homogeneity could reflect closer affinities to humid lowland montane forest in Central America than to lowland rain forest in South America. Finally, substantial biotic homogeneity within Varzea could result from common adaptation to edaphic environments near the Amazon River.

AB Habitat fragmentation results in landscape configuration, which affects the species that inhabit it. As a consequence, natural habitat is replaced by different anthropogenic plantation types (e.g. pasture, agriculture, forestry plantations and urban areas). Anthropogenic plantations are important for biodiversity maintenance because some species or functional groups can use it as a complementary habitat. However, depending on plantation permeability, it can act as a barrier to the movement of organisms between habitat patches, such as forest fragments, reducing functional connectivity for many species. Anthropogenic plantations are becoming the most common land use and cover type in the Anthropocene and biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes requires information on how different plantation types affect the capacity of the species to move through the landscape. In this study, we evaluated the influence of the type and structure of plantations on the movement of two forest-dependent understory bird species - plain antvireo (Dysithamnus mentalis) and flavescent warbler (Myiothlyps flaveola) - within a highly fragmented landscape of Atlantic Forest hotspot. Knowing that forestry plantation is assumed to be more permeable to dependent forest bird species than open ones, we selected six study areas containing a forest fragment and surrounding plantation: three with sugarcane plantation and three with Eucalyptus sp. plantation. We used playback calls to stimulate the birds to leave forest fragments and traverse the plantations. Control trials were also carried out inside the forest fragments to compare the distances crossed. We observed that individuals moved longer distances inside forest than between plantation types, which demonstrate that plantations do constrict the movements of both species. The two plantation types equally impeded the movements of the species, suggesting the opposite of the general assumption that forestry plantations are more permeable. Our results indicate that, for generalist species, plantation type does not matter, but its presence negatively impacts movement of these bird species. We highlight that plantations have negative influences on the movements of common bird species, and discuss why this is important when setting conservation priorities.

AB Climate change is shifting the amount and frequency of precipitation in many regions, which is expected to affect seedling recruitment across ecosystems. However, the combined effects of precipitation amount and frequency on seedling recruitment remain largely unknown. An understanding of the effects of precipitation amount and frequency and their interaction on seedling emergence and growth of typical desert plants is vital for managing populations of desert plants. We conducted two experiments to study the effects of variation in precipitation on Reaumuria soongarica (Pall.) Maxim. First, greenhouse experiments were conducted to examine the effects of three precipitation amount treatments (ambient, +30%, and -30%) and two precipitation frequency treatments (ambient and -50%) on seedling emergence. Second, the morphological responses of R. soongarica to changes in precipitation amount and frequency were tested in a controlled field experiment. Stage-specific changes in growth were monitored by sampling in different growth seasons. Our results showed that precipitation amount significantly affected germination, seedling emergence, and growth of R. soongarica, and there was a larger effect with decreased precipitation frequency compared with ambient. Germination and seedling emergence increased as precipitation increased under the same frequency of precipitation. The highest emergence percentage was obtained with a 30% increase in precipitation amount and a 50% reduction in precipitation frequency. Compared with ambient precipitation, a 30% increase in precipitation amount increased above- and below-ground biomass accumulation of R. soongarica during the growth season. A decrease of 30% in precipitation amount also resulted in an increase in below-ground biomass and root/shoot ratio in the early stages of the growth season, however, above- and below-ground biomass showed the opposite results at the end of the growth season, with larger effects on above-ground than below-ground biomass under decreased precipitation frequency. When precipitation frequency decreased by 50%, values of all growth traits increased for a given amount of precipitation. We concluded that precipitation frequency may be as important as precipitation amount to seedling emergence and growth of R. soongarica, and that understanding the effects of precipitation variability on seedling recruitment requires the integration of both precipitation amount and frequency. In particular, the combination of a 30% increase in precipitation amount and 50% reduction in precipitation frequency increased the emergence and growth of seedlings, suggesting that alteration of amount and frequency of precipitation caused by climate change may have significant effects on seedling recruitment of R. soongarica.

AB Soil organic and inorganic phosphorus (P) compounds can be influenced by distinctive environmental properties. This study aims to analyze soil P composition in natural ecosystems, relating organic (inositol hexakisphosphate, DNA and phosphonates) and inorganic (orthophosphate, polyphosphate and pyrophosphate) compounds with major temporal (weathering), edaphic and climatic characteristics. A dataset including 88 sites was assembled from published papers that determined soil P composition using one-dimensional liquid state P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of NaOH-EDTA extracts of soils. Bivariate and multivariate regression models were used to better understand the environmental properties influencing soil P. In bivariate relationships, trends for soil P compounds were similar for mineral and organic layers but with different slopes. Independent and combined effects of weathering, edaphic and climatic properties of ecosystems explained up to 78% (inositol hexakisphosphates) and 89% (orthophosphate) of variations in organic and inorganic P compounds across the ecosystems, likely deriving from parent material differences. Soil properties, particularly pH, total carbon, and carbon-tophosphorus ratios, over climate and weathering mainly explained the P variation. We conclude that edaphic and climatic drivers regulate key ecological processes that determine the soil P composition in natural ecosystems. These processes are related to the source of P inputs, primarily determined by the parent material and soil forming factors, plant and microbe P cycling, the bio-physico-chemical properties governing soil phosphatase activity, soil solid surface specific reactivity, and P losses through leaching, and finally the P persistence induced by the increasing complexity of organic and inorganic P compounds as the pedogenesis evolves. Soil organic and inorganic P compounds respond differently to combinations of environmental drivers, which likely indicates that each P compound has specific factors governing its presence in natural ecosystems.

AB In the southern Amazon relationships have been established among drought, human activities that cause forest loss, fire, and smoke emissions. We explore the impacts of recent drought on fire, forest loss, and atmospheric visibility in lowland Bolivia. To assess human influence on fire, we consider climate, fire, and vegetation dynamics in an area largely excluded from human activities since 1979, Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NK) in northeastern Bolivia. We use data from five sources: the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 6 active fire product (2001-2015) (MODIS C6), Global Fire WEather Database (GFWED) data (1982-2015), MODIS land cover data (2001-2010), MODIS forest loss data (2000-2012), and the regional extinction coefficient for the southwestern Amazon (i.e., B-ext), which is derived from horizontal visibility data from surface stations at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) level (1973-2015). The B-ext is affected by smoke and acts as a proxy for visibility and regional fire emissions. In lowland Bolivia from 2001 to 2015, interannual Drought Code (DC) variability was linked to fire activity, while from 1982 to 2015, interannual DC variability was linked to B-ext. From 2001 to 2015, the B-ext and MODIS C6 active fire data for lowland Bolivia captured fire seasonality, and covaried between low-and high-fire years. Consistent with previous studies, our results suggest B-ext can be used as a longer-term proxy of regional fire emissions in southwestern Amazonia. Overall, our study found drought conditions were the dominant control on interannual fire variability in lowland Bolivia, and fires within NK were limited to the Cerrado and seasonally inundated wetland biomes. Our results suggest lowland Bolivian tropical forests were susceptible to human activities that may have amplified fire during drought. Human activities and drought need to be considered in future projections of southern Amazonian fire, in regard to carbon emissions and global climate.

AB Humans can alter fire dynamics in grassland systems by changing fire frequency, fire seasonality and fuel conditions. These changes have effects on vegetation structure and recovery, species composition, and ecosystem function. Understanding how human management can affect fire regimes is vital to detect potential changes in the resilience of plant communities, and to predict vegetation responses to human interventions. We evaluated the fire regimes of two recently protected areas in Madagascar (Ibity and Itremo NPA) and one in Brazil (Serra do Cipo NP) before and after livestock exclusion and fire suppression policies. We compare the pre- and post-management fire history in these areas and analyze differences in terms of total annual burned area, density of ignitions, burn scar size distribution, fire return period and seasonal fire distribution. More than 90% of total park areas were burned at least once during the studied period, for all parks. We observed a significant reduction in the number of ignitions for Ibity NPA and Serra do Cipo NP after livestock exclusion and active fire suppression, but no significant change in total burned area for each protected area. We also observed a seasonal shift in burning, with fires happening later in the fire season (October November) after management intervention. However, the protected areas in Madagascar had shorter fire return intervals (3.23 and 1.82 years) than those in Brazil (7.91 years). Our results demonstrate that fire exclusion is unattainable, and probably unwarranted in tropical grassland conservation areas, but show how human intervention in fire and vegetation patterns can alter various aspects of the fire regimes. This information can help with formulating realistic and effective fire management policies in these valuable conservation areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Species coexistence mechanisms and maintenance of biodiversity have long been considered important components of community ecology research. As one of the important mechanisms, species coexistence theory based on niche differentiation has received attention in past years. Thus, topography, through the formation of habitat heterogeneity, affects species distributions and coexistence. A 30-ha dynamic plot of mixed broadleaved-Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forest is located in the Heilongjiang Fenglin National Nature Reserve. We examined species-habitat associations using the torus-translation method. We aim to understand the habitat associations of different species, life forms (shrubs, trees), and shade tolerance (light-demanding, midtolerant, shade-tolerant) across life stages (sapling, juvenile and mature), providing further evidence for the role of niche theory in temperate forests.
   Results: Of the 33 species we tested, 28 species (84.8%) were at least significantly associated with one habitat type. Positive associations were more frequent in the valley and slope (shady and sunny) and less frequent on the ridge. Thirty-four significant positive associations with the five habitats were detected at three life stages (11, 11 and 12 at the sapling stage, juvenile stage, and mature stage, respectively). The trees were positively associated with the valley, and the shrubs were positively associated with sunny and ridge. The majority of species' habitat preferences shifted among different life stages; the exceptions were Corylus mandshurica, Maackia amurensis, Quercus mongolica, Picea jezoensis and Acer ukurunduense, which had consistent associations with the same habitat at all stages. The midtolerant trees and midtolerant shrubs were positively correlated with sunny across the three life stages.
   Conclusions: Most species show habitat preferences in the plot. These results indicate that niche theory plays an important role in species coexistence. Most species have no consistent association with habitat at different life stages.

AB One of the first successes of neutral ecology was to predict realistically-broad distributions of rare and abundant species. However, it has remained an outstanding theoretical challenge to describe how this distribution of abundances changes with spatial scale, and this gap has hampered attempts to use observed species abundances as a way to quantify what non-neutral processes are needed to fully explain observed patterns. To address this, we introduce a new formulation of spatial neutral biodiversity theory and derive analytical predictions for the way abundance distributions change with scale. For tropical forest data where neutrality has been extensively tested before now, we apply this approach and identify an incompatibility between neutral fits at regional and local scales. We use this approach derive a sharp quantification of what remains to be explained by non-neutral processes at the local scale, setting a quantitative target for more general models for the maintenance of biodiversity.

AB This work contributes to the basic knowledge of poneroid and ectatommine ants in forest fragments of llanos piedmont, upper llanos and the transition between these zones in the Meta department. Species lists were generated for each study site and were compared among them. During september and november of 2015 and february of 2016, samplings were conducted through manual capture, pitfall traps, and collection of 1 m(2) of litter for processing in Winkler sacks. In total, 40 species were recorded, 32 of them with a name, belonging to twelve genera and four subfamilies. Species richness and abundance tended to decrease from the llanos piedmont to upper llanos. The results constitute the highest richness of poneroid and ectatommine ants reported in the studied zones. The importance of forest fragments for the presence of these groups of ants and the need to increase baseline studies towards the Colombian Orinoquia region is highlighted.

AB The subtropical riverine forests present a variation in soil water availability throughout the year, following precipitation seasonality. The objective of this work was to evaluate the responses of Cordia americana to different light intensities combined with soil flooding. Seedlings were acclimated to light treatments, with full sun and shade conditions. Sun and shade plants were subjected to soil flooding during periods of 10 (short) and 30 (longer) days. After 10 days, flooded plants had a higher root dry mass accumulation and soluble sugars content, regardless of the light condition. Shade plants presented higher shoot soluble sugars content in relation to the sun plants. After 30 days, a higher shoot soluble sugar content was observed in sun and shade flooded plants. In addition, a higher root soluble sugar content was also observed in sun plants under flood. Periods of short flooding, characterized in subtropical forests as from 5 to 15 days, favor the growth of shade plants and the roots sugar accumulation, fact that can explain the species distribution. However, long periods of flooding may be associated with light environment plasticity, suggesting that the sun plants present a higher flooding tolerance, directly associated with the ability to maintain the sugar content.

AB Interactions between plants and root-associated fungi can affect the assembly, diversity, and relative abundances of tropical plant species. Host-symbiont compatibility and some degree of host specificity are prerequisites for these processes to occur, and these prerequisites may vary with host abundance. However, direct assessments of whether specificity of root-associated fungi varies with host abundance are lacking. Here, in a diverse tropical forest in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, we couple DNA metabarcoding with a sampling design that controls for host phylogeny, host age, and habitat variation, to characterize fungal communities associated with the roots of three confamilial pairs of host species that exhibit contrasting (high and low) relative abundances. We uncovered a functionally and phylogenetically diverse fungal community composed of 1,038 OTUs (operational taxonomic units with 97% genetic similarity), only 14 of which exhibited host specificity. Host species was a significant predictor of fungal community composition only for the subset of OTUs composed of putatively pathogenic fungi. We found no significant difference in the number of specialists associating with common versus rare trees, but we found that host abundance was negatively correlated with the diversity of root fungal communities. This latter result was significant for symbiotrophs (mostly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and, to a lesser extent, for pathotrophs (mostly plant pathogens). Thus, root fungal communities differ between common and rare trees, which may impact the strength of conspecific negative density dependence. Further studies from other tropical sites and host lineages are warranted, given the role of root-associated fungi in biodiversity maintenance.
   RESUMEN Las interacciones entre plantas y hongos asociados a las raices pueden afectar el ensamblaje, la diversidad y la abundancia relativa de plantas tropicales. La compatibilidad entre el hospedero y el hongo, asi como el grado de elspecificidad para el hospedero son prerrequisitos para que estos procesos ocurran, y tales requisitos pueden variar con la abundancia del hospedero. Sin embargo, se requiere evaluar directamente si la especificidad de los hongos asociados a la raiz varia con la abundancia del hospedero. En este estudio combinamos metacodigo de barras con un diseno de muestreo que controla la filogenia, edad del hospedero y la heterogeniedad del habitat para caracterizar las comunidades fungicas asociadas a las raices de tres pares confamiliares de especies hospederas de abundancia relativa contrastante (comunues y raras) en un bosque tropical diverso (Los Tuxtlas, Mexico). Descubrimos una comunidad fungica funcional y filogeneticamente diversa, compuesta por 1,038 UTO (unidades taxonomicas operativas con 97% de similitud genetica), de las cuales solo 14 presentaron especificidad. La especie del hospedero fue un buen predictor de la composicion de la comunidad fungica para el subconjunto de UTOs de hongos presuntamente patogenicos. No encontramos diferencias significativas en el numero de hongos especialistas asociados con los arboles comunes vs. raros, pero encontramos que la abundancia del hospedero se correlaciona negativamente con la diversidad de las comunidades de hongos radiculares. Este ultimo resultado fue significativo para los simbiotrofos (principalmente hongos micorrizicos arbusculares), y en menor medida para los patotrofos (principalmente patogenos de plantas). Por lo tanto, las comunidades de estos hongos difieren entre arboles comunes y raros, lo que puede afectar la fuerza del efecto coespecifico densodependiente negativo. Se requiere de estudios que consideren mas linajes de hospederos, dado el papel que juegan los hongos asociados a las raices en el mantenimiento de la biodiversidad tropical.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are considered promising instruments for promoting conservation and addressing socio-economic goals, including equity. While several studies analyse how institutions enable the delivery of cost effective conservation, fewer studies focus on the role that informal institutions play in influencing equitable outcomes especially in Africa. Focussing on the role of formal and informal institutions, this article contributes to the emergence of work that reflects alternative conceptualisations to mainstream neoclassical understandings of PES. A qualitative research approach is applied analysing two Kenyan cases to illustrate how historical institutional processes influence present day equity outcomes. The study explores both procedural and distributive equity. The results reveal that despite very similar land tenure origins, the schemes differ considerably regarding their equity outcomes. Formal and informal institutional interplay was found to influence perceptions of land value over time and bargaining processes are identified as determinants of the different equity outcomes. The study also reveals that institutional interplay may influence the simultaneous achievement of different equity dimensions. The study therefore recommends the integration of mechanisms that reconcile both formal and informal institutions, such as land tenure distribution and cultural norms in design and implementation of PES schemes to better achieve equity.

AB The linking of individual functional traits to ecosystem processes is the basis for making generalizations in ecology, but the measurement of individual values is laborious and time consuming, preventing large-scale trait mapping. Also, in hyper-diverse systems, errors occur because identification is difficult, and species level values ignore intra-specific variation. To allow extensive trait mapping at the individual level, we evaluated the potential of Fourrier-Transformed Near Infra-Red Spectrometry (FT-NIR) to adequately describe 14 traits that are key for plant carbon, water, and nutrient balance. FT-NIR absorption spectra (1,000-2,500 nm) were obtained from dry leaves and branches of 1,324 trees of 432 species from a hyper-diverse Amazonian forest. FT-NIR spectra were related to measured traits for the same plants using partial least squares regressions. A further 80 plants were collected from a different site to evaluate model applicability across sites. Relative prediction error (RMSErel) was calculated as the percentage of the trait value range represented by the final model RMSE. The key traits used in most functional trait studies; specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, wood density and wood dry matter content can be well predicted by the model (R-2=0.69-0.78, RMSErel=9-11%), while leaf density, xylem proportion, bark density and bark dry matter content can be moderately well predicted (R-2=0.53-0.61, RMSErel=14-17%). Community-weighted means of all traits were well estimated with NIR, as did the shape of the frequency distribution of the community values for the above key traits. The model developed at the core site provided good estimations of the key traits of a different site. An evaluation of the sampling effort indicated that 400 or less individuals may be sufficient for establishing a good local model. We conclude that FT-NIR is an easy, fast and cheap method for the large-scale estimation of individual plant traits that was previously impossible. The ability to use dry intact leaves and branches unlocks the potential for using herbarium material to estimate functional traits; thus advancing our knowledge of community and ecosystem functioning from local to global scales.

AB Ricinus communis L. colonizes heterogeneous urban landscapes as monospecific thickets. The ecological understanding on colonization success of R. communis population due to variable light availability is lacking. Therefore, to understand the effect of intrinsic light heterogeneity on species' population dynamics, R. communis populations exposed to variable light availability (low, intermediate, and high) were examined for performance strategies through estimation of key vegetative, eco-physiological, biochemical, and reproductive traits. Considerable variability existed in studied plant traits in response to available light. Individuals inhabiting high-light conditions exhibited high eco-physiological efficiency and reproductive performance that potentially confers population boom. Individuals exposed to low light showed poor performance in terms of eco-physiology and reproduction, which attribute to bust. However, individuals in intermediate light were observed to be indeterminate to light availability, potentially undergoing trait modulations with uncertainty of available light. Heterogeneous light availability potentially drives the boom and bust cycles in R. communis monospecific thickets. Such boom and bust cycles subsequently affect species' dominance, persistence, collapse, and/or resurgence as an aggressive colonizer in contrasting urban environments. The study fosters extensive monitoring of R. communis thickets to probe underlying mechanism(s) affecting expansions and/or collapses of colonizing populations.

AB While deforestation and fragmentation can cause massive species loss in forest ecosystems, forest regeneration can also drive successional changes in species composition. Although studies have sometimes documented the effects of these compositional changes on interspecific interactions, few studies have investigated changes in the structure of plant-animal networks. We investigated how interaction networks of assemblages of rodents and tree seeds changed with forest fragmentation and succession in a subtropical region. We compared seed-rodent interactions between 14 secondary forest patches that ranged in area from 2 to 58 ha, and from 10 to at least 100 years old, representing a successional gradient. We expected that deforestation and fragmentation would reduce seed production and diversify rodent communities, resulting in higher interaction strengths and connectivity, but weak nestedness (i.e., specialists interact with subsets of the species interaction of generalists). We measured the frequency of rodents eating and removing seeds (interaction strength) in each patch during 3 successive years, using seed tagging and infrared camera trapping, and calculated the properties of the seed-rodent networks. We found that the relative abundances of seeds and rodents changed with stand age not patch size, as did seed-rodent interactions: older patches produced more seeds, contained fewer individuals and species of rodents, and had seed-rodent networks with lower connectance and interaction strength, but higher nestedness. Connectance and interaction strength decreased with metabolic per capita seed availability (as measured by seed energy value); nestedness increased with seed richness, but decreased with rodent abundance. At species level, we found stand age and patch size showed significant effects on seed or rodent abundance of a few species. We also found seed coat thickness and starch contents had significant effects on network metrics. Our results suggest that during succession after deforestation, seed-rodent interactions in these sub-tropical forests change from a state dominated by high seed removal and highly connected seed-rodent networks to a state with more seeds and highly nested networks. From a management perspective of our study region, succession age, not fragment size, and network structure should be paid more attention so as to facilitate the restoration processes of degraded forests. Rodent management should be applied to protect native forest species and exclude incursive ones from farmlands and human residences at early succession stage.

To address this problem, C. lanceolata are increasingly mixed with broadleaf Schima superba Gardn. & Champ. (Theaceae). The success of these mixed plantations relies on introducing each species in the appropriate sequence, which requires understanding how tree species respond to light variations. We therefore compared S. superba and C. lanceolata seedling light tolerance in shaded houses under five light gradients (5%, 15%, 40%, 60%, and 100% sunlight). Our findings showed that S. superba seedlings exhibited greater net height increment (Delta Ht), net diameter growth (Delta Dia), leaf area, root mass, stem mass, leaf mass, and total mass under low light conditions (15% sunlight). However, as sunlight increased, these growth variables became higher in C. lanceolata seedlings. With more sunlight, both species experienced a drop in height to diameter ratio (HDR), and specific leaf area (SLA), but an elevated root to shoot ratio. Additionally, under the same light levels, S. superba seedlings exhibited greater leaf area and root to shoot ratio than C. lanceolata seedlings. Our results suggested that S. superba might be more suitable for underplanting beneath a heavy canopy due to its shade-tolerant traits. In contrast, C. lanceolata was less shade-tolerant, having an optimum seedling growth under full sunlight. These findings suggest that underplanting S. superba seedlings in C. lanceolata monoculture plantation (i.e., underplanting regeneration approach) could be a better silvicultural alternative than simultaneously planting both seedlings.

AB As cyclonic wind storms (hurricanes and typhoons) increase in frequency and intensity with climate change, it is important to understand their effects on the populations and communities of tropical trees they impact. Using tree demographic data from four large, tropical forest dynamics plots that differ in cyclonic storm frequency, we compare tree population and community dynamics. Additionally, we assess the effect of cyclonic storms on three functional traits, specific leaf area, wood density, and tree height of the dynamic tree assemblages. Mortality, growth and recruitment rates and the intrinsic rates of population growth of species differed across the plots, and were most dynamic, especially for stems 1-2 cm in diameter, at the plot which had an intermediate level of cyclonic storm frequency. Functional assemblages of species had the greatest degree of temporal variation in relation to disturbance, as measured by the change in functional divergence for the two plots with more intermediate cyclonic storm recurrence. Therefore, cyclonic storms affecting these plots generally have a greater effect on forest composition and dynamism than comparable cyclonic storms do on the plot which experiences cyclonic storms more frequently. Thus, we provide some evidence that community-wide demographic resistance to cyclonic storms is generally lower at an intermediate frequency of storms. While cyclonic storm strength and timing are important determinants of the within forest variation in tree dynamics and functional trait assemblages, we also show that cyclonic storm timing and frequency shapes tropical forest dynamics and functional composition across forests. We conclude that, over a given time interval, sites with intermediate levels of damaging cyclonic wind disturbance express a greater potential for life-history variation in the forest community, when compared to sites with less or more frequent disturbance.

AB The landscape heterogeneity hypothesis posits that increasing variance of land cover types in agricultural landscapes will increase landscape level biodiversity. This hypothesis, however, does not detail which component of landscape structural heterogeneity, compositional (the type and amount) or configurational (the shape and arrangement) has the greatest influence on biodiversity and at what spatial scale(s). We investigated how dung beetle (Scarabaeidae) alpha-diversity responded to landscape structural heterogeneity at a variety of spatial scales in an agricultural mosaic-landscape in north-eastern Swaziland. We also compared the effect of these components to the effect of variation in the amounts of major land-cover types in the landscape and plot level vegetation structure. We used pitfall traps to sample the dung beetle community along a gradient of heterogeneity and used linear mixed effects models to compare the effect of each component on dung beetle richness and Shannon diversity at four separate spatial scales (i.e. 1-,1.5-, 2- & 3-km). Land-cover diversity and number of patches represented compositional and configurational landscape heterogeneity respectively. Landscape compositional heterogeneity was negatively correlated with dung beetle richness at the 1.5-km and 2-km spatial scales. The percentage savanna in the landscape was positively correlated with dung beetle richness at the 3-km and 2-km scales. Landscape level heterogeneity may enhance diversity of some taxonomic groups, but this was not the case for dung beetles in a southern African savanna. The best way to maintain their diversity is to create or maintain large continuous blocks of savanna while limiting intensive agriculture.

AB 1. Integrated visual displays that combine gesture with colour are nearly ubiquitous in the animal world, where they are shaped by sexual selection for their role in courtship and competition. However, few studies assess how multiple selection regimens operate on different components of these complex phenotypes on a macroevolutionary scale.
   2. Here, we study this issue by assessing how both sexual and ecological selection work together to influence visual display complexity in the birds of paradise.
   3. We first find that sexual dichromatism is highest in lekking species, which undergo more intense sexual selection by female choice, than non-lekking species. At the same time, species in which males directly compete with one another at communal display courts have more carotenoid-based ornaments and fewer melanin ornaments.
   4. Meanwhile, display habitat influences gestural complexity. Species that dance in the cluttered understorey have more complex dances than canopy-displaying species.
   5. Taken together, our results illustrate how distinct selection regimens each operate on individual elements comprising a complex display. This supports a modular model of display evolution, wherein the ultimate integrated display is the product of synergy between multiple factors that select for different types of phenotypic complexity.

AB Aim Multiple geological and climatic events have created geographical or ecological barriers associated with speciation events, playing a role in biological diversification in Mexico. Here, we evaluate the influence of Neogene geological events and of Pleistocene climate change in the diversification of the genus Gerrhonotus using molecular dating and ancestral area reconstruction.
   Location Mexico and south-central United States.
   Methods A multilocus sequence dataset was generated for 86 individuals of Gerrhonotus from most Mexican biogeographical provinces and belonging to five of the seven currently recognized species, as well as two putative undescribed species. Phylogeographical structure was explored using Poisson-Tree-Processes molecular species delimitation. Divergence events were estimated based on the fossil record using a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal clock. Ancestral areas were estimated at divergence events across the tree using a probabilistic Bayesian approach.
   Results Extensive geographical structure was evident within three well-supported clades. These clades probably diverged from each other in the early to mid-Miocene, and their divergence was followed by six divergences in the late Miocene and eight divergences in the Pliocene. The ancestral origin of Gerrhonotus with keeled dorsal scales (keeled-scale Gerrhonotus) was reconstructed to be across the Pacific Coast Province. Our phylogenetic analyses did not support the monophyly of Gerrhonotus.
   Main conclusions Miocene and Pliocene geomorphology, perhaps in conjunction with climate change, appears to have induced allopatric divergence on a relatively small spatial scale in this genus. The late Miocene-Pliocene reduction in the highlands along the Tehuantepec fault probably created a large marine embayment that led to an early divergence in a clade of Gerrhonotus. Our analysis suggests uplifting of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during this same time period resulted in additional diversification. This was followed by more recent, independent colonization events in the Pliocene from the Mexican Plateau to the Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre Occidental, Tamaulipas and Edwards Plateau provinces. A genus Gerrhonotus with the keeled-scale species in addition to Coloptychon rhombifer (= G. rhombifer) is strongly supported. Inclusion of the smooth dorsal-scale species in the genus is uncertain and maintained only tentatively.

AB 1. Evergreen broad-leaved forests are widely distributed in eastern Asia with evergreen broad-leaved (EBL) and deciduous broad-leaved (DBL) tree species coexisting under the same climatic regime, raising questions as to the underlying mechanisms. Since EBL and DBL species differ in leaf life span, a key component of resource economic strategies, their coexistence might be attributed to regeneration niche partitioning across habitats varying in resource supply.
   2. We investigated the effects of variation in insolation and topography on regeneration of EBL and DBL species in a subtropical EBL forest of eastern China after an ice storm that caused severe canopy disturbance.
   3. Using a mixed-effects modelling framework and census data from 2011 to 2014 on 8,548 wild seedlings of 123 species, we quantified habitat preferences of EBL and DBL species during post-disturbance regeneration and how their survival and height relative growth rates varied among habitats.
   4. The relative density of DBL seedlings (proportional to all seedlings) was greater in habitats with greater (canopy gaps) compared to habitats with lesser (understorey) insolation and increased with canopy gap size. However, DBL seedlings were not more frequent in higher (valleys) compared to lower (ridges) fertility habitats. Although DBL seedlings exhibited larger differences in growth between higher and lower resource habitats than EBL seedlings, their growth rates did not increase with canopy gap size. Seedlings of EBL species had high survival in all habitats, but larger DBL seedlings survived equally well on ridges. Consequently, the relative density of DBL seedlings declined in valleys, so that by 2014 it became more similar in valley and ridge habitats, whereas it remained higher in gaps than in the understorey, and especially in larger gaps.
   5. Synthesis. Specialization on contrasting topographic habitats is considered the primary mechanism mediating coexistence between deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen broad-leaved species. Our results, however, suggest this may not always be true, since seedlings of deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen broad-leaved species partitioned regeneration niches based on light more so than topography. We propose that coexistence of deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen broad-leaved species can strongly depend upon canopy disturbance to create a mosaic of habitat patches, including high light gaps favouring regeneration of deciduous broad-leaved species.

AB Theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that predators can modulate coexistence between prey species and can modify broad patterns of community structure. Although the keystone predator effect (i.e., local coexistence and species diversity mediated by predator consumption) is commonly reported, negative effects of predators on species coexistence are also common. The balance depends critically on the asymmetry of competition, predator preferences for different prey, and the effective mortality rates exerted by predator populations on prey per capita growth rates. Here we studied the role of predation on two competing mussels, the dominant competitor Perumytilus purpuratus that dominates in abundance at most shores, and the subordinate Semimytilus algosus, which is common, but persistently abundant only at a smaller set of shores. We examined the potential for keystone effects by quantifying and evaluating the patterns of mussel consumption rates of sea star (Heliaster helianthus) and crab (Acanthocyclus gayi) predators in laboratory experiments, and under natural field conditions. Field sites with contrasting mussel abundance and recruitment (i.e., different local prey population growth rates) were chosen. Laboratory experiments showed that crabs would first consume Semimytilus over Perumytilus in mixed mussel clumps, while the larger sea star predators made no distinction between mussel species. Regardless of the order in which mussel species were first ingested, consumption rates of the two mussel species through the experiment were not different for either predator species. A similar temporal pattern was partly observable in the field through specific differences in the order of mussel consumption; however, experimental mussels of both species where consumed after the first two months of exposure to predators at both sites. Thus, in this system predation could not foster coexistence between mussel species and it may instead favor the occurrence of local extinction of the subordinate competitor, especially at sites where the smaller and more selective crab predators are relatively more abundant and recruitment of the subordinate species is low. Existing patterns of locally abundant Semimytilus beds are probably related to high site-specific recruitment rates of this species and should be further explored.

AB Forest fires pose an important threat to tropical rain-forest biodiversity. In the present study, we assessed ground layer (herb and shrub) communities in six differentially disturbed landscape plots in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, including primary and logged forest and once-, twice- and frequently-burnt forest. Overall, we recorded 175 species of herbs and shrubs; richness was highest in twice-burnt forest and lowest in logged forest. Vegetation and topographical variables including the percentage of the plot burnt and tree abundance were significant predictors of variation in composition. The main compositional gradient showed a clear distinction between subplots in unburnt versus burnt forest. A subset of subplots in burnt forest, however, clustered together with subplots from unburnt forest. These plots were located in a network of relatively unscathed forest along floodplains that persisted in the burnt-forest matrix. Small plant species associated with unburnt forest included several species of Dryopteridaceae, Marantaceae and Rubiaceae. Species associated with once- and twice-burnt forest included Mikania scandens (Compositae), Microlepia speluncae (Dennstaedtiaceae), Nephrolepis cf. biserrata (Nephrolepidaceae), Lygodium microphyllum (Schizaeaceae) and Hornstedtia cf. reticulata (Zingiberaceae). The frequently-burnt landscape plot was characterized by a high cover of the grass species Imperata cylindrica and the invasive exotic shrub Chromolaena odorata. Importantly, these species and other exotics had also invaded the once- and twice-burnt forest and represent a potential threat to forest recovery.

AB Savannas are highly variable systems, and predicting variation, especially in the tree layer, represents a major unresolved challenge for forecasting biosphere responses to global change. Prediction to date has focused on disentangling interactions between resource limitation and chronic disturbances to identify what determines local savanna vegetation heterogeneity. By focusing at too fine a scale, this approach overlooks: sample size limitation arising from sparse tree distributions; stochasticity in demographic and environmental processes that is preserved as heterogeneity among tree populations with slow dynamics; and spatial self-organization. Renewed focus on large (1-50ha) permanent plots and on spatial patterns of tree-layer variability at even larger landscape spatial scales (>= 1000s of ha) promises to resolve these limitations, consistent with the goal of predicting large-scale biosphere responses to global change.

AB Anthropogenic habitat disturbance has potential consequences for ant communities. However, there is limited information on the effects of ant responses on associated ecological processes such as seed dispersal. We investigated the effect of disturbance on the abundance, richness, and composition of ant communities and the resulting seed-dispersal services for a herbaceous myrmecochore, Corydalis giraldii (Papaveraceae), in an undisturbed habitat (forest understory), moderately disturbed habitat (abandoned arable field), and highly disturbed habitat (road verge) on Qinling Mountains, China. In total, we recorded 13 ant species, and five out of these were observed to transport seeds. The community composition of dispersers was significantly different amongst habitats. The richness of the dispersers did not differ among the habitats, but their total abundance varied significantly across habitats and was 21% lower in the road verge than in the abandoned arable fields. The major seed-dispersing ant species in both the forest understory and the abandoned arable field were large-bodied (Myrmica sp. and Formica fusca, respectively), whereas the major seed-dispersing ants found in the road verge were the small-bodied Lasius alienus. This difference resulted in lower seed removal rates and dispersal distances in the road verge than in the other two habitats. The different dispersal patterns were attributed primarily to differences in dispersing ant abundance and identity, most likely in response to habitats with different degree of anthropogenic disturbance. The possible influence of disturbance on the ecological specialization of ant-seed dispersal interaction is also discussed.

AB Seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) is one of the best parameters for estimating the benefit that a plant obtains from a dispersal agent. SDE includes quantitative and qualitative components. Previous avian studies of SDE estimation have been conducted mainly in temperate shrub lands or in tropical forests; data are limited for temperate forests, especially, the quality of seed-deposition sites. In this study, we estimated the SDE of birds for Wild Cherry Cerasus jamasakura and Giant Dogwood Cornus controversa fruits in a temperate Japanese forest. These trees prefer sunny sites so we focused on the light conditions at seed-deposition sites and categorized three microhabitat types: forest-gap, forest-edge, and forest-interior. We observed avian seed removal at fruiting trees, conducted a bird census to estimate microhabitat selectivity and collected bird-dispersed seeds. We then counted seedling emergence. Finally, we constructed generalized linear mixed models that combined bird census and dispersed seed data to identify influential seed disperser(s) for each tree species. Frugivorous behavior was recorded for eight avian species for C. jamasakura and 12 for C. controversa. Of these birds, one for the former, and two for the latter preferentially selected forest-gap or forest-edge trees during each fruiting period. The density of dispersed seeds and seedlings was higher in the forest-gap or forest-edge. Additionally, the frequency with which Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus visited was a significant variable for seed density in each micro habitat. The results suggested that microhabitat selectivity may affect the density of dispersed seeds in each microhabitat. Furthermore, a bird with a high quantitative SDE may not necessarily also have a high qualitative SDE. Thus, it is important to estimate qualitative and quantitative SDE by focusing especially on the seed-deposition site for each bird in order to evaluate the actual SDE in temperate forests.

AB Watershed management is critical for the sustainable supply of clean water to urban centers, particularly in areas of developing countries where large-scale infrastructure projects are costly to implement. In this paper, we discuss the potential for financing improvements in watershed services in the foothills of the Himalayas through Payments for Ecosystem Services. Through the use of a choice experiment to disentangle household preferences, we show that downstream water users are interested in improvements in water quality through source water protection. Households in Dharan municipality are willing to finance watershed management to the extent of USD 118,000 per year. These payments can be used to incentivize upstream households to decrease domestic livestock grazing, change agricultural practices and reduce open defecation to improve the drinking water quality and quantity in downstream areas. The estimated cost of these activities is less than $50,000 per year. Through discussions with local stakeholders, we propose a tri-partite institutional structure to facilitate transactions between downstream and upstream communities and to improve watershed services.

AB The Atlantic Forest is a Neotropical biome encompassing mainly Brazil's coastline and parts of Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina, but today surviving largely in small degraded patches and protected areas. Being a region under threat of extinction of its biological components, little is known about how climate change could influence the biodiversity, dynamics, and stability of this ecosystem. Here, we analyze the response of tree-growth dynamics to regional climate variability and drought, both in temporal and spatial scale. For this purpose, five Cedrela spp forest sites located in the biogeographic region 'Serra do Mar' (AFSM) in southeastern Brazil was considered. This region contains the best-preserved secondary forests of the Atlantic Forest biome, a fact that represents a natural laboratory to ascertain the environmental influence on the tree development through large spatial scales. Correlation and regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between growth and rainfall, air temperature, and a drought index. Results indicate that tree growth performance is highly dependent to the dry season rainfall amounts in the most humid sector of the gradient, while sites settled in areas of lower summer temperatures, rainfall during the warm-rainy season is the main determining factor influencing tree-growth dynamics. This implies that the same environmental factor (rainfall) affect differentially the growth of Cedrela sites depending on the sector in the gradient in which they are. We found that the population located at the highest-altitude site experienced a growth decline in recent decades linked to increases of winter regional warming, being more sensitivity to long periods of drought (6-10 years). In summary, the seasonal response of cambium activity in AFSM trees to rainfall varies across a climatic gradient. These results are crucial to understand how the present and future global change may differentially impact on tree population dynamics of montane Neotropical forests. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Rubber plantations have expanded at an unprecedented rate in Southeast Asia in recent decades. This has led to a substantial decline in the supply of ecosystem services (ESS) and has reduced livelihood options and socioeconomic well-being in rural areas. We assessed the impact of two land use scenarios on the supply of ESS in a mountainous watershed in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, People's Republic of China. We combined time-series data derived from spatially explicit ESS models (InVEST) with a sequential, data-driven algorithm (R-method) to identify potential tipping points (TPs) in the supply of ESS under two rubber plantation expansion scenarios. TPs were defined as any situation in which the state of a system is changed through positive feedback as a result of accelerating changes. The TP analysis included hydrological, agronomical, and climate-regulation ESS, as well as multiple facets of biodiversity (habitat quality for vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant species). We identified regime shifts indicating potential tipping points, which were linked to abrupt changes in rubber yields, in both scenarios at varying spatial scales. With this study, we provide an easily applicable method for regional policy making and land use planning in data-scarce environments to reduce the risk of traversing future TPs in ESS supply for rubber producing land use systems.

AB During a taxonomic treatment of Connarus L. (Connaraceae) in the Brazilian Amazon, two new species of the genus were identified: Connarus manausensis and Connarus ramiflorus. Descriptions and illustrations of the new taxa are provided, including information on their habitat, distribution, and phenology, along with a key to recognize the species of Connarus occurring in the Brazilian Amazon. The new species have only been found in single locations of Amazonas state (Brazil), but our hypothesis is that their distribution is poorly understood due to the scarcity of botanical data in the study area.

AB QuestionsDensity-dependent processes may promote species diversity in plant communities. Here, we tested whether seedling survival was density-dependent and varied by seedling size, species and climatic factors.
   LocationTropical rain forest, Xishuangbanna, southwest China.
   MethodsGeneralized linear mixed-effects models were used to examine seedling survival (232 tree species) across 9years of seedling census data from a 20-ha tropical forest dynamics plot. Our predictor variables were conspecific and heterospecific neighbour density, size of the seedling and annual variation in climatic factors.
   ResultsWe found significant negative effects of conspecific tree density, but positive effects of heterospecific seedling density on the survival of tree seedlings in this plot. In general, conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) was observed most frequently for large size classes of seedlings (20-cm high), while heterospecific positive density dependence (HPDD) was similar at all size classes. CNDD for large seedlings was stronger during warm years, and HPDD for large seedlings was stronger during dry years.
   ConclusionsOur study suggests that the strength of density dependence varied through time, and this strength was influenced by water availability and temperature. Our results highlight the potential for changes in species composition and species co-existence that could result from increasing temperature-strengthening CNDD effects and decreasing precipitation strengthening HPDD effects.

AB QuestionsWhat drives canopy gap formation in regenerating coastal dune forest? Does canopy gap size frequency distribution differ between new and old-growth forests? Can canopy gaps divert regenerating trajectories?
   LocationRehabilitating coastal dune forest, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
   MethodsWe mapped canopy gaps in regenerating dune forest patches of varying age, which develop after seeding of the pioneer Vachellia kosiensis, and a reference forest by means of unsupervised classification of multi-spectral satellite images. We tested if gap formation can be explained by abiotic (exposure to winds) and/or biotic (tree density at early stages) variables. We calculated the scaling exponent of a power-law model to quantify if gap size frequency differed between new and old-growth forests. Finally, we measured canopy openness, tree height and number of stems to validate canopy gap classification and assess the consequences of canopy gaps on regenerating trajectories.
   ResultsExposure to winds and tree density at early stages were both significant predictors of gap presence. Gaps were more likely to be present along dune ridges and areas with low tree density than valleys and areas with high tree density at early stages. Large gaps were common in both new and old-growth forests. The scaling exponent was positively related to regeneration age, indicating a reduction in gap size as the forest aged. Areas with open canopies had shorter individual trees that were more likely to be multi-stemmed than areas with closed canopies.
   ConclusionCanopy gaps are an important component of new and old-growth coastal dune forests dynamics. Although gaps are filled during forest development, changes in individual life-history strategies and morphology may alter regeneration trajectories. However, because their effect is partly controlled by the exposure to wind and tree density at early stages, it can also be manipulated by management to ensure nucleation, which could accelerate forest recovery.

AB Smaller-seeded tree species often require mineral soil and coarse woody debris (CWD) to establish. Limited data suggest that species-based variation in tree seedling-CWD relations exists; however, the generalizability of this pattern and its mechanistic basis remain unknown. We investigated interspecific substrate-seedling relations and the potential that differences in mycorrhizal status and substrate nutrition underlie these patterns with a potted plant experiment. Eight temperate tree species were grown in a lath shade house on six species of CWD and mineral soil that had either been sterilized with gamma irradiation or left untreated to separate the effects of mycorrhizae from substrate nutrition. We assessed the impact of substrate identity on height growth and investigated possible mechanisms via relating growth to substrate inorganic N concentration, seedling foliar N (%), and mycorrhizal colonization. Seedling height varied across substrates consistently among species (i.e., substrate effects were strong, but seedling species x substrate interactions were weak). Seedlings were generally tallest on mineral soil followed by Betula papyrifera and Thuja occidentalis CWD, and shortest on B. alleghaniensis or Acer saccharum CWD. Sterilization main effects on height were not significant; however, the response of species to sterilization varied, as Acer rubrum and T occidentalis seedlings were significantly shorter on sterilized substrate. For all seedling species, growth correlated positively with substrate [N] and foliar N. Among the four species examined for mycorrhizae, root colonization density was highest on mineral soil and lowest on A. saccharum and B. alleghaniensis CWD). For these species, mean colonization density was more strongly associated with mean seedling height than substrate inorganic [N]. Beneficial mycorrhizal effects were suggested by positive height-mycorrhizal root density relationships for B. alleghaniensis, A. rubrum, and T. occidentalis. Collectively, for the group of northern hardwood tree species examined in this study, these results demonstrate that in a controlled environment, most species grow best on mineral soil, B. alleghaniensis and Picea glauca attained maximum growth on CWD, species-specific growth responses occur on CWD, and that substrate nutrient availability and mycorrhizal fungi contribute to the variation observed in seedling growth response across substrates.

AB Forest fragmentation, a result of deforestation, not only decreases the amount of habitat available for wildlife, but also increases the isolation of the remaining fragments and the area of edges surrounding them. Also, deforestation often leads to the creation of a dynamic regenerating matrix where cleared land is subsequently abandoned. Here we examine the effects of fragmentation and landscape change on the nutritional condition of Amazonian rainforest birds at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil. We analyzed ptilochronology-based measurements of feather growth rate in 12 species living in fragments within a dynamic landscape over 21 years. Ptilochronology serves as an index of nutritional condition by revealing energy available for maintenance over 1-2 weeks while the feather is grown, allowing intraspecific comparison across treatments. Feather growth rate decreased in fragments surrounded by young second-growth borders but increased as fragment size and age of adjacent second-growth vegetation increased. Results from this simple, yet informative, measure of nutritional condition reveal physiological impacts of land cover change, including the response of birds to changes occurring at both local and landscape levels. Our results highlight the importance of looking beyond presence/absence data to describe fragmentation effects, and support the value of landscape-scale approaches for the conservation of tropical forest biodiversity.

AB The Sao Francisco River basin is one of the most drought-prone regions of Brazil. Seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) are widely distributed in the basin and we developed a short chronology of Cedrela fissilis annual ring widths from SDTF fragments based on 89 cores from 44 trees dating from 1961 to 2015. The average correlation among all radii (RBAR) is 0.52. The tree-ring chronology is correlated with wet season precipitation totals, must strongly and consistently near the beginning of the wet season. The spatial pattern of correlation covers most of the southern portion of the Brazilian Drought Polygon and the sub-basins of the two largest tributaries of the Sao Francisco River, in some areas exceeding r = 0.60. The chronology is also correlated with total annual discharge of the Rio Sao Francisco River measured at Barra (r = 0.489; 1961-2015), which is very promising in a country that generates two thirds of its electricity from hydroelectric power plants, particularly if this short chronology can be extended with trees exceeding 150-years old known to still exist in the region.

AB After forest governance reforms by the Brazilian government, Amazon deforestation rates dropped by almost 80% between 2004 and 2012. Since then, however, deforestation has slowly increased again, casting doubts on the long-term sustainability of past conservation policy achievements. Clearly, deforestation rates and the associated local drivers of land-use and land-cover change differ considerably across the region, and adapting public policies to dynamic local contexts and actor constellations remains a major challenge for decision-makers. This paper seeks to contribute to the related science-policy debate by applying frontier theory insights to map, quantify, and compare land-cover dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004 and 2015. Our theoretical framework performs well in explaining broad variations in scope, nature, and agents of land-use and land-cover change across different frontier regions. We observe two types of transformative processes at deforestation frontiers in the Amazonian context. First, recent frontier development is characterized by an intensification of cattle ranching, and an increasing share of agricultural activities in the production portfolio, which could be the result of better access to modern technologies and markets, combined with forest governance induced scarcity of land for expansion of historically dominant extensive pasture systems. Second, the share of medium and large-scale deforestation declines at first, but rebounds during the observation period in all frontier types after 2012. Further research is needed to better understand the role of the changing political environment in driving these medium and short-term transformations in land-use and land-cover change. Furthermore, policy-makers, international cooperation, and civil society must seek strong integration between value chain based governance measures and effective environmental law enforcement.

AB Regeneration of secondary forests on previously deforested or degraded land is one of the most dominant forms of land-use change in the tropics. However, the response of animal communities to forest regeneration is poorly understood. To evaluate support for thermal quality as a mechanism driving reptile species distributions during secondary forest succession, we measured operative temperatures and occupancy in three successional forest stages (pasture, secondary forest, and old growth forest) for two anole species common in the landscape (Norops humilis and Norops limifrons). We then measured thermal preference in laboratory experiments and used operative temperature and temperature preference measurements to determine how thermal quality of habitat changes over the course of secondary forest succession, and if occupancy varies as a function of thermal quality. We found that thermal quality was lowest in pasture habitat because of a large frequency of temperatures above the thermal preference range. However, in low thermal quality pasture sites, riparian habitats and remnant trees provided a thermal refuge for both lizard species. Our results support thermal quality as a mechanism for reptile species distributions in altered landscapes and highlight the importance of the maintenance of riparian corridors.

AB The functional trait approach has, as a central tenet, that plant traits are functional and shape individual performance, but this has rarely been tested in the field. Here, we tested the individual-based trait approach in a hyperdiverse Amazonian tropical rainforest and evaluated intraspecific variation in trait values, plant strategies at the individual level, and whether traits are functional and predict individual performance.
   We evaluated > 1300 tree saplings belonging to > 383 species, measured 25 traits related to growth and defense, and evaluated the effects of environmental conditions, plant size, and traits on stem growth.
   A total of 44% of the trait variation was observed within species, indicating a strong potential for acclimation. Individuals showed two strategy spectra, related to tissue toughness and organ size vs leaf display. In this nutrient- and light-limited forest, traits measured at the individual level were surprisingly poor predictors of individual growth performance because of convergence of traits and growth rates.
   Functional trait approaches based on individuals or species are conceptually fundamentally different: the species-based approach focuses on the potential and the individual-based approach on the realized traits and growth rates. Counterintuitively, the individual approach leads to a poor prediction of individual performance, although it provides a more realistic view on community dynamics.

AB American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was a dominant species in eastern North America prior to the importation of chestnut blight. In light of recent efforts to restore viable populations of chestnut in eastern forests, an increased understanding of its association with other co-occurring, disturbance-adapted oak species is necessary. We evaluated crown architecture and leaf morphology in juvenile chestnut and red oak (Quercus rubra) to assess potential differences in establishment strategies of both species. We also investigated differences in nonstructural carbohydrate reserves and whole tree biomass partitioning between species. Seedlings of both species were planted in forest stands treated either with midstory removal or small patch cuts, simulating potential restoration plantings. After 5-7years, chestnut's allocation to its root system was lower than red oak's, with chestnut saplings instead diverting resources to branches and foliage. Chestnut had lower leaf area index, greater crown projection area, and higher specific leaf area than red oak, indicating the species may have an advantage in shaded understories. There were only minor differences in nonstructural root carbohydrate reserves, between red oak and American chestnut, indicating that chestnut may respond similarly to oak by resprouting after disturbances topkill young saplings. We suggest that American chestnut has morphological and physiological attributes that allow it to function as an opportunistic and plastic species that can utilize gaps to facilitate its canopy recruitment, yet still persist after occasional surface fire. This knowledge can guide restoration strategies for this iconic species of the eastern temperate forest region.

AB Biofuel feedstock production can be a significant driver of landscape modification, ecosystem change and biodiversity loss. There is growing body of literature that shows how biofuel landscapes provide various ecosystem services (e.g., feedstock for fuel, carbon sequestration) and compromise other ecosystem services (e.g., food, freshwater services). These effects are context-specific and depend largely on prior land use conditions and feedstock production practices. Changes in the flow of ecosystem services due to the conversion of natural and agricultural areas can have ripple effects on human wellbeing. Despite some recent attempts to apply to biofuel settings concepts and methods rooted in the ecosystem services literature, this is the exception rather than the rule within both the biofuel and the ecosystem services research communities. This paper synthesizes the current knowledge about the impact of biofuels on ecosystem services. It focuses especially on the feedstock production phase and outlines the main mechanisms through which landscape conversion affects the provisions of ecosystem services. It proposes conceptually coherent indicators to reflect these mechanisms and offers a critical discussion of key issues at the interface of biofuels and ecosystem services.

AB Montane tropical cloud forests, with their complex topography, biodiversity, high numbers of endemic species, and rapid rates of clearing, are a top global conservation priority. However, species distributions at local and landscape scales in cloud forests are still poorly understood, in part because few regions have been surveyed. Empirical work has focused on species distributions along elevation gradients, but spatial variation among forests at the same elevation is less commonly investigated. In this study, the first to compare tree communities across multiple Andean cloud forests at similar elevations, we surveyed trees in five ridge-top forest reserves at the upper end of the mid-elevation diversity bulge' (1900-2250 masl) in the Intag Valley, a heavily deforested region in the Ecuadorian Andes. We found that tree communities were distinct in reserves located as close as 10 to 35km apart, and that spatially closer forests were not more similar to one another. Although larger (1500 to 6880ha), more intact forests contained significantly more tree species (108-120 species/0.1ha) than smaller (30 to 780ha) ones (56-87 species/0.1ha), each reserve had unique combinations of more common species, and contained high proportions of species not found in the others. Results thus suggest that protecting multiple cloud forest patches within this narrow elevational band is essential to conserve landscape-level tree diversity, and that even small forest reserves contribute significantly to biodiversity conservation. These findings can be applied to create management plans to conserve and restore cloud forests in the Andes and tropical montane cloud forests elsewhere.
   RESUMEN Los bosques nublados tropicales montanos, con su compleja topografia, biodiversidad, alto numero de especies endemicas, y altas tasas de tala de bosque son una prioridad de conservacion global. Sin embrago, la distribucion de especies a escala local y de paisaje en bosques nublados es aun pobremente entendida, en parte porque pocas regiones han sido muestreadas. Estudios empiricos se han enfocado en la distribucion de especies a lo largo de gradientes altitudinales, pero la variacion espacial entre bosques ubicados a la misma elevacion ha sido comunmente menos investigada. En este estudio, el primero en comparar comunidades de arboles a lo largo de multiples bosques nublados Andinos en elevaciones similares, muestreamos arboles en cinco reservas de bosque de cresta de montana en el limite superior del pico de diversidad de elevaciones intermedias (mid-elevation diversity bulge') (1900-2250m.s.n.m.) en el Valle de Intag, una region altamente deforestada en los Andes ecuatorianos. Encontramos que las comunidades de arboles fueron distintas en reservas tan cercanas como de 10 a 35km de distancia entre si, y que bosques espacialmente mas cercanos no fueron mas similares entre ellos. Aunque bosques extensos mas intactos contuvieron significativamente mas especies de arboles (108-120 especies/0.1ha) que los de menor tamano (56-87 especies/0.1ha), cada reserva tuvo una combinacion unica de especies comunes, y una alta proporcion de especies no encontradas en las otras reservas. Los resultados sugieren que proteger multiples parches de bosque nublado dentro de este estrecho rango altitudinal es esencial para conservar la diversidad de arboles a escala de paisaje, y que aun pequenas reservas de bosque contribuyen significativamente a la conservacion de la biodiversidad. Estos resultados se pueden aplicar para la creacion de planes de manejo para conservacion y restauracion del bosque nublado en los Andes y bosques tropicales montanos en otros sitios.

FX Situated knowledge specific to mountain environments played a key role
   in developing this study (Nazarea 2006). Hiking through our forests,
   Ecuadorian botanist Miguel Angel Chinchero, who has over ten years
   experience identifying cloud forest trees and recognizes most species on
   sight, noticed that the dominant tree communities differed markedly
   between forest sites. Distant sites, in some cases, were more similar
   than neighboring ones. He made these observations throughout the forest
   reserves, beyond the area sampled using transects, and his observations
   were the inspiration for more extensive study. The data we collected and
   our analyses here correlate highly with his initial observations in the

AB Selective logging in tropical rain forests may promote population growth of invasive plants. The ability of invaders to respond, specifically in reproductive traits, to increase in resource abundance may allow them to increase their presence in the seed rain of recipient communities. The invasive pioneer tree Bellucia pentamera (Melastomataceae) is currently spreading within Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The park has also experienced periods of illegal, small-scale, selective logging that seem to have facilitated population growth and spread of this invader. We first used fruiting frequency as a proxy for fruit output to make comparisons between B.pentamera and the native tree community of over 200 genera. We then constructed two Generalized Linear Autoregressive Moving Average (GLARMA) models using 13months of phenology data to predict both fruiting frequency and crop size of B. pentamera under selective logging versus natural treefall disturbance regimes. Bellucia pentamera fruited at considerably higher frequency than all 200 native genera considered. This invader also responded positively to selective logging with both odds of being in fruit and crop sizes at least doubling in logged plots. Prolific seed output of B.pentamera is especially problematic within the lottery competition of tropical rain forest gap tree communities, in which prominence in the seed rain is particularly important. Furthermore, the reproductive response of B.pentamera to selective logging suggests that this harvesting practice may have a considerable role in facilitating this invasion in Southeast Asia.

AB Recent work suggests that plant size affects light requirements and carbon balance of juvenile trees, and such shifts may be greater in light-demanding species than in their more shade-tolerant associates. To explore the physiological basis of such shifts, we measured juvenile light interception, carbon gain and growth of four subtropical Australian rainforest trees differing in shade tolerance, comparing individuals ranging from 13 to 238 cm in height, across a wide range of understory environments. We hypothesized that even in a standardized light environment, increasing sapling size would lead to declines in net daily carbon gain of foliage and relative growth rates (RGR) of all species, with declines more pronounced in light-demanding species. Crown architecture of individuals was recorded using a 3-dimensional digitizer, and the YPLANT program was used to estimate the self-shaded fraction of each crown and model net carbon gain. Increased sapling size caused a significant increase in self-shading, and significant declines in net daily carbon gain and RGR of light-demanding species, while such ontogenetic variations were minimal or absent in shade-tolerant species. Additionally, differences in the slope of the relationship between light and RGR led to crossovers in RGR among shade-tolerant and light-demanding species at low light. Our results show that the magnitude of ontogenetic variation in net daily carbon gain and RGR can be substantial and may depend on successional status, making it unsafe to assume that young seedling performance can be used to predict or model responses of larger juvenile trees.

AB Wood density (WD) is believed to be a key trait in driving growth strategies of tropical forest species, and as it entails the amount of mass per volume of wood, it also tends to correlate with forest carbon stocks. Yet there is relatively little information on how interspecific variation in WD correlates with biomass dynamics at the species and population level. We determined changes in biomass in permanent plots in a logged forest in Vietnam from 2004 to 2012, a period representing the last 8 years of a 30 years logging cycle. We measured diameter at breast height (DBH) and estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) growth, mortality, and net AGB increment (the difference between AGB gains and losses through growth and mortality) per species at the individual and population (i.e. corrected for species abundance) level, and correlated these with WD. At the population level, mean net AGB increment rates were 6.47 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) resulting from a mean AGB growth of 8.30 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), AGB recruitment of 0.67 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) and AGB losses through mortality of 2.50 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Across species there was a negative relationship between WD and mortality rate, WD and DBH growth rate, and a positive relationship between WD and tree standing biomass. Standing biomass in turn was positively related to AGB growth, and net AGB increment both at the individual and population level. Our findings support the view that high wood density species contribute more to total biomass and indirectly to biomass increment than low wood density species in tropical forests. Maintaining high wood density species thus has potential to increase biomass recovery and carbon sequestration after logging.

AB Terra firme forests make up more than three quarters of the western Amazon basin and are often considered functionally homogeneous in regional scale mapping and modelling efforts. However, the landforms underlying these systems are subject to dynamic processes of landscape evolution occurring within an otherwise geomorphically stable terrace formation. These processes may introduce systematic variability in local nutrient status of terra firme ecosystems. We utilised high-resolution airborne topographic and imaging spectroscopy data, with directed field soil surveys, to reveal that active stream incision and patterns of soil rock derived nutrient availability drive foliar canopy chemistry distributions across seven catchments within a single terrace formation. These results strongly suggest that fine-scale geomorphic processes directly affect biogeochemical cycles throughout the lowland western Amazon. Furthermore, links between landscape evolution and foliar chemical distributions indicate that geomorphic processes drive the fine-scale spatial organisation of this tropical ecosystem, with implications for the functional assembly and biogeography of Amazonian forests.

AB Ecological processes are centered to water availability in drylands; however, less known nutrient stoichiometry can help explain much of their structure and ecological interactions. Here we look to the foliar stoichiometry of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) of 38 dominant plant species from the Sonoran Desert, grouped in four different functional types to describe ecological characteristics and processes. We found that foliar N, C:N, C:P, and N:P stoichiometric ratios, but not P, were higher than those known to most other ecosystems and indicate P but not N limitations in leaves. Biological N fixers (BNF) had even higher leaf N concentrations, but bio-elemental concentrations and stoichiometry ratios were not different to other non-N-fixing legume species which underscores the need to understand the physiological mechanisms for high N, and to how costly BNF can succeed in P-limiting drylands environments. Stoichiometry ratios, and to lesser extent elemental concentrations, were able to characterize BNF and colonizing strategies in the Sonoran Desert, as well as explain leaf attribute differences, ecological processes, and biogeochemical niches in this dryland ecosystem, even when no direct reference is made to other water-limitation strategies.

AB This review aims to draw the attention of researchers, ecologists and farmers to the threats of soil-dwelling insect pests on important tree crops in sub-Saharan Africa, with a special focus on termites. It synthesizes the information on the effects of various factors affecting soil pest occurrence and damage, suggesting that the resultant undesirable effects of soil pests in this region are largely as a result of indiscriminate tree cutting, slash-and-burn agriculture and indiscriminate use of pesticides. Major insect orders, their host ranges and the nature of damage on selected tree crops are described. This study further critiques existing soil pest management practices, showing that majority of soil pest management practices are ineffective. Thus, management strategies like attract and kill approach based on entomopathogenic fungi need to be studied, developed and emphasized for the management of soil insect pests in sub-Saharan Africa. A conclusion section attempts to offer suggestions for ways in which future work on soil pests in sub-Saharan Africa could proceed.

AB Tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the Neotropics and climatic projections suggest that frequency and duration of drought episodes could increase and threaten them even more. The aim of this study was to: 1) evaluate germination success under different water soil conditions, 2) analyze seedling survival and transpiration rate under prolonged water shortage and 3) measure gas exchange to determine the photosynthetic metabolism (CAM vs. C3) at seedling stage on three common cactus species, Acanthocereus tetragonus, Melocactus curvispinus and Stenocereus griseus, at Tatacoa, a tropical dry forest remnant in Colombia. Seed germination decreased as soil water potential decreased for all species. At seedling stage, all species have a strict water regulation strategy, showing low transpiration rate even when well-watered. This water saving strategy could explain the 100% seedling survival observed in all species during 6 months of water deprivation. All species had nocturnal CO2 fixation, consistent with them being CAM, but S. griseus presented also C-3 behavior as it was growing up. Our findings indicate that all species can withstand water deprivation for eight months, and only under prolonged drought scenarios, recruitment may be reduced because of a decrease in germination and seedling survival.

AB Comprehensive approaches integrating ecological and socio-economic objectives are fundamental pillars in the design of more sustainable agroecosystems. To this purpose, we formulated an optimization model aimed to support decisions behind the planning of agricultural ecosystems. We demonstrate the proposed approach onto the design agroecosystems aimed at the regeneration of deforested lands in the Peruvian Amazon to investigate how the different objectives influence the species composition and the overall sustainability performance. The model incorporates the three dimensions of sustainability into the optimization objectives, i.e., annual income (economic dimension), species diversity (environmental dimension), and income stability (social dimension). The obtained results show, firstly, relevant tradeoffs between the economic objective and the social and ecological ones, with significant reductions in short term incomes in the agroecosystems with the highest levels of diversity. Secondly, the species compositions changes over time depending on the life cycle of selected species and following ecological succession paths. Finally, species diversity also determines heterogeneous ecological structures, and these are jointly good premises for ecosystem multi-functionality. We highlighted major methodological challenges for the planning of more sustainable agroecosystems, which are mainly linked to the conflict and trade-off analysis, long-term assessment, non steady-state solutions, and lack of data. Despite these challenges, the formulated optimization framework can quantitatively support the understanding and the pursuing of both the ecological conservation and the productivity of agroecosystems, and put the basis for future more detailed models.

AB Little is known about the mechanisms promoting or limiting the coexistence of functionally divergent species in hyperdiverse tropical tree genera. Density-dependent enemy attacks have been proposed to be a major driver for the local coexistence of chemically divergent congeneric species. At the same time, we expect local soil conditions to favor the coexistence of species sharing similar functional traits related to resource use strategies, while environmental heterogeneity would promote the diversity of these traits at both local and large spatial scales. To test how these traits mediate species coexistence, we used functional trait data for 29 species from the tree genus Protium (Burseraceae), collected in 19 plots (2 ha each) in the Peruvian Amazon. We characterized the presence-absence of 189 plant secondary metabolites (SM) for 27 of these species, and 14 functional traits associated with resource use strategies (RUT) for 16 species. Based on these data, we found that SM were significantly more dissimilar than null expectations for species co-occurring within plots, whereas RUT were significantly more similar. These results were consistent with the hypothesis that density-dependent enemy attacks contribute to the local coexistence of congeneric species displaying divergent chemical defenses, whereas local habitat conditions filter species with similar RUT. Using measurements of nine soil properties in each plot, we also found a significant turnover of RUT traits with increasing dissimilarity of soil texture and nutrient availabilities, providing support for the hypothesis that soil heterogeneity maintains functional diversity at larger spatial scales (from 500 m up to ca. 200 km) in Protium communities. Our study provides new evidence suggesting that density-dependent enemy attacks and soil heterogeneity both contribute to maintaining high species richness in diverse tropical forests.

AB Spatial and temporal information on the structural and chemical properties of tropical forest canopies are key to understanding ecosystem processes. However, such information is usually limited to field studies performed at the plot level (similar to 1 ha). The combination of imaging spectroscopy with physically based radiative transfer (RT) models holds great promise for generalizing and extrapolating insights from plot-based studies to whole landscapes. Here, we tested the capacity of a simplified 3D RT approach to retrieve the structural and chemical traits of individual tree crowns (ITCs) from a highly diverse tropical forest. We first produced two datasets called measured and simulated. The measured dataset was composed of ITC reflectance extracted from sunlit imaging spectroscopy pixels. The simulated dataset was produced using a look-up-table approach and the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model. We then compared the simulated and measured reflectances of ITCs in terms of shape difference by computing the spectral angle. The results showed small disagreements between the simulated and measured reflectances. Such differences impacted neither the spectral variability nor the spectral regions recognized as useful for species discrimination, showing that the spectral angle was a suitable measure of spectral similarity. Simulation robustness was assessed by comparing model parameters obtained by inversion to imaging spectroscopy vegetation indices and the proportion of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green photosynthetic vegetation (GV) and shade estimated within ITCs. DART canopy structural parameters were related to NPV (R-2 = 0.71), GV (R-2 = 0.78) and shade (R-2 = 0.55). DART canopy foliar parameters such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were related to the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI (R-2 = 0.80) indices and the simple ratio between reflectances at 515 nm and 570 nm (R-515/R-570) (R-2 = 0.54), respectively. Species-related differences in NPV, GV and shade were explained by variations in crown architectural characteristics. The simulation framework employed in this study can be applied to retrieve structural and chemical traits of ITCs from other areas in which high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data are available.

The subfamilies, genera, and species are listed in alphabetical order. For each species, synonymous names and the geographical distribution by country is provided. The most diversified subfamily is Megalopodinae with 480 species and 24 genera. The Neotropical biogeographic region has the highest diversity of Megalopodidae, followed by the Ethiopian region. The knowledge of Megalopodidae is limited, and is remarkably biased by country. A significant increase in geographic and taxonomic information is needed in order to fill these knowledge gaps. The following taxonomic and nomenclatural changes are proposed: 1) type species are designated for the genera Macrolopha Weise and Falsomegalopus Pic. 2) Zeugophora novobicolor Rodriguez-Miron is proposed as new replacement name of Zeugophora bicolor. 3) The following taxa are reinstated in the genera Temnaspis: T. speciosus Baly, T. arida Westwood, and T. nigriceps Baly. 4) Falsotemnaspis luteimembris Pic is proposed as new synonym (= F. lacordairei (Westwood)). 5) The next new combinations are proposed: Macrolopha bicolor (Jacoby), M. carinata (Bryant), M. centromaculata (Jacoby), M. costatipennis (Pic), M. dollmani (Bryant), M. hargreavesi (Bryan), M. mashuana (Jacoby), M. murrayi (Baly), M. neavei (Bryant), M. nyassae (Bryant), M. suturalis (Clavareau), M. variabilis (Westwood), M. aeneipennis (Weise), M. notaticollis (Pic), M. parvula (Weswood), M. theresae (Pic), M. tricoloripes (Pic) and Falsotemnaspis lacordairei (Westwood).

AB Negative conspecific density dependence is one of the principal mechanisms affecting plant performance and community spatial patterns. Although many studies identified the prevalence of density dependent effects in various vegetation types by analyzing conspecific spatial dispersal patterns (spatial patterning) of forest trees, interactions between individuals and heterospecific neighboring trees caused by density-dependent effects are often neglected. The effects of negative density dependence lead us to expect that neighbourhood species segregation would increase with increasing tree size and that larger trees would be surrounded by more heterospecific neighbours than would smaller trees. We studied four mapped 1-Ha plots on Changbaishan Mountain in North-eastern China and used marked point pattern analysis to explore whether trees of different sizes exhibited differences in neighbourhood species segregation; we also determined whether larger trees were more likely to have heterospecific neighbours than smaller trees were. Our results show that bigger trees generally have higher species mingling levels. Neighborhood species segregation ranged from lower than expected levels to random or nearly random patterns at small scales as tree size classes increased under heterogeneous Poisson null model tests. This study provides some evidence in support of negative density dependent effects in temperate forests.

AB The reproductive phenology of tropical plants is potentially driven by a number of abiotic and biotic factors. However, it is still unclear as to which climatic factors and biotic interactions drive the reproductive phenology of woody trees in the tropical seasonal rainforest of Xishuangbanna region in Southwest China. We conducted observations on woody plants (including trees and shrubs) phenology between November 2004 and October 2007 at biweekly intervals in the one hectare permanent plot of tropical seasonal rainforest in Southwest China. A total of 357 individuals of 76 species (70 genera, 37 families), comprising of 59 (78%) woody trees and 17 (22%) shrub species were observed. Our results demonstrate that flowering and fruiting frequencies show slight temporal variation between years. Flowering was significantly correlated with day-length, temperature and rainfall and fruiting was significantly correlated with rainfall and temperature. This finding indicates that woody tree reproductive phenology was primarily associated with temperature and rainfall and to a lesser extent with day-length. Reproductive phenology is also linked to seasonal patterns with flowering peaking in the late dry season and fruiting peaking in the late wet season. Moreover, reproductive phenology is also significantly associated with reproductive ecological guilds such as pollination types and dispersal modes. Community reproductive phenology is associated with climatic seasonality and biotic interactions. It also suggests that seasonal phenology patterns may play a fundamental role in community reproductive success in the tropical seasonal rainforest of Xishuangbanna region of Southwest China.

AB Trait-based community ecology promises an understanding of the factors that determine species abundances and distributions across habitats. However, ecologists are often faced with large suites of potentially important traits, making generalizations across ecosystems and species difficult or even impossible. Here, we hypothesize that key traits structuring ecological communities may be causally dependent on common physiological mechanisms and that elucidating these mechanisms can help us understand the distributions of traits and species across habitats. We test this hypothesis by investigating putatively causal relationships between physiological and behavioral traits at the species and community levels in larvae of 17 species of dragonfly that co-occur at the landscape scale but segregate among lakes. We use tools borrowed from phenotypic selection analyses to show that physiological traits underlie activity rate, which has opposing effects on foraging and predator avoidance behaviors. The effect of activity on these behaviors ultimately shapes species distributions and community composition in habitats with either large-bodied fish or invertebrates as top predators. Remarkably, despite the inherent complexity of ecological communities, the expression of just two biomolecules accounts for a high proportion of the variation in behavioral traits and hence, dragonfly community composition between habitats. We suggest that causal relationships among traits can drive species distributions and community assembly.

AB The coexistence of ecologically similar species might be counteracted by ecological drift and demographic stochasticity, both of which erode local diversity. With niche differentiation, species can be maintained through performance trade-offs between environments, but trade-offs are difficult to invoke for species with similar ecological niches. Such similar species might then go locally extinct due to stochastic ecological drift, but there is little empirical evidence for such processes. Previous studies have relied on biogeographical surveys and inferred process from pattern, while experimental field investigations of ecological drift are rare. Mechanisms preserving local species diversity, such as frequency dependence (e.g., rare-species advantages), can oppose local ecological drift, but the combined effects of ecological drift and such counteracting forces have seldom been investigated. Here, we investigate mechanisms between coexistence of ecologically similar but strongly sexually differentiated damselfly species (Calopteryx virgo and Calopteryx splendens). Combining field surveys, behavioral observations, experimental manipulations of species frequencies and densities, and simulation modeling, we demonstrate that species coexistence is shaped by the opposing forces of ecological drift and negative frequency dependence (rare-species advantage), generated by interference competition. Stochastic and deterministic processes therefore jointly shape coexistence. The role of negative frequency dependence in delaying the loss of ecologically similar species, such as those formed by sexual selection, should therefore be considered in community assembly, macroecology, macroevolution, and biogeography.

AB Forest ecosystems have great ecological values in mitigation of climate change and protection of biodiversity of flora and fauna; re-forestry is commonly used to enhance the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into forest storage biomass. Therefore, seasonal and spatial dynamics of the major microbial players in nitrification, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), in acidic soils of young and matured revegetated forests were investigated to elucidate the changes of microbial communities during forest restoration, and compared to delineate the patterns of community shifts under the influences of environmental factors. AOA were more abundant than AOB in both young and matured revegetated forest soils in both summer and winter seasons. In summer, however, the abundance of amoA-AOA decreased remarkably (p < 0.01), ranging from 1.90 (+/- 0.07) x 10(8) copies per gram dry soil in matured forest to 5.04 (+/- 0.43) x 10(8) copies per gram dry soil in young forest, and amoA-AOB was below detection limits to obtain any meaningful values. Moreover, exchangeable Al3+ and organic matter were found to regulate the physiologically functional nitrifiers, especially AOA abundance in acidic forest soils. AOB community in winter showed stronger correlation with the restoration status of revegetated forests and AOA community dominated by Nitrosotalea devanaterra, in contrast, was more sensitive to the seasonal and spatial variations of environmental factors. These results enrich the current knowledge of nitrification during re-forestry and provide valuable information to developmental status of revegetated forests for management through microbial analysis.

AB Understanding the underlying mechanisms causing diversity patterns is a fundamental objective in ecology and science-based conservation biology. Energy and environmental-heterogeneity hypotheses have been suggested to explain spatial changes in ant diversity. However, the relative roles of each one in determining alpha and beta diversity patterns remain elusive. We investigated the main factors driving spatial changes in ant (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) species richness and composition (including turnover and nestedness components) along a 500km longitudinal gradient in the Pampean region of Argentina. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in 12 sample sites during the summer. We performed a model selection approach to analyse responses of ant richness and composition dissimilarity to environmental factors. Then, we computed a dissimilarity partitioning of the contributions of spatial turnover and nestedness to total composition dissimilarity. Temporal habitat heterogeneity and temperature were the primary factors explaining spatial patterns of epigean ant species richness across the Pampas. The distance decay in species composition similarity was best accounted by temperature dissimilarity, and turnover had the greatest contribution to the observed beta diversity pattern. Our findings suggest that both energy and environmental-heterogeneity-related variables are key factors shaping richness patterns of ants and niche-based processes instead of neutral processes appear to be regulating species composition of ant assemblages. The major contribution of turnover to the beta diversity pattern indicated that lands for potential reconversion to grassland should represent the complete environmental gradient of the Pampean region, instead of prioritizing a single site with high species richness.

AB The aim of this study was to disentangle the effects of landscape configuration (i.e., fragment area, connectivity, and proximity to a busy highway) on the assembly of annual plant communities at different spatial scales. Our main hypothesis was that larger and more connected fragments would have higher species densities per plot and this may result in differences in turnover and nestedness patterns at the fine spatial scales where plants interact. Specifically, since Mediterranean annuals are known to form strong competitive hierarchies, we expected to find a nested pattern of beta diversity due to sequential species loss. The study area was a fragmented gypsum habitat in central Spain with a semiarid climate where two fragmentation drivers coexist: agricultural practices and a roadway. Larger fragments had higher species densities per plot (20 x 20 m). Nevertheless, we detected no effect on the species assembly at fine spatial scales (30 x 30 cm). However, when the fragment connectivity was high the species that appeared in poor quadrats (30 x 30 cm) comprised a subset of the species in rich quadrats. These results agree well with the establishment of strong competitive hierarchies among annual species. The distance to the highway influenced the identity of the species established in the community (i.e., species composition) at fine spatial scales, but we detected no effect on species turnover, nestedness, or species densities. The main conclusion of our study is that the effects of habitat fragmentation extend beyond the landscape scale and they determine the spatial assembly at fine spatial scales.

AB Almost all Australian tropical and subtropical regions lack annually-resolved long-term (multi-decadal to centennial scale) instrumental climate records. Reconstructing climate in these regions requires the use of sparse climate proxy records such as tree rings. Tree rings often archive annually-resolved centennial-scale climate information. However, many tropical and subtropical species have short life-spans, the timbers are poorly preserved, and there is a belief that the proxy records of these species are often compromised by ring anomalies. Additionally, for many species the relationship between climate (e.g. temperature and/or rainfall) and tree growth has not been established. These factors have led to tree-ring data being underutilized in the Australian subtropics. Trees in the Araucariaceae family, a common family in northern and eastern Australia, are both longer lived than many species in the Australian subtropics, present growth rings that are annual in nature, and their growth is known to vary with climate. In this study we examine two subtropical Araucariaceae species, Araucaria cunninghamii and Araucaria bidwillii, and quantify the relationship between their radial growth and climate variability. Ring anomalies including false, faint, locally absent, and pinching rings, are found to be present in these species, however, bomb-pulse radiocarbon dating of A. cunninghamii samples together with a whole tree approach helped to identify annual growth patterns despite such anomalous ring boundaries. Additionally, to determine which climate variables most influence growth in these species, dendrometers were installed at two locations in subtropical Southeast Queensland, Australia. We found that rainfall variability drives annual ring growth, while temperature constrains the onset and conclusion of the growth season each year. Our results demonstrate that through the use of A. cunninghamii and A. bidwillii trees which demonstrate annual growth in relation to climate variables there is potential to develop centennial scale climate reconstructions from the Australian subtropics. We provide recommendations on how to best identify ring anomalies in these species to help in the future development of long-term chronologies and climate reconstructions.

AB Xerophytic thickets occur along the southwestern part of Madagascar. Although providing a wide variety of resources and services to the local population, this particular vegetation is subjected to deforestation. This study focuses on linking dendroclimatology and dendroecology by examining the spatial and temporal variability of the ecological growth conditions. Information from tree rings was retrieved, on one hand, to identify the problem of the limiting effects of past climate on growth and, on the other hand, to show how local environment takes part in the growth pattern of South Soalara species, in the southwestern part of Madagascar. Methods and principles of dendrochronology were applied on nine species belonging to seven botanical families. A total of 42 stem discs from 3 to 5 trees per species were collected at 30 cm height. All discs exhibited visible tree rings, but anatomical distinctness varied between species. This study highlighted the annual formation of tree rings through successful crossdating techniques. Then, from the nine constructed chronologies, species were grouped into three clusters. Analysis between precipitation and radial growth showed that the response to climate occurred mainly in rainy season. Large-scale climatic drivers such as sea surface temperature (SST1) of ENSO2 regions revealed a teleconnection with tree growth in cluster 1. Mean radial increments were computed from the measured tree ring width and varied from 0.66 to 1.98 mm year-1, showing that those species are slow-growing. All species were recorded as having a certain dendrochronological potential, which was ranked as useful for Rhizogum madagascariense and Terminalia gracilipes, poor for Gyrocarpus americanus and problematic for the other species. It is recommended to increase the number of wood samples and to provide more knowledge on the characteristics of the species in order to improve the quality of the chronology and the climatic signal on tree rings.

AB Interannual changes in global climate and weather disturbances may influence reproduction in tropical forests. Phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are known to produce interannual variation in reproduction, as do severe storms such as hurricanes. Using stationary trap-based phenology data collected fortnightly from 1993 to 2014 from a hurricane-affected (1989 Hugo, 1998 Georges) subtropical wet forest in northeastern Puerto Rico, we conducted a time series analysis of flowering and seed production. We addressed (1) the degree to which interannual variation in flower and seed production was influenced by global climate drivers and time since hurricane disturbance, and (2) how long-term trends in reproduction varied with plant lifeform. The seasonally de-trended number of species in flower fluctuated over time while the number of species producing seed exhibited a declining trend, one that was particularly evident during the second half of the study period. Lagged El Nino indices and time series hurricane disturbance jointly influenced the trends in numbers of flowering and fruiting species, suggesting complex global influences on tropical forest reproduction with variable periodicities. Lag times affecting flowering tended to be longer than those affecting fruiting. Long-term patterns of reproduction in individual lifeforms paralleled the community-wide patterns, with most groups of lifeform exhibiting a long-term decline in seed but not flower production. Exceptions were found for hemiepiphytes, small trees, and lianas whose seed reproduction increased and then declined over time. There was no long-term increase in flower production as reported in other Neotropical sites.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; WATERSHED SERVICES; POLICY DESIGNS; PES;
   DEFINITIONS; FRAMEWORK
AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes are governed by complex institutional arrangements. Specific rules are needed to control who can participate in buying and selling of services, under what circumstances participation is allowed, how transactions are regulated, and many other actions. Decisions made by the developers of PES schemes about what rules to include and what form these rules take are likely to have an impact on the eventual success or failure of the scheme. This paper applies the Institutional Analysis and Develop Framework's rules typology and Institutional Grammar Tool to develop a new method of classifying and summarizing institutional arrangements of PES schemes. We use 21 water quality trading schemes and develop the institutional rules classification and summary system. The classification system enables comparative assessment of institutional diversity across PES schemes. We demonstrate the utility of the classification system for this purpose by showing that there is significant institutional diversity among water quality trading schemes, despite their common environmental objectives and market-based approaches to addressing environmental challenges. We conclude with suggestions for applying the classification system to comparative research to understand the effectiveness of PES schemes generally and how differences in institutional arrangements may contribute to success or failure.

AB This paper examines whether and how payments for hydrological services (PHS) programs implemented on communal lands in Mexico result in household-level conservation and human wellbeing outcomes. We first use evaluation methods to establish the impact of PHS by comparing outcomes across seven communities enrolled, and one community not enrolled, in PHS. Second, we exploit variations in PHS program design across the enrolled communities to test the role of cash and technical assistance on outcomes. Data come from a 2016 cross-sectional survey of 261 households around El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, in Chiapas, Mexico. We find that households enrolled in PHS implement more conservation actions and that some own more assets than similar households not enrolled in PHS. We find that asset ownership is positively correlated with a household's payment amount and that conservation practices are related to amount of assistance received. We also measure perceived equity and benefits for households enrolled in PHS and find that perceptions are correlated with both payment and assistance, and strongly influenced by community organization. Our results provide evidence that common-property PHS contracts can change household-level conservation and human wellbeing outcomes, but that these changes are dependent on the type of external motivator and community organization.

AB In the agricultural frontiers of Brazil, the distinction between forested and deforested lands traditionally used to map the state of the Amazon does not reflect the reality of the forest situation. A whole gradient exists for these forests, spanning from well conserved to severely degraded. For decision makers, there is an urgent need to better characterize the status of the forest resource at the regional scale. Until now, few studies have been carried out on the potential of multisource, freely accessible remote sensing for modelling and mapping degraded forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass (AGB). The aim of this article is to address that gap and to evaluate the potential of optical (Landsat, MODIS) and radar (ALOS-1 PALSAR, Sentinel-1) remote sensing sources in modelling and mapping forest AGB in the old pioneer front of Paragominas municipality (Para state). We derived a wide range of vegetation and textural indices and combined them with in situ collected AGB data into a random forest regression model to predict AGB at a resolution of 20 m. The model explained 28% of the variance with a root mean square error of 97.1 Mgha(-1) and captured all spatial variability. We identified Landsat spectral unmixing and mid-infrared indicators to be the most robust indicators with the highest explanatory power. AGB mapping reveals that 87% of forest is degraded, with illegal logging activities, impacted forest edges and other spatial distribution of AGB that are not captured with pantropical datasets. We validated this map with a field-based forest degradation typology built on canopy height and structure observations. We conclude that the modelling framework developed here combined with high-resolution vegetation status indicators can help improve the management of degraded forests at the regional scale.

AB The distribution of the Darwin fox (L. fulvipes) between the Bio-Bio and Aysen regions in Chile was modeled under two future climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The most optimistic RCP2.6 model predicts an increase in the range of distribution, contrary to the RCP8.5 model, which shows local extinctions, but habitats gains in areas where this species has not been registered. The results are evaluated with respect to the system of protected areas for this endemic and endangered species in the southern cone of South America.

AB The remnants of coastal Mediterranean sclerophyll forests in Chile have a low representativeness in the National System of Protected Wild Areas despite their high endemism and species richness. In the Biobio Region, the Hualpen Terrestrial Biology Station (EBT) protects a remnant of this type of forest, for which there are no revisions describing its flora, which makes it difficult to formulate and develop strategies for its protection and conservation. This work aims are: a) to describe the taxonomic composition of vascular plants of the ETB and b) to provide information on their geographical origin, habit and conservation status. The resulting floristic list includes species identified through systematic sampling in the study area for one year, as well as EBT species stored in the collection of the Universidad de Concepcion Herbarium. We identified 292 species of vascular plants, where 71 species are endemic, 124 are native, 99 are alien species. From the floristic point of view the Asteraceae family was the most diverse with 36 species, followed by Poaceae with 32 species and Fabaceae with 18 species. Herbs were the most frequent growth habit (77.2%), followed by shrub (13.9%), tree (7.5%) and sub-shrub (1.4%). Nineteen endemic and native species have been classified in some category of conservation in continental Chile, standing out Gomortega keule and Pitavia punctata both classified as endangered species, and the fern Asplenium trilobum classified as a least concern in Chile and vulnerable in the Biobio Region. Despite of the reduced protected area in the EBT (70 ha), the site has a high species richness of native species when compared with data obtained from other studies of flora in sites of central Chile.

AB Woody encroachment can lead to a complete switch from open habitats to dense thickets, and has the potential to greatly alter the biodiversity and ecological functioning of grassy ecosystems across the globe. Plant litter decomposition is a critical ecosystem process fundamental to nutrient cycling and global carbon dynamics, yet little is known about how woody encroachment might alter this process. We compared grass decay rates of heavily encroached areas with adjacent nonencroached open areas in a semi-arid South African savanna using litterbags that allowed or excluded invertebrates. We also assessed the effect of woody encroachment on the activity of termites-dominant decomposer organisms in savanna systems. We found a significant reduction in decomposition rates within encroached areas, with litter taking twice as long to decay compared with open savanna areas. Moreover, invertebrates were more influential on grass decomposition in open areas and termite activity was substantially lower in encroached areas, particularly during the dry season when activity levels were reduced to almost zero. Our results suggest that woody encroachment created an unfavourable environment for invertebrates, and termites in particular, leading to decreased decomposition rates in these areas. We provide the first quantification of woody encroachment altering the functioning of African savanna ecosystems through the slowing of aboveground plant decomposition. Woody encroachment is intensifying across the globe, and our results suggest that substantial changes to the carbon balance and biodiversity of grassy biomes could occur.

AB Primate seed dispersal is a vital, but complex, ecological process that involves many interacting agents and plays important roles in the maintenance of old-growth forest, as well as in the development of regenerating forest. Focusing primarily on African examples, in this article we briefly review the ecological process of primate seed dispersal, highlighting understudied and contentious topics, and then we discuss how our knowledge on primate seed dispersal can promote both forest restoration and primate conservation. Though it is frequently claimed that primates are critically important for the maintenance of diverse tropical forest ecosystems, we believe that more empirical evidence is needed to support this claim. Confounding factors can often be difficult to rule out and long-term studies extending beyond the seedling or sapling stage are very rare. In addition, though primates are critical for initial seed dispersal of many tree species, spatial and temporal variation in post-deposition processes, such as secondary seed dispersal and predation by rodents, can dramatically alter the initial patterns generated by primates. However, given the need for immediate conservation action to prevent further primate extinctions, we advocate that the knowledge about primate seed dispersal be used in formulating informed conservation plans. One prominent area where this knowledge will prove extremely valuable is in forest restoration efforts. To aid in the development of such efforts, we pose five questions, the answers to which will help facilitate forest restoration becoming a useful tool in strategies designed to conserve primates.

AB We summarize work on a speciose Neotropical tree genus, Inga (Fabaceae), examining how interspecific variation in anti-herbivore defenses may have evolved, how defenses shape host choice by herbivores and how they might regulate community composition and influence species radiations. Defenses of expanding leaves include secondary metabolites, extrafloral nectaries, rapid leaf expansion, trichomes, and synchrony and timing of leaf production. These six classes of defenses are orthogonal, supporting independent evolutionary trajectories. Moreover, only trichomes show a phylogenetic signature, suggesting evolutionary lability in nearly all defenses. The interspecific diversity in secondary metabolite profiles does not arise from the evolution of novel compounds, but from novel combinations of common compounds, presumably due to changes in gene regulation. Herbivore host choice is determined by plant defensive traits, not host phylogeny. Neighboring plants escape each other's pests if their defenses differ enough, thereby enforcing the high local diversity typical of tropical forests. Related herbivores feed on hosts with similar defenses, implying that there are phylogenetic constraints placed on the herbivore traits that are associated with host use. Divergence in defensive traits among Inga appears to be driven by herbivore pressure. However, the lack of congruence between herbivore and host phylogeny suggests that herbivores are tracking defenses, choosing hosts based on traits for which they already have adaptations. There is, therefore, an asymmetry in the host-herbivore evolutionary arms race.

AB Lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) exhibit compensatory growth responses to herbivory. Among the various factors that have been identified to affect plant compensatory growth are the extent and type of tissue damage, the herbivore's feeding mode and the time of damage. Another factor that can greatly impact plant responses to herbivory, but has been largely ignored in previous studies, is the action of parasitoids. In most cases, parasitoids halt or slow down the development of herbivorous hosts, which, can result in decreased leaf damage, thereby affecting plant responses and ultimately plant fitness. Here, we investigated the effects of two koinobiont parasitoids on the amount of leaf damage inflicted by the Southern armyworm Spodoptera latifascia to wild lima bean, and the consequences of this for plant growth and seed production in the field. We specifically tested the hypothesis that the action of parasitoids will reduce plant damage and that this reduction will alter plant growth responses and seed production. Indeed, we found that in the presence of parasitoids plants suffered less damage than plants with only herbivores. As a consequence, compensatory growth was reduced and more and heavier seeds were produced earlier in the season, compared to plants exposed to only herbivores.

AB Several interspecific studies have related functional traits to alien plant invasiveness. Few studies have explicitly addressed how intraspecific variation in functional traits influences alien plant distribution across environments. In an old-growth temperate rainforest, we evaluated alien plant distribution across the light gradient, its relationship with native plant diversity and abundance, and variation in functional traits related to light capture that could explain the ecological breadth of alien plant species across the light gradient. In addition, we estimated possible ecological and phylogenetic constraints to intraspecific variation in these functional traits. In sixty 8-m(2) plots we recorded light availability together with richness and abundance of alien and native plant species. We measured in 14 alien plant species three functional traits (specific leaf area, chlorophyll content and root/shoot ratio) and calculated their coefficient of variation. We estimated ecological constraints by measuring correlations among traits that could limit functional responses to light. We assessed phylogenetic constraints by calculating the phylogenetic signal of those functional traits. Richness and abundance of alien plant species were positively associated with light availability, while abundance was negatively related to native plant species abundance. Dominance of alien species increased with light availability, but some of them were dominant even in the shade. Phenotypic variation of functional traits was positively associated with ecological breadth and dominance of alien plant species. We found little evidence of ecological or phylogenetic constraints on functional trait variation. Light availability and functional trait variation correlated with the distribution and dominance of alien plants in this temperate rainforest. Alien plant species showed considerable phenotypic variation in low light, which may facilitate colonization of the forest understory. This process would not be hindered by ecological or phylogenetic constraints. Intraspecific variation in functional traits can render insightful information on current and future alien plant distribution across environmental gradients.

AB Recently, it has been shown that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions lead to different effects on grassland diversity. While N additions decrease species richness, the effects of P additions are mainly neutral. This contribution focuses on the mechanisms behind this observed pattern. First, I elaborate on three classical hypotheses explaining the diversity response to nutrient enrichment. These hypotheses highlight the roles of above ground competition ('the light asymmetry hypothesis'), above and below ground interactions ('the total competition hypothesis') and litter production ('the litter hypothesis'). I test whether these hypotheses are able to explain the differences between N and P additions using data from the nutrient network, a globally distributed experiment (including 45 sites from five continents). I show that N addition leads to species loss (c.13%) but P addition has no net effect on species richness. Furthermore, the effects of N and P additions on richness are mediated by biomass, litter and light availability as proposed by the general hypotheses. Nonetheless, there are additional (biomass independent) effects of N addition on species richness. These effects elucidate the main limitation of the general hypotheses that do not explicitly consider the differences between N and P additions. Hence, I review the current knowledge on the differences between N and P additions by integrating the specific characteristics of N and P with the potential mechanisms proposed by ecological theory. The review focuses on mechanisms mediated by soil chemistry and stoichiometry, variation in light acquisition among species as well as species pool size of different functional groups. These mechanisms are incorporated into a detailed graphical model that allows testing the old and new hypotheses presented in this contribution.

AB The spatial distribution of organisms is usually discontinuous due to the interaction between the different species and variable optimal factors for them. In recent years, the distribution of several species has been affected by the alteration and destruction of their habitat; thus, it is important to evaluate the factors that affect the presence and persistence of taxa. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preference of substrates by diurnal lizards that inhabit Zapotitlan Salinas, Puebla through an analysis of interaction networks. Nestedness, modularity and attributes of the bipartite network were measured to analyze the preferences and distribution of lizards in the area. It was possible to identify generalist and specialist species, as well as the type of recurrent habitat for each species, the structure and possible competition or distribution of available resources. The existing environment in the valley provides a variety of subtrates that allow the presence of all registered species, however, their presence is threatened by the modification of those habitats.

AB Lycianthes series Meizonodontae Bitter (Solanaceae) is monophyletic and includes 8 species and 2 varieties. The aim of this paper is to analyze the richness, distribution and conservation status of the series. Using geographic information systems (GIS), we evaluated the richness by latitude, longitude, elevation, political divisions, biogeographic provinces, vegetation types, a 83 x 83 km grid cell and species distribution models. Also, we estimated geographic distribution and conservation status for each taxon, according to criterion B2 of the IUCN. Lycianthes series Meizonodontae distributes from northeast of Mexico to central Costa Rica, with Mexico as its main center of diversification. The species richness concentrates in Central Mexico, where the Transmexican Volcanic Belt and the Balsas Basin converge. Based on their areas of occupancy (AOO), L. hintonii and L. starbuckii are considered as critically endangered (CR), while the rest of the species are least concern (LC). The potential distribution models suggest that the main richness of Lycianthes series Meizonodontae occurs in the Transmexican Volcanic Belt.

AB We analyzed distributional data of 59 species of funnel-web spiders (Araneae: Agelenidae) of Mexico. We constructed individual tracks for the species analyzed, based on published and unpublished records, and based on their overlap we obtained 9 generalized tracks. Three generalized tracks belong to the Californian Nearctic dominion (Nearctic region) and 6 generalized tracks extend along the Mexican transition zone. Seven generalized tracks are defined by species of the same genus or closely related genera and 2 generalized tracks are supported by species of distantly related genera, which shows that both spatial relationships and phylogenetic evidence support the existence of ancestral biotas including unrelated taxa.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation contributes to the pool of plant-available N in both bulk soil and the rhizosphere. Here we investigated the co-association and assemblage process of diazotrophic community members in both rhizosphere and bulk soil of wheat fields. The diazotrophic community structure in the rhizosphere was significantly different and comprised a less competitive and more stable network structure when compared with that of the bulk soil. Deterministic versus stochastic community assemblage processes were quantified using betaNTl scores, demonstrating that deterministic processes decreased in importance with distance from plant roots. Soil pH was correlated with diazotrophic community structure and diversity, and community structure showed greater connectivity and stability in soils with neutral pH relative to those in acidic or alkaline soils. Stochastic processes dominated the assemblage of the diazotrophic community in soils with neutral pH, while deterministic processes dominated in acidic or alkaline soils. These results suggest that soil pH may play an essential role in the interaction and assemblage processes of the diazotrophic community in the rhizosphere and bulk soils, which could enhance our understanding of biological nitrogen fixation in agricultural soils.

AB Monitoring and management of forest fire is imperative in India where 50% of forest cover is prone to the fire. The study aims for applying the geospatial technology towards forest fire characterization and evaluation of relationship with meteorological thematic layers. Spatial analysis of forest fires in the state of Arunachal Pradesh was carried out based upon the decadal (2008-2016) forest fire count datasets, which was assessed for spatial variability over the known Himalayan biodiversity hotspot in diverse geographical and socio-economic gradients. Result suggested that Kameng districts had maximum fire incidences (25.2%) whereas it has 15.2% of state forest, established the districts as 'forest fire hotspot' in the state. Maximum number of incidences (88%) occurred in areas of low elevation (< 1500 m). There was high correlation with socio-economy where 42.3% forest fire points falls in high poverty index areas and 73% of fire incidences in the areas having population density 6-50. All districts showed high fire incidences, therefore an urgent intervention is greatly required by the policy makers towards conservation and management of forest fire prevention and control by adopting focused intervention, strategic allocation of limited resources in potent areas in order to safeguard Himalayan region of highest biodiversity.

AB Mixed-species flocks of birds have been studied for more than a century, but investigation efforts are historically unbalanced towards certain types of habitats, such as woodlands and lowland forests. Here we provide a first glance of bird flocks' patterns across different gradients in recent studies conducted within the Neotropics. We summarize a symposium where a series of independent studies that approached the topic, some of them making use of techniques that were seldom applied in previous decades in Neotropical systems. We discuss bird flocks' patterns across a latitudinal gradient, social network patterns in bird flocks' across elevational gradients in local and regional scale, and, finally, patterns of flocking response to different levels of human disturbance. Altogether, these studies offer a larger and diverse panorama of possible patterns of response and diversity of mixed-species flocks of birds in the Neotropical region, and provide a rich ground where future studies with bird flocks in the Neotropics may rely on.

AB While the importance of frugivorous primates as seed dispersers is well established, the question of the extent to which they exert selective pressure on fruit color phenotypes is contested. Numerous studies have identified suites of primate fruit colors, but the lack of agreement among them illustrates the difficulty of identifying the match between primate foraging behavior and the extent of primate-plant coevolution. This may indicate that primates do not shape fruit traits, at least in a consistent direction, or that the evolution of fruit color is affected by a complex array of selection pressures in which primates play only a part. Here, we review the role of primates in shaping fruit color in the context of primate color vision phenotypes, and fruit phenotypic constraints and selective pressures. To test the hypothesis that fruit color is subjected to selection pressures by primates, we offer six testable predictions aimed at disentangling the complex array of factors that can contribute to fruit color phenotypes, including animal mutualists, animal antagonists, and developmental and phylogenetic constraints of fruits. We conclude that identifying the importance of primate seed dispersers in shaping fruit visual traits is possible, but more complex than previously thought.

AB Human management of ecosystems can have direct or indirect effects on species communities. How species communities are affected by management is a key question in ecology and nature conservation. As keystone taxon, changes in ant communities can have sustained consequences for entire ecosystems. In forests, management has been shown to have an overall negative effect on ant communities in tropical and a positive effect in boreal forests. However, in temperate forests, it is unclear what components of forest management affect ant communities and how. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of forest management on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities in 150 temperate forest stands in three regions in Germany. Using a multi-model inference approach and structural equation models, we analyzed the effects of 18 variables, including variables of forest management, forest structure, arthropod diversity, and biomass, as well as abiotic factors, on ant species richness, abundance, and functional trait diversity (Rao's Q) based on morphological (FDM) and life-history traits (FDLH). In total, we found 28 ant species occurring on 120 plots. Main direct effects of forest management on ant abundance and species richness were caused by tree species selection, measured as dominant tree species. The main positive indirect effect was mediated by a reduced canopy cover with an increasing proportion of oak and pine, resulting in a higher temperature amplitude. Due to the low number of species in two regions, we analyzed functional diversity for the most ant species diverse region only. FDLH was affected positively by tree harvesting and negatively by structural complexity. FDM showed no response to forest management, potentially due to the low morphological diversity of temperate forest ants. Our results show that forest management practices in temperate forests strongly impact ant community structure. This can be beneficial for ants if management reduces the canopy cover, either by tree harvesting or by changing the tree species composition toward shade-intolerant tree species. To promote ant diversity as key taxon for maintaining ecosystem processes in forest ecosystems, we suggest to integrate forest stands with more open and warmer conditions in future management strategics.

AB Using effective survey protocols to address the effects of environmental change are key to saving time, resources and costs. Although exhaustive sampling in any location has been shown as impractical, biodiversity sampling projects must capture sufficient information to show how species assemblages change with the environmental variables. This study investigated time of exposure in the field and the number of pitfall traps that efficiently sampled poneromorph ants in 30 250 m long plots across an area of 25 km(2) of tropical rain forest in Brazil. The treatments used for the surveys included two days and 300 traps, 14 days and 300 traps, 14 days and 750 traps, and were considered the minimum, intermediate and maximum sampling efforts, respectively. We characterized each assemblage of ants in relation to a gradient of soil texture, terrain slope and leaf and branch litter volume, and then tested whether the ecological relationships observed with the maximum effort were comparable to data on intermediate and minimum sampling efforts. We also estimated the cost-effectiveness of using the protocols in survey programs. The assemblage of species sampled during 14 days was similar to the assemblage captured during two days, indicating that the number of days influenced the assemblage similarity more than the number of sampling traps. All ecological patterns detected with the maximum effort were also captured with lesser sampling efforts. Overall, both the intermediate and minimum sampling efforts represented savings around 26-40% of total project costs and 43-45% of time to process the samples. We recommend that two days of trapping time combined with 300 pitfall traps is a highly effective shortcut for monitoring assessment, which can be applied to large-scale biodiversity surveys in tropical forests.

AB There has been an increase in the number of studies using seed removal by antsto evaluate ecosystem functioning; however, these studies encompassed varying time periods and used different types of seeds. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate differences in the proportion of seeds removed by ants in impacted and non-impacted sites in Brazilian savanna. Furthermore, we evaluated seed removal (1) during the morning and after a 24h period of seed exposure and (2) using natural and artificial seeds (manipulated resource to resemble natural seeds). The proportion of seeds removed was higher after the 24h exposure period (artificial seeds) regardless of site status, and more artificial seeds were removed than natural seeds. Our recommendations regarding sampling period depend on whether evaluating impacted or non-impacted sites. Although seed removal was greater after 24h in both impacted and non-impacted sites, we suggest that research evaluating the proportion of seeds removed in non-impacted sites should be performed only in the morning period to optimize the sampling time (removal of 60% during this period). When the aim is to compare non-impacted and impacted sites, we suggest evaluating after 24h of exposure, since the impacted sites experienced a higher proportion of seed removal during the afternoon and/or night time periods. Furthermore, we recommend the use of artificial seeds because they are easier to obtain and manipulate, and allow us to do comparisons between studies at different regions. We consider these findings an important first step towards standardizing future research on seed removal in Brazilian savannas by facilitating fieldwork and allowing comparisons to be made among different studies.

AB Post-industrial sites form a unique phenomenon in the landscape. They enable us to study the human-altered succession of communities. Regarding this, we studied an ant community in three types of habitats - reclamation and spontaneous succession in an ore basin together with unaltered surroundings in the Czech Republic. More than 30 years after being abandoned, the site with spontaneous succession was more species rich than the reclaimed one. Moreover, spontaneous succession created a habitat that was more similar regarding ant diversity to the unaltered surrounding environment than that after traditional reclamation. Ants dependent on tree vegetation were rather rare in both the reclaimed and spontaneous succession parts of the ore basin compared to the surrounding landscape. The relative abundance of socially parasitic ants increases in a gradient from the reclaimed basin, through the basin with spontaneous succession to the unaltered surroundings. Our study highlighted the fact that the formation of ant communities at post-industrial sites is clearly more complicated than for other arthropods, including related aculeate hymenopterans. The potential of both reclaimed and spontaneous succession basins for harbouring endangered species appeared to be lower for ants than for other taxa indicated by recent studies.

AB The study of ecophysiology of endangered species is key to the success of conservation and ecological restoration programs. The objective of this work was to know the effect of light, soil fertility and seed origin on the growth of Magnolia pugana seedlings. The relative growth rate (RGR) and its components (Net Assimilation Rate: NAR and Leaf Area Ratio: LAR), as well as the root-shoot ratio (R/S) were estimated. Seedlings were obtained from seeds collected in two localities in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico, the first is a wild population in San Nicolas (SN) and the second is a plantation located in the gardens of the Centro Universitario de Ciencias Biologicas y Agropecuarias (CUCBA). The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions. In September 2015, 96 seedlings of approximately three months old were subjected to the following treatments in a factorial experiment (2x2x2): light level (high = 1 120 mu mol m(-2)s(-1 )and low = 136.3 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), seedling origin (SN and CUCBA) and soil fertility (high fertility = SN soil, low fertility = CUCBA soil) with 12 replicates for each combination of factors and levels. Growth was estimated in two harvests: the first harvest after 30 days of starting the experiment and the second at 60 days. Light and soil fertility levels, as well as seedling origin influenced growth through physiological and morphological adjustments. In general, Magnolia pugana showed higher RGR and NAR in high light, while LAR decreased. Soil fertility and seedling origin did not affect RGR or its components. However, these were affected by the light level, seedlings from SN grew more in high light. Stem height varied due to soil fertility and seedling origin, in low fertility soil (CUCBA) the seedlings of SN were 35 % higher than those of CUCBA. Low fertility soil under high light caused greater investment in seedling root biomass. The physiological component (NAR) was the major determinant of intraspecific variation in RGR. SN seedlings showed greater phenotypic plasticity due to coming from a wild population, which possibly has higher genetic variation than the cultivated population from CUCBA. The results suggest that Magnolia pugana is a species capable of adapting to diverse environments due to its phenotypic plasticity in response to different light and soil fertility levels.

AB Tropical forests are currently experiencing large-scale structural changes, including an increase in liana abundance and biomass. Higher liana abundance results in reduced tree growth and increased tree mortality, possibly playing an important role in the global carbon cycle. Despite the large amount of data currently available on lianas, there are not many quantitative studies on the influence of lianas on the vertical structure of the forest. We study the potential of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in detecting and quantifying changes in forest structure after liana cutting using a small scale removal experiment in two plots (removal plot and non-manipulated control plot) in a secondary forest in Panama. We assess the structural changes by comparing the vertical plant profiles and Canopy Height Models (CHMs) between pre-cut and post-cut scans in the removal plot. We show that TLS is able to detect the local structural changes in all the vertical strata of the plot caused by liana removal. Our study demonstrates the reproducibility of the TLS derived metrics for the same location confirming the applicability of TLS for continuous monitoring of liana removal plots to study the long-term impacts of lianas on forest structure. We therefore recommend to use TLS when implementing new large scale liana removal experiments, as the impact of lianas on forest structure will determine the aboveground competition for light between trees and lianas, which has important implications for the global carbon cycle.

TI Payments for forest ecosystem services: a look at neglected existence

AB Payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs have emerged as a financial mechanism to ameliorate market failures associated with the multitude of non-market ecosystem services (ES) provided by forest ecosystems. However, the defining principles of PES in theory is far from what pertains in practice. Focusing on the concept of total economic value (TEV) of ES. we identify that PES often include compensation as a proxy for the supply of ES and largely neglect to encompass the different attributes of an ES' TEV, particularly existence values. Most PES schemes are limited by scope of funding and incentives often account for as little as 0.1% to 85% of the full annual ES economic values per ha. The mechanism of PES therefore needs to be broadened to integrate potential levels of payments that direct and indirect beneficiaries might be willing to pay to preserve forest ecosystems and their services. Some beneficiaries might be willing to pay for some ES and altruistically expect others to free-ride on their payment. Research efforts should aim at providing better understanding of beneficiaries' willingness to pay in order to expand the demand-side of PES and reduce uncertainties.

AB Understanding which environmental variables and traits underlie adaptation to harsh environments is difficult because many traits evolve simultaneously as populations or species diverge. Here, we investigate the ecological variables and traits that underlie Mimulus laciniatus' adaptation to granite outcrops compared to its sympatric, mesic-adapted progenitor, Mimulus guttatus. We use fine-scale measurements of soil moisture and herbivory to examine differences in selective forces between the species' habitats, and measure selection on flowering time, flower size, plant height, and leaf shape in a reciprocal transplant using M.laciniatusx M.guttatus F-4 hybrids. We find that differences in drought and herbivory drive survival differences between habitats, that M.laciniatus and M.guttatus are each better adapted to their native habitat, and differential habitat selection on flowering time, plant stature, and leaf shape. Although early flowering time, small stature, and lobed leaf shape underlie plant fitness in M.laciniatus' seasonally dry environment, increased plant size is advantageous in a competitive mesic environment replete with herbivores like M.guttatus'. Given that we observed divergent selection between habitats in the direction of species differences, we conclude that adaptation to different microhabitats is an important component of reproductive isolation in this sympatric species pair.

AB Secondary forest habitats are increasingly recognized for their potential to conserve biodiversity in the tropics. However, the development of faunal assemblages in secondary forest systems varies according to habitat quality and species-specific traits. In this study, we predicted that the recovery of bird assemblages is dependent on secondary forest age and level of isolation, the forest stratum examined, and the species' traits of feeding guild and body mass. This study was undertaken in secondary forests in central Panama; spanning a chronosequence of 60-, 90-, and 120-year-old forests, and in neighboring old-growth forest. To give equal attention to all forest strata, we employed a novel method that paired simultaneous surveys in canopy and understory. This survey method provides a more nuanced picture than ground-based studies, which are biased toward understory assemblages. Bird reassembly varied according to both habitat age and isolation, although it was challenging to separate these effects, as the older sites were also more isolated than the younger sites. In combination, habitat age and isolation impacted understory birds more than canopy-dwelling birds. Proportions of dietary guilds did not vary with habitat age, but were significantly different between strata. Body mass distributions were similar across forest ages for small-bodied birds, but older forest supported more large-bodied birds, probably due to control of poaching at these sites. Canopy assemblages were characterized by higher species richness, and greater variation in both dietary breadth and body mass, relative to understory assemblages. The results highlight that secondary forests may offer critical refugia for many bird species, particularly specialist canopy-dwellers. However, understory bird species may be less able to adapt to novel and isolated habitats and should be the focus of conservation efforts encouraging bird colonization of secondary forests.

AB Organismal phenotypes often co-vary with environmental variables across broad geographic ranges. Less is known about the extent to which phenotypes match local conditions when multiple biotic and abiotic stressors vary at fine spatial scales. Bittercress (Brassicaceae: Cardamine cordifolia), a perennial forb, grows across a microgeographic mosaic of two contrasting herbivory regimes: high herbivory in meadows (sun habitats) and low herbivory in deeply shaded forest understories (shade habitats). We tested for local phenotypic differentiation in plant size, leaf morphology, and anti-herbivore defense (realized resistance and defensive chemicals, i.e., glucosinolates) across this habitat mosaic through reciprocal transplant-common garden experiments with clonally propagated rhizomes. We found habitat-specific divergence in morphological and defensive phenotypes that manifested as contrasting responses to growth in shade common gardens: weak petiole elongation and attenuated defenses in populations from shade habitats, and strong petiole elongation and elevated defenses in populations from sun habitats. These divergent phenotypes are generally consistent with reciprocal local adaptation: plants from shade habitats that naturally experience low herbivory show reduced investment in defense and an attenuated shade avoidance response, owing to its ineffectiveness within forest understories. By contrast, plants from sun habitats with high herbivory show shade-induced elongation, but no evidence of attenuated defenses canonically associated with elongation in shade-intolerant plant species. Finally, we observed differences in flowering phenology between habitat types that could potentially contribute to inter-habitat divergence by reducing gene flow. This study illuminates how clonally heritable plant phenotypes track a fine-grained mosaic of herbivore pressure and light availability in a native plant.

AB Elevated tropospheric ozone (O-3) concentration has been shown to affect many aspects of plant performance including detrimental effects on leaf photosynthesis and plant growth. However, it is not known whether such changes are accompanied by concomitant responses in plant hydraulic architecture and water relations, which would have great implications for plant growth and survival in face of unfavorable water conditions. A soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) cultivar commonly used in Northeast China was exposed to non-filtered air (NF, averaged 24.0nll(-1)) and elevated O-3 concentrations (eO(3), 40nll(-1) supplied with NF air) in six open-top chambers for 50days. The eO(3) treatment resulted in a significant decrease in whole-plant hydraulic conductance that is mainly attributable to the reduced hydraulic conductance of the root system and the leaflets, while stem and leaf petiole hydraulic conductance showed no significant response to eO(3). Stomatal conductance of plants grown under eO(3) was lower during mid-morning but significantly higher at midday, which resulted in substantially more negative daily minimum water potentials. Moreover, excised leaves from the eO(3) treated plants showed significantly higher rates of water loss, suggesting a lower ability to withhold water when water supply is impeded. Our results indicate that, besides the direct detrimental effects of eO(3) on photosynthetic carbon assimilation, its influences on hydraulic architecture and water relations may also negatively affect O-3-sensitive crops by deteriorating the detrimental effects of unfavorable water conditions.

AB The predominance of secondary forest-species in Brazilian subtropical forests highlights the importance of understanding the ecology of these taxa, and dendrochronology provides valuable information about the growth and climate response of tree species. The wide distribution of Alchornea triplinervia (Spreng.) Mull. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae), and the presence of growth rings in its wood, leds to its selection for this study. Samples were collected from 34 trees growing in rainy dense forest fragments in the cities of Blumenau and Brusque, in southern Brazil, and subjected to standard dendrochronological techniques. The local chronology spanned from 1889 to 2013 and the age of the trees ranged from 32 to 125years. The mean age was 73years and annual increment was 1.13mmyear(-1); the diameter and age showed a weak correlation. The results suggest that A.triplinervia growth responded negatively to hot summers and increased rainfall in the previous spring and winter. The high perdiodicity trend characteristic of ENSO activity was reflected in wavelet power spectra of A.triplinervia chronology, affecting positively its growth after strong ENSO events (1970-2009). Negative influences occurred before 1970 during normal ENSO events. Also, there is evidence of the existence of a connection between Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperatures influencing on tree growth.

AB Can morphological plant functional traits predict demographic rates (e.g., growth) within plant communities as diverse as tropical forests? This is one of the most important next-step questions in trait-based ecology and particularly for global reforestation efforts. Due to the diversity of tropical tree species and their longevity, it is difficult to predict their performance prior to reforestation efforts. In this study, we investigate if simple leaf traits are predictors of the more complex ecological process of plant growth in regenerating selectively logged natural forest within the Wet Tropics (WTs) bioregion of Australia. This study used a rich historical data set to quantify tree growth within plots located at Danbulla National Park and State Forest on the Atherton Tableland. Leaf traits were collected from trees that have exhibited fast or slow growth over the last similar to 50 yr of measurement. Leaf traits were found to be poor predictors of tree growth for trees that have entered the canopy; however, for sub-canopy trees, leaf traits had a stronger association with growth rates. Leaf phosphorus concentrations were the strongest predictor of Periodic Annual Increment (PAI) for trees growing within the sub-canopy, with trees with higher leaf phosphorus levels showing a higher PAI. Sub-canopy tree leaves also exhibited stronger trade-offs between leaf traits and adhere to theoretical predictions more so than for canopy trees. We suggest that, in order for leaf traits to be more applicable to reforestation, size dependence of traits and growth relationships need to be more carefully considered, particularly when reforestation practitioners assign mean trait values to tropical tree species from multiple canopy strata.

AB How habitat mediates the distribution and habitat selection of migratory birds that winter in agroforestry systems is still poorly known. In this research, we evaluated how different habitat characteristics in shade agroforestry plantations influenced the richness and abundance of the overwintering migratory bird community. We examined migratory bird diversity and habitat structure in nine farms with coffee agroforestry systems with different shading regimes during two wintering seasons in southwestern Antioquia Department, Colombia. 15.9 +/- 3.69 species of migratory birds were found on the 9 farms (range 11-21 species). While we found little support for a strong association between richness of migratory birds and habitat variables, abundance of migratory birds was best explained by the combined effect of habitat characteristics. Particularly, the total number of individuals of migratory birds was positively related to structural attributes such as shrub density, canopy cover, tree density and diameter at breast height, suggesting that a denser and closed shading system might be beneficial for migratory birds, which may both increase the horizontal and vertical complexity of the agroforestry system and the variety of food resources for birds. Our surveys showed additional evidence that shaded systems can provide overwinter habitat to Neotropical migrant birds in the Colombian Andes. Moreover, we suggest that migratory birds can benefit by managing structurally and floristically diverse agroforestry and silvopastoral systems.

AB Varzea forests account for 17% of the Amazon basin and endure an annual inundation that can reach 14 m deep during 6-8 months. This flood pulse in combination with topography directly influences the varzea vegetation cover. Assemblages of several taxa differ significantly between unflooded terra firme and flooded varzea forests, but little is known about the distribution of medium and large sized terrestrial mammals in varzea habitats. Therefore, our goal was to understand how those habitats influence mammalian species distribution during the dry season. Specifically, we: (1) compared the species composition between a terra firme (Amana Sustainable Development Reserve) and a varzea forest (Mamiraua A Sustainable Development Reserve); and (2) tested the influence of the varzea habitat classes on the number of records, occurrence and species composition of mammalian assemblages. The sampling design in each reserve consisted of 50 baited camera trap stations, with an overall sampling effort of 5015 camera trap days. We used Non-Metric Multidimension Scaling (NMDS) to compare species composition between terra firme and varzea forests, and used Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to assess how habitat types and a habitat diversity index affect mammal distributions. We recorded 21 medium and large sized mammalian species, including 20 species in terra firme and only six in varzea (3443 records). Flood pulse and isolation in varzea forest drove the dissimilarity between these two forest types. In varzea forest, medium size mammals, in general, avoided habitats associated with long flooding periods, while jaguars (Panthera onca) appeared to prefer aquatic/terrestrial transition zones. Habitats that remain dry for longer periods showed more mammalian occurrence, suggesting that dispersion via soil is important even for semi-arboreal species. This is the first study to evaluate differential use of varzea habitats by terrestrial mammalian assemblages.

AB Background. A key strategy in biodiversity conservation is the establishment of protected areas. In the future, however, the redistribution of species in response to ongoing climate change is likely to affect species' representativeness in those areas. Here we quantify the effectiveness of planning protected areas network to represent 151 birds endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot, under current and future climate change conditions for 2050.
   Methods. We combined environmental niche modeling and systematic conservation planning using both a county and a regional level planning strategy. We recognized the conflict between biodiversity conservation and economic development, including socio-economic targets (as opposed to biological only) and using planning units that are meaningful for policy-makers.
   Results. We estimated an average contraction of29,500 km(2) in environmentally suitable areas for birds, representing 52% of currently suitable areas. Still, the most cost-effective solution represented almost all target species, requiring only ca. 10% of the Atlantic Forest counties to achieve that representativeness, independent of strategy. More than 50% of these counties were selected both in the current and future planned networks, representing >83% of the species.
   Discussion. Our results indicate that: (i) planning protected areas network currently can be useful to represent species under climate change; (ii) the overlapped planning units in the best solution for both current and future conditions can be considered as "no regret" areas; (iii) priority counties are spread throughout the biome, providing specific guidance wherever the possibility of creating protected area arises; and (iv) decisions can occur at different administrative spheres (Federal, State or County) as we found quite similar numerical solutions using either county or regional level strategies.

AB The establishment of agricultural matrices generally involves deforestation, which leads to fragmentation of the remaining forest. This fragmentation can affect forest dynamics both positively and negatively. Since most animal species are affected, certain groups can be used to measure the impact of such fragmentation. This study aimed to measure the impacts of agricultural crops (matrices) on ant communities of adjacent lower montane Atlantic rainforest fragments. We sampled nine forest fragments at locations surrounded by different agricultural matrices, namely: coffee (3 replicates); sugarcane (3); and pasture (3). At each site we installed pitfall traps along a 500 m transect from the interior of the matrix to the interior of the fragment (20 pitfall traps-25 m apart). Each transect was partitioned into four categories: interior of the matrix; edge of the matrix; edge of the fragment; and interior of the fragment. For each sample site, we measured ant species richness and ant community composition within each transect category. Ant richness and composition differed between fragments and matrices. Each sample location had a specific composition of ants, probably because of the influence of the nature and management of the agricultural matrices. Species composition in the coffee matrix had the highest similarity to its corresponding fragment. The variability in species composition within forest fragments surrounded by pasture was greatest when compared with forest fragments surrounded by sugarcane or, to a lesser extent, coffee. Functional guild composition differed between locations, but the most representative guild was 'generalist' both in the agricultural matrices and forest fragments. Our results are important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as an island of biodiversity in an 'ocean of crops'.

AB Background: The destruction and fragmentation of forest in Southeast Asia is accelerating biodiversity loss, resulting in a range of management and conservation actions. For some species, a detailed understanding of microhabitat selection is critical for this, especially in the breeding season.
   Methods: To understand the factors that explain how specific habitats are used by the Grey Peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum) in the breeding season, we used camera trapping and microhabitat sampling to assess the microhabitat selection of males. We also looked at their interaction with predators in an area of 1200 m x 1200 m at the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, between January and May 2013.
   Results: We show that display scrapes are situated on flatter open areas with small saplings and some vines, typified by low horizontal understory density. We hypothesise that this allows a trade-off between courtship display and the avoidance of predators. Our study showed that the position of Grey Peacock-pheasant display scrapes regularly overlapped with predators within the same microhabitat. We hypothesise that the species' behavioural responses to temporal variation in predation risk allows them to avoid most predators.
   Conclusions: Particular microhabitats are required for Grey Peacock-pheasant display. They avoid predators at these places by being active when predators are not.

AB Fire is a major determinant of savanna tree communities and, as such, manipulation of fire frequency is an important management tool. Resolving the effects of fire management on tree size class distributions can help managers predict and plan for short-term ecological and economic outcomes, reveal different strategies by which woody plants cope with frequent fire, and help us predict vegetation changes under future fire scenarios. Savanna structure and size class distribution are strongly influenced by the ability of suppressed tree resprouts to escape stem death by frequent fire. A widespread assumption is that resprouts have an imperative to escape fire to reach sexual maturity in the canopy and thereby ensure long-term species viability. We use a census of Australian mesic savanna tree communities subjected to annual, triennial, and fire exclusion (unburnt) fire treatments to ask how fire frequency affects size class distributions within and between eco-taxonomic groups of species. Total tree densities did not significantly differ, but were highest in the triennial (7,610 se 1,162 trees ha(-1)) and unburnt fire treatments (7,051 +/- se 578 trees ha(-1)) and lowest in the annual fire treatment (6,168 se 523 trees ha(-1)). This was caused by increased sapling densities in the triennial and unburnt fire treatments, predominantly of Acacia and pantropical genera. Eucalypts (Eucalyptus and Coryrnbia spp.) dominated the canopy across all fire treatments indicating relatively greater success in recruiting to larger sizes than other species groups. However, in the sub-canopy size classes eucalypts co-dominated with, and in some size classes were outnumbered by, pantropicals and Acacia, regardless of fire treatment. We hypothesize that such results are caused by fundamental differences in woody plant strategies, in particular sexual reproduction, that have not been widely recognized in Australian savannas.

AB Dahlia tamaulipana (Asteraceae, Coreopsideae), a new species from Sierra Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas, Mexico, is described. The new species is morphologically similar to D. tubulata, but differs by developing stems evidently hexagonal and villous in the upper portion of the nodes and the base of the petioles, the internodes reach 3-5.5 x 1-1.5 cm, the stipels are present from the first to the third pair of leaflets, the synflorescence develops (1-) 15-25 heads, the heads reach 6.5-10 cm wide across the extended rays, and clavate cypsela with crown-shaped pappus. Both species inhabit the northern portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental, however they are not sympatric and do not share ecological preferences and phenological behavior. The description of the new species is accompanied with photographs, a chromosome count, and a distributions map and a key for Dahlia in Sierra Madre Oriental.

AB Secondary forests constitute a substantial proportion of tropical forestlands. These forests occur on both public and private lands and different underlying environmental variables and management regimes may affect post-abandonment successional processes and resultant forest structure and biodiversity. We examined whether differences in ownership led to differences in forest structure, tree diversity, and tree species composition across a gradient of soil fertility and forest age. We collected soil samples and surveyed all trees in 82 public and 66 private 0.1-ha forest plots arrayed across forest age and soil gradients in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We found that soil fertility appeared to drive the spatial structure of public vs. private ownership; public conservation lands appeared to be non-randomly located on areas of lower soil fertility. On private lands, areas of crops/pasture appeared to be non-randomly located on higher soil fertility areas while forests occupied areas of lower soil fertility. We found that forest structure and tree species diversity did not differ significantly between public and private ownership. However, public and private forests differed in tree species composition: 11 percent were more prevalent in public forest and 7 percent were more prevalent in private forest. Swietenia macrophylla, Cedrela odorata, and Astronium graveolens were more prevalent in public forests likely because public forests provide stronger protection for these highly prized timber species. Guazuma ulmifolia was the most abundant tree in private forests likely because this species is widely consumed and dispersed by cattle. Furthermore, some compositional differences appear to result from soil fertility differences due to non-random placement of public and private land holdings with respect to soil fertility. Land ownership creates a distinctive species composition signature that is likely the result of differences in soil fertility and management between the ownership types. Both biophysical and social variables should be considered to advance understanding of tropical secondary forest structure and biodiversity.
   Resumen Los bosques secundarios constituyen una proporcion importante de las tierras forestales tropicales. Dichos bosques se encuentran en tierras de propiedad publica y privada, las cuales son sujetas a diferentes formas de manejo, afectando asi el proceso de sucesion de los bosques. Este proceso ocurre durante un periodo posterior al abandonado de las tierras y afecta la estructura forestal y biodiversidad resultante. Examinamos si las diferencias en cuanto a posesion y manejo de tierras, generan desigualdad en la estructura del bosque, biodiversidad y composicion a traves de un gradiente de fertilidad en el suelo y de edad del bosque. Colectamos muestras de suelo e hicimos un estudio de todos los arboles con un diametro a la altura del pecho a 10cm en 66 parcelas forestales privadas de 0.1-ha, colocadas a lo largo de areas con diferentes edades de bosque y gradientes de fertilidad de suelo, con la finalidad de comparar los datos colectados en este estudio con la base de datos existente de 82 parceles forestales de tierras publicas en bosques secos forestales en Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que la fertilidad del suelo parece dirigir la estructura espacial de bosques de propiedad publica vs. privada; las tierras destinadas a la conservacion que son de propiedad publica, parecen localizarse de forma no aleatoria en suelos menos fertiles. En tierras de propiedad privada, las areas destinadas al pastoreo y cultivo parecen localizarse de forma no aleatoria en suelos mas fertiles, mientras que los bosques ocupan tierras menos fertiles. Encontramos que la estructura metrica integrada de los bosques y la biodiversidad no difieren significativamente entre las tierras publicas y privadas. Sin embargo, los bosques publicos y privados difieren en su composicion de especies de arboles. De un total de166 especies, 11 por ciento fueron mas prevalentes en bosques publicos, 7 por ciento mas prevalentes en bosques privados, 32 por ciento no exhibieron parcialidad en cuanto a su distribucion, y 49 por ciento eran muy raras como para ser clasificadas. Las especies de madera popular Swietenia macrophylla, Cedrela odorata, y Astronium graveolens fueron mas prevalentes en bosques publicos, mientras que Guazuma ulmifolia, una especie ampliamente consumida y dispersada por ganado, fue mas abundante en los bosques privados. Sugerimos que la diferencia en cuanto abundancia de la madera popular y G. ulmifolia puedo haber sido el resultado de la tala selectiva y dispersion por ganado. Ademas, algunas diferencias en composicion floral parecen ser el producto de disimilitud en cuanto a la fertilidad del suelo, debido a una seleccion no aleatoria de fertilidad del suelo en tierras publicas y privadas. Existen pocas comparaciones entre bosques secundarios tropicales de propiedad publica y privada. Sin embargo, el entendimiento de estas diferencias es clave: la extension de los bosques secundarios esta incrementandose sistematicamente en conjunto con la disminucion de los bosques maduros, y los bosques secundarios usualmente se regeneran en pastizales o tierras agricolas de propiedad privada.

AB The expansion of agricultural land remains one of the main drivers of deforestation in tropical regions. Stronger land property rights could possibly enable farmers to increase input intensity and productivity on the already cultivated land, thus reducing incentives to expand their farms by deforesting additional land. This hypothesis is tested with data from a panel survey of farm households in Sumatra. The survey data are combined with satellite imageries to account for spatial patterns, such as historical forest locations. Results show that plots for which farmers hold formal land titles are cultivated more intensively and are more productive than untitled plots. However, due to land policy restrictions, farmers located at the historic forest margins often do not hold formal titles. Without land titles, these farmers are less able to intensify and more likely to expand into the surrounding forest land to increase agricultural output. Indeed, forest closeness and past deforestation activities by households are found to be positively associated with current farm size. In addition to improving farmer's access to land titles for non-forest land, better recognition of customary land rights and more effective protection of forest land without recognized claims could be useful policy responses.

AB Partitioning of soil phosphorus (P) pools has been proposed as a key mechanism maintaining plant diversity, but experimental support is lacking. Here, we provided different chemical forms of P to 15 tree species with contrasting root symbiotic relationships to investigate plant P acquisition in both tropical and subtropical forests. Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees responded positively to addition of inorganic P, but strikingly, ECM trees acquired more P from a complex organic form (phytic acid). Most ECM tree species and all AM tree species also showed some capacity to take up simple organic P (monophosphate). Mycorrhizal colonisation was negatively correlated with soil extractableP concentration, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi may regulate organic P acquisition among tree species. Our results support the hypothesis that ECM and AM plants partition soil P sources, which may play an ecologically important role in promoting species coexistence in tropical and subtropical forests.

AB 1. Tropical conservation strategies traditionally focus on large tracts of pristine forests but, given rapid primary forest decline, understanding the role of secondary forest remnants for biodiversity maintenance is critical. Until now, the interactive effects of changes in forest amount, configuration and disturbance history (secondary vs. primary forest) on the conservation value of tropical landscapes have remained unknown, hampering the incorporation of these global change drivers into local and global conservation planning.
   2. We disentangled effects of landscape-wide forest amount, fragment size and forest age (old growth vs. secondary forest) on abundance, beta-diversity, beta-diversity (biotic homogenization) and community shifts of bird communities in human-dominated landscapes of southern Costa Rica. Utilizing two complementary methods, yielding 6,900 individual detections and 223 species, we characterized bird communities in 49 forest fragments representing independent gradients in fragment size (<5 ha vs. >30 ha) and forest amount (5%-80%) in the surrounding landscape (within 1000 m).
   3. Abundance and beta-diversity of forest specialists and insectivores declined by half in small fragments, but only in landscapes with little old-growth forest. Conversely, secondary forest at the landscape scale showed no such compensation effect. Similarly, a null-model approach indicated significant biotic homogenization in small vs. large fragments, but only in landscapes with little old-growth forest, suggesting forest amount and configuration interactively affect beta-diversity in tropical human-dominated landscapes. Finally, dramatic abundance-based community shifts relative to intact forests are largely a result of landscape-scale loss of old growth rather than changes in overall forest cover.
   4.Policy implications. Our study provides strong evidence that retaining old growth within tropical human-modified landscapes can simultaneously curb erosion of avian forest specialist beta-diversity, mitigate collapse of beta-diversity (biotic homogenization) and dampen detrimental avian community shifts. However, secondary forests play, at best, a subordinate role to mitigate these processes. To maintain tropical forest biodiversity, retaining old-growth forest within landscapes should be first priority, highlighting a land-sparing approach.

AB Elucidating the relative importance of niche and neutral processes in structuring ecological communities is a major goal of ecology. We considered multiple components of community structure (beta diversity, species abundance distributions, and niche specialisation) and spatial scales to identify the processes structuring marine fish communities along a tropical to temperate gradient. Beta diversity was explained by local scale environmental and spatial variables, with geographic distance and environmental gradients being stronger drivers of species turnover in tropical and temperate study areas, respectively. Species abundance distributions found a significant component of community structure in all regions to not differ from that expected by chance. Niche specialisation was more prevalent among the endemic, temperate fish species than in tropical fishes. Our results support a strong neutral component of marine fish community assembly, regardless of bioregion. A change in importance from dispersal limitation to niche filtering processes was found from tropical to temperate communities, superimposed over neutrally assembled marine fish communities.

AB Numerical simulations of neutral metacommunities are used here to predict the effects of growth and shrinkage of metacommunities, as well as their separation and merging caused by continental collision and rifting and their secondary eustatic effects. Although growth and shrinkage of metacommunities predictably change diversity, separating and merging metacommunities have counterintuitive effects. Separating and merging metacommunities change diversity within the individual areas, especially so for smaller areas, but they cause no change in total diversity of the system, contrary to previous predictions. The response times of metacommunities are likely to be geologically undetectable except for enormously large systems. These models can be used to predict the plate-tectonic effects on the diversity of terrestrial, coastal-marine, deep-marine, and oceanic-island systems. Of these, global and regional coastal-marine systems are the most acutely sensitive to the changes in area and fragmentation caused by plate tectonics. Oceanic-island systems also experience global and regional changes in diversity during supercontinent breakup and assembly, with the global effects driven by the changing length of volcanic arcs, and the regional effects also driven by secondary eustatic changes in shallow-marine area. Although individual terrestrial provinces or continents may experience substantial changes in diversity from rifting and collision, global terrestrial diversity should be unchanged except for the relatively modest contributions caused by the secondary eustatic effects on land area. These changes in diversity may be reinforced or counteracted by the changing latitudinal position of metacommunities.

AB Biological invasions present a global problem underlain by an ecological paradox that thwarts explanation: how do some exotic species, evolutionarily naive to their new environments, outperform locally adapted natives? We propose that community assembly theory provides a framework for addressing this question. Local community assembly rules can be defined by evaluating how native species' traits interact with community filters to affect species abundance. Evaluation of exotic species against this benchmark indicates that exotics that follow assembly rules behave like natives, while those exhibiting novel interactions with community filters can greatly underperform or outperform natives. Additionally, advantages gained by exotics over natives following disturbance can be explained by accounting for extrinsic assembly processes that bias exotic traits toward ruderal strategies.

AB With rapid population growth comes the ever-important task of meeting the energy demand that this growth requires, and many of the world's tropical regions have turned to hydropower to address the challenges associated with increasing energy consumption. Hydropower is an important energy policy issue in Brazil, and it is promoted as the preferred electricity option, because it is the least expensive in terms of long-term returns on investment; the Belo Monte dam in Northern Brazil provides an opportunity to study the effects of large investments in hydroelectric infrastructure on the surrounding local population. Using a matched panel data spanning 10 years (2005 to 2015), we study the impacts of Brazil's Belo Monte dam on cocoa and other food crop producers in the region. We find that households have seen a decline in rural employment opportunities, and despite improvements in cocoa productivity households have experienced declining food production. With the construction of the dam largely completed, farmers must now face the challenges of decreased food access and shifts in employment opportunities, and while there are many advantages and opportunities associated with this new development, special policy considerations are necessary to ensure that there are safety nets in place to assist those who will see a decline in access to economic opportunities.

AB Metal hyperaccumulation can increase plant resistance to herbivory, but tolerance as an herbivore defense has been little investigated. This study explored the interaction between Ni hyperaccumulation and herbivory tolerance using Streptanthus polygaloides. Plants were grown in one of two potting soil Ni treatments: Ni-amended (800 A mu g g(-1) added Ni) or unamended (0 A mu g g(-1) added Ni). One-month-old plants were arbitrarily assigned one of four levels of artificial herbivory damage applied to the leaves. Response variables included aboveground dry biomass and Ni concentration, total leaf number, final plant height, and total number of flowers, and were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. We found no consistent soil Ni effect, artificial herbivory effect, or interaction between soil Ni and artificial herbivory treatments for total leaf number or final plant height. However, there was a soil Ni effect for biomass, flower production, and Ni concentrations: all were greater for plants grown in Ni-amended soil when compared to plants grown in unamended soil. There was also a significant interaction between treatments for number of flowers produced (reflecting plant fitness) as well as for aboveground biomass. Plants of S. polygaloides receiving greater damage produced significantly more flowers, and had greater biomass, when grown in Ni-amended soil than plants in unamended soil. We conclude that Ni hyperaccumulation is associated with herbivory tolerance of S. polygaloides, increasing plant fitness when herbivory damage is severe. Herbivory tolerance provides an additional dimension to elemental defenses that can supplement the defense trait of herbivory resistance.

AB Long-term forest dynamics plots in the tropics tend to be situated on stable terrain. This study investigated forest dynamics on the north coast of New Guinea where active subduction zones are uplifting lowland basins and exposing relatively young sediments to rapid weathering. We examined forest dynamics in relation to disturbance history, topography and soil nutrients based on partial re-census of the 50-ha Wanang Forest Dynamics Plot in Papua New Guinea. The plot is relatively high in cations and phosphorus but low in nitrogen. Soil nutrients and topography accounted for 29% of variation in species composition but only 4% of variation in basal area. There were few areas of high biomass and most of the forest was comprised of small-diameter stems. Approximately 18% of the forest was less than 30 y old and the annual tree mortality rate of nearly 4% was higher than in other tropical forests in South-East Asia and the neotropics. These results support the reputation of New Guinea's forests as highly dynamic, with frequent natural disturbance. Empirical documentation of this hypothesis expands our understanding of tropical forest dynamics and suggests that geomorphology might be incorporated in models of global carbon storage especially in regions of unstable terrain.

AB Soil has been proposed as a driver explaining the development of monodominant forests in the tropics, for example, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forests (GDF) in central Africa. The aim of this study was to compare the physical and chemical properties of soils under GDF with those under an adjacent mixed forest (AMF), while controlling for topography. To this end, we set up sixteen 0.25-ha plots according to forest type and topography (plateau vs. bottomland), in the Yoko forest reserve, Democratic Republic of Congo. In each plot, we measured litter thickness and collected a total of 80 soil samples at depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 120-150 cm, for standard physical and chemical analyses. When controlling for topography and soil texture, we found that most of the chemical properties of soils under GDF did not differ from those of soils under AMF, particularly acidity, cation concentration, total N and the C:N ratio. The litter layer was 2.3 times thicker under GDF than under AMF stands, and, for a given texture, soils under GDF had a slightly higher organic C concentration in the 0-5 cm soil layer. This study suggests that G. dewevrei stands modify organic matter dynamics, which may be important in maintaining its monodominance.

AB The spatial structure of trees is a template for forest dynamics and the outcome of a variety of processes in ecosystems. Identifying the contribution and magnitude of the different drivers is an age-old task in plant ecology. Recently, the modelling of a spatial point process was used to identify factors driving the spatial distribution of trees at stand scales. Processes driving the coexistence of trees, however, frequently unfold within gaps and questions on the role of resource heterogeneity within-gaps have become central issues in community ecology. We tested the applicability of a spatial point process modelling approach for quantifying the effects of seed dispersal, within gap light environment, microsite heterogeneity, and competition on the generation of within gap spatial structure of small tree seedlings in a temperate, old growth, mixed-species forest. By fitting a non-homogeneous Neyman-Scott point process model, we could disentangle the role of seed dispersal from niche partitioning for within gap tree establishment and did not detect seed densities as a factor explaining the clustering of small trees. We found only a very weak indication for partitioning of within gap light among the three species and detected a clear niche segregation of Picea abies (L.) Karst. on nurse logs. The other two dominating species, Abies alba Mill. and Fagus sylvatica L., did not show signs of within gap segregation.

AB Adjustments that a tree species displays in acclimating to light conditions may explain its fate in different forest successional stages. Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong is a tree found in contrasting light environments and used in reforestation programs because of its rapid growth. This study analyzed the performance of tamboril seedlings grown in three light environments: FSfull sun (100% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a red/far-red ratio (R/FR) of 1.66), Sshade net (38% of PAR and a R/FR of 1.54) and IInsulfilm((R)) (Insulfilm, SAo Paulo, Brazil) shade cloth (24% of PAR and a R/FR of 0.69). Greater net assimilation, higher root/shoot ratio, higher stomatal density, and reduced leaf area are some of the functional traits developed by tamboril to acclimate to full sun. On the other hand, a larger leaf area associated with a greater specific leaf area, higher leaf area ratio, higher leaf number and leafing intensity, as well as higher chlorophyll and carotenoid contents are among the most important traits for tamboril to acclimate to shade. The seedlings growing in FS displayed the best quality index. However, the traits developed in the nursery under each light condition could promote the successful installation and survival of tamboril seedlings under similar conditions in the field.

DE urbanization; ecological framework; Kazan urban agglomeration
AB The analysis of ways for development of anecological framework of the Kazan city agglomeration is given in the paper. Currently, about1.7 million people live in this territory. The Kazan urban agglomeration has amonocentric structure and includes the city of Kazan, its satellite towns, as well as 6 municipal districts. Sustainable development of this territory requires mandatory consideration of the environmental component. The most important role in the ecological component belongs to the ecological frame work of agglomeration.
   Currently, the basis for the formation of the ecological frame work of the Kazan urban agglomeration is existing natural ecosystems: water objects, and forested areas. The work defines nuclei that are considered fundamental points of the natural ecological framework. It is the Volga-Kamsky state natural biosphere reserve in Laishev sky and Zelenodol sky districts, the State nature reserve of regional significance" Sviyazhsky" in Verkhneuslonsky district; the monument of nature of regional importance "Semiozer sky forest" in Vysokogor sky district; the State Nature Reserve of Regional Importance of the Landscape Profile "The Old Mill" in the Pestrechinsky District, and the Lenino-Kokushkin sky State Nature Reserve of Regional Importance and the Integrated Profile.

AB With ongoing climate change, it is likely that shifts in species distribution ranges will lead to changes in the type and intensity of plant-herbivore interactions. Plants currently exposed to lower levels of herbivory could have less developed defensive mechanisms and therefore could suffer in case of increased herbivore pressure.
   We performed a common garden experiment using clones of Festuca rubra originating from four populations experiencing contrasting temperature and precipitation regimes. Clones of identical genotype were subjected to both the control and the herbivory treatment using larvae of the nymphalid butterfly Coenonympha pamphilus, a generalist herbivore feeding on several grass species. Various measures of constitutive and induced defence as well as growth response to herbivory were assessed, compared between populations of different climatic origin and related to herbivore performance (larval survival).
   The four F. rubra populations significantly differed in constitutive defence (content of Si and total phenols), nutritional quality (content of C) and inducibility of defence (change in total phenols), but not in growth response to herbivory. Herbivores survived better on populations from colder climate and better survival was generally related to lower Si content and lower initial plant size.
   We demonstrated population differentiation in both constitutive and induced defence against insect herbivory, which directly affected survival of a generalist herbivore. Our findings confirmed the expectation that plants from higher elevations are more prone to herbivory. Moreover, differences in various aspects of plant defence between populations from the same altitude stresses the need of considering multiple factors when assessing the effect of climate on plant-herbivore interactions.

AB Species assembly patterns of local communities are shaped by the balance between multiple abiotic/biotic filters and dispersal that both select individuals from species pools at the regional scale. Knowledge regarding functional assembly can provide insight into the relative importance of the deterministic and stochastic processes that shape species assembly. We evaluated the hierarchical roles of the alpha niche and beta niches by analyzing the influence of environmental filtering relative to functional traits on geographical patterns of tree species assembly in mid-latitude forests. Using forest plot datasets, we examined the alpha niche traits (leaf and wood traits) and beta niche properties (cold/drought tolerance) of tree species, and tested non-randomness (clustering/over-dispersion) of trait assembly based on null models that assumed two types of species pools related to biogeographical regions. For most plots, species assembly patterns fell within the range of random expectation. However, particularly for cold/drought tolerance-related beta niche properties, deviation from randomness was frequently found; non-random clustering was predominant in higher latitudes with harsh climates. Our findings demonstrate that both randomness and non-randomness in trait assembly emerged as a result of the alpha and beta niches, although we suggest the potential role of dispersal processes and/or species equalization through trait similarities in generating the prevalence of randomness. Clustering of beta niche traits along latitudinal climatic gradients provides clear evidence of species sorting by filtering particular traits. Our results reveal that multiple filters through functional niches and stochastic processes jointly shape geographical patterns of species assembly across mid-latitude forests.

AB Tree mortality is a key driver of forest community composition and carbon dynamics. Strong winds associated with severe convective storms are dominant natural drivers of tree mortality in the Amazon. Why forests vary with respect to their vulnerability to wind events and how the predicted increase in storm events might affect forest ecosystems within the Amazon are not well understood. We found that windthrows are common in the Amazon region extending from northwest ( Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, and west Brazil) to central Brazil, with the highest occurrence of windthrows in the northwest Amazon. More frequent winds, produced by more frequent severe convective systems, in combination with well-known processes that limit the anchoring of trees in the soil, help to explain the higher vulnerability of the northwest Amazon forests to winds. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of convective storms in the Amazon have the potential to increase wind-related tree mortality. A forest demographic model calibrated for the northwestern and the central Amazon showed that northwestern forests are more resilient to increased wind-related tree mortality than forests in the central Amazon. Our study emphasizes the importance of including wind-related tree mortality in model simulations for reliable predictions of the future of tropical forests and their effects on the Earth' system.

AB The Atlantic Forest is an intensely fragmented and globally important ecological hotspot. In this context, the objective of this study was to analyze the landscape ecology and submit proposals for creating ecological corridors (ECs) in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. Landscape ecology metrics, based on the forest fragments map, were used for the analysis. Suggested corridors were based on least-cost path analysis, considering land use, declivity, permanent preservation areas (PPM), and forest fragment sizes. Although the predominant class sizes in the study area are small fragments, landscape ecology analysis has shown good environmental quality for fragments larger than 100 ha that do not lose their central area, even for the largest edge distances. Four ECs were proposed, with an average length of 53.86 km, average width of 5.39 km, and average area of 28,786.32 ha. Land use conflicts showed that the fragments within the corridors were situated in a matrix dominated by grassland. PPM within the proposed corridors were dominated by misused land and did not comply with environmental legislation. The proposed corridors were efficient in using the largest fragments, which have the least edge effect and provide necessary support for most wildlife. However, we emphasize that other factors can influence the delimiting of ECs; additional studies are required to obtain more effective ECs to connect habitats. The proposed methodology can be applied to other Brazilian and global ecoregion.

AB Leaf-cutting ants are responsible for much of living plant fragment removal in Neotropical regions, causing major damage in both in natural and agricultural systems. To understand the variation in plant fragment removal by leaf-cutting ants and the influence that temporal and spatial factors have on such variation, we evaluated plant fragments collected by two ant species, Alta laevigata and A. sexdens rubropilosa in different seasons (rainy and dry) and in different forest systems (natural area of cerrado sensu stricto and monoculture of Eucalyptus sp.) in 2014 in Goianesia. Goias, Brazil. Heavier plant fragments were removed during the dry season and in monoculture areas; A. laevigata removed heavier fragments than A. sexdens rubropilosa. Furthermore, we observed a positive association between the weight of collected fragments and the weight of worker ants and higher weights in A. laevigata. The study shows that the weight of plant fragments removed by leaf-cutting ants is conditioned temporally and spatially, and by the ant species involved. More detailed studies of each of these factors are need to better understand the dynamics of these foraging ants and how abiotic and biotic factors affect this process.

ID POGONOMYRMEX-OCCIDENTALIS; HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;

AB During reproduction, ant colonies produce winged queens. These new queens usually leave the nest to mate and can then establish a new nest. If the new nest is close to an existing colony, it will be in competition with the existing colony. Therefore, workers will kill any mated queens they find outside the colony during the reproductive season. In this study, factors that might determine whether workers eliminate queens were investigated. Mating status (mated or unmated), colony origin (same or different to tested workers) and mating partners (inbred or outbred) of the queens of Japanese harvester ants (Messor aciculatus) were manipulated and the workers' behavior towards the queens was observed. Mated queens were always attacked by workers, though this was not affected by either colony origin or mating partners. These results suggest that mating status triggers elimination of queens by workers, and that the colony origin and mating partner are unlikely to be important roles in elimination of queens.

AB Amphibians are hosts for a wide variety of micro- and macro-parasites. Chigger mites from the Hannemania genus are known to infect a wide variety of amphibian species across the Americas. In Chile, three species (H. pattoni, H. gonzaleacunae and H. ortizi) have been described infecting native anurans; however, neither impacts nor the microscopic lesions associated with these parasites have been described. Here, we document 70% prevalence of chigger mite infection in Eupsophus roseus and absence of infection in Rhinoderma darwinii in the Nahuelbuta Range, Chile. Additionally, we describe the macroscopic and microscopic lesions produced by H. ortizi in one of these species, documenting previously undescribed lesions (granulomatous myositis) within the host's musculature. These findings highlight that further research to better understand the impacts of chigger mite infection on amphibians is urgently required in Chile and elsewhere.

AB Tropical rainforest soils harbor a considerable diversity of soil fauna that contributes to emissions of N2O. Despite their ecological dominance, there is limited information available about the contribution of epigeal ant mounds to N2O emissions in these tropical soils. This study aimed to determine whether ant mounds contribute to local soil N emissions in the tropical humid rainforest. N2O emission was determined in vitro from individual live ants, ant-processed mound soils, and surrounding reference soils for two trophically distinct and abundant ant species: the leaf-cutting Atta mexicana and omnivorous Solenopsis geminata. The abundance of total bacteria, nitrifiers (AOA and AOB), and denitrifiers (nirK, nirS, and nosZ) was estimated in these soils using quantitative PCR, and their respective mineral N contents determined. There was negligible N2O emission detected from live ant individuals. However, the mound soils of both species emitted significantly greater (3-fold) amount of N2O than their respective surrounding reference soils. This emission increased significantly up to 6-fold in the presence of acetylene, indicating that, in addition to N2O, dinitrogen (N-2) is also produced from these mound soils at an equivalent rate (N2O/N-2 = 0.57). Functional gene abundance (nitrifiers and denitrifiers) and mineral N pools (ammonium and nitrate) were significantly greater in mound soils than in their respective reference soils. Furthermore, in the light of the measured parameters and their correlation trends, nitrification and denitrification appeared to represent the major N2O-producing microbial processes in ant mound soils. The ant mounds were estimated to contribute from 0.1 to 3.7% of the total N2O emissions of tropical rainforest soils.

AB Tropical forest mortality is controlled by both biotic and abiotic processes, but how these processes interact to determine forest structure is not well understood. Using long-term demography data from permanent forest plots at the Paracou Tropical Forest Research Station in French Guiana, we analysed the relative influence of competition and climate on tree mortality. We found that self-thinning is evident at the stand level, and is associated with clumped mortality at smaller scales (<2m) and regular spacing of living trees at intermediate (2.5-7.5m) scales. A competition index (CI) based on spatial clustering of dead trees was used to build predictive mortality models, which also accounted for climate interactions. The model that most closely fitted observations included both the CI and climatic variables, with climate-only and competition-only models less informative than the full model. There was strong evidence for U-shaped size-specific mortality, with highest mortality for small and very large trees, as well as sensitivity of trees to drought, especially when temperatures were high, and when soils were water saturated. The effect of the CI was more complex than expected a priori: a higher CI was associated with lower mortality odds, which we hypothesize is caused by gap-phase dynamics, but there was also evidence for competition-induced mortality at very high CI values. The strong signature of competition as a control over mortality at the stand and individual scales confirms its important role in determining tropical forest structure. The complexity of the competition-mortality relationship and its interaction with climate indicates that a thorough consideration of the scale of analysis is needed when inferring the role of competition in tropical forests, but demonstrates that climate-only mortality models can be significantly improved by including competition effects, even when ignoring species-specific effects.Synthesis. Empirical models such as the one developed here can help constrain and improve process-based vegetation models, serving both as a benchmark and as a means to disentangle mortality processes. Tropical vegetation dynamic models would benefit greatly from explicitly considering the role of competition in stand development and self-thinning while modelling demography, as well as its interaction with climate.

AB 1. Acute activation of the immune system often initiates a suite of behavioural changes. These "sickness behaviours"-involving lethargy and decreased activity-may be particularly costly on invasion fronts, where evolutionary pressures on dispersal favour individuals that move large distances.
   2. We used a combination of field and laboratory studies to compare sickness behaviours of cane toads from populations differing in invasion history. To do this we stimulated immune system activation by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic bacterial infection.
   3. We predicted that LPS would result in less severe sickness behaviour in toads from range-edge populations because they had undergone selection for rapid and sustained dispersal (activities in conflict with lethargy and decreased activity).
   4. Contrary to our prediction, LPS injection caused a greater reduction in dispersal-relevant traits in invasion-front individuals than in conspecifics from the range-core.
   5. Our data suggest that the rapid invasion of cane toads through tropical Australia has seen an evolutionary shift in the magnitude of sickness behaviour elicited by pathogen infection. The increased sickness behaviour among range-edge toads suggests a shift away from pathogen tolerance (seen in range-core populations) towards resistance to pathogen attack. But as a consequence, when pathogens do become successfully established, toads from invasion-front populations may have less capacity to tolerate their ill-effects.

AB 1. Active restoration strategies have been recommended to recover Neotropical savannas in abandoned lands, but no studies have investigated the trajectories and speeds of spontaneous recovery for these systems. Research into the dynamics of degraded savannas is urgently needed to guide restoration decision making.
   2. We analysed the dynamics of secondary savannas in the Brazilian Cerrado by sampling 29 abandoned pastures (time since abandonment ranging from 3 to 25 years) and applying the space-for-time substitution method. We modelled the temporal changes in plant community attributes and estimated the time (years) required for these attributes to match those of two reference ecosystems (three replicates each), old-growth savanna and a forest-type savanna, which had encroached following fire suppression (encroached savanna). We also analysed the plant community composition of the study sites.
   3. Our models showed that tree canopy cover, richness and density rapidly increased with time since pasture abandonment, easily surpassing the values of the old-growth savanna (28 years) and reaching the values of encroached savanna 49 years after abandonment. The cover and richness of the ground layer increased at a much slower pace. Since the species in this layer, including the exotic grasses, are shade intolerant, they will be eliminated by canopy closure over time.
   4. Up to 25 years after abandonment, secondary savannas continued to lack many (37%) old-growth savanna species, mostly from the ground layer (82% of grasses absent). This period was also not sufficient for the secondary savannas to become floristically similar to the encroached savannas, which are dominated by shade-tolerant tree species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Despite the reported high natural regeneration of Neotropical savanna vegetation, abandoned pastures will not spontaneously return to an old-growth savanna state. Protected from fire and lacking the native ground layer, the end state of secondary savannas will be a low-diversity forest. If restoration goals include the recovery of old-growth savanna biodiversity and structure, interventions are required to prevent woody encroachment and reintroduce native grasses, forbs and shrubs. However, if the desirable endpoint is a low-diversity forest, passive restoration (non-intervention) and fire protection are appropriate.

AB 1. Natural habitats adjacent to agricultural areas are often considered sources of species that provide beneficial regulating ecosystem services through cross-habitat spillover. Both inter-habitat matrix and landscape configuration can influence spillover by controlling organismal ability to disperse through landscapes, and affecting the provision of additional or supplementary resources that impact organism survival.
   2. To understand how landscape structure in terms of matrix land use type, forest cover and edge density might facilitate avian cross-habitat spillover, we sampled avian communities in forest patches and adjacent land use types (coffee plantations or cattle pastures) using a well-replicated study design across 92 sampling sites across a landscape-context forest cover gradient (6%-60%).
   3. Land use type was a key factor influencing avian cross-habitat spillover, facilitating species movement into coffee plantations and acting as a barrier to spillover into cattle pastures. We found that 24% of the forest-dependent species pool was capable of spillover into coffee plantations, while spillover was nearly non-existent in cattle pastures.
   4. Forest cover was also the main driver of spillover into coffee plantations. There was a positive relationship between forest cover and spillover, potentially due to processes related with (1) a higher density of organism in-patches, (2) decreased isolation among patches facilitating species movement and (3) higher landscape supplementation processes.
   5. Finally, we found edge density had an additive effect with forest cover on spillover. Spillover was higher in high-forested landscapes with many forest-matrix edges, possibly due to increased structural connectivity for species able to move through edges, and to improved access for forest-dwelling species to different resource types (complementation processes).
   6. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that land use type is a key factor facilitating species spillover into agricultural matrices and that the influence of land use type on spillover is further modulated by a combination of native habitat amount and edge density. These results should be considered in efforts to design or manage sustainable agricultural landscapes in order to enhance both bird persistence and the provision of bird-mediated ecosystem services.

AB The light environment of trees is a strong driver for their growth and morphology. Manipulating the light regime in forests is one of the main tools available to control the forest development. This study analysed the effect of a drastic light addition through gap creation on beech saplings (Pagus sylvalica L.) that had initially established under the canopy of mature trees. Altogether 6 gaps of varying size were created on an area of 4 ha. A total of 51 saplings were incorporated in this study. The saplings' above- and belowground biomass compartments were destructively harvested along a light gradient. Relationships between light availability and growth increment, stress relief, biomass allocation, and growth morphology were analysed. Along the gradient of increasing light availability, beech saplings responded with an increased diameter growth, whereas the height growth remained unaffected. Also the root mass fraction increased at the expense of the leaf mass fraction. Other biomass compartments showed no significant trend. The mean branch weight also increased and the specific leaf area decreased. Other morphological traits were not affected by the light availability. The results lead to the conclusion that the morphological plasticity of the beech saplings towards light was not as high as initially expected. Furthermore, the sudden increase of light availability did not impose stress on the saplings. Finally, managing the light regime is appropriate to achieve specific goals.

AB Mounting evidence suggests that anthropogenic global change is altering plant species composition in tropical forests. Fewer studies, however, have focused on long-term trends in reproductive activity, in part because of the lack of data from tropical sites. Here, we analyze a 28-year record of tropical flower phenology in response to anthropogenic climate and atmospheric change. We show that a multidecadal increase in flower activity is most strongly associated with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations using yearly aggregated data. Compared to significant climatic factors, CO2 had on average an approximately three-, four-, or fivefold stronger effect than rainfall, solar radiation, and the Multivariate ENSO Index, respectively. Peaks in flower activity were associated with greater solar radiation and lower rainfall during El Nino years. The effect of atmospheric CO2 on flowering has diminished over the most recent decade for lianas and canopy trees, whereas flowering of midstory trees and shrub species continued to increase with rising CO2. Increases in flowering were accompanied by a lengthening of flowering duration for canopy and midstory trees. Understory treelets did not show increases in flowering but did show increases in duration. Given that atmospheric CO2 will likely continue to climb over the next century, a long-term increase in flowering activity may persist in some growth forms until checked by nutrient limitation or by climate change through rising temperatures, increasing drought frequency and/or increasing cloudiness and reduced insolation.

AB The Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania and Kenya are one of 35 global biodiversity hotspots. The Eastern Arc forests are, as are many other tropical biodiversity hotspots, highly fragmented. Understanding the impact of habitat fragmentation (i.e., habitat loss and subdivision) on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests is important because forest spatial structure highly influences species richness, persistence, and extinction debt. Here we examine the impact of habitat fragmentation on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests at a patch scale using very high resolution aerial imagery having a spatial resolution of 0.5-1.5 m. Forest area across the 13 Eastern Arc Mountains is 405,852 ha and is distributed into 311 fragments 10 ha in size with a median fragment size of 84 ha. The 18 largest forest fragments in the Eastern Arc Mountains contain greater than three-quarters of total forest area. Average fragment isolation, as assessed by median distance to nearest fragment and median distance to the nearest larger fragment, is 867 and 1533 m, respectively. Of total forest area, 14% is < 100 m from the forest edge and 33% is < 300 m from the forest edge. Establishing forested linkages among the largest and closest forest fragments through forest regeneration and protection of secondary regenerating forest as well as providing protected area status to the remaining non-protected forest including unprotected smaller forest fragments are important to enhancing the long-term persistence of many plant and animal species here.

AB The reproductive system of a tree species has substantial impact on genetic diversity and structure within and among natural populations. Such information, should be considered when planning tree planting for forest restoration. Here, we describe the mating system and genetic diversity of an overexploited Neotropical tree, Myroxylon peruiferum L.f. (Fabaceae) sampled from a forest remnant (10 seed trees and 200 seeds) and assess whether the effective population size of nursery-grown seedlings (148 seedlings) is sufficient to prevent inbreeding depression in reintroduced populations. Genetic analyses were performed based on 8 microsatellite loci. M. peruiferum presented a mixed mating system with evidence of biparental inbreeding (100) population conservation. Therefore, to obtain a reasonable genetic representation of native tree species and prevent problems associated with inbreeding depression, seedling production for restoration purposes may require a much larger sampling effort than is currently used, a problem that is further complicated by species with a mixed mating system. This study emphasizes the need to integrate species reproductive biology into seedling production programs and connect conservation genetics with ecological restoration.

AB Habitat destruction and fragmentation alter the quality of habitats and put populations under the risk of extinction. Changes in population parameters can provide early warning signs of negative impacts. In tropical forests, where habitat loss and fragmentation are vast, such indicators are of high relevance for directing conservation efforts before effects are irreversible. Most of our knowledge from tropical ecosystems originates from community level surveys, whereas our understanding of the influence of habitat conversion on vital rates of species is limited. This study focused on the influence of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation on the survival probability and abundance of three leaf-litter frog species (Rhinella errata, Ischnocnema guentheri and I. parva) in forest patches of the Atlantic rainforest of South-east Brazil compared to a continuous forest. The species differ in their matrix tolerance: high for R. ornata and low for I. guentheri and I. parva and, thus, we examined whether their survival and abundance correspond to this classification. behnoeneina guentheri showed highest abundances in all study sites and low mortality in the forest patches compared to the continuous forest; I. parva was encountered only in isolated fragments, with very low mortality in one isolated fragment; and the matrix tolerant species had generally low abundance and showed no clear pattern in terms of mortality in the different sites. Our counter-intuitive results show that even matrix sensitive amphibian species may show high abundance and low mortality in small forest patches. Therefore, these patches can be of high value for amphibian conservation regardless of their degree of matrix aversion. Landscape level conservation planning should not abandon small habitat patches, especially in highly fragmented tropical environments.

AB Phosphorus (P) application in olive orchards is very common in the Mediterranean basin although experimental evidence of crop response to applied P is practically non-existent. In this work soil P and tree P nutritional status of the olive groves of NE Portugal were assessed from a population of 1808 soil and 2252 leaf samples. Plant response to applied P was evaluated from two field and two pot experiments carried out with the cultivar 'Cobrancosa'. The analyses of soil and leaf samples of the olive orchards of the region indicate that P fertilizer recommendations should be based on leaf rather than on soil analyzes, since the latter seems to overestimate the need for P. The field and pot experiments hardly showed any positive response to P applications, which is a sign that the use of P fertilizer in olive can be substantially reduced. Nonetheless, in one pot experiment, P application significantly increased total dry matter yield during three consecutive years, in a strict association with higher tissue P concentrations and enhanced photosynthetic activity, as revealed by gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence traits. The experimental results also showed that the roots can uptake and store P when available in the soil, which may buffer the levels of P in the shoots. The acid phosphate activity can provide useful information but deserves caution in the interpretation of results since it depends not only on the availability of inorganic P in the soil, but also on the available organic substrate and pH.

AB Why tropical forests harbour an exceptional number of species with striking differences in abundances remains an open question. We propose a theoretical framework to address this question in which rare species may have different extirpation risks depending on species ranks in tree growth and sensitivities to neighbourhood interactions. To evaluate the framework, we studied tree growth and its responses to neighbourhood dissimilarity (ND) in traits and phylogeny for 146 species in a neotropical forest. We found that tree growth was positively related to ND, and common species were more strongly affected by ND than rare species, which may help delay dominance of common species. Rare species grew more slowly at the community-wide average ND than common species. But rare species grew faster when common species tended to dominate locally, which may help reduce extirpation risk of rare species. Our study highlights that tree growth rank among species depends on their responses to neighbourhood interactions, which can be important in fostering diversity maintenance in tropical forests.

AB Climate change models predict more frequent and severe droughts in the humid tropics. How drought will impact tropical forest carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics is poorly understood. Here we report the effects of the severe 2015 Caribbean drought on soil moisture, oxygen, phosphorus (P), and greenhouse gas emissions in a humid tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Drought significantly decreases inorganic P concentrations, an element commonly limiting to net primary productivity in tropical forests, and significantly increases organic P. High-frequency greenhouse gas measurements show varied impacts across topography. Soil carbon dioxide emissions increase by 60% on slopes and 163% in valleys. Methane (CH4) consumption increases significantly during drought, but high CH4 fluxes post-drought offset this sink after 7 weeks. The rapid response and slow recovery to drought suggest tropical forest biogeochemistry is more sensitive to climate change than previously believed, with potentially large direct and indirect consequences for regional and global carbon cycles.

AB Capuchin monkeys (Cebus spp. and Sapajus spp.) and coatis (Nasua spp.) coexist in most neotropical forests, including small forest remnants. Both capuchins and coatis eat fruit and disperse seeds, but little is known about whether their roles in seed dispersal are redundant or complementary. We compiled 49 studies from the literature on feeding by capuchins and/or coatis, of which 19 were comprehensive enough for our analyses. We determined the relative importance of fruit eating to each species and compared their diets. Additionally, we analysed the structure of three fruit-frugivore networks built with both animal groups and the fruits they eat and evaluated whether fruit traits influenced the network topology. Fruits represented the largest part of capuchin and coati diets, even though coatis have been known for their opportunistic and generalist diets. Capuchins and coatis also exhibited similar general diet parameters (niche breadth and trophic diversity). The three networks exhibited high connectance values and variable niche overlap. A Multiple Correspondence Analysis, failed to detect any trait or trait combination related to food use. In conclusion, capuchins and coatis both have generalist diets; they feed on many different species of fruits and exhibit important complementarity as seed dispersers. Both are likely to be particularly important seed dispersers in disturbed and fragmented forests.

AB Lemna minuta Kunth is an invasive, alien duckweed that is present throughout much of Europe, where it competes with native congeneric Lemna minor Linnaeus. Previously, L. minuta was found to grow faster than L. minor. The aim of this study was to determine whether the rapid growth of invasive L. minuta is based on differential light utilisation. For this purpose, the growth performance of L. minuta was compared with that of L. minor under a range of different light intensities. Both physiological and morphological parameters were determined. L. minuta showed a higher Relative Growth Rate (RGR) than L. minor when grown under medium and high intensities. Further analysis showed that, at high light intensities, L. minuta has a higher Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), and displays more photochemical quenching (qP) and a higher quantum yield (Y(II)) than L. minor. In contrast under low light intensities L. minor displayed a marginally higher RGR, due to a greater Leaf Area Ratio (LAR), and higher chlorophyll content than L. minuta. The results indicate two distinct light utilisation strategies, and reveal that the invasive species L minuta takes more advantage from high intensity light conditions. In turn, this may influence plant distribution and, consequently, ecosystem management by relevant authorities.

AB While the effects of nectar robbing on plants are relatively well-studied, its impacts from the perspective of the pollinators of robbed plants is not. Numerous studies do consider the impacts of robbing on pollinator visitation to robbed plants, but rarely do they focus on its scaled-up impacts on individual pollinator behavior. We used radio telemetry to track the spatial and behavioral responses of the territorial hummingbird Aglaeactis cupripennis to experimental nectar robbing over a period of several days. Simulated nectar robbing impacted foraging behavior by increasing territory area, distance flown, and reliance on novel food resources, especially small-bodied flying insects. We did not observe any impact on the amount of time individuals spent foraging, nor did we observe territory abandonment. These findings indicate that nectar robbing may impose a significant energetic cost on pollinators via increased flight distances and shifts towards potentially less profitable food resources, and demonstrate the importance of quantifying the indirect effects of nectar robbing on pollinators in addition to plants.

AB Aim: Landscape attributes can determine plant-animal interactions via effects on the identity and abundance of the involved species. As most studies have been conducted in a context of habitat loss and fragmentation, we know very little about interaction assembly in new habitats from a landscape approach. This study aimed to test the effect of forest age and connectivity on acorn predation by a guild of predator insects differing in dispersal ability and resilience mechanisms: two weevils (Curculio elephas and C.glandium) and one moth (Cydia fagiglandana) in expanding Quercus ilex forests.
   Location: Barcelona, Spain.
   Methods: We assessed the proportion of infested acorns and identified the predator at the species level in five patches of connected old forests, connected new forests and isolated new forests. Effects of habitat age and connectivity at three scales (tree, patch and landscape) were analysed using generalized linear mixed-effects models.
   Results: Predation by weevils was positively associated with old connected forests, while moths, with better dispersal ability, were able to predate upon all patches equally. Moreover, C.elephas, the weevil with lower dispersal ability, exhibited colonization credits in the new isolated patches. In spite of these changes in the guild of seed predators, the proportion of infested acorns was non-significantly different among forests.
   Main conclusions: The guild of seed predators may vary depending on forest age and connectivity. However, because those with higher dispersal ability may replace less mobile species, this resulted in zero-sum effects of landscape attributes on acorn predation (i.e., similar predation rates in well-connected old forests vs. isolated new forests).

AB Pathogen spillover from wildlife to domestic animals and humans, and the reverse, has caused significant epidemics and pandemics worldwide. Although pathogen emergence has been linked to anthropogenic land conversion, a general framework to disentangle underlying processes is lacking. We develop a multi-host model for pathogen transmission between species inhabiting intact and converted habitat. Interspecies contacts and host populations vary with the proportion of land converted; enabling us to quantify infection risk across a changing landscape. In a range of scenarios, the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rarest, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion. This framework provides insights into the mechanisms driving disease emergence and spillover during land conversion. The finding that the risk of spillover is highest at intermediate levels of habitat loss provides important guidance for conservation and public health policy.

AB Species coexistence in diverse communities likely results from multiple interacting factors. Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and varying life-history strategies related to resource partitioning are known to influence plant fitness, and thereby community composition and diversity. However, we have little understanding of how these mechanisms interact and how they vary across life stages. Here, we document the interaction between CNDD and life-history strategy, based on growth-mortality trade-offs, from seedling to adult tree for 47 species in a tropical forest. Species' life-history strategies remained consistent across stages: fast-growing species had higher mortality than slow-growing species at all stages. In contrast, mean CNDD was strongest at early life stages (i.e. seedling, sapling). Fast-growing species tended to suffer greater CNDD than slow-growing species at several, but not all life stages. Overall, our results demonstrate that coexistence mechanisms interact across multiple life stages to shape diverse tree communities.

AB Soil carbon (C) and nutrients are derived largely from decomposition of plant biomass. Animals that generate greenfall, or green leaf litter, influence C and nutrient cycling dynamics by altering the phenological condition, and therefore nutrient quality, of plant litter entering the soil, and transporting litter among microsites. Microsite effects on decomposition rates are particularly pronounced in arid and semi-arid ecosystems where vegetation cover is often patchy. We investigated differences in decomposition of greenfall and senesced litter of three common Chihuahuan Desert plants from which animals frequently generate greenfall. A litterbag study was used to quantify differences in mass, C, and nitrogen (N) losses between green and senesced leaves in shrub intercanopy and subcanopy microsites in desert shrublands. We found significant differences in nutrient concentration of green and senesced leaves, and that both litter condition (green or senesced) and microsite affected decomposition rate. For two of the three litter species, greenfall decomposed more rapidly than senesced litter; for all three species; litter decomposed more rapidly in intercanopy than subcanopy microsites. These results support the idea that creation and translocation of greenfall by animals are important mechanisms regulating decomposition speed and C and nutrient transfer from plant biomass into the soil.

AB Cropland abandonment has emerged as a common phenomenon in land use transitions. Both cropland abandonment and Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs can facilitate the provision of ecosystem services. However, the relationship between cropland abandonment and PES programs remains poorly understood. China has recently undergone considerable cropland abandonment in mountainous areas. Meanwhile, China adopted a series of forest conservation and restoration policies under the scheme of PES starting in the late 1990s. In this study, we track the temporal trend of cropland abandonment under China's two PES programs, Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program (CCFP) and Ecological Welfare Forest Program (EWFP), in Tiantangzhai Township, Anhui Province. We use a random-coefficients logistic regression model to examine the roles that these two PES programs, together with other factors, played in cropland abandonment. Results indicate that: 1) the overall cropland abandonment rates for the CCFP-participating households were lower than those for the non-participants in the years immediately after the implementation of the CCFP, but there was an acceleration of cropland abandonment by the CCFP participants afterwards, leading to the convergence of cropland abandonment rates between the two types of households. 2) Although CCFP payment did not have a long-term effect on cropland abandonment, a larger amount of EWFP payment significantly increased the likelihood of cropland abandonment. 3) Land parcel biophysical characteristics that facilitated cropland abandonment include proximity to EWFP and CCFP forests, poor accessibility and unfavorable topographic positions, and 4) among household socioeconomic conditions, poor farm labor availability and high proportion of local off-farm income in total gross income increased the likelihood of cropland abandonment, while owning domestic animals decreased the likelihood of abandoning cropland. EWFP cash compensation (socioeconomic factors) and distances from cropland parcels to both EWFP and CCFP forest lands (geographic factors) had direct and indirect impacts on cropland abandonment, potentially facilitating the provision of ecosystem services through forest restoration and regrowth on the abandoned land. These findings are highly valuable for policy-makers designing similar PES programs with higher cost-effectiveness and better selection of croplands as targets for reforestation.

AB Seed predation can cause substantial seed losses and influence plant population dynamics, but the impact depends on the extent to which populations are limited by seed availability or favorable microsites for recruitment. Harvester ants are the dominant post-dispersal seed predators in Australia's tropical savannas, and their abundance and foraging efficiency, as well as the availability of seed and microsites, are affected by fire history. We undertook a predator-exclusion experiment to examine the interactive effects of fire history (no fire compared with annual burning over 5 years) and seed predation by ants on seedling establishment of the dominant savanna tree, Eucalyptus miniata, in northern Australia. Despite its large seed size, the rate of removal (similar to 20-60%) was similar or higher than typically reported for eucalypts, although it was lower than that recorded for the smaller seeds of the co-occurring E. tetrodonta. Seed predation rates were twice as high in annually burnt compared to unburnt sites, but there was no significant difference in the proportion of seedlings that emerged from the initial seed available. Seedling emergence in both regimes was low, representing < 7% of seed available after harvesting. About one-third of emergent seedlings were still alive during the middle of the following dry season. Our results indicate that seedling recruitment in E. miniata is limited by both seed supply and microsite availability. However, seed predation by ants reduces the likelihood of seedling establishment from low to virtually zero, which suggests that it plays a potentially important role in the population dynamics of savanna eucalypts.

AB The monitoring of the tree-shrub Cerrado sensu stricto was conducted in two permanent plots, 1.25 ha each, in Planaltina, Federal District, Brazil from 1988 to 2012 throughout seven times. Fire was set in August biennially in Area 1 in 1988, 1990 and 1992. Area 2 was protected against fire until July 1994. There was an accidental burning in August 1994 in both areas, thereafter they were protected against fire until 2012. The diameter and height of trees and shrubs above or equal 1 m height were measured before fire setting. In 1988, it was measured only the height. The species diversity was analyzed by UPGMA. Density, frequency, dominance and floristic similarity were evaluated. Eighty-two (82) species were recorded in both areas, where 74 species, in 35 families, occurred in Area 1 and, 73 species, in 34 families, in Area 2. From 1988 to 1994, both areas presented differences in the diversity and in the floristic similarity. In 2012, both areas showed floristic similarity, but the diversity was greater in Area 1. The tree-shrub vegetation was resistant and resilient to fire. Fire reduced the density and the basal area, but when fire was absent, both of them increased. Distributions of living plants in height and diameter classes did not differ significantly in both areas. Fire affects primarily individuals in the smaller classes of height and diameter.

AB The presence and distribution of green vegetation cover in the biosphere are of paramount importance in investigating cause-effect phenomena at the land/atmosphere interface, estimating primary production rates as part of global carbon and water cycle assessments and evaluating soil protection and land use change over time. The fraction of green vegetation cover (FCover) as estimated from satellite observations has already been demonstrated to be an extraordinarily useful product for understanding vegetation cover changes, for supporting ecosystem service assessments over areas with variable extents and for processes spanning a variable period of time (abrupt events or long-term processes). This study describes a methodology implemented to estimate global FCover (from 2001 to 2015) by applying a linear spectral mixture analysis with global endmembers to an entire temporal series of MODIS satellite observations and gap-filling missing FCover observations in temporal series using the DINEOF algorithm. The resulting global MODV1 FCover product was validated with two global validation datasets and showed an overall good thematic absolute accuracy (RMSE = 0.146) consistent with the validation performance of other FCover global products. Basic statistics performed on the product show changes in average and trend values and allow for the quantification of gross vegetation loss and gain over different temporal scales. To demonstrate the capacity of this global product to monitor specific dynamics, a multitemporal analysis was performed on selected sites and vegetation responses (i.e., cover changes), and specific dynamics resulting from cause-effect phenomena are briefly discussed. The product is intended to be used for monitoring vegetation dynamics, but it also has the potential to be integrated in other modeling frameworks (e.g., the carbon cycle, primary production, and soil erosion) in conjunction with other spatial datasets such as those on climate and soil type.

AB Background: In the middle of last century, it was considered that tropical rainforest covers around 12.8 % of Mexico, but today this area is mainly occupied by agricultural lands, prairies, and secondary vegetation while just a little portion has mature forested vegetation. One of the more serious troubles in the Lacandon region, is the decrease of its rainforest area, because of a hard colonization process, expansion of communication paths, excessive logging, and incorporation of new rainforest areas to the agricultural and livestock production.
   This study was conducted in the Lacandon Community Naha, located at the north of the Lacandon rain forest, at the Municipality of Ocosingo, Chiapas, where some areas with mature rain forest are found and the rest is subject to traditional diversified and intensified use.
   Research question: How are structure and composition in the relicts of mature or well-preserved vegetation in the tropical rainforest of the Lacandon Community Naha? Study site and period of research: This study was conducted in the Lacandon Community Naha, located at the north of the Lacandon rain forest, at the Municipality of Ocosingo, Chiapas, from November 1993 to May 1995.
   Methods: Inside the lands of this community, we conducted 25 vegetation samplings in plots of 400 m(2) each (a hectare in total) in mature fragments of the rainforest. The evaluated structural traits were: floristic composition, density, frequency, basal area, and height. We calculated the importance value of the species in the community and its relative contribution in the six forest strata recognized with the help of lacandon informants.
   Results: We found 283 species of vascular plants in the total sampled area, belonging to 199 genera and 84 families. The structural analysis of vegetation corroborated the presence of six recognized forest strata, with distinctive height, floristic composition, and life forms. Density in the studied hectare was 15,632 individuals, and the absolute basal area 136.78 m(2). The importance value allowed to define the relative importance of the species in each stratum, according to the field observations. Terminalia amazonia records the highest importance value in all the strata.
   Conclusions: It was possible to describe with detail the tropical rain forest in Naha. The assistance of lacandon informants was crucial to recognize the zones with mature rainforest and their strata. There is an inverse relationship between density and basal area. The importance to evaluate in a quantitatively way the relicts of mature or well-preserved vegetation is highlighted as an indispensable reference to rehabilitate degraded areas, or to apply corrective actions for adequate advantage.

AB Wood ants are common in coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests of the Palaearctic ecozone. We conducted a survey of wood-ant mounds in an area of 1400 ha in the Bialowieza Forest (NE Poland) and related physical mound characteristics to the surrounding forest properties. The overall density of inhabited wood-ant mounds was 0.13 per ha. Formica polyctena and F. rufa were the most abundant species, and the highest densities of their mounds were found in fresh mixed deciduous and fresh mixed coniferous forests. The physical mound properties, such as direction of the longest mound slope and the distance to the closest tree did not differ significantly between these two ant species. Amount of light significantly affected mound size and the distance to the closest tree distance: mound diameter, height and volume increased with increasing shade; and the distance to the closest tree with increasing amount of light. The results of our study suggest that coniferous forests with an admixture of deciduous trees are best for maintaining wood-ant populations.

AB Soil and water conservation (SWC) practices in the northern highlands of Ethiopia have important implications for land restoration and biodiversity recovery. The present study determined soil macroinvertebrate (SMI) abundance and diversity in response to spatial conditions i.e., generated by different conservation practices, soil depth, and temporal seasonality with the wet and dry season. The SWC practices considered were exclosure + terrace, exclosure alone, terraces, and non-conserved grazing lands. Each SWC measure was selected in three sites that were considered as replications due to low heterogeneity in terms of human and livestock disturbances and biophysical factors. Soil macroinvertebrates were collected using a monolith according to tropical soil biology and fertility (TSBF) method. The highest density (55%) of SMI was found in exclosures followed by terraces 26%. Non-conserved communal grazing lands account for only 19% of the total. Shannon diversity index was significantly (P < 0.05) higher (1.21) in the exclosures supported with terraces and the lowest (0.9) was observed in the non-conserved communal grazing lands. Diversity was also significantly (P < 0.05) higher (1.26) in wet than dry season (0.70). The highest (41%) Sorensen similarity index among SMI was found between exclosures with terraces and exclosures alone during the wet season. The lowest (20%) Sorensen similarity index was found between terraces alone and exclosures with terraces in dry season. Soil macroinvertebrate abundance was higher in upper (0-10 cm) than lower (10-20 and 20-30 cm) soil depth. Soil macroinvertebrate abundance was positively and strongly correlated with soil moisture (R-2 = 0.85) and soil organic carbon stock (R-2 = 0.95). However, it was negatively (R-2 = -0.71) correlated with bulk density. Generally, the abundance and diversity of SMI increased as exclosures and communal grazing lands are supported with terraces.

This study aims to assess the effects of calcium (Ca) and soil base saturation (V%) on the growth of seedlings of eight tree species native to the Atlantic Forest biome and commonly used in restoration plantings in the study region. Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse over a period of four months in Haplic Arenosol dystric soil with low calcium content and high aluminum saturation, and were subjected to four different treatments: (i) control; (ii) lime addition until V%=40 (V40); (iii) lime addition until V%= 70 (V70); (iv) addition of calcium chloride and magnesium until V%= 70 (VMg70). On average, seedlings treated only with lime (V40 and V70) gave similar results, showing an increase in both shoot and root dry plant biomass. Different absorption by species belonging to different successional groups were observed. Pioneer and early secondary species showed similar behavior regarding nutrient use efficiency. Seedling fertilization increases the chances of success of restoration plantings in degraded areas by favoring seedling biomass gain and nutrient absorption, and increasing overall V% through lime fertilization. The patterns for pioneer and secondary species found in this study could contribute to decision making in restoration projects and to native seedling production of white-sand forest native species.

AB Effective biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of the drivers of natural resource use. Few studies, however, have examined how motivations of natural resource users and attributes of local social organizations affect resource extraction over time. We aimed to identify which characteristics of individuals (taboos, food security, resource-related income), groups (village size, ease of access to education, proximity to park), and institutions (presence of enforcement mechanisms) best predicted use of multiple types of natural resources near a protected area during the past 1.5years and during respondents' lifetimes. Data were collected in 2013 via semi-structured interviews with 360 people across ten villages along the perimeter of Ankarana National Park (northern Madagascar). All recent and lifetime uses of natural resources examined were higher in villages close to the park and for respondents with a history of earning money from extracting natural resources. In addition, individuals with ancestral meat-related taboos were less likely to have extracted natural resources over their lifetime, while individuals who recently consumed meat were more likely to have extracted natural resources over the past 1.5years. All other variables were less important in explaining the use of natural resources. The results highlight that some drivers can be consistently important in predicting natural resource use and that simple models can have relatively high explanatory power even in the context of the (sometimes) illegal extraction of five different types of natural resources.

AB While bushmeat hunting is critical to the livelihoods of millions of people throughout the tropical world, it is also a major threat to wildlife conservation. Assessing the sustainability of hunting has been a major goal in conservation biology but developing methods that accurately predict patterns of prey depletion has proven notoriously problematic. In this study, we sought to assess the sustainability of the hunting of indigenous Waiwai in Guyana by comparing results from the most commonly used static sustainability index, the production model, with results from spatially explicit biodemographic models for three indicator species; tapirs Tapirus terrestris, spider monkeys Ateles paniscus, and curassows Crax alector. Our goals were to (1) assess how conclusions about sustainability differ between the two methods and (2) to determine the suitability of biodemographic modeling for nonprimate taxa. We used hunter-self monitoring data to calculate annual harvest and to estimate parameters for biodemographic models. The production model indicated that all three species were being overharvested, with T.terrestris harvested at six times the sustainable rate. In contrast, biodemographic models indicated that each species would persist in the Waiwai catchment area in 20years (although A.paniscus would be close to extirpation), even if the Waiwai population increased by 64% and shifted to all shotgun hunting. Predicted densities for A.paniscus and C.alector were statistically indistinguishable from empirically derived encounter rates and those for T.terrestris were consistent with the locations of Waiwai kills, demonstrating the robustness of the model. While the weaknesses of static sustainability indices are well documented, they continue to be used and conclusions based on their results are still cited and influential in determining conservation policy. Our study demonstrates that biodemographic models perform far better than static indices and that the biodemographic approach is robust for a range of different prey species.

AB Over the last 20 years, Uganda has emerged as a testing ground for the various modes of carbon forestry used in Africa. Carbon forestry initiatives in Uganda raise questions of justice, given that people with comparatively negligible carbon footprints are affected by land use changes initiated by the desire of wealthy people, firms, and countries to reduce their more extensive carbon footprints. This paper examines the notions of justice local people express in relation to two contrasting carbon forestry projects in Uganda, the Mount Elgon Uganda Wildlife Authority- Forests Absorbing Carbon Emissions (UWA-FACE) project and Trees for Global Benefit (TFGB). UWA-FACE closed down its initial operations at Mount Elgon after 10 years as a result of deep controversies and negative international publicity, whereas TFGB is regarded by many as an exemplary design for smallholder carbon forestry in Africa. Our approach builds upon an emerging strand in the literature, of empirical analyses of local people's notions of justice related to environmental interventions. The main contribution of the paper is to examine how people's notions of justice have influenced divergent project outcomes in these cases. In particular, we highlight the relative success of TFGB in the way it meets people's primarily distributional concerns, apparently without significantly challenging prevalent expectations of recognition or procedural justice. In contrast, we illuminate how controversy across the range of justice dimensions in UWA-FACE at Mount Elgon ultimately led to the project's decline. This paper therefore explores how attention to notions of justice can contribute to a fuller understanding of the reactions of people to carbon forestry projects, as well as the pathways and ultimate outcomes of such interventions.

AB Aim: To test the importance of alternative diversification drivers and biogeographical processes for the evolution of Amazonian upland forest birds through a densely sampled analysis of diversification of the endemic Amazonian genus Rhegmatorhina at multiple taxonomic and temporal scales.
   Location: Amazonia.
   Taxon: Antbirds (Thamnophilidae).
   Methods: We sequenced four mtDNA and nuclear gene regions of 120 individuals from 50 localities representing all recognized species and subspecies of the genus. We performed molecular phylogenetic analyses using both gene tree and species tree methods, molecular dating analysis and estimated population demographic history and gene flow.
   Results: Dense sampling throughout the distribution of Rhegmatorhina revealed that the main Amazonian rivers delimit the geographic distribution of taxa as inferred from mtDNA lineages. Molecular phylogenetic analyses resulted in a strongly supported phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus, with two main clades currently separated by the Madeira River. Molecular dating analysis indicated diversification during the Quaternary. Reconstruction of recent demographic history of populations revealed a trend for population expansion in eastern Amazonia and stability in the west. Estimates of gene flow corroborate the possibility that migration after divergence had some influence on the current patterns of diversity.
   Main Conclusions: Based on broad-scale sampling, a clarification of taxonomic boundaries, and strongly supported phylogenetic relationships, we confirm that, first, mitochondrial lineages within this upland forest Amazonian bird genus agree with spatial patterns known for decades based on phenotypes, and second, that most lineages are geographically delimited by the large Amazonian rivers. The association between past demographic changes related to palaeoclimatic cycles and the historically varying strength and size of rivers as barriers to dispersal may be the path to the answer to the long-standing question of identifying the main drivers of Amazonian diversification.

AB Aim: The Mexican Transition Zone (MTZ) is an area where the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographical regions overlap, generating high species richness and endemism. The objective of this study was to analyse if potential changes in the composition and the geographical location of areas of endemism (AEs) for beetles and mammals during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the mid-Holocene (MH) or the Last Interglacial (LIG) have influenced the definition of the MTZ in the present.
   Location: Mexico and Central America.
   Methods: Ecological niche models (ENM) were generated describing the current distribution of 218 species associated with the MTZ and then transferred to three periods into the past. A parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) was run to identify current AEs. The transferred models of each set of species that form the current AEs were used to assess if the geographical ranges of the species' ecological niches changed over time, or whether they remained stable supporting the validation of the AEs during three past recent periods (LGM, MH and LIG).
   Results: Two current AEs were detected that persisted geographically during the three past periods (LGM, MH and LIG).
   Main conclusions: The results show that some AEs change through time as a response of climate, whereas others remained stable. Thus, the MTZ could be considered as a dynamic zone at least over the last 130,000 years. The climate analysis of the AEs allows them to be recognized either as true spatio-temporal units, or as temporarily restricted patterns of co-distribution resulting from changes in climate over time.

AB The South Lake Worth Inlet Sand Transfer Plant in Palm Beach County, Florida pumps subtidal sediment from the upcurrent to the downcurrent side of the jetty to correct jetty-induced sediment transport disruption. This pumping accounts for 35% of the overall net longshore transport. We investigated if living macrofauna could survive the sediment pumping process. We also examined the effects this activity had on the subtidal macro faunal invertebrate communities. Subtidal sediment cores were taken near the intake pipe, at the outflow pipe, and just outside the direct effects of the sand transfer plant. Benthic macrofauna and sand grain size were examined and compared. Macrofauna, live and preserved, were confirmed exiting the outflow pipe. Low diversity, low abundance macrofaunal communities were found at all sample sites. Macrofaunal abundance was primarily isopods (79%) and polychaetes (14%). Three isopod and one polychaete species constituted 89% of the community diversity. Both inflow borrow pit and outflow deposition sampling sites exhibited different community structure compared to adjacent control sites. The inflow borrow pit presented a high population of the isopod Eurydice personata. The outflow deposition site had the highest species diversity. The outflow deposition site also showed much coarser mean sediment grain size compared to other sites. The differences found at the sites direct associated with the sand transfer plant demonstrated localized disturbance. We concluded that although the plant disturbs the adjacent community it also helps maintain the macrofaunal community structure and sand grain size on the downdrift side of the South Lake Worth Inlet. Further studies integrating abiotic and biotic components will assist in management practices and our understanding of nearshore systems.

AB Variation in seed availability shapes plant communities, and is strongly affected by seed predation. In some plant species, temporal variation in seed production is especially high and synchronized over large areas, which is called 'mast seeding'. One selective advantage of this phenomenon is predator satiation which posits that masting helps plants escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, and satiation in mast years. However, even though seed predation can be predicted to have a strong spatial component and depend on plant densities, whether the effectiveness of predator satiation in masting plants changes according to the Janzen-Connell effect has been barely investigated. We studied, over an 8-year period, the seed production, the spatiotemporal patters of weevil seed predation, and the abundance of adult weevils in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) population that consists of trees interspersed at patches covering a continuum of conspecific density. Isolated oaks effectively satiate predators, but this is trumped by increasing conspecific plant density. Lack of predator satiation in trees growing in dense patches was caused by re-distribution of insects among plants that likely attenuated them against food shortage in lean years, and changed the type of weevil functional response from type II in isolated trees to type III in trees growing in dense patches. This study provides the first empirical evaluation of the notion that masting and predator satiation should be more important in populations that start to dominate their communities, and is consistent with the observation that masting is less frequent and less intense in diverse forests.

AB Vegetation in the transition between tropical forest and savanna is hyperdynamic and there is evidence that in the absence of fire, forest advances over savanna. Between 2008 and 2013 we evaluated changes in species composition and diversity and in the structure of the woody vegetation of savanna physiognomies in the transition between the Cerrado and Amazon biomes that were fire free for 11 years. The physiognomies form a gradient from savanna woodland (Typical Cerrado - TC), to low woodland (Dense Cerrado - DC), to woodland (locally called Cerradao - CO). We hypothesise that: 1) the more open physiognomies (TC and DC) are more dynamic compared to the closed physiognomy (CO); and 2) in the absence of fire vegetation tends to become more forested. We found that: 1) TC was more dynamic (e.g. greater increases in richness, diversity, and abundance of plants and basal area) than CO and DC; 2) The three physiognomies experienced an increase in basal area and abundance of individuals, but only certain key species contributed to these increases. These results indicate that the open physiognomies were more dynamic than the closed physiognomies, and in the absence of fire the savanna physiognomies became more forested and accumulated biomass.

AB In order to better explore the maintenance mechanisms of biodiversity, data collected from a 40-ha undisturbed Pinus forest were applied to the Individual Species-Area Relationship model (ISAR) to determine distribution patterns for species richness. The ecological processes influencing species abundance distribution patterns were assessed by applying the same data set to five models: a Log-Normal Model (LNM), a Broken Stick Model (BSM), a Zipf Model (ZM), a Niche Preemption Model (NPM), and a Neutral Model (NM). Each of the five models was used at six different sampling scales (10 m x 10 m, 20 m x 20 m, 40 m x 40 m, 60 m x 60 m, 80 m x 80 m, and 100 m x 100 m). Model outputs showed that: (1) Accumulators and neutral species strongly influenced species diversity, but the relative importance of the two types of species varied across spatial scales. (2) Distribution patterns of species abundance were best explained by the NPM at small scales (10 m-20 m), whereas the NM was the best fit model at large spatial scales. (3) Species richness and abundance distribution patterns appeared to be driven by similar ecological processes. At small scales, the niche theory could be applied to describe species richness and abundance, while at larger scales the neutral theory was more applicable.

AB There has been increasing attention to and investment in local environmental stewardship in conservation and environmental management policies and programs globally. Yet environmental stewardship has not received adequate conceptual attention. Establishing a clear definition and comprehensive analytical framework could strengthen our ability to understand the factors that lead to the success or failure of environmental stewardship in different contexts and how to most effectively support and enable local efforts. Here we propose such a definition and framework. First, we define local environmental stewardship as the actions taken by individuals, groups or networks of actors, with various motivations and levels of capacity, to protect, care for or responsibly use the environment in pursuit of environmental and/or social outcomes in diverse social-ecological contexts. Next, drawing from a review of the environmental stewardship, management and governance literatures, we unpack the elements of this definition to develop an analytical framework that can facilitate research on local environmental stewardship. Finally, we discuss potential interventions and leverage points for promoting or supporting local stewardship and future applications of the framework to guide descriptive, evaluative, prescriptive or systematic analysis of environmental stewardship. Further application of this framework in diverse environmental and social contexts is recommended to refine the elements and develop insights that will guide and improve the outcomes of environmental stewardship initiatives and investments. Ultimately, our aim is to raise the profile of environmental stewardship as a valuable and holistic concept for guiding productive and sustained relationships with the environment.

AB Herbivory has significant impacts on individual plants and plant communities, both at ecological and evolutionary time scales. In this context, this study aims to evaluate herbivore damage and its relationship with leaf chemical and structural traits, nutritional status, and forest structural complexity along a successional gradient. We predicted that trees in early successional stages support conservative traits related to drought tolerance (high specific leaf mass and phenolics), whereas trees in light-limited, late successional stages tend to enhance light acquisition strategies (high nitrogen content). We sampled 261 trees from 26 species in 15 plots (50 x 20 m; five per successional stage). From each tree, twenty leaves were collected for leaf trait measures. Phenolic content increased whereas specific leaf mass and nitrogen content decreased from early to late stages. However, leaf damage did not differ among successional stages. Our results partially corroborate the hypothesis that early successional plants in tropical dry forests exhibit leaf traits involved in the conservative use of water. The unexpected decrease in nitrogen content along the chronosequence is likely related to the fact that thinner leaves with low specific leaf mass could have less nitrogen-containing mesophyll per unit area. Mechanisms affecting herbivory intensity varied across scales: at the species level, leaf damage was negatively correlated with tannin concentration and specific leaf mass; at the plot level, leaf damage was positively affected by forest structural complexity. Herbivory patterns in tropical forests are difficult to detect because abiotic factors and multiple top-down and bottom-up forces directly and indirectly affect herbivores.

AB Interspecific competition can strongly influence community structure and limit the distribution and abundance of species. One of the main factors that determine hummingbird community structure is competition for food. The temporal and spatial distribution of nectar has a strong impact on hummingbird assemblages, shaping foraging niches according to hummingbird dominance and foraging strategy. We investigated whether body size and the degree of aggressive dominance influence feeding behaviour of hummingbirds in a temperate forest in northwestern Mexico (El Palmito, Mexico) when winter migrant hummingbirds are present in the community. First, we determined the dominance status of hummingbirds and evaluated the relationship between dominance and body mass, wing disc loading and migratory status. Secondly, we determined how hummingbird species used plant species differently. Thirdly, we examined whether the most dominant hummingbird species defended floral patches with more energy and/or with a larger number of flowers. At each flower patch, hummingbird species, number of hummingbird interactions, feeding time and number of flowers present were recorded. The total number of calories available within each floral patch was also determined. Our results demonstrate that the dominance hierarchy of 13 hummingbird species (migratory and resident) was correlated with body size but not wing disc loading, and that members of the hummingbird community showed a clear separation in resource use (by plant species). Hummingbirds at the top of the dominance hierarchy defended and fed on the best flower patches, defined by the quantity of calories available. Hence, the feeding behaviour of hummingbirds at El Palmito depends on the abundance of plant species used by hummingbirds and on the amount of energy available from each flower patch. Thus, hummingbird body size, aggressive dominance and defence of quality flower patches determines niche partitioning among species.

AB Successfully implemented payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs can provide both conservation of nature and financial support to rural communities. In this paper, we explore how PES programs can be designed so as to maximize the amount of additional ecosystem services provided for a given budget. We also provide a brief summary of the use of auction mechanisms in real world PES programs. To explore the potential additionality of different PES program designs we use a conceptual agent based simulation model where payments are either fixed, or set through a uniform or discriminatory auction. The program can also be designed to target payments to land-owners based on their provision of ecosystem services. Theoretically, auctions should be the most effective design, especially if payments are differentiated and targeted by ecosystem service provision. However, what we find is that the context in which the PES program is implemented baseline compliance with program standards among the participants, correlation between opportunity costs and ecosystem services in the landscape, heterogeneity in costs and budget size has a determining impact on the relative effectiveness of the different payment designs, with fixed payments schemes being much more effective than auctions in certain settings. Our findings suggest that context should be taken into serious consideration when a PES program design is chosen.

AB While the literature on ecological economics often notes the importance of institutions, there has been less attention to the ways in which these institutions are created in practice. We contribute to the literature on institutions in ecological economics by examining the practice of institutional creation in the context of the literature on Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). While a large literature outlines ideal PES models, PES literature tends to overlook the demanding everyday work involved in building and maintaining the institutions upon which successful PES models depend. Drawing on the theory of institutional work, we conduct an extensive survey of the literature on PES to find examples of everyday work undertaken to build and maintain PES institutions, or else to disrupt institutions that stand in the way. Finding very limited discussion of the work of institutional creation, we present a case study of efforts to develop Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, identifying numerous examples of institutional work essential to the initiative. We suggest that institutional work, with its highly developed typologies of actions involved in institutional creation, can be a helpful tool for critical institutionalist studies of ecological economics.

AB Small forest patches embedded in agricultural (and peri-urban) landscapes in Western Europe play a key role for biodiversity conservation with a recognized capacity of delivering a wide suite of ecosystem services. Measures aimed to preserve these patches should be both socially desirable and ecologically effective. This study presents a joint ecologic and economic assessment conducted on small forest patches in Flanders (Belgium) and Picardie (N France). In each study region, two contrasted types of agricultural landscapes were selected. Open field (OF) and Bocage (B) landscapes are distinguished by the intensity of their usage and higher connectivity in the B landscapes. The social demand for enhancing biodiversity and forest structure diversity as well as for increasing the forest area at the expenses of agricultural land is estimated through an economic valuation survey. These results are compared with the outcomes of an ecological survey where the influence of structural features of the forest patches on the associated herbaceous diversity is assessed. The ecological and economic surveys show contrasting results; increasing tree species richness is ecologically more important for herbaceous diversity in the patch, but both tree species richness and herbaceous diversity obtain insignificant willingness to pay estimates. Furthermore, although respondents prefer the proposed changes to take place in the region where they live, we find out that social preferences and ecological effectiveness do differ between landscapes that represent different intensities of land use. Dwellers where the landscape is perceived as more "degraded" attach more value to diversity enhancement, suggesting a prioritization of initiatives in these area. In contrast, the ecological analyses show that prioritizing the protection and enhancement of the relatively better-off areas is more ecologically effective. Our study calls for a balance between ecological effectiveness and welfare benefits, suggesting that cost effectiveness studies should consider these approaches jointly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Commercial hunting for the international trade in animal hides in the 20th century decimated many populations of aquatic wildlife in Amazonia. However, impacts varied significantly between different species and regions, depending upon hunting intensity, accessibility of habitat, and the inherent resilience of various species and their habitats. We investigated the differential responses of two Amazonian Mustelid species, the neotropical otter and giant otter, to commercial hunting pressure along the upper Rio Negro in Brazil, and examined historical factors that influenced spatial and temporal variation in commercial exploitation. We analyzed previously unanalyzed data from historical records of hide shipments to track changes in hide sales and prices for the two species in the late 20th century. We also gathered oral histories from older Baniwa people who had witnessed or participated in commercial otter hunting. These complimentary data sources reveal how intrinsic biological and social characteristics of the two otter species interacted with market forces and regional history. Whereas giant otter populations were driven to local or regional extinction during the late 20th century by commercial hunting, neotropical otters persisted. In recent decades, giant otter populations have returned to some parts of the upper Rio Negro, a development which local people welcome as part of a generalized recovery of the ecosystems in their territory as a result of the banning of animal pelt exports and indigenous land demarcation. This paper expands the scope of the field historical ecology and reflects on the role of local knowledge in biodiversity conservation.

AB Understanding how anthropogenic disturbance influences patterns of community composition and the reinforcing interactive processes that structure communities is important to mitigate threats to biodiversity. Competition is considered a primary reinforcing process, yet little is known concerning disturbance effects on competitive interaction networks. We examined how differences in ant community composition between undisturbed and disturbed Bornean rainforest, is potentially reflected by changes in competitive interactions over a food resource. Comparing 10 primary forest sites to 10 in selectively-logged forest, we found higher genus richness and diversity in the primary forest, with 18.5% and 13.0% of genera endemic to primary and logged respectively. From 180 hours of filming bait cards, we assessed ant-ant interactions, finding that despite considered aggression over food sources, the majority of ant interactions were neutral. Proportion of competitive interactions at bait cards did not differ between forest type, however, the rate and per capita number of competitive interactions was significantly lower in logged forest. Furthermore, the majority of genera showed large changes in aggression-score with often inverse relationships to their occupancy rank. This provides evidence of a shuffled competitive network, and these unexpected changes in aggressive relationships could be considered a type of competitive network re-wiring after disturbance.

AB Most coral-associated decapod species have non-migratory adult populations and depend on their planktonic larvae for dispersal. This study examined the metapopulation structure of three decapod species with different pelagic larval duration (PLD) from twelve coral reef complexes of the Gulf of Mexico. The dispersion of larvae was analyzed through the use of a realistic numerical simulation of the Gulf of Mexico with the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model. To study the transport and dispersion of particles in near-surface waters, a particle-tracking subroutine was run using as input the currents from the model. The simulation consisted of the launch of 100 passive particles (virtual larvae) every 24 hours from each reef throughout five years, and tracked for as long as 210 days. Results indicated that species with a short PLD, Mithraculus sculptus (PLD 8-13 days), had a weak connection among the reefs, but higher self-recruitment, especially on the narrow western shelf. The species with a longer PLD, Dromia erythropus (28-30 days), had a stronger connection among neighboring reefs (< 300 km). Finally, the species with an even longer PLD, Stenopus hispidus (123-210 days), had a wider potential distribution than the other species. Circulation on synoptic, seasonal and interannual scales had differential effects on the larval dispersal of each species. The metapopulation structure of M. sculptus and D. erythropus seemed to combine features of the non-equilibrium and the patchy models, whereas that of S. hispidus presumably fit to a patchy model. These findings support previous observations that indicate that species with longer PLD tend to occupy larger areas than species with short PLD, although recruitment of juveniles to the adult populations will also depend on other factors, such as the availability of suitable habitats and the ability to colonize them.

AB Eco-compensation is the most important form of compensatory conservation in China. However, this compensatory mechanism is criticized for vague definition and massive government participation. For better understanding of eco-compensation in China, this paper compares theories and practices of compensatory mechanisms in China and abroad. The analysis of theoretical backgrounds shows that eco-compensation in China is a combination of 'ecological compensation' and 'payments for ecosystem services'. Ten compensatory projects in China and abroad are assessed to reveal characteristics and problems of eco-compensation in China. The results show that compensatory projects in China lagged behind mature foreign compensatory projects in clarity of property rights, responsibility fulfillment, executive efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and equality. The massive participation of the government is the major reason for the poor performance of compensatory projects in China. However, government participation is necessary at the present stage in China for the income gap and beneficiaries' low willingness to pay. For the improvement of eco-compensation in China, suggestions are given on the choice of non-market valuation methods, the creation of property rights and the establishment of market mechanisms.

AB Phosphorus availability is widely assumed to limit primary productivity in tropical forests(1,2), but support for this paradigm is equivocal(3). Although biogeochemical theory predicts that phosphorus limitation should be prevalent on old, strongly weathered soils(4,5), experimental manipulations have failed to detect a consistent response to phosphorus addition in species-rich lowland tropical forests(6-9). Here we show, by quantifying the growth of 541 tropical tree species across a steep natural phosphorus gradient in Panama, that phosphorus limitation is widespread at the level of individual species and strengthens markedly below a threshold of two parts per million exchangeable soil phosphate. However, this pervasive species-specific phosphorus limitation does not translate into a community-wide response, because some species grow rapidly on infertile soils despite extremely low phosphorus availability. These results redefine our understanding of nutrient limitation in diverse plant communities and have important implications for attempts to predict the response of tropical forests to environmental change.

AB Wood anatomical features such as vessels record paleo climatic and environmental signals through their physiological adjustment during the environmental stress condition. Using vessel features as environmental proxy is relatively new in tropical dendrochronology but very useful to study plant ecophysiological responses to changing environmental conditions. Here, we developed the first vessel chronologies of diffuse porous Chukrasia tabularis from a Bangladeshi moist tropical forest and assessed their suitability for Dendroclimatic and ecophysiological studies in moist tropical forests. Standard chronologies of ring-width (RW), vessel number (NV), mean vessel area (MVA), total vessel area (TVA), total vessel area % (TVAP), mean vessel tangential diameter (MVTD), mean vessel radial diameter (MVRD), and vessel density (VD) were developed which spanned the period 1925-2015. Principal component analysis revealed that all chronologies were related among each other, the first two principal axis explaining 80% of the common variance. Hence, all chronologies shared a common environmental signal, except TVAP and MVRD which were excluded from further dendroclimatic analysis. Bootstrap correlation function was used to test the relationship between the chronologies and climate variables over 1950-2015. All chronologies were significantly correlated with monthly, seasonal and annual climate variables but varied in their magnitude. Spring temperatures (March-April) and late monsoon precipitation had the dominant influence on the vessel features and radial growth of Chukrasia tabularis. Decreased vessel area (Hydraulic efficiency) and increased vessel density (Hydraulic safety) were observed in response to stress environmental condition particularly in the spring (hot and dry) when evapotranspiration became higher and soil moisture deficit occurs due to high temperatures. Moving correlation functions revealed stable climate tree-ring variable relationships during March-April and October with an increasing tendency of climate interaction in other months. Our study shows that vessel features in Chukrasia tabularis are highly sensitive to inter-annual climate variability and can be used for paleoclimatic and ecophysiological studies in moist tropical forests.

AB Studies have shown the potential for rapid adaptation in coevolving populations and that the structure of species interaction networks can modulate the vulnerability of ecological systems to perturbations. Although the feedback loop between population dynamics and coevolution of traits is crucial for understanding long-term stability in ecological assemblages, modelling ecoevolutionary dynamics in species-rich assemblages is still a challenge. We explore how eco-evolutionary feedbacks influence trait evolution and species abundances in 23 empirical antagonistic networks. We show that, if selection due to antagonistic interactions is stronger than other selective pressures, ecoevolutionary feedbacks lead to higher mean species abundances and lower temporal variation in abundances. By contrast, strong selection of antagonistic interactions leads to higher temporal variation of traits and on interaction strengths. Our results present a theoretical link between the study of the species persistence and coevolution in networks of interacting species, pointing out the ways by which coevolution may decrease the vulnerability of species within antagonistic networks to demographic fluctuation.

AB Domestication studies traditionally focus on the differences in morphological characteristics between wild and domesticated populations that are under direct selection, the components of the domestication syndrome. Here, we consider that other aspects can be modified, because of the interdependence between plant characteristics and the forces of natural selection. We investigated the ongoing domestication of Pourouma cecropiifolia populations cultivated by the Ticuna people in Western Amazonia, using traditional and ecological approaches. We compared fruit characteristics between wild and domesticated populations to quantify the direct effects of domestication. To examine the characteristics that are not under direct selection and the correlated effects of human selection and natural selection, we investigated the differences in vegetative characteristics, changes in seed: fruit allometric relations and the relations of these characteristics with variation in environmental conditions summarized in a principal component analysis. Domestication generated great changes in fruit characteristics, as expected in fruit crops. The fruits of domesticated plants had 20x greater mass and twice as much edible pulp as wild fruits. The plant height:DBH ratio and wood density were, respectively, 42% and 22% smaller in domesticated populations, probably in response to greater luminosity and higher sand content of the cultivated landscapes. Seed: fruit allometry was modified by domestication: although domesticated plants have heavier seeds, the domesticated fruits have proportionally (46%) smaller seed mass compared to wild fruits. The high light availability and poor soils of cultivated landscapes may have contributed to seed mass reduction, while human selection promoted seed mass increase in correlation with fruit mass increase. These contrasting effects generated a proportionately smaller increase in seed mass in domesticated plants. In this study, it was not possible to clearly dissociate the environmental effects from the domestication effects in changes in morphological characteristics, because the environmental conditions were intensively modified by human management, showing that plant domestication is intrinsically related to landscape domestication. Our results suggest that evaluation of environmental conditions together with human selection on domesticated phenotypes provide a better understanding of the changes generated by domestication in plants.

AB Background: In Amazonia, primates are not only an important food source but they also hold significant cultural and symbolic value for many indigenous groups. We document the relationship between primates and community members of the Maijuna indigenous community of Sucusari in the Peruvian Amazon and describe how ethnoprimatological studies provide a better understanding of the significance of primates in people's lives. Additionally, we explore how ethnoprimatological studies can help inform and enhance primate conservation initiatives.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 residents of the community of Sucusari to assess the classification, cultural significance and traditional uses, beliefs, ceremonies and stories of primates within the Sucusari River basin.
   Results: Primates play an important role in the lives of individuals in the Sucusari community. They are distinguished by their arboreal lifestyle, and among the 11 species reported in the area, seven (Lagothrix lagotricha, Alouatta seniculus, Pithecia monachus, Callicebus spp., Saimiri sciureus, Leontocebus nigricollis) are highly recognized and culturally salient. Primates are used as food, medicine, pets, domestic tools and in the production of handicrafts. They are primarily hunted for local consumption, with larger primates such as L. lagotricha being preferred. Lagothrix lagotricha was also the most commonly reported pet species and the only observed pet primate in the community during surveys. Maijuna traditional beliefs include ancestral dietary taboos for A. seniculus, which are referred to as sorcerer monkeys, but this taboo is no longer fully adhered to. Maijuna traditional stories associated with primates describe the origin of primates found in Sucusari.
   Conclusion: Primates are embedded in the intricate sociocultural system of the community of Sucusari. Better understanding the relationship between primates and people can help to focus conservation efforts on primate species of particularly high sociocultural importance as well as ecological value, such as L. lagotricha. We highly recommend the inclusion of ethnoprimatological studies into primate conservation initiatives to accomplish more effective conservation planning, ultimately integrating the goals of biodiversity conservation with the cultural and economic needs of indigenous and local communities.

AB Species that coexist in diverse natural communities interact in complex ways that alter each other's abundances and affect selection on each other's traits. Consequently, predicting trait evolution in natural communities may require understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics involving a number of species. In August 2016, the American Society of Naturalists sponsored a symposium to explore evolution in a community context, focusing on microevolutionary processes. Here we provide an introduction to our perspectives on this topic by defining the context and describing some examples of when and how microevolutionary responses to multiple species may differ from evolution in isolation or in two-species communities. We find that indirect ecological and evolutionary effects can result in nonadditive selection and evolution that cannot be predicted from pairwise interactions. Genetic correlations of ecological traits in one species can alter trait evolution and adaptation aswell as the abundances of other species. In general, evolution in multispecies communities can change ecological interactions, which then feed back to future evolutionary changes in ways that depend on these indirect effects. We suggest avenues for future research in this field, including determining the circumstances under which pairwise evolution does not adequately describe evolutionary trajectories.

AB Abundant and species rich oribatid mite faunas live as ant associates in red wood ant nest mounds. Distribution of oribatids (as of many other groups) within mounds is unknown, yet there is an indication that many oribatid species favor moist microclimates. The ant mounds typically have a relatively dry core covered by a moister surface layer, but the moisture variance of mound parts has rarely been verified by measurements. We measured the moisture variance of nine Formica polyctena mounds (surface, rim, core) located in three different forest types in Finland. The moisture may affect the mounds' temperature maintenance, and we further investigated this relationship. We also hypothesised that the abundance, species richness and community composition of oribatids may be related to the moisture, and investigated these differences between the mound parts and forest types. The moisture varied significantly between the mound parts; moisture was highest in surface followed by rim and core. The surface moisture had a positive relationship with nest core temperature. A total of 18,614 oribatid mites belonging to 93 species and one higher taxon were recorded. The oribatids occurred predominantly on the surface (77.9%), followed by the rim (16.6%) and the core (5.5%) of the ant nest mounds. The abundance and species richness of oribatids was positively related to moisture and differed significantly between the mound parts and forest types. The mound volume had no effect on moisture, temperature or mite community composition. The results indicate that the moisture harbored in the surface layer of ant nest mounds is a vital factor for maintaining rich oribatid mite communities within mounds.

AB Africa's savannas are undergoing rapid conversion from rangelands into villages and croplands. Despite limited research, and evidence of deleterious effects to biodiversity, international organisations have earmarked this system for cropland. Invertebrates, and ants in particular, are sensitive indicators of habitat fragmentation, and contribute to ecosystem services at a range of scales. We investigated how rangelands, villages and croplands differ in ant species and functional diversity, and assemblage composition. We sampled ants using pitfall traps at 42 sites (14 replicates each in rangeland, cropland, and village) in northern South African savannas. We investigated the impact of landuse, season, and multiple soil and vegetation habitat variables on ant species diversity, assemblages and functional diversity. Rangelands had the greatest ant species richness, particularly in the wet season. Richness declined with increasing soil clay content. Ant assemblages were distinctly different between landuse types. Rangeland harboured the widest diversity of indicator species, and contained greatest functional diversity. Rangelands accommodated more scavengers, granivores, and plant-matter feeders than cropland, and representation of these groups varied with season. Ants play essential roles in soil nutrient cycling, plant and seedling recruitment, and impact other arthropods through predation and aphidoculous behaviour that in turn influences entire food webs. Thus, the reduced species richness, changes in assemblage composition and the loss of functional groups in ant assemblages found in cropland and villages is potentially problematic. Left unchallenged, these new forms of landuse threaten to characterise the entire African savanna system, impacting not only future ecological, but possibly also human wellbeing.

AB Co-occurrence methods are increasingly utilized in ecology to infer networks of species interactions where detailed knowledge based on empirical studies is difficult to obtain. Their use is particularly common, but not restricted to, microbial networks constructed from metagenomic analyses. In this study, we test the efficacy of this procedure by comparing an inferred network constructed using spatially intensive co-occurrence data from the rocky intertidal zone in central Chile to a well-resolved, empirically based, species interaction network from the same region. We evaluated the overlap in the information provided by each network and the extent to which there is a bias for co-occurrence data to better detect known trophic or non-trophic, positive or negative interactions. We found a poor correspondence between the co-occurrence network and the known species interactions with overall sensitivity (probability of true link detection) equal to 0.469, and specificity (true non-interaction) equal to 0.527. The ability to detect interactions varied with interaction type. Positive non-trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation were detected at the highest rates. These results demonstrate that co-occurrence networks do not represent classical ecological networks in which interactions are defined by direct observations or experimental manipulations. Co-occurrence networks provide information about the joint spatial effects of environmental conditions, recruitment, and, to some extent, biotic interactions, and among the latter, they tend to better detect niche-expanding positive non-trophic interactions. Detection of links (sensitivity or specificity) was not higher for well-known intertidal keystone species than for the rest of consumers in the community. Thus, as observed in previous empirical and theoretical studies, patterns of interactions in co-occurrence networks must be interpreted with caution, especially when extending interaction-based ecological theory to interpret network variability and stability. Co-occurrence networks may be particularly valuable for analysis of community dynamics that blends interactions and environment, rather than pairwise interactions alone.

AB Individual-based models (IBMs) of complex systems emerged in the 1960s and early 1970s, across diverse disciplines from astronomy to zoology. Ecological IBMs arose with seemingly independent origins out of the tradition of understanding the ecosystems dynamics of ecosystems from a 'bottom-up' accounting of the interactions of the parts. Individual trees are principal among the parts of forests. Because these models are computationally demanding, they have prospered as the power of digital computers has increased exponentially over the decades following the 1970s.
   This review will focus on a class of forest IBMs called gap models. Gap models simulate the changes in forests by simulating the birth, growth and death of each individual tree on a small plot of land. The summation of these plots comprise a forest (or set of sample plots on a forested landscape or region). Other, more aggregated forest IBMs have been used in global applications including cohort-based models, ecosystem demography models, etc. Gap models have been used to provide the parameters for these bulk models. Currently, gap models have grown from local-scale to continental-scale and even global-scale applications to assess the potential consequences of climate change on natural forests. Modifications to the models have enabled simulation of disturbances including fire, insect outbreak and harvest.
   Our objective in this review is to provide the reader with an overview of the history, motivation and applications, including theoretical applications, of these models. In a time of concern over global changes, gap models are essential tools to understand forest responses to climate change, modified disturbance regimes and other change agents. Development of forest surveys to provide the starting points for simulations and better estimates of the behavior of the diversity of tree species in response to the environment are continuing needs for improvement for these and other IBMs.

AB Grazing systems dynamics are driven by a complex combination of socio-economic, political and environmental contexts. Although the drivers and dynamics can be highly location-specific, we focus on describing global trends as well as trends by agro-ecological, socio-economic and political contexts. Global grasslands have expanded in area over the last decades. A decreasing trend has however been observed since the 21st century. Grazing systems' management has also intensified. While these dynamics can have socio-economic and environmental benefits, they have often led to unsustainable systems, exemplified by deforestation and land degradation. Opportunities for land expansion without damaging forests and natural ecosystems are increasingly limited around the world and future increases in grazing systems production will need to mainly come from increases in productivity per animal and per unit area. We highlight some priority research areas and issues for policy makers to consider to help the movement towards more sustainable systems.

AB Our objectives were to assess how turnover and nestedness contribute to beta-diversity patterns of the Zygoptera in Amazonian streams, and to relate these components of beta diversity to environmental, spatial and biogeographic predictors. Our first hypothesis is that the turnover is the most important component of beta-diversity patterns due to the historical isolation of all or part of the areas located in the interfluves of the major Amazonian rivers. Our second hypothesis is that the interaction between environmental conditions and the area of endemism (biogeography) would be the most important predictor of beta-diversity patterns. To test these hypotheses, we compiled data on the Zygoptera communities from 172 Amazonian streams. We used three sets of predictor variables: (i) environmental variables, (ii) area of endemism (biogeographic) and (iii) spatial filters. The turnover explained 99.36% of the beta diversity, corroborating our first hypothesis. Together, environmental and biogeographic variables were the best predictors of beta-diversity patterns. For turnover, however, the biogeographic variables were the best predictors, contrary to our second hypothesis. We found high gamma diversity, but low alpha diversity in the Zygoptera communities. This paradox is explained by the high turnover among sites within the study landscape. This pattern of diversity is related to both historical biogeographic factors and the spatial structuring of environmental conditions in the Amazon region. In the light of our results (high turnover and beta diversity), and their correspondence with areas of endemism, adequate conservation of Amazonian Zygoptera diversity will depend on the establishment of so-called mega-reserves throughout the major Amazonian interfluves and, whenever possible, in the areas with adequate environmental conditions for the greatest possible number of species, otherwise, most species may be at a constant risk of extinction.

AB 1. Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are critically endangered, and their restoration is understudied. Large-scale passive restoration efforts in north-west (NW) Costa Rica have catalysed TDF regeneration but are not effective on degraded Vertisols, where active restoration is necessary due to high content of shrink-swell clays that impede regeneration following degradation.
   2. We established a large-scale restoration experiment in degraded former pastures in NW Costa Rica to determine (1) the restoration potential of native TDF tree species on Vertisols, (2) if plant functional traits elucidate mechanisms behind interspecific variability in species performance and (3) if affordable and readily available soil amendments increase seedling survivorship and growth. We planted 1,710 seedlings of 32 native species coupled with five amendments aimed at ameliorating root-zone microclimatic conditions: sand, rice hulls, rice hull ash, hydrogel and unamended controls. For each species, we quantified a suite of resource-acquisition and ecophysiological functional traits, and monitored survival and growth seasonally over 2 years.
   3. Interspecific survivorship after 2 years ranged widely (0%-92.5%). Functional traits including wood density, photosynthetic parameters and upregulation of integrated water-use efficiency, explained interspecific variation in survivorship and growth at distinct ontogenetic stages. Easily measured leaf traits, however, were not good predictors of restoration potential.
   4. Hydrogel and sand amendments increased initial seedling survival, but after 2 years no differences among treatments were found.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown it is possible, albeit challenging, to-restore tropical dry forest (TDF) on degraded Vertisols. Our results support the use of functional trait-based screenings to select tree species for restoration projects as tree species with high survivorship and growth in this stressful environment have overlapping ecophysiological functional traits. Furthermore, practitioners should consider water-use and photosynthetic traits when designing initial-species mixes for TDF restorations.

AB Freshwater ecosystems across the Amazon are largely comprised of small streams and headwaters of riparian zones. These areas are legally protected within private landholdings in Brazil, but recent changes in the environmental legislation have slackened protection requirements, with unpredictable consequences to the integrity and functioning of these freshwater environments. Local drivers of riparian forest loss and degradation should be understood by considering context-dependent land management practices and pressures within a region. Here, we examine the spatial determinants of the total amount and spectral quality of both headwater and overall riparian forests within private landholdings within a highly fragmented region of southern Amazonia. We built generalized linear models to assess how the amount and spectral quality of headwater and riparian forests respond to landholding size and distance to roads and an urban center, and document landholder compliance rates according to both the current and previous Brazilian environmental legislation. Although forest loss and degradation are typically associated, forest degradation responded independently to the same drivers. Headwater forests were generally more degraded than riparian forests, and smallholders complied less often with legal requirements than largeholders. Proximity to roads and the nearest town had a detrimental effect on both headwater and riparian forest amount and quality, and distance to the nearest town affected all variables, except for headwater forest quality. Compliance with environmental legislation is the first step in protecting riparian and headwater forests, but alternative landscape management strategies must be explored, particularly focusing on smallholdings, which are most vulnerable to deforestation and forest degradation.

AB The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has been a central topic in ecology for more than 20 years. While experimental and theoretical studies have produced much knowledge of how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning, it remains poorly understood how habitat fragmentation affects the BEF relationship.
   To develop a framework that connects habitat fragmentation to the BEF relationship from a landscape perspective.
   We reviewed the literature on habitat fragmentation, BEF, and related fields, and developed a framework to analyze how habitat fragmentation affects the BEF relationship through altering biodiversity, environmental conditions, and both, based on the pattern-process-scale perspective in landscape ecology.
   Our synthesis of the literature suggests that habitat fragmentation can alter BEF relationship through several processes. First, habitat fragmentation causes the non-random loss of species that make major contributions to ecosystem functioning (decreasing sampling effect), and reduces mutualistic interactions (decreasing complementarity effects) regardless of the changes in species richness. Second, environmental conditions within patches and ecological flows among patches vary significantly with the degree of fragmentation, which potentially contributes to and modulates the BEF relationship.
   Habitat fragmentation can affect the BEF relationship directly by altering community composition, as well as indirectly by changing environmental conditions within and among habitat patches on both local and landscape levels. The BEF relationship obtained from small plots and over short time periods may not fully represent that in real landscapes that are fragmented, dynamic, and continuously influenced by myriad human activities on different scales in time and space.

AB Phosphorus is a scarce nutrient in many tropical ecosystems, yet how soil microbial communities cope with growth-limiting phosphorus deficiency at the gene and protein levels remains unknown. Here, we report a metagenomic and metaproteomic comparison of microbial communities in phosphorus-deficient and phosphorus-rich soils in a 17-year fertilization experiment in a tropical forest. The large-scale proteogenomics analyses provided extensive coverage of many microbial functions and taxa in the complex soil communities. A greater than fourfold increase in the gene abundance of 3-phytase was the strongest response of soil communities to phosphorus deficiency. Phytase catalyses the release of phosphate from phytate, the most recalcitrant phosphorus-containing compound in soil organic matter. Genes and proteins for the degradation of phosphorus-containing nucleic acids and phospholipids, as well as the decomposition of labile carbon and nitrogen, were also enhanced in the phosphorus-deficient soils. In contrast, microbial communities in the phosphorus-rich soils showed increased gene abundances for the degradation of recalcitrant aromatic compounds, transformation of nitrogenous compounds and assimilation of sulfur. Overall, these results demonstrate the adaptive allocation of genes and proteins in soil microbial communities in response to shifting nutrient constraints.

AB We compare carbon (and hence energy) costs of the different modes of phosphorus (P) acquisition by vascular land plants. Phosphorus-acquisition modes are considered to be mechanisms of plants together with their root symbionts and structures such as cluster roots involved in mobilising or absorbing P. Phosphorus sources considered are soluble and insoluble inorganic and organic pools. Costs include operating the P-acquisition mechanisms, and resource requirements to construct and maintain them. For most modes, costs increase as the relevant soil P concentration declines. Costs can thus be divided into a component incurred irrespective of soil P concentration, and a component describing how quickly costs increase as the soil P concentration declines. Differences in sensitivity of costs to soil P concentration arise mainly from how economically mycorrhizal fungal hyphae or roots that explore the soil volume are constructed, and from costs of exudates that hydrolyse or mobilise insoluble P forms. In general, modes of acquisition requiring least carbon at high soil P concentrations experience a steeper increase in costs as soil P concentrations decline. The relationships between costs and concentrations suggest some reasons why different modes coexist, and why the mixture of acquisition modes differs between sites.

TI How belowground interactions contribute to the coexistence of

AB Mycorrhizal strategies are very effective in enhancing plant acquisition of poorly-mobile nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P) from infertile soil. However, on very old and severely P-impoverished soils, a carboxylate-releasing and P-mobilising cluster-root strategy is more effective at acquiring this growth-limiting resource. Carboxylates are released during a period of only a few days from ephemeral cluster roots. Despite the cluster-root strategy being superior for P acquisition in such environments, these species coexist with a wide range of mycorrhizal species, raising questions about the mechanisms contributing to their coexistence.
   We surmise that the coexistence of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal strategies is primarily accounted for by a combination of belowground mechanisms, namely (i) facilitation of P acquisition by mycorrhizal plants from neighbouring cluster-rooted plants, and (ii) interactions between roots, pathogens and mycorrhizal fungi, which enhance the plants' defence against pathogens. Facilitation of nutrient acquisition by cluster-rooted plants involves carboxylate exudation, making more P available for both themselves and their mycorrhizal neighbours. Belowground nutrient exchanges between carboxylate-exuding plants and mycorrhizal N-2-fixing plants appear likely, but require further experimental testing to determine their nutritional and ecological relevance. Anatomical studies of roots of cluster-rooted Proteaceae species show that they do not form a complete suberised exodermis.
   The absence of an exodermis may well be important to rapidly release carboxylates, but likely lowers root structural defences against pathogens, particularly oomycetes. Conversely, roots of mycorrhizal plants may not be as effective at acquiring P when P availability is very low, but they are better defended against pathogens, and this superior defence likely involves mycorrhizal fungi. Taken together, we are beginning to understand how an exceptionally large number of plant species and P-acquisition strategies coexist on the most severely P-impoverished soils.

AB Unprecedented mineral and oil extraction is occurring in Africa, often in important areas of conservation. This is especially true in the Murchison Falls Conservation Area (MFCA) in northwestern Uganda. We assessed land fragmentation and conversion between 2002 and 2014 and quantified changes in human population density in the districts surrounding MFCA between 1969 and 2014 to understand landscape level impacts of oil development on the MFCA landscape. We found that three districts with ongoing oil development have increased population more rapidly (+ 69.3%) than districts without oil development (+ 27.6%), as well as the national average of Uganda (+ 41.5%). These districts also had higher proportional increases in total developed land cover and fragmentation in natural land cover. This study provides an increased understanding of how oil can shape human-environment interactions outside of globally important protected areas.

AB The application of gap dynamics theory appears to be a promising option for tropical forest management and conservation. In the present study of a tree species-rich and old-growth Ecuadorian Neotropical forest, we assessed the spatial distribution of gaps and gap size in relation to: i) tree number at the gap edge, ii) number of tree species at the gap edge, iii) number of tree species per stem at the gap edge, iv) species similarity, v) species evenness at the gap edge, vi) size differentiation at the gap edge, vii) gap isolation and viii) species mingling at the gap edge. Our results demonstrated that the spatial distribution of gaps was random. Various gap attributes were strongly associated with gap size. The number of tree species per stem at the gap edge was negatively correlated to the gap size. Gap sizes up to 50 m(2) were mostly sufficient to generate tree species-rich forest stands. Assuming that our results were representative for an old-growth neotropical rainforest in Ecuador, our study remarks the following management recommendations: 1) Rainforests have a very complex spatial and diversity structure and logging activities should preferably be omitted because of adverse effects. 2) If logging is inevitable, this should mimic a random choice of trees and tree species, to prevent special selection of tree dimension and species; and a random distribution of trees to be logged, to produce gaps smaller than 50 m(2) and never larger than 400 m(2). Additionally, we suggest cutting not more than 5 % of the tree biomass per 10-20 years period, to preclude stronger alterations of ecosystem processes, and the reduction of existing dead wood from the ecosystem.

AB Larger hummingbirds often dominate smaller species in contest for resources. It has recently been postulated that in birds, this advantage declines as the evolutionary distance between two interacting species increases. In the present study we used hummingbirds as a model to evaluate: 1) the frequency of agonistic interactions won by larger and smaller hummingbirds, 2) if the body size relative to the competitor and the clade belonging to the hummingbirds have an effect on the frequency of won encounters, and 3) if there are differences between the genetic distance of hummingbirds that won encounters against smaller contenders. Our study included interactions of 74 species of hummingbirds distributed in seven countries of America. We found that the largest species dominated 74% of the encounters. Hummingbirds of the Emerald clade dominated 45% of the total contests analyzed, and all clades of hummingbirds won more encounters when they faced a smaller contender. Finally, no significant differences were found between the genetic distances of the hummingbirds that won contests against smaller competitors. The results highlight the importance of incorporating evolutionary perspectives in the study of communities.

AB Protecting aboveground carbon stocks in tropical forests is essential for mitigating global climate change and is assumed to simultaneously conserve biodiversity. Although the relationship between tree diversity and carbon stocks is generally positive, the relationship remains unclear for consumers or decomposers. We assessed this relationship for multiple trophic levels across the tree of life (10 organismal groups, 3 kingdoms) in lowland rainforests of the Congo Basin. Comparisons across regrowth and old-growth forests evinced the expected positive relationship for trees, but not for other organismal groups. Moreover, differences in species composition between forests increased with difference in carbon stock. These variable associations across the tree of life contradict the implicit assumption that maximum co-benefits to biodiversity are associated with conservation of forests with the highest carbon storage. Initiatives targeting climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation should include both old-growth and regenerating forests to optimally benefit biodiversity and carbon storage.

AB In Southeast Asia, some plantation developers have retained patches of native forest within plantations to promote wildlife diversity, but relatively few studies have examined the effectiveness of such efforts. To provide more information on the interaction between native forest and plantation, we conducted surveys of birds in patches of logged native forest and surrounding groves of exotic plantations in Borneo. We asked the following questions: Does plantation age influence the bird community in adjacent native forest fragments? Are bird communities in the plantations influenced by the presence of small fragments of native forest? Are bird communities in more intensively managed plantations different compared to less intensively managed plantation? Do bird distributions across habitat types vary by functional trait? Our study was conducted in a 500,000 ha multi-use landscape in Sarawak, Malaysia. We identified 15 native forest fragments within exotic plantation, and these were partitioned into old (>7yr) and young (<5 yr) groves. We conducted surveys in the native forest fragments and in the 2 age groups of adjacent plantation at distances near (< 500 m) and far (>500 m) from fragments. Species richness was highest in native forest fragments. In plantation groves near fragments, species richness remained comparable to native forest but dropped significantly in young plantation far from fragments. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) threat status was significantly related to species habitat associations, with Near Threatened species preferring native forest. Although protecting large tracts of native forest is optimal for protection of birds, smaller patches may also maintain considerable levels of species richness in plantations, and they may be particularly important during the early phases (first 5 yr) of plantation growth.

AB Tropical tree species distributions are determined by a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, including topography and hydrology. Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are characterized in part by small-scale variations in topography ('hummocks' and 'hollows') that create distinct microhabitats and thus may contribute to niche diversification among TPSF tree species. Using tree elevations calibrated to daily peat water levels collected using a data logger and a permutation test, we evaluated topographical microhabitat preferences for 21 tree species in a relatively undisturbed TPSF in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, to determine whether these species show preferential association with hummocks or hollows and to quantify the prevalence of microhabitat specialization among them. Only one species, Tetractomia tetrandrum, emerged as a hollow specialist, with no hummock specialists among the species tested. The remaining 20 species, including Psydrax dicoccos, which had the lowest mean observed elevation, and Maasia hypoleuca, which had the highest mean observed elevation, showed no clear microtopographic preference. This suggests that many TPSF species may be resilient to the natural hydrologic variations that occur in relatively intact peat swamp forests. Such studies of microtopographic preferences of tree species in TPSF and other wetland forest ecosystems can inform selection of tree species for reforestation projects, and potentially also provide information on how future climate change may impact these habitats and their resident tree species.

AB Land use change is accelerating globally at the expense of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Invertebrates are numerically dominant and functionally important in old growth tropical rain forests but highly susceptible to the adverse effects of forest degradation and fragmentation. Ants (Formicidae) and termites (Blattodea: Termitoidae) perform crucial ecosystem services. Here, the potential effects of anthropogenic disturbance on ant and termite communities in dead wood are investigated. Community composition, generic richness, and occupancy rates of ants and termites were compared among two old growth sites (Danum Valley and Maliau Basin) and one twice-logged site (the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems' (SAFE) Project), in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Occupancy was measured as the number of ant or termite encounters (1) per deadwood items, and (2) per deadwood volume, and acts as surrogates for relative abundance (or generic richness). Termites had a lower wood-occupancy per volume in logged forest. In contrast, there were more ant encounters, and more ant genera, in logged sites and there was a community shift (especially, there were more Crematogaster encounters). The disruption of soil and canopy structure in logged forest may reduce both termite and fungal decay rates, inducing increased deadwood residence times and therefore favoring ants that nest in dead wood. There is an anthropogenic-induced shift of dead wood in ants and termites in response to disturbance in tropical rain forests and the nature of that shift is taxon-specific.

AB Despite expansive research on Amazonian deforestation and its drivers, the role of local politics is not well understood. Using a panel data set that combines municipal-level deforestation and election data from 2002 to 2012, I estimate the effect of an incumbent mayor running for re-election on deforestation rates in election periods. I find that deforestation rates increase 8-10% in election years when an incumbent mayor runs for re-election, an amount equivalent to four percent of the total forest lost since the 2004 elections. Electoral deforestation cycles do not appear to be driven by changes in agricultural policy implementation and activity, but are linked to corruption and campaign finance, suggesting that weak institutional constraints facilitate electoral manipulation of forest resources. This phenomenon is not likely limited to Amazonian forests; re-election incentives could very well lead to misallocation of other natural resources in alternate geographies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Conservation in human-dominated landscapes is challenging partly due to the high costs of land acquisition. We explored a property tax mechanism to finance conservation easements or related contracts as a partial-property acquisition strategy to meet Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) treaty targets to conserve critically imperiled coastal Douglas fir ecosystems in Canada. To maximize cost-efficiency, we used systematic planning tools to prioritize 198,058 parcels for biodiversity values, estimated the cost of eliminating property tax on high-priority parcels to engage land owners in conservation, and then calculated the tax increase on nonpriority parcels necessary to maintain tax revenue. Marginal tax rate increases of 0.13, 0.21, and 0.51% on nonpriority parcels were necessary to offset the elimination of tax revenue on similar to 21,000 ha of high-priority parcels, and potentially sufficient to increase area protection from 9% to 17% to meet CBD targets given uptake rates of 100, 50, or 25%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses suggest uptake rates of 30% to 40% could allow government to achieve a 17% target with 30% of the planning area prioritized for inclusion in a property tax mechanism. Our results suggest prioritizing parcels for biodiversity value and commensurate "tax shifting" may offer an efficient route to conservation on private land.

AB In South America, the largest area of tropical savanna is the Brazilian Cerrado biome, which encompasses a considerable range of environmental variation, with different types of soil, geology, geomorphology and climate, as well as distinct types of vegetation. These savannas include two types of vegetation: one on hilly slopes, with relatively shallow interspersed with rocky soils (RS), known as Rocky Cerrado, and the other located on flat terrain with deep soils (DS), known as Typical Cerrado. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of the heterogeneity of the chemical and granulometric properties of the soils on the composition and diversity of the shrubby-arboreal strata of the RS and DS. We found that, despite the reduced abundance of woody plants in the RS, and the physical limitations on plant development imposed by the rocky outcrops found in this environment, the RS is characterized by similar species diversity to that found in the DS. We present evidence of greater heterogeneity in the species composition and edaphic proprieties of the RS in comparison with the DS. We conclude that the greater variation and heterogeneity in the substrates of the RS accounts for the similarity in the species diversity between the RS and DS, although we suspect that other drivers, not investigated here, may also be involved. The intense conversion of native vegetation within the study region interferes with the establishment of exclusive species in RS (e.g., Norantea guianensis Aubl.) and DS (e.g., Couepia grandiflora (Mart. & Zucc.) Benth.) and consequently threatens the community structure of both environments with fundamental implications for the conservation.

AB Land use change modifies the environment at multiple spatial scales, and is a main driver of species declines and deterioration of ecosystem services. However, most of the research on the effects of land use change has focused on taxonomic diversity, while functional diversity, an important predictor of ecosystem services, is often neglected. We explored how local and landscape scale characteristics influence functional and taxonomic diversity of hummingbirds in the Andes Mountains in southern Ecuador. Data was collected in six landscapes along a land use gradient, from an almost intact landscape to one dominated by cattle pastures. We used point counts to sample hummingbirds from 2011 to 2012 to assessed how local factors (i.e., vegetation structure, flowering plants richness, nectar availability) and landscape factors (i.e., landscape heterogeneity, native vegetation cover) influenced taxonomic and functional diversity. Then, we analyzed environment - trait relationships (RLQ test) to explore how different hummingbird functional traits influenced species responses to these factors. Taxonomic and functional diversity of hummingbirds were positively associated with landscape heterogeneity but only functional diversity was positively related to native vegetation coverage. We found a weak response of taxonomic and functional diversity to land use change at the local scale. Environment-trait associations showed that body mass of hummingbirds likely influenced species sensitivity to land use change. In conclusion, landscape heterogeneity created by land use change can positively influence hummingbird taxonomic and functional diversity; however, a reduction of native vegetation cover could decrease functional diversity. Given that functional diversity can mediate ecosystem services, the conservation of native vegetation cover could play a key role in the maintenance of hummingbird pollination services in the tropical Andes. Moreover, there are particular functional traits, such as body mass, that increase a species sensitivity to land use change.

AB Over the past century, humans have cleared the Earth's forests at an alarming rate and intensity. The majority of global forest cover is categorized as secondary forest, and it is becoming increasingly important to consider secondary forests in addition to old-growth forest in conservation planning for biota. We reviewed the literature to synthesize information on amphibian and reptile communities during secondary forest succession. We summarized literature on mechanisms of community change during forest succession and conducted a meta-analysis to estimate effect sizes for species richness and abundance in human-modified landscapes (agriculture, pasture, and plantation) and old-growth forests compared to regenerating secondary forests. Studies reported strong support for differences in species composition among human-modified landscapes, secondary forest, and old-growth forest as well as species-specific responses to successional forest change. Secondary forest generally had higher species richness and abundance than human-modified landscapes, but lower species richness and abundance than old-growth forests. This result was more pronounced in amphibians than reptiles, and effect size of abundance was more variable than richness among studies. Secondary forests have better conservation value than altered habitats, but they do not necessarily hold the same conservation value for species as old-growth forest.

AB Savannas are ecosystems where plants are expected to have leaf-level adaptations conferring tolerance to high irradiances, which characterizes this type of open canopy vegetation. The neotropical savannas of Brazil (Cerrado) harbour a large diversity of heliophilous herbaceous species, which are threatened by the current invasion of those open canopy habitats by forest trees, increasing tree density and canopy cover, thereby strongly reducing light availability. In this study, we measured leaf pigment concentrations, specific leaf area and light response curves of photosynthesis to determine whether herbaceous species of open savanna habitats were less tolerant to shade than the ones that were more characteristic of forested savanna. Relative to species of forested savannas, herbaceous species of open savannas had heavier leaves with higher concentration of carotenoids. They also achieved higher photosynthetic rates, reaching light compensation and saturation at higher irradiances. Based on measurements of light compensation points and of prevailing irradiances in forested savannas, leaves of most herbaceous species of more open savannas would be strongly light-limited in sites with a dense woody layer. In summary, we provide evidence that forest tree encroachment of savannas would select for leaf trait combinations in the understory vegetation that would favor shade tolerance and, depending on the degree of leaf acclimatization to shade of individual species, could strongly constrain persistence of the current understory vegetation.

AB Quantifying and mapping ecosystem services (ES) is seen as one way to improve decision making and land management to better integrate environmental issues. This study aimed to characterize ES supply in deforestation context where an improvement of scientific knowledge should help develop more efficient environmental management. For three case studies in the Brazilian Amazon impacted by deforestation, seven indicators of potential ES supply were mapped at a spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m: biodiversity index (indicator of food web support); richness of pollinators (pollination); index of soil chemical quality (support to production); water available for plants (water regulation); soil carbon stocks (support to production and climate regulation); rate of water infiltration into the soil (soil erosion control); and vegetation carbon stocks (climate regulation). To map these indicators, in situ measurements of ES for 135 sampling points and remote sensing data were linked using regression methods. These methods were used to predict ES values and identify environmental factors that influence ES supply. The resulting maps help in understanding the influence of environmental factors on ES spatial distribution within the sites. The analyses illustrate the influence of land-use changes on ES supply and the role of context effects due to the heterogeneity of the biophysical environment, the temporality of deforestation and/or their diversified sociopolitical contexts. From a methodological viewpoint, the study highlights the importance of choices inherent in all cartographic practices and that need to be considered, especially in the context of rendering ES maps operational.

AB We used point pattern analysis (pair-correlation function, K2 function, distance to kth neighbor D-k, and spherical contact distribution function HO to describe the process of plant pattern formation for five dominant tree species with different life strategies in a mixed-forest stand with Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et. Zucc.) in the southern part of the Sikhote-Alin mountain range (southeastern Russia). We subdivided each species pattern using an ontogenetic classification of individuals: immature, virginal, and generative. We also analyzed stump pattern structure, which marks canopy gap formation locations in recent decades. We also studied the shade tolerance changes of pre-generative plants during their development. As a result, we found similarities between the processes of pattern transformation for the different species. Namely, they transform from pronounced aggregated distributions of plants at several spatial scales (immature plants) to a random pattern (middle-aged and old generative plants). This transformation of pattern structure occurs because the immature plants accumulate under a canopy and require significantly improved light conditions that can only be found in gaps to transition into the virginal and young-generative stage. In turn, the process of gap formation is stochastic, and the stand is characterized by a low-intensity disturbance regime. Thus, the pre-generative plant patterns are filtered by randomly formed gaps, and thus only individual randomly distributed plants reach the middle-aged and old generative ontogenetic states.

AB Key message The effects of distance dependence, negative density dependence (NDD), phylogenetic density dependence, and habitat filtering were integrated to provide additional evidence in temperate forest tree seedling survival. The main focus of this study was to explore how population density and habitat filtering regulate NDD. An approach involving four classes of population density and three classes of soil moisture was tested, including the effect of habitat variables to more accurately evaluate the underlying ecological processes affecting the density dependence of seedlings.
   Context NDD is an important mechanism for the maintenance of species diversity across multiple life stages, particularly during seedling recruitment. By regulating specific population structures to maintain species diversity, the effects of density dependence and distance dependence are sometimes difficult to distinguish. Nevertheless, the contribution of NDD to community assembly, relative to other processes such as habitat filtering, remains a subject of debate. Recently, it has been reported that seedling survivals are also negatively correlated with phylogenetic relatedness between neighbors and focal individuals. This effect is known as phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD). However, another opposite effect known as phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD) has also been reported to exist.
   Aims The objectives of this study are to examine the following: (i) how population density affects negative density dependence (NDD); (ii) how habitat filtering regulates the NDD; (iii) whether more evidence can be found for PNDD or PPDD and why; and (iv) whether the intensity of negative density dependence is affected by the distance between parent trees and seedlings.
   Methods The study was conducted in a 20-ha primary mixed broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain of China. We used generalized linear mixed models to analyze how the seedling survival of 23 woody plant species relates to neighborhoods and habitat variables. Four models were established with and without habitat variables, and two of the four models were used to test how different population densities of focal seedlings and different gradients of habitat variable regulated negative density dependence.
   Results The following results were obtained: (1) the strongest conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) was found within a radius of 15 m; (2) seedling survival were most strongly impacted by the density of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors in habitats with relatively low soil moisture; (3) the effect of seedling-seedling CNDD was especially significant, when densities ranged from 20 to 40 seedlings/4 m(2), and (4) there were some evidences of phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD), and the effect of seedling-seedling PPDD was increasing with an increase in soil moisture.
   Conclusion Our results demonstrate that conspecific negative density dependence played an important role in seedling survival, which is closely related to habitat filtering and population density. However, we found some evidences of phylogenetic positive density dependence. We suggest that future studies of neighborhood density dependence should increase awareness of evolutionary relationships.

TI Different mechanisms of organic and inorganic phosphorus release from

AB Enhancement of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) release by low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA) increases soil phosphorus (P) availability to plant, but the release of organic phosphorus (Po) and the associated kinetics of both Pi and Po release by LMWOA have not been well considered. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the impacts of three common LMWOA (citric acid, oxalic acid, and malic acid) on the kinetic release of Pi and Po in a black clay soil in northeast China. All kinetic data were well described by the Elovich and power functions models (P < 0.01). The LMWOA at 10 mmol kg(-1) soil increased the rate of the kinetic release of both Pi and Po. Organic phosphorus released by LMWOA derived from the soil-labile Po (NaHCO3-Po) fraction in the order of oxalic acid (3.58 mg kg(-1)) > citric acid (2.67 mg kg(-1)) > malic acid (1.76 mg kg(-1)). In contrast, Pi release by LMWOA resulted from mobilization of the moderately labile NaOH-Pi (Fe/Al-P) and HCl-Pi (Ca-Pi) fractions in the order of citric acid (4.83 mg kg(-1)) > oxalic acid (2.40 mg kg(-1)) > malic acid (2.04 mg kg(-1)). Therefore, the release of Po by LMWOA is mainly via the dissolution of soil-labile Po (NaHCO3-Po) rather than via chelation of organic acid ligands.

AB Insecure land tenure plagues many developing and tropical regions, often where conservation concerns are highest. Conservation organizations have long focused on protected areas as tenure interventions, but are now thinking more comprehensively about whether and how to incorporate other land tenure strategies into their work, and how to more soundly ground such interventions on evidence of both conservation and human benefits. Through a review of the literature on land tenure security as it relates to conservation practice, predominantly in the tropics, we aim to help conservation practitioners consider and incorporate more appropriate land tenure security interventions into conservation strategies. We present a framework that identifies three common ways in which land tenure security can impact human and conservation outcomes, and suggest practical ways to distill tenure and tenure security issues for a given location. We conclude with steps for considering tenure security issues in the context of conservation projects and identify areas for future research.

AB The study of tree community dynamics may help improve our understanding of forest ecosystem function. Here, we aimed to investigate the influences of climate, soils, landscape, forest structure, and chronic anthropogenic disturbances on tree community demography in the fragments of Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil. Nine forest fragments were inventoried between 2008 and 2012, and were inventoried again from three to six years later. For the tree community in each forest remnant, we calculated mortality, recruitment, basal area loss-and gain, net changes, and turnover rates. For each study area, we also measured altitude, climate, soil type, fragment patch metrics, cattle presence, and tree component structure. We used Principal Component Analyses (PCA) to order the multivariate data (Tree community dynamics: demographic rates; Climate: altitude + climate; Patch metric: area + core + shape + Cai). The relationships between the patterns of the dynamics and the explanatory variables were subjected to regression tree analyses and t tests. We found that the Araucaria Forest dynamics mainly varied in terms of tree mortality and basal area loss rates. In general, mortality and basal area loss rates were smaller within larger fragments, which had a greater proportion of interior areas. Therefore, we concluded that anthropogenic fragmentation is a key driver of tree community dynamics in the Araucaria Forest of Southern Brazil. Based on our results, we would recommend (i) the protection of small and large tracts of forest fragments; and (ii) incentives to promote the silviculture of the most relevant timber species, the light demanding Araucania angustifolia, in the deforested lands of the region.

AB The growth of urban centers, along with the fragmentation of natural habitats, can interfere with the distribution pattern of species and their abundance, thus compromising the conservation of urban biodiversity. Principal players in this biodiversity are arthropods that help to decompose litterfall, favoring the recycling of nutrients and, hence, are an important part in sustaining the forest fragments that remain in urban areas. Therefore, it is important to study arthropod biodiversity in green urban areas, especially those areas where litterfall management is an important part of maintaining biodiversity. Accordingly, this study evaluated arthropod diversity associated with litterfall in three urban forests with different size and litterfall management practices, including Agua Branca Park (ABP) and Tiete Ecological Park (TEP)-Nucleo Engenheiro Goulart in Sao Paulo City and Chico Mendes Park (CMP) in Osasco City, all belonging to the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), Brazil. Four litterfall harvests were carried out in each park between April and August of 2015 with twelve samples collected with a wood mold (30-cmx30-cm) at randomly points on the forest floor. The collected material was then screened in the laboratory and the arthropods were visually separated and preserved in alcohol 70%. Arthropods were classified by the order to which they belonged. Litterfall was dried in a forced air oven at 65 degrees C for seven days. Dried litterfall was then separated into leaves, branches, reproductive parts and miscellaneous fragments and weighed. Arthropod diversity was measured by Shannon, Margalef and Pielou indexes and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) using the Manhattan distance index. Litterfall weight was compared by one-way ANOVA. The orders Hymenoptera, Collembola and Isopoda were dominant in CMP, ABP and TEP, respectively but multiple rare orders had a presence in all parks, albeit at different abundance. NMDS showed abundance similarity among the parks; however, TEP showed greater richness, Shannon diversity and evenness. The fractions of leaf litterfall and reproductive parts were different between the CMP and TEP. Overall, our results confirm that neither litterfall management, nor park size, is a final determinant of arthropod distribution, even though the abundance of dominant species was shown to differ in each park.

AB Brazilian biodiversity is being target of many scientific efforts to preserve it. However, there is an enormous contradiction in the country between what is discussed in scientific theory and what government measures are actually doing in practice. In this work, we discuss Brazil's conservationist aspirations under a human and social aspect, which the scientific view of natural scientists seldom explores: the historical materialist conception. From this analysis, we argue that current scientific efforts are important, but merely palliative, because at the heart of capitalist society the logic of value precedes any political decision making of the state. Therefore, the analysis of Brazilian biodiversity conservation under the premises of historical materialism elucidates with more clarity the forces that are at play in the country to inform the practice of conservation. This is a way of understanding the relatively ineffective role that science and technology has had in the permanent control of environmental destruction in Brazil.

AB Aim: The importance of anthropogenic activities in reshaping biodiversity is increasing fast. Interactive effects of climate change, biological invasions and species replacement are poorly understood, particularly at large scales and in megadiverse biomes. We aimed to assess the effects of climate change as a driver of spatio-temporal biodiversity patterns and homogenization of woody plants at multiple scales, in a hyperdiverse species assemblage.
   Location: The Atlantic Forest, Brazil.
   Time period: Present, future projections.
   Major taxa studied: Woody plants.
   Methods: We used ecological niche modeling to estimate geographic distributions of 2,255 plant species under present and future climates. Range-diversity plots based on species presence-absence matrices and null models were used to explore changes in alpha and beta diversity, range size and covariance in species composition across ecoregions, climatic scenarios and within protected areas. We also partitioned dissimilarity into turnover and nestedness components and explored expansions and retractions of species' ranges to infer invasive potential and implications for conservation in the future.
   Results: Despite a general increase in local richness, beta diversity decreased with time. Similarity among sites was accentuated in severe climate change scenarios enhancing biotic homogenization at large scales. Changes were not constant or homogeneous across ecoregions and at smaller scales, but a consistent pattern was the reduction of beta diversity accompanied by increments in the mean range size of widespread species. Likewise, subsets of assemblages within protected areas presented higher similarity, increased mean range size and invariability of richness through time, indicating potential compositional turnover promoted by the expansion of widespread species.
   Main conclusions: Expansion of current generalist and disturbance-tolerant species rather than extinction or retraction of local endemics may lead to woody plant homogenization in the tropics. The woody plant assemblage in the Atlantic Forest is prone to a structural reorganization due to climate change, threatening conservation of biodiversity and potentially leading to severe large-scale biotic homogenization in the near future.

AB Large old trees are critically important keystone structures in forest ecosystems globally. Populations of these trees are also in rapid decline in many forest ecosystems, making it important to quantify the factors that influence their dynamics at different spatial scales. Large old trees often occur in forest landscapes also subject to fire and logging. However, the effects on the risk of collapse of large old trees of the amount of logging and fire in the surrounding landscape are not well understood. Using an 18-year study in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, we quantify relationships between the probability of collapse of large old hollow-bearing trees at a site and the amount of logging and the amount of fire in the surrounding landscape. We found the probability of collapse increased with an increasing amount of logged forest in the surrounding landscape. It also increased with a greater amount of burned area in the surrounding landscape, particularly for trees in highly advanced stages of decay. The most likely explanation for elevated tree fall with an increasing amount of logged or burned areas in the surrounding landscape is change in wind movement patterns associated with cutblocks or burned areas. Previous studies show that large old hollow-bearing trees are already at high risk of collapse in our study area. New analyses presented here indicate that additional logging operations in the surrounding landscape will further elevate that risk. Current logging prescriptions require the protection of large old hollow-bearing trees on cutblocks. We suggest that efforts to reduce the probability of collapse of large old hollow-bearing trees on unlogged sites will demand careful landscape planning to limit the amount of timber harvesting in the surrounding landscape.

TI Global patterns of tropical forest fragmentation
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID HABITAT FRAGMENTATION
AB Remote sensing enables the quantification of tropical deforestation with high spatial resolution(1,2). This in-depth mapping has led to substantial advances in the analysis of continent-wide fragmentation of tropical forests(1-4). Here we identified approximately 130 million forest fragments in three continents that show surprisingly similar power-law size and perimeter distributions as well as fractal dimensions. Power-law distributions(5-7) have been observed in many natural phenomena(8,9) such as wildfires, landslides and earthquakes. The principles of percolation theory(7,10,11) provide one explanation for the observed patterns, and suggest that forest fragmentation is close to the critical point of percolation; simulation modelling also supports this hypothesis. The observed patterns emerge not only from random deforestation, which can be described by percolation theory(10,11), but also from a wide range of deforestation and forest-recovery regimes. Our models predict that additional forest loss will result in a large increase in the total number of forest fragments-at maximum by a factor of 33 over 50 years-as well as a decrease in their size, and that these consequences could be partly mitigated by reforestation and forest protection.

AB Background: Human cystic (CE) and alveolar (AE) echinococcoses are zoonotic parasitic diseases that can be influenced by environmental variability and change through effects on the parasites, animal intermediate and definitive hosts, and human populations. We aimed to assess and quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of human echinococcoses in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), China between January 1994 and December 2013, and examine associations between these infections and indicators of environmental variability and change, including large-scale landscape regeneration undertaken by the Chinese authorities.
   Methods: Data on the number of human echinococcosis cases were obtained from a hospital-based retrospective survey conducted in NHAR for the period 1 January 1994 through 31 December 2013. High-resolution imagery from Landsat 4/5-TM and 8-OLI was used to create single date land cover maps. Meteorological data were also collected for the period January 1980 to December 2013 to derive time series of bioclimatic variables. A Bayesian spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive model was used to quantify the relationship between annual cases of CE and AE and environmental variables.
   Results: Annual CE incidence demonstrated a negative temporal trend and was positively associated with winter mean temperature at a 10-year lag. There was also a significant, nonlinear effect of annual mean temperature at 13-year lag. The findings also revealed a negative association between AE incidence with temporal moving averages of bareland/artificial surface coverage and annual mean temperature calculated for the period 11-15 years before diagnosis and winter mean temperature for the period 0-4 years. Unlike CE risk, the selected environmental covariates accounted for some of the spatial variation in the risk of AE.
   Conclusions: The present study contributes towards efforts to understand the role of environmental factors in determining the spatial heterogeneity of human echinococcoses. The identification of areas with high incidence of CE and AE may assist in the development and refinement of interventions for these diseases, and enhanced environmental change risk assessment.

AB Persistent genetic variation within populations presents an evolutionary problem, as natural selection and genetic drift tend to erode genetic diversity. Models of balancing selection were developed to account for the maintenance of genetic variation observed in natural populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection is a powerful type of balancing selection that maintains many natural polymorphisms, but it is also commonly misinterpreted. This review aims to clarify the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection, describe classes of polymorphisms that can and cannot result from these processes, and discuss the empirical data needed to accurately identify processes that generate or maintain diversity in nature. Finally, the importance of accurately describing the processes affecting genetic diversity within populations as it relates to research progress is considered.

AB Payment for hydrological services (PHS) are popular tools for conserving ecosystems and their water-related services. However, improving the spatial targeting and impacts of PHS, as well as their ability to foster synergies with other ecosystem services (ES), remain challenging. We aimed at using spatial analyses to evaluate the targeting performance of Mexico's National PHS program in central Veracruz. We quantified the effectiveness of areas targeted for PHS in actually covering areas of high HS provision and social priority during 2003-2013. First, we quantified provisioning and spatial distributions of two target (water yield and soil retention), and one non-target ES (carbon storage) using InVEST. Subsequently, pairwise relationships among ES were quantified by using spatial correlation and overlap analyses. Finally, we evaluated targeting by: (i) prioritizing areas of individual and overlapping ES; (ii) quantifying spatial co-occurrences of these priority areas with those targeted by PHS; (iii) evaluating the extent to which PHS directly contribute to HS delivery; and (iv), testing if PHS targeted areas disproportionately covered areas with high ecological and social priority. We found that modelled priority areas exhibited non-random distributions and distinct spatial patterns. Our results show significant pairwise correlations between all ES suggesting synergistic relationships. However, our analysis showed a significantly lower overlap than expected and thus significant mismatches between PHS targeted areas and all types of priority areas. These findings suggest that the targeting of areas with high HS provisioning and social priority by Mexico's PHS program could be improved significantly. This study underscores: (1) the importance of using maps of HS provisioning as main targeting criteria in PHS design to channel payments towards areas that require future conservation, and (2) the need for future research that helps balance ecological and socioeconomic targeting criteria.

AB Despite its negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity, tree plantations can contribute to biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes, as they harbor many native species. In this study, we investigated the impact of Eucalyptus plantations on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities, comparing ant communities sampled in managed and unmanaged (abandoned for 28 years) Eucalyptus plantations, and native Atlantic rain forests. Eucalyptus plantations, both managed and unmanaged, reduced the functional diversity and increased the similarity between ant communities leading to functional homogenization. While communities in managed plantations had the lowest values of both taxonomic and functional ant diversities, ant communities from unmanaged plantations had similar values of species richness, functional redundancy and Rao's Q compared to ant communities from forest patches (although functional richness was lower). In addition, communities in unmanaged Eucalyptus plantations were taxonomically and functionally more similar to communities located in managed plantations, indicating that Eucalyptus plantations have a severe long-term impact on ant communities. These results indicate that natural regeneration may mitigate the impact of Eucalyptus management, particularly regarding the functional structure of the community (a diversity), although it does not attenuate the effects of long term homogenization in community composition (beta diversity).

AB We assessed the relative importance of dispersal limitation, environmental heterogeneity and their joint effects as determinants of the spatial patterns of 229 species in the moist tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island (Panama). We differentiated five types of species according to their dispersal syndrome; autochorous, anemochorous, and zoochorous species with small, medium-size and large fruits. We characterized the spatial patterns of each species and we checked whether they were best fitted by Inhomogeneous Poisson (IPP), Homogeneous Poisson cluster (HPCP) and Inhomogeneous Poisson cluster processes (IPCP) by means of the Akaike Information Criterion. We also assessed the influence of species' dispersal mode in the average cluster size. We found that 63% of the species were best fitted by IPCP regardless of their dispersal syndrome, although anemochorous species were best described by HPCP. Our results indicate that spatial patterns of tree species in this forest cannot be explained only by dispersal limitation, but by the joint effects of dispersal limitation and environmental heterogeneity. The absence of relationships between dispersal mode and degree of clustering suggests that several processes modify the original spatial pattern generated by seed dispersal. These findings emphasize the importance of fitting point process models with a different biological meaning when studying the main determinants of spatial structure in plant communities.

AB While a significant effort has been made to understand how human activities influence biodiversity, less attention has been given to the consequences of tropical forest disturbance on belowground functional processes and its linkages with environmental drivers. Here, we demonstrate how selective logging influenced dung beetle communities and two associated ecological processes - namely, dung consumption and incidental soil bioturbation - in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, using a robust before-and-after control-impact design. We tested hypotheses about logging-induced changes on environmental condition (canopy cover, leaf litter and soil texture), community metrics (e.g. dung beetle species richness and biomass) and beetle-mediated faecal-detritus processing; and on the importance of the environment for beetle communities and functional processes. We show that post-logging changes in canopy openness do not necessarily mediate logging impacts on dung beetle diversity and biomass, which were directly influenced by reduced impact logging (RIL) operations. Although neither environmental condition (leaf litter or soil sand content) nor faecal consumption and incidental soil bioturbation were directly affected by RIL, the relationships between environmental condition and biological components were. By showing that selective logging alters the linkages among belowground ecological processes and environmental drivers, we provide support that logged forests can retain some important functioning processes, in particular faecal consumption, even when the dung beetle diversity and biomass are impoverished. These results provide support for the resistance of functional processes to logging-induced changes in biodiversity.

AB Tropical homegardens (THGs) are a model system for rural development that may reconcile food production with social resilience and biodiversity conservation, particularly in rapidly changing landscapes. This study quantified the sink function of THGs for wild native trees in relation to tree cover fragmentation, garden management and household socio-economics. Abundance, richness and diversity of naturally established spared native trees were recorded for 59 rural THGs in Southeast Mexico, along a gradient of tree cover fragmentation. The majority of native species and individuals encountered in THGs had arrived naturally. Contrary to previous work, both the abundance and diversity of spared native trees increased with tree cover fragmentation. However, this sink function was strongly mediated by the type of garden management: lush, multi-layered gardens and gardens with few exotics and low labour input had more spared native trees of more species, while simple-structured gardens and gardens with high labour input and many exotic fruits had only few. Overall, the results indicate that tree cover fragmentation determines which species come in, and management determines how many of each stay. Our results clearly demonstrate that THGs are crucial sinks for wild native trees in deforested fragmented landscapes. THGs are ubiquitous, and could also be key sources for reforestation; here we coin homegarden-based natural regeneration as a new concept. Since garden management has a clear impact, further research is needed as to how socio-economic, cultural and ecological functions of THGs can be optimised in different landscape contexts.

AB Simple mathematical models can exhibit rich and complex behaviors. Prototypical examples of these drawn from biology and other disciplines have provided insights that extend well beyond the situations that inspired them. Here, we explore a set of simple, yet realistic, models for savanna-forest vegetation dynamics based on minimal ecological assumptions. These models are aimed at understanding how vegetation interacts with both climate (a primary global determinant of vegetation structure) and feedbacks with chronic disturbances from fire. The model includes three plant functional types-grasses, savanna trees, and forest trees. Grass and (when they allow grass to persist in their subcanopy) savanna trees promote the spread of fires, which in turn, demographically limit trees. The model exhibits a spectacular range of behaviors. In addition to bistability, analysis reveals (i) that diverse cyclic behaviors (including limit and homo- and heteroclinic cycles) occur for broad ranges of parameter space, (ii) that large shifts in landscape structure can result from endogenous dynamics and not just from external drivers or from noise, and (iii) that introducing noise into this system induces resonant and inverse resonant phenomena, some of which have never been previously observed in ecological models. Ecologically, these results raise questions about how to evaluate complicated dynamics with data. Mathematically, they lead to classes of behaviors that are likely to occur in other models with similar structure.

AB Background: Camellia nitidissima, a rare and endangered shrub is narrowly distributed in South China and North Vietnam occurring in forest understory. Their light tolerance mechanism is unclear. We measured photosynthesis and related parameters on 2-years-old cuttings growing at 10, 30, 50 and 100% sunlight. Our research question was: At what light level are C. nitidissima cuttings responding most favorably, and what is the eco-physiological basis for their response to light? We hypothesized that as a forest understory growth of C. nitidissima would respond most favorably at low to intermediate light by optimizing photosynthetic activity, and high light will affect photosynthetic functions due to photoinhibition, damage of photosynthetic apparatus and concomitant enzyme activity.
   Results: With increasing light, the maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-Nmax) and apparent quantum yield (AQY) decreased, while the light compensation point increased, and light saturation point first increased followed by a decrease. The P-Nmax and AQY under 50 and 100% sunlight were significantly lower than that under 10 and 30% sunlight. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters F-m, F-v, F-v/F-m all decreased under high light (> 50%). The contents of chlorophyll a (Chla), chlorophyll b (Chlb), and carotenoid (Car) decreased with increasing light. Relative conductivity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline contents in leaves were significantly increased in high light but we found no significant difference in these indices at 10 and 30% sunlight.
   Conclusions: We conclude that C. nitidissima is a shade adapted plant with poor adaptability to high light (> 50%). The novelty of this research is the demonstration of the eco-physiological basis of its light tolerance (conversely, shade adaptation) mechanisms indicated by decreased photosynthetic activity, chlorophyll fluorescence, Chla, Chlb and Car contents and concomitant increase in relative conductivity, MDA and proline contents at high light causing photoinhibition. For artificial propagation of C. nitidissima we recommend growing cuttings below 30% sunlight. For in situ conservation of this valuable, rare and endangered shrub it is necessary to protect its natural habitats.

AB The Variegated Antpitta (Grallaria varia) is the largest member of the terrestrial insectivores guild within its Amazonian range. Despite the bird's large size and loud vocalizations, however, basic aspects of G. varia's natural history remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted intensive tracking of one individual in a nature reserve in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, describing - for the first time with radio telemetry - space use, movement patterns, and roosting sites of G. varia. Over the course of 50 days in July and August 2017, the tracked individual moved slowly through a home range covering similar to 17.6 ha and was generally quiet, singing at only two of 68 locations that together comprised its home range. Of five roosting sites, four included visual observations where the bird slept 3-7 (mean 4.5) m aboveground in relatively open mid-story trees. We found no evidence of commutes to regular roost sites as all nocturnal locations were located close (mean 59.6 m, range 24-101 m) to the most recent diurnal locations. Slow movements on the ground without commutes to foraging or roosting sites help explain low capture rates in mist nets for this species. Our telemetry data suggest that G. varia home range may be larger than previously estimated in studies that relied heavily on bird vocalizations to determine area needs, though such methods may yield adequate results at times when birds vocalize frequently. Regardless, large area requirements help to explain the disappearance of G. varia documented in tropical forest fragments.

AB Insects play a key role in the regulation and dynamics of many ecosystem services (ES). However, this role is often assumed, with limited or no experimental quantification of its real value. We examined publication trends in the research on ES provided by insects, ascertaining which ES and taxa have been more intensively investigated, and which methodologies have been used, with particular emphasis on experimental approaches. We first performed a systematic literature search to identify which ES have been attributed to insects. Then we classified the references retrieved according to the ES, taxonomic group and ecosystem studied, as well as to the method applied to quantify each ES (in four categories: no quantification, proxies, direct quantification and experiments). Pollination, biological control, food provisioning, and recycling organic matter are the most studied ES. However, the majority of papers do not specify the ES under consideration, and from those that do, most do not quantify the ES provided. From the rest, a large number of publications use proxies as indicators for ES, assuming or inferring their provision through indirect measurements such as species abundances, species density, species richness, diversity indices, or the number of functional groups. Pollinators, predators, parasitoids, herbivores, and decomposers are the most commonly studied functional groups, while Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera are the most studied taxa. Experimental studies are relatively scarce and they mainly focus on biological control, pollination, and decomposition performed in agroecosystems. These results suggest that our current knowledge on the ES provided by insects is relatively scarce and biased, and show gaps in the least-studied functional and taxonomic groups. An ambitious research agenda to improve the empirical and experimental evidence of the role played by insects in ES provision is essential to fully assess synergies between functional ecology, community ecology, and biodiversity conservation under current global changes.

AB We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of similar to 1000 km(2) in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna.
   Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination.
   Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.

AB In this study I tested the effect of Syagrus loefgrenii nut size and number on the intensity of removal by rodents across seasons. Trials were performed in which piles of either small or large endocarps (1, 3, 6, 12, and 25) were subjected to removal by rodents in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna). Despite of variations in the intensity of removal, always this process decrease conform endocarp number. Also, mean proportion of endocarp removal was unrelated to year period, initial number, and size of endocarps. Hence, endocarp removal was consistently negative density-dependent. As, in principle, the observed patterns of nut removal point out similar survival chances for both nut sizes, the pervasive negative density-dependent response emerges as a strategy in S. loefgrenii to swamp rodents all year round irrespective of seed size.

AB Intraspecific functional trait diversity (FTD) has improved our understandings about the key mechanisms of species coexistence in plant communities. Yet, little is known about whether and how intraspecific and inter specific FTD mediate the response of aboveground biomass to species richness across forest strata (i.e. overstorey and understorey) and at whole-community in forests. To address this question, we tested the direct and indirect responses of aboveground biomass to species richness via intraspecific and interspecific FTD based on specific leaf area (FTDSLA) and leaf dry matter content (FTDLDMC) using structural equation modeling, in addition to the effects of soil nutrients, across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. Results showed that intraspecific FTD mediates the response of aboveground biomass to species richness at overstorey and under storey strata, and whole-community level, while interspecific FTD did so at understorey strata only. At over storey strata, 14% of the variation in aboveground biomass was accounted by the strong direct positive effect of species richness only. At understorey strata, soil nutrients had a strong negative direct effect followed by positive effects of species richness and FTDLDMC on aboveground biomass with 44-45% of the variation in both intraspecific and interspecific FTD models. At whole community level, 14% of the variation in aboveground biomass was explained by the strong positive direct effect of species richness followed by negative direct effect of intraspecific FTDSLA. Intraspecific and interspecific FTDLDMC had positively mediated the response of aboveground biomass to species richness at understorey strata through niche differentiation. Intraspecific FTD had negligible mediation role, whereas interspecific FTD had no role, for linking the response of aboveground biomass to species richness at overstorey strata, indicating that only dominant species with a specific functional strategy may largely determine community trait space. Intraspecific FTDSLA had negative relationship with aboveground biomass at the whole-community, probably due to the presence of a few large trees occupying larger niche space in a community. We conclude that intraspecific versus interspecific FTD plays a central role for linking the direct and indirect responses of aboveground biomass to species richness, but these relationships depend on the forest strata of a community.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services programmes represent an important conservation policy worldwide. Despite their popularity, there is still a shortage of evidence regarding whether or not these schemes improve quality of life and generate desired behavioural changes. In this paper, we use a dataset from participants that enrolled in a conservation program on 2007, and from non-participants in the same program. Mexican indigenous communities were interviewed to evaluate program impacts on a range of land use and socio-economic variables between 2007 and 2013. In response to the theory that perceptions of ecosystem services mediate changes in behaviour regarding conservation, we seek to test whether participation in the programme makes it more likely for respondents to identify a higher number of ecosystem services obtained from the forest. Our results are in line with recent socio-economic evaluations of these programmes that conclude that, at best, such conservation programmes do not harm their participants. However, we are also able to provide evidence that participation in the Mexican programme increases participants' perception of the provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services obtained from the forest. These results add more evidence to the thin literature on the behavioural dimensions of ecosystem services and the kind of responses of program participants to the conservation of those services.

AB Ecological theory suggests that large habitat fragments should harbour more species than small fragments. However, this may depend on the surrounding matrix. Matrices in fragmented landscapes may either amplify or reduce area effects, which could influence predicted extinctions based on species-area relationships (SARs).
   To determine the influence of matrix type on SARs.
   We surveyed birds within 59 coastal forest fragments in two matrix types, anthropogenic (South Africa) and natural (Mozambique). We classified species as forest specialists or habitat generalists and fitted species-area models to compare how SAR slopes differed among matrix types. We also calculated nestedness and evenness to determine if these varied among matrix type and used logistic regressions to identify species-specific responses to matrix type.
   For habitat generalists, SARs were weak within both matrices, while for forest specialists it was strong in the anthropogenic but weak in the natural matrix. In the former, the SAR was similar to those recorded for real islands within archipelagos. Forest specialist assemblages were nested by area within anthropogenic, but not natural matrices. Matrix type did not influence evenness. Area only affected the occurrence of one species when the matrix was natural, compared to 11 species when it was anthropogenic.
   Forest specialist bird species conformed to island biogeographic predictions of species loss in forest fragments embedded in anthropogenic, but not natural matrices. Extinctions from small forest fragments might be prevented by conserving natural- or restoring anthropogenic matrices, as well as by increasing forest area.

AB The composition of the soil microbiome is influenced by environmental (abiotic) variables and biological interactions (biotic factors). To determine whether the aboveground vegetation and soil physicochemical properties were the main determinant of beta-diversity and biological interaction of soil microbial community, we sampled soils from the temperate coniferous forest and grassland. Clustering of operational taxonomic units was conducted using 16S rRNA gene. We found that the microbial composition of the rhizospheres, in which root exudates influence the microbial environment, show lower alpha-diversity than that of nonroot soils. The nonsignificant rhizosphere effect suggested other undetermined factors or stochastic processes accounted for microbial diversity in the rhizosphere. More significant microbe-microbe interactions were observed in forest and rhizosphere soils relative to the grassland soils. The elevated number of positive correlations for relative abundances in forest soil implied beneficial associations being common among bacteria, in particular within the rhizosphere environment. The particular soil properties generated by root exudates also alter the physicochemical properties of soil such as K and pH value, and might in turn favor the adoption of teamwork-cooperation strategies for microbe-microbe interactions, represented as large clusters of positive associations among bacterial taxa. Specific biological interactions differentiated the microbiomes within forest soils. Thus, the environmental selection pressure of aboveground vegetation accounts for differences between soil microbiomes while biotic factors are responsible for fine-scale differences of the microbial community in forest soils.

AB Little is known about the forces that determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities inhabiting drinking water treatment filters and how this affects drinking water quality. Two contrasting ecological theories can help to understand how natural microbial communities assemble; niche theory and neutral theory, where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors predominate respectively. This study investigates the development of the microbial community on two common contrasting filter materials (quartz sand and granular activated carbon-GAC), to elucidate the main factors governing their assembly, through the evaluation of environmental (i.e. filter medium type) and stochastic forces (random deaths, births and immigration). Laboratory-scale filter columns were used to mimic a rapid gravity filter; the microbiome of the filter materials, and of the filter influent and effluent, was characterised using next generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and flow-cytometry. Chemical parameters (i.e. dissolved organic carbon, trihalomethanes formation) were also monitored to assess the final effluent quality. The filter communities seemed to be strongly assembled by selection rather than neutral processes, with only 28% of those OTUs shared with the source water detected on the filter medium following predictions using a neutral community model. GAC hosted a phylogenetically more diverse community than sand. The two filter media communities seeded the effluent water, triggering differences in both water quality and community composition of the effluents. Overall, GAC proved to be better than sand in controlling microbial growth, by promoting higher bacterial decay rates and hosting less bacterial cells, and showed better performance for putative pathogen control by leaking less Legionella cells into the effluent water.

AB Habitat fragmentation often induces edge effects that can increase, decrease or have minimal effect upon the population density of a species, depending upon environmental conditions and the requirements of the species. Using a trapping study and generalized linear mixed models, we evaluated edge effects on small tropical mammals living near roads, including two ground-dwelling (Akodon sp. and Cerradomys subflavus) and two arboreal (Marmosops incanus and Rhipidomys sp.) species. We examined the relationship of these edge effects to environmental factors at both plot and patch scales. Generalist ground-dwelling species were attracted to edges, with higher population densities recorded in habitats close to road or matrix edges where vegetation density was lower. In contrast, populations of the generalist arboreal species avoided edge habitats, their populations were found in greater density in habitats far from roads/matrix edges. Thus, our results show that patterns of edge habitat utilization were related to the ecological requirements of each species. These findings are especially important in the tropics, where demand for economic growth in many countries has accelerated the fragmentation process and has recently culminated in increased road construction and expansion. Fragmented habitats promote an increase in edge environments, and consequently will reduce the abundance of arboreal small mammal species, such as those used as models in this study.

AB Few studies have been published that focus on monitoring and investigating the long-term patterns of recruitment and survival of seedlings in the understories of tropical forests. Studies for mixed dipterocarp forest, the dominant tropical forest type for South and Southeast Asia, demonstrate seedlings in the existing forest understory (advance regeneration) play the most important role in forming a new forest after disturbance (e.g., logging, windstorms). Our study monitors the regeneration dynamic across a topographic gradient (ridge, mid-slope, and valley) of the understory for a mixed dipterocarp forest in the Sinharaja MAB reserve in southwest Sri Lanka. We recorded seedling recruitment, growth, and mortality by species in replicated plots on multiple forest understory sites over a ten-year period. Seedling density ranged from 26 to 31 m(2) with all of it categorized as advance regeneration of canopy tree species. Results show differences in seedling density per species across the topography and over time, with differences driven by changes in species composition from valley to ridge and in recruitment periodicity potentially related to supra-annual variations in climate. Seedling mortality was higher on ridges than valley and midslopes; and disproportionately higher seedling mortality occurs of relatively shade-intolerant late-successional trees species (70% mortality after 8 yr) compared with their more shade-tolerant associates (30% mortality after 8 yr). Our results contradict current selective logging prescriptions for tropical forests that comprise a single cutting cycle and minimum diameter felling for all commercial timber trees. Such harvests give no consideration to timing and manipulation of the forest canopy to favor release of advance regeneration. We recommend careful timing of timber harvests to occur in synchrony to the periodicity of seedling recruitment and silvicultural treatments that both insures their release and that accommodates to differences in seedling composition and density across topography.

AB Most of the world's ant species rely on flight for reproduction and dispersal, during a solitary phase in which colony fitness depends only on the survival of individual queens. Flight-related selection shapes ant physiology, such that queens and males fly for short durations but carry heavy loads due to the nutrient demands of mating and colony founding. Ants vary by four orders of magnitude in flight distance, with larger ants or those with lighter abdomens flying farther than smaller or heavier ones. Flight tradeoffs explain much variation in ant life history, including the temporal segregation of flight and egg production, the continuum of ant mating systems from male aggregation to female calling syndromes, and the evolution of alternate colony founding strategies. Flight performance also constrains range expansions or shifts in response to invasions or climate change. Flying queens and males act as dispersal vectors for pathogenic or symbiotic organisms, and are eaten in large numbers by aerial insectivores. By entering aerial food webs, flying ants help mediate the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems. They are also model systems for addressing several questions, including nutrient allocation tradeoffs and the evolution of reproductive polymorphisms.

AB This research aimed to quantify the effects of precipitation and land use changes on the hydrological response (peak discharge and runoff volume) in the River Kelantan catchment, Malaysia. Two periods were studied, involving the years 1988 (lower hydrological response) and 2004 (greater hydrological response). Rainfall and land use observed for the year 1988 was used in the calibrated and validated model for 1988, but also used in the calibrated 2004 runoff model to simulate the impact of changes in these two factors on runoff generation. For the upstream gauge, differences in peak discharge and runoff volume were affected more by land use change compared to climate-related changes (i.e. precipitation). However, changes in hydrologic response in the downstream catchment were much more associated with precipitation changes. From these findings, we suggest that both land use and climate changes (i.e. precipitation) contributed to changes in hydrologic response in the Kelantan monsoonal catchment, but that for the downstream catchment, which is more prone to flooding, with associated potential socio-economic impacts, precipitation change is the major driver. The results have clear implications for planning and management decision-making.

AB Modelling and simulation of tree growth that is faithful to the living environment and numerically consistent to botanic knowledge are important topics for realistic modelling in computer graphics. The realism factors concerned include the effects of complex environment on tree growth and the reliability of the simulation in botanical research, such as horticulture and agriculture. This paper proposes a new approach, namely, integrated growth modelling, to model virtual trees and simulate their growth by enforcing constraints of environmental resources and tree morphological properties. Morphological properties are integrated into a growth equation with different parameters specified in the simulation, including its sensitivity to light, allocation and usage of received resources and effects on its environment. The growth equation guarantees that the simulation procedure numerically matches the natural growth phenomenon of trees. With this technique, the growth procedures of diverse and realistic trees can also be modelled in different environments, such as resource competition among multiple trees.

AB Herbivory is an important factor to generate spatial mosaics with variations in a plant community composition and organization. The objective of this work was to determine the impact of Atta vollenweideri Forel 1893 nests on herbaceous and shrub vegetation in a degraded native forest of the Espinal ecoregion. The study was carried out in the Protected Area and Multiple Use Nature Reserve called Estancia "El Caraya" (Entre Rios, Argentina). Ten A. vollenweideri nests were selected by simple random sampling through internal roads, and two transects were drawn from the center of the nest (0 m) up to 60 m away in opposite directions. The line intercept method was used to quantify the percentage of vegetation cover of herbaceous and shrub species, while the floristic composition was estimated by the Canfield method. Afterwards, a nonparametric test between positions and a conglomerate analysis to evaluated distance were applied. Grass species, legumes, and sedges fell in the adjacent areas to nests, highlighting the bare soil at the crest and base of the nests. Fifteen plant species were identified, and two families correspond to monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. In conclusion, the nests of A. vollenweideri affect the community of herbaceous and shrub vegetation of the studied degraded native forest of the Espinal ecoregion since these ants perform a high selection of herbaceous species considered as pioneers of plant successions.

AB Comparative investigations were undertaken in five forest fragments (Chawia, Fururu, Mbololo, Ngangao and Vuria) of varying sizes in Taita Hills, Kenya to examine the effects of forest edge on soil moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, electrical conductivity and organic carbon (hereafter referred to as environmental variables) along forest edge-interior gradient and relate them to tree species distribution and abundance. For each of the forest fragment, belt transects proportional to the forest area were established for data collection. Within each belt transect, plots of 10.0 x 10.0 m were systematically established and replicated three times in a stratum at an interval of between 10.0 and 50.0 m along forest edge-interior gradient depending on the size of the forest fragment for assessment of environmental variables and tree species distribution and abundance. Results showed significant edge effect on the distribution and abundance of dominant and adaptable tree species i.e. Macaranga conglomerata, Albizia gummifera, Syzygium guineense, Xymalos monospora, Tabernaemontana stapfiana and Maesa lanceolata (p = .012). Edge effect was also noted among the following environmental variables; soil pH in Mbololo (p < .001), Ngangao (p < .001) and Vuria (p = .042), electrical conductivity (p = .048) and nitrogen (p = .038) in Fururu and potassium in Mbololo (p = .002) and Ngangao (p = .035). The distance from the forest edge influenced the distribution and abundance of 36.7% and 36.4% of most abundant species and less abundant species respectively. The environmental variables-tree species relationships established in this study could be utilized in selecting native tree species for rehabilitation programs to restore the degraded sites within the forest fragments.

AB REDD+ was initially conceived of as a multi-level carbon-based payment for environmental services (PES). It is still often assumed to be a cost-effective climate change mitigation strategy, but this assumption is mostly based on theoretical studies and static opportunity cost calculations. We used spatial and socioeconomic datasets from an Amazonian deforestation frontier in Brazil to construct a simulation model of REDD + payments to households that can be used to assess REDD + interventions. Our SimREDD + model consists of dynamic optimization and land-use/cover change allocation sub-models built into an agent-based model platform. The model assumes that households maximize profit under perfect market conditions and calculates the optimal household land-use/cover configuration at equilibrium under a given REDD + PES scenario. These scenarios include PES based on (1) forest area and (2) carbon stocks. Insights gained from simulations under different conditions can assist in the design of more effective, efficient, and equitable REDD + programs. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In stands with a broad range of diameters, a small number of very large trees can disproportionately influence stand basal area and transpiration (Et). Sap flow-based Et estimates may be particularly sensitive to large trees due to nonlinear relationships between tree-level water use (Q) and tree diameter at breast height (DBH). Because Q is typically predicted on the basis of DBH and sap flow rates measured in a subset of trees and then summed to obtain Et, we assessed the relative importance of DBH and sap flow variables (sap velocity, V-s, and sapwood depth, R-s) in determining the magnitude of Et and its dependence on large trees in a tropical montane forest ecosystem. Specifically, we developed a data-driven simulation framework to vary the relationship between DBH and V-s and stand DBH distribution and then calculate Q, E-t and the proportion of E-t contributed by the largest tree in each stand. Our results demonstrate that variation in how R-s is determined in the largest trees can alter estimates up to 26% of E-t while variation in how V-s is determined can vary results by up to 132%. Taken together, these results highlight a great need to expand our understanding of water transport in large trees as this hinders our ability to predict water fluxes accurately from stand to catchment scales.

AB We examined the spatial distribution and potential relationship of genetic and volatile terpenoid diversity in 13 Mexican populations of Mikania micrantha (Asteraceae) from the Atlantic and Pacific watersheds using six specific microsatellites. A low genetic diversity was observed in all populations (H-E = 0.00-0.37), which may be attributed to clonal reproduction and/or their marginal location relative to the whole species distribution in the Americas. We found a significant genetic differentiation between regions, and more genetic structure in Atlantic populations where a Mantel test also showed a pattern of isolation by distance (r(2) = 0.478, P = 0.002). In addition, we detected three genetic barriers that match geographic barriers and may be responsible for population isolation. The geographic patterns of genetic diversity were compared to those from chemical diversity but we found no correlation between the genetic and chemical distances of the populations. Our results suggest that neutral molecular markers and adaptive traits like defensive metabolites provide complementary information that may prove useful during the selection of biocontrol agents for invasive plant species.

AB A biogeographical regionalization is a hierarchical system that categorizes geographical areas in terms of their biotas. I provide a general protocol to undertake biogeographical regionalizations, that consists of seven steps: (1) defining the study area; (2) assembling distributional data; (3) identifying natural areas; (4) discovering area relationships; (5) defining boundaries/transition zones; (6) regionalization and (7) area nomenclature. Natural biogeographical units are useful for people undertaking different types of analyses, like macroecologists, evolutionary biologists, systematists and conservationists. Biogeographical regionalizations may help biogeographers communicate more effectively between themselves and discover opportunities to work on common problems, contributing to the development of a truly integrative biogeography.

AB We analyzed the shade tolerance of a tropical tree species based on the plasticity of 22 photosynthetic traits. Carpotroche brasiliensis leaves have characteristics of a shade-tolerant species, with low photosynthetic plasticity.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the photosynthetic plasticity of young Carpotroche brasiliensis plants in response to different light environments. This tropical tree species has some shade-tolerant traits, such as large and fleshy fruits, seeds with a high water content, and the ability for natural regeneration in the forest understory. In this way, we tested the hypothesis that, at the leaf scale, young C. brasiliensis plants have photosynthetic characteristics of shade-tolerant species, with low photosynthetic plasticity when grown under different light environments. For this, seedlings were subjected to four light treatments (60, 35, 25, and 15% full sunlight, corresponding to about 20.9, 11.9, 9.1, and 5.4 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), respectively) for 5 months. We evaluated the photosynthetic plasticity at the leaf scale through morphological and anatomical variables, as well as variables associated with the diffusive, photochemical, and biochemistry phases of photosynthesis. All key photosynthetic variables measured exhibited values of typical shaded leaves. The highest simplified relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) for light treatments was found for light compensation point (0.32), performance index (0.30), photochemical reflectance index (0.30), mesophyll conductance (0.27), dark respiration rate (0.27), and leaf area (0.19). The lowest RDPI for light treatments was found for the leaf anatomical variables (< 0.1). From the 22 photosynthesis-related variables analyzed, we conclude that, on a leaf scale, young C. brasiliensis plants exhibit characteristics of a typical shade-tolerant species. Based on our results, we can recommend the plantation of C. brasiliensis seedlings in forest enrichment programs or agroforestry systems, in which other tree species are present providing light environments below 35% full sunlight or about 10 mol photons m(-2) day(-1).

AB Floral herbivory represents a major threat to plant reproductive success, driving the importance of plant tolerance mechanisms that minimize fitness costs. However, the cumulative insect herbivory plants experience under natural conditions complicates predictions about tolerance contributions to net fitness. Apical damage can lead to compensatory seed production from late season flowering that ameliorates early season fitness losses. Yet, the compensation realized depends on successful development and herbivore escape by later season flowers. Using monocarpic perennial Cirsium canescens, we quantified seed-reproductive fitness of plants with vs. without experimental damage to the early-developing large apical flower head, with and without a 30-40% herbivory reduction on subsequent flower heads, for two flowering cohorts. Plants with reduced herbivory clearly demonstrated the release of apical dominance and compensation, not overcompensation, for apical damage via greater seed maturation by later flower heads. In contrast, plants that experienced ambient herbivory levels on subsequent heads undercompensated for early apical damage. Individuals had lower total seed set when the apical head was damaged. Compensation was, therefore, possible through a small increase in total flower heads, caused by a higher rate of floral bud survival, and a higher seed maturation rate by subsequent heads, leading to more viable seeds per matured flower head. With ambient cumulative floral herbivory, compensation for apical damage was not sufficient to improve fitness. Variation in the intensity of biological interactions played a role in the success of plant tolerance as a mechanism to maximize individual fitness.

AB Expansion of oil palm agriculture is currently one of the main drivers of habitat modification in Southeast Asia. Habitat modification can have significant effects on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and interactions between species by altering species abundances or the available resources in an ecosystem. Increasing complexity within modified habitats has the potential to maintain biodiversity and preserve species interactions. We investigated trophic interactions between Argyrodes miniaceus, a cleptoparasitic spider, and its Nephila spp. spider hosts in mature oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. A. miniaceus co-occupy the webs of Nephila spp. females and survive by stealing prey items caught in the web. We examined the effects of experimentally manipulated understory vegetation complexity on the density and abundance of A. miniaceus in Nephila spp. webs. Experimental understory treatments included enhanced complexity, standard complexity, and reduced complexity understory vegetation, which had been established as part of the ongoing Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture (BEFTA) Project. A. miniaceus density ranged from 14.4 to 31.4 spiders per square meter of web, with significantly lower densities found in reduced vegetation complexity treatments compared with both enhanced and standard treatment plots. A. miniaceus abundance per plot was also significantly lower in reduced complexity than in standard and enhanced complexity plots. Synthesis and applications: Maintenance of understory vegetation complexity contributes to the preservation of spider host-cleptoparasite relationships in oil palm plantations. Understory structural complexity in these simplified agroecosystems therefore helps to support abundant spider populations, a functionally important taxon in agricultural landscapes. In addition, management for more structurally complex agricultural habitats can support more complex trophic interactions in tropical agroecosystems.

AB Phenotypic and genetic variation are present in all species, but lineages differ in how variation is partitioned among populations. Examining phenotypic clustering and genetic structure within a phylogeographic framework can clarify which biological processes have contributed to extant biodiversity in a given lineage. Here, we investigate genetic and phenotypic variation among populations and subspecies within a Neotropical songbird complex, the White-collared Seedeater (Sporophila torqueola) of Central America and Mexico. We combine measurements of morphology and plumage patterning with thousands of nuclear loci derived from ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and mitochondrial DNA to evaluate population differentiation. We find deep levels of molecular divergence between two S.torqueola lineages that are phenotypically diagnosable: One corresponds to S.t.torqueola along the Pacific coast of Mexico, and the other includes S.t.morelleti and S.t.sharpei from the Gulf Coast of Mexico and Central America. Surprisingly, these two lineages are strongly differentiated in both nuclear and mitochondrial markers, and each is more closely related to other Sporophila species than to one another. We infer low levels of gene flow between these two groups based on demographic models, suggesting multiple independent evolutionary lineages within S.torqueola have been obscured by coarse-scale similarity in plumage patterning. These findings improve our understanding of the biogeographic history of this lineage, which includes multiple dispersal events out of South America and across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec into Mesoamerica. Finally, the phenotypic and genetic distinctiveness of the range-restricted S.t.torqueola highlights the Pacific Coast of Mexico as an important region of endemism and conservation priority.

AB The dynamic ebb and flood of tides makes the marine intertidal zone a habitat with temperatures that fluctuate rapidly in both space and time. This is problematic for slow intertidal organisms that cannot move at the speed of tidal fluctuations. The timing of low tides determines which days organisms may experience extreme body temperatures, controlling microclimate to a greater degree than weather patterns. When low tides occur midday, temperatures can exceed critical thermal maxima for many species. Although high shore areas experience the greatest environmental extremes, they often harbor untapped food resources. The periodicity of low tide timing creates a predictable cycle that marine animals can use to obtain food in risky areas while minimizing exposure to thermal extremes. Here, we use a two-part approach to assess whether the snail, Nucella ostrina, uses the predictability of the tidal cycle to obtain food in risky areas while minimizing exposure to thermal extremes. Radio tracking detected the presence/absence of snails in high shore feeding areas continuously for 14 weeks and physical thermal models approximated snail body temperature in those high shore areas. Snails were absent when extreme low tides occurred at times of high solar irradiance (midday). Comparing the subset of physical model body temperatures foraging snails experienced to all available body temperatures in the high shore environment showed snails in foraging areas disproportionately at 9-12 degrees C and absent at body temperatures > 31 degrees C, suggesting that N. ostrina is not present when and where thermal risk is greatest. These patterns demonstrate that censuring only at low tide yields an adequate picture of foraging behavior of this species in its natural habitat, and that migratory foraging behavior effectively moderates snail experience of environmental temperature in nature and may buffer this species from aerial warming.

AB Certain smallholder farmers in parts of sub-Saharan Africa engage in conservation agriculture and participate in agroforestry ecosystem services schemes that generate additional on-farm revenues through payment for ecosystem services (PES). However, smallholder farmers that are inadequately compensated for the foregone income from agricultural production due to marginal ecosystem services provision have no incentive to participate. On the other hand, over-compensating participating farmers will also lead to PES schemes inefficiencies. Therefore, stakeholders are confronted with the challenge of evaluating farm-level interactions between agricultural production and ecosystem services' provision when making strategic decisions on the efficient level of compensation. We propose in this contribution to assess the efficiency of PES schemes by measuring the marginal cost of ecosystem services based on farm level bio-economic interactions. The quantitative assessment is based on a theoretical classification of the relationship between marketed agricultural output and ecosystem services into complementary, supplementary or competitive. We use a flexible transformation function and cross-sectional data on 120 surveyed smallholder farmers with agroforestry certification in rural Mount Kenya. The results suggest that the joint production (of agricultural output and ecosystem services) for a substantial number of smallholder farms in Kenya may not show a complementary relationship. The biophysical linkage between marketed outputs and ecosystem services strongly influences the marginal cost of ecosystem services.

TI Soy Moratorium in Mato Grosso: Deforestation undermines the agreement
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English

ID AMAZON
AB Brazil is one of the world leaders in replacing forests with agriculture. Agribusiness has responded to international public opinion by introducing the Soy Moratorium, (SoyM), an agreement that aims to inhibit the destruction of forests to plant soy in the Brazilian Amazon. This pressure led to the creation of a joint working group comprised of representatives from the civil society, soy producers, and finally the Brazilian government. In this article, we analyze all the areas that were forested in 2006 and are now planted with soy in the Amazonian municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso. During the period in which we analyzed deforestation between 2009 and 2016, we identified 54 municipalities that were not in compliance with SoyM; a total of 59,972 ha had been converted to soy plantation. These results can be ascribed to several reasons, one of which is, essentially, that SoyM has not been able to reach the offending producers. If we consider deforestation starting in 2006, the amount of soy grown in violation of SoyM would be equivalent to an estimated total of 350,000 tons(-1), or 9700 truckloads, only in the 2016/17 harvest. Nevertheless, even with these less satisfactory results, SoyM, the first voluntary zero-deforestation agreement implemented in the tropics, should be seen as a commendable initiative to engage all segments, including society, the productive sector, and the government, in this process. It merely needs to be refined, with all the groups involved in discussing new strategies in an international forum.

AB Aims
   It is known that taxonomic diversity can be predicted by the spatial configuration of the habitat, in particular by its area and degree of isolation. However, taxonomic diversity is a poor predictor of ecosystem functioning. While functional diversity is strongly linked to the functionality and stability of ecosystems, little is known about how changes in the spatial configuration of the habitat affect functional diversity. In this study, we evaluated whether the spatial configuration of forest patches predicts the functional diversity of plants in a fragmented forest.
   Methods
   Five functional leaf traits (leaf dry matter content, leaf punch force, specific leaf area, leaf size and leaf thickness) were measured for 23 dominant plant species in 20 forest patches in a naturally fragmented forest on the Yucatan Peninsula. Abundance-weighted multivariate and individual trait metrics of functional diversity were calculated and correlated with size, degree of isolation and the shape of forest patches.
   Important Findings
   Patch shape was negatively correlated with multivariate and individual trait (leaf dry matter content and leaf size) metrics of functional diversity. Patch isolation measures were also negatively correlated with individual trait (leaf dry matter content, leaf punch force and leaf size) metrics of functional diversity. In other words, greater patch shape irregularity and isolation degree impoverish plant functional variability. This is the first report of the negative effects of patch shape irregularity and isolation on the functional diversity of plant communities in a forest that has been fragmented for a long time.

   CONSERVATION
AB Tropical America (the Neotropics) harbours more plant species than any other region on Earth. The contribution of rare species to this diversity has been recently recognised, but their spatial distribution remains poorly understood. Here, we use all collection records of angiosperms from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to delineate Neotropical bioregions, and to identify putatively rare species within the Neotropics and the Amazonian rainforest. We analyse the spatial distribution of these species and validate the results on a largely independent dataset based on vegetation plots from the Amazon Tree Diversity Network. We find that rare species are homogeneously distributed through most parts of the lowland Neotropics and Amazonia, but more concentrated in highlands. The second collection of any rare species is most often found in the close vicinity of the first, but in 20% of cases they are more than 580 km apart. We also find cross-taxonomic patterns of disjunct distributions within the Andes, the Atlantic forest in eastern Brazil, and between Amazonia and the Atlantic forest, but no clear disjunction patterns within lowland areas. These results suggest that a considerable proportion of rare plant species have surprisingly large distribution ranges, and that collections of rare species across most of the lowland Neotropics, and in particular in Amazonia, show no clear directionality. The second record of many rare species may be found virtually anywhere, urging the need for intensifying and broadening biological sampling.

AB Landscape-scale approaches to assessing the impact of land-use change on species' persistence are necessary because species depend on processes acting at varying scales, yet existing approaches to ecological impact assessment tend only to be site-based. A further major criticism of current ecological impact assessments is that they tend to be qualitative. Here we develop methods that apply the Incidence Function Model (IFM) in real urban planning contexts, by generating repeatable and comparable quantitative measures of ecological impacts. To demonstrate the methods for a case study (Nottingham, UK), we estimated landscape-scale measures of species' persistence that indicate metapopulation viability. We based these on Nottingham's landscape when urban developments were recently proposed, then adjust the land cover to include the proposed developments, and also for two projected landscapes where 10% and 20% of the original natural or semi-natural land cover is lost. We find that the IFM shows promise as a tool for quantitative landscape-scale ecological impact assessment, depending on the size of the impact. We detected minimal differences in the species' viability measures between the original and post -development landscapes. This suggests that for small (around 2%) cumulative losses ofnatural/semi-natural space, current site-based approaches are sufficient. However, when the cumulative effect of continued development was modelled by increasing the losses of natural/semi-natural land cover to 10-20% of existing cover, the impact on many of the species studied was more substantial. This indicates that a landscape scale approach is necessary for larger, prolonged and cumulative habitat losses.

AB Priority effects, or the effects of species arrival history on local species abundances, have been documented in a range of taxa. However, factors determining the extent to which priority effects affect community assembly remain unclear. Using laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, we examined whether shared evolutionary history affected the strength of priority effects. We hypothesized that sympatric evolution of populations belonging to the same guild would lead to niche differentiation, resulting in phenotypic complementarity that weakens priority effects. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that priority effects tended to be weaker in sympatrically evolved pairs of immigrating populations than in allopatrically evolved pairs. Furthermore, priority effects were weaker under higher phenotypic complementarity. However, these patterns were observed only in populations with a relatively short history of sympatric evolution, and disappeared when populations had evolved together for a long time. Together, our results suggest that the evolutionary history of organismal traits may dictate the strength of priority effects and, consequently, the extent of historical contingency in the assembly of ecological communities.

AB One of the recurrent themes in historical biogeography relates to the units of analysis, their definition and identification. Although areas of endemism are usually accepted as the standard units of study, other units have been suggested, as well as several methods for identifying them. There is no consensus on which units are best suited for the studies; however, the effect of the units and area schemes on analytical results is acknowledged. Here, I review the literature on biogeographic units, their uses and recommendations, highlighting the relevance of the use of more than one area-classification scheme in empirical studies.

AB We present a study of the endemicity patterns in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest on the basis of the distribution of 107 fly species belonging to 24 genera of 15 families. This is the first picture of endemism for Diptera in the Atlantic Forest. Instead of the traditional grid of geographical coordinates, we used a system of topographic units (TUs) for the analysis, delimited after gathering information on rivers and altitude for each state and country. A parsimony analysis of the data matrix with the species records for the Us was performed, named topographic-unit parsimony analysis (TUPA). The same distributional data was used in a NDM/VNDM analysis. The combination of the resulting patterns from both analyses indicated the existence of the following three major areas of endemism for flies in the Atlantic Forest: a Northern Atlantic Forest, north of Rio Doce; a Southern Atlantic Forest, south of Rio Doce along the coast, extending to the west and to the south at the level of the state of Parana; and a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, west to the ombrophilous forest along the coast. None of these areas seems to be shaped solely by vicariance events. They can possibly be the result of biotic fusion of ancestral areas of endemism as a result of barrier collapse and secondary overlap of sister biotas, a hypothesis yet to be tested. The recognition of a separate area of endemism for flies in the Semideciduous Forest agrees with phytogeographical reconstructions and raises an important alert for the scarcity of biological reserves for this vegetation.

AB Advanced cognitive abilities have long been hypothesized to be important in mating. Yet, most work on sexual selection has focused on morphological traits and its relevance for cognitive evolution is poorly understood. We studied the spatial memory of lekking long-billed hermits (Phaethornis longirostris) and evaluated its role in lek territory ownership, the magnitude of its effect compared to phenotypic traits expected to influence sexual selection, and whether its variation is indicated in the structure of mating vocal signal. Spatial memory (the ability to recall the position of a rewarding feeder) was compared between "territorial" and "floater" males. Interestingly, although spatial memory and body size both positively affected the probability of lek territory ownership, our results suggest a stronger effect of spatial memory. Bill tip length (used as weapon in agonistic interactions) also showed a positive but smaller effect. Load lifting during vertical flight, a measure of physical performance relevant to agonistic interactions, had no effect on territory ownership. Finally, both body size and spatial memory were indicated in the structure of male song: body size negatively correlated with song lowest frequency, while spatial memory positively predicted song consistency. Together, our findings lend support for cognition as a sexual selection target.

AB Habitat destruction, characterized by patch loss and patch fragmentation, has been recognized as one of leading factors driving species loss. Although some studies have already explored how patch loss affects metacommunity dynamics, the effect of patch configurational fragmentation remains vaguely understood. Here we construct a patch-dynamic model for various plant-animal interactions in fragmented landscapes, including neutralism (0, 0), poison (0, -), competition (-, -), predation (-, +), fruitivory (0, +) and mutualism (+, +). Counter-intuitively, negative plant-animal interactions (harmful for one or both species) show stronger tolerance to habitat destruction (i.e., higher species persistence) than positive interactions (beneficial to one or both species), in spite of lower patch occupancy. This is because animal species survival in positive interactions largely depends on plant species abundance. Furthermore, neutralism displays most robust to both patch loss and fragmentation while mutualism showing most vulnerability. Essentially, neutral interaction leads to more patches available for both plant and animal species, while in mutualistic interaction (e.g., pollination), both plant and animal species can only persist when they co-occur at the same patches. Compared to other interactions, predation (-, +) results in lowest patch occupancy, but such trophic interaction does not exhibit highest sensitivity to habitat destruction. Overall, our modelling framework provides new insights into how different plant-animal interactions respond to landscape fragmentation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of environmental and dispersal processes on macrofungi community assembly remain unclear. Further, it is not well understood if community assembly differs for different functional guilds of macrofungi, e.g., soil and rotten-wood macrofungi. In this study, using 2433 macrofungi sporocarps belonging to 217 species located within a forest dynamics plot in temperate mountain forest (China), we examined the explanatory power of topography, spatial eigenvectors (representing unknown spatial processes, e.g., dispersal), plant community, and light availability for local spatial variation in the macrofungi community through variance partitioning and partial least squares path modeling. We found spatial eigenvectors and light as the most important factors for explaining species richness and composition of macrofungi. Light was negatively correlated with species richness of macrofungi. Furthermore, species richness and composition of soil macrofungi were best explained by light, and species richness and composition of rotten-wood macrofungi were best explained by spatial eigenvectors. Woody plant community structure was not an important factor for species richness and composition of macrofungi. Our findings suggest that spatial processes, perhaps dispersal limitation, and light availability were the most important factors affecting macrofungi community in temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest. Major differences in influencing factors between soil and rotten-wood macrofungi were observed, with light as the major driver for soil macrofungi and unknown spatial processes as the major driver for rotten-wood macrofungi. These findings shed new light to the processes shaping community assembly in macrofungi in temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest and point to the potential importance of both intrinsic dynamics, such as dispersal, and external forcing, such as forest dynamics, via its effect on light availability.

AB Phosphorus (P) is one of the most limiting macronutrients for crop productivity and P deficiency is a common phenomenon in agricultural soils worldwide. Despite long-term application of phosphate fertilizers to increase crop yields, P availability is often low, due to the high affinity of phosphate for the soil solid phase. It has been suggested that the accumulated (surplus) P in agricultural soils is sufficient to sustain crop yields worldwide for about 100 years. In this paper, we try to clear up the potential for making use of legacy P in soils for crop growth potentially alleviating the global P resource shortage. Specifically, we try to clear up the potential of soil "P activators" for releasing fixed P. P activators accelerate and strengthen process which transform P into bio-available forms via a range of chemical reactions and biological interactions. They include phosphate solubilizing microorganisms, phosphatase enzymes and enzyme activators, low molecular weight organic acids, humic acids, lignin, crop residues, biochar and zeolites. Although reported performance is variable, there is growing evidence that P activators can promote the release of phosphate from soil and, hence, have potential for mitigating the impending global P crisis. Further basic and applied research is required to better understand the mechanisms of interaction of P activators with natural soils and to maximize activator efficacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In open woodlands and savannas, fire is often the dominant disturbance that shapes and maintains their structure and dynamics. Numerous studies have explored tree-grass coexistence under different fire regimes in these ecosystems; however, there is a lack of research on the tree-tree relationship in the presence or absence of fire. In the present study, we explored the effects of fire regime on tree spatial pattern, mortality and regeneration in the Argentine Caldenal, which is one of the most endangered and least studied open woodlands in the Neotropics. While there was no significant difference in the overall tree density between frequently burned and fire-excluded regimes, we found clear divergences between fire regimes in the within-stand spacing of not only all trees, but also of large and small trees in addition to their spatial interactions. In contrast with previous results from other frequently burned open forests, trees in the Caldenal were randomly distributed in burned plots whereas both mid-and long-term fire exclusion lead to the strong short-scale aggregation of trees. In the absence of fire, both large and small trees were significantly clumped, but in the frequently burned woodlands, large and small trees had a tendency to repulsion and aggregation, respectively. Fire regime also significantly affected tree mortality and regeneration mechanisms in the Caldenal. Our mortality analysis indicated that fire suppression led to the shift from fire-induced to competition-driven mortality of trees. When analysing tree regeneration, we found a lack of seedlings in any of the fire regimes but the presence of vigorous sprouting only in frequently burned plots. The present study thus revealed the key role of frequent fires in the Caldenal open woodlands because recurrent burning not only shaped the spatial arrangement of trees, but fire-induced mortality also triggered an essential tree recruitment mechanism in these ecosystems.

AB Background: Canopy structure, defined by leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FCover) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), regulates a wide range of forest functions and ecosystem services. Spatially consistent field-measurements of canopy structure are however lacking, particularly for the tropics.
   Methods: Here, we introduce the Global LAI database: a global dataset of field-based canopy structure measurements spanning tropical forests in four continents (Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas). We use these measurements to test for climate dependencies within and across continents, and to test for the potential of anthropogenic disturbance and forest protection to modulate those dependences.
   Results: Using data collected from 887 tropical forest plots, we show that maximum water deficit, defined across the most arid months of the year, is an important predictor of canopy structure, with all three canopy attributes declining significantly with increasing water deficit. Canopy attributes also increase with minimum temperature, and with the protection of forests according to both active (within protected areas) and passive measures (through topography). Once protection and continent effects are accounted for, other anthropogenic measures (e.g. human population) do not improve the model.
   Conclusions: We conclude that canopy structure in the tropics is primarily a consequence of forest adaptation to the maximum water deficits historically experienced within a given region. Climate change, and in particular changes in drought regimes may thus affect forest structure and function, but forest protection may offer some resilience against this effect.

AB Despite El Nino events being one of the main forces shaping the coastal desert vegetation in South America, the impacts of the high precipitation typical of this rare but recurrent climatic event remain understudied. Here we monitored the plant community of a coastal lomas, a seasonal desert ecosystem, during 1998 and 2001 to analyse its changes during the 1997-98 El Nino and the following La Nina events. We measured species abundance and vegetation cover in 31 plots, and recorded climate variables in Lomas de Lachay, Peru. We found a significant positive correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover, density, alpha diversity (species diversity at the plot level), total richness and abundance of several key species but no correlation with gamma diversity (species diversity at the whole loma level). During the El Nino event, the seasonality, typical of the lomas ecosystem, disappeared, as evidenced by both the similarity of species composition and mean vegetation cover values between most sampling campaigns of 1998 and 1999. Moreover, total richness was lower during the El Nino event than during the humid season of 2000 and 2001 resulting from the dominance of only a few species, such as Nicotiana paniculata and Loasa urens. Temporal-spatial changes in the abundance of the dominant species caused the differences between alpha and gamma diversity, especially during 1999. Within that year, mean alpha diversity showed similar values whilst gamma diversity values were different. The reestablishment of the seasonality of most plant community characteristics and a clear difference between species composition of the humid and the dry season occurred two years after the El Nino event, suggesting a resilient community. This study provides one of the few quantifications of the Peruvian lomas' response to the 1997-98 El Nino event and the following La Nina, one of the most extreme climatic events in the last century.

AB Fertilizer with different ratios of nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) can influence crop plant performance and defense against herbivores. Spodoptera exigua is an important agricultural pest that has caused serious economic loss, especially in recent decades. In the present study, we explored effects of different intensities and durations of S. exigua herbivory on host plant biomass and on S. exigua enzyme activities in response to five fertilizer treatments with different N: P ratios of 1: 5, 1: 3, 1: 1, 3: 1 and 5: 1. The results showed that fertilizer type can significantly influence interactions between caterpillars and its hosts. Compensatory growth of leaf biomass was detected under fertilizer with N: P = 3: 1. Fertilizer with a higher proportion of N appears to maintain stem biomass in defoliated seedlings similar to controls that are not exposed to herbivory. There was no significant difference in root biomass under most conditions. High proportion of N also enhanced the activity of two antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in low density of beet armyworm. However, with increased herbivorous intensity, a higher proportion of P played a more important role in increasing the activities of CAT and SOD. Higher P likely enhanced acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity at lower degrees of defoliation, but a higher N proportion resulted in higher AChE activity at higher degrees of defoliation. Higher N proportion contributed to reduced carboxylesterase (CarE) activity at high intensity, short-term defoliation. However, when defoliation intensity increased, the difference in CarE activity between fertilizer categories was little. The study explored the interaction between the damage of S. exigua and the biomass accumulation of its host plant Brassica rapa, and the influence of the N/P ratio in plant fertilizer on this interaction. Systematic analysis was provided on the biomass of B. rapa and the activity of metabolic enzymes of S. exigua under different treatments.

AB Forest islands are unique habitats standing out across mountains dominated by rupestrian grassland in southeastern Brazil. In this work we evaluated the relationship between the plant species functional traits (number of ecoregions in which a species occurs, potential height, mean height, mean basal area, mean leaf area) and ecological variables (leaf damage from chewing herbivores, the number of individuals) with environmental parameters (physical and chemical properties of the soil, canopy cover) of the tree communities in an archipelago of montane forest islands immersed in rupestrian grasslands. We found a strong connection between the traits of tree species and environmental parameters; habitats associated with high soil fertility and canopy cover (leaf area index) harbored species with high structural values (i.e., height and basal area), broad distribution among Brazilian ecoregions, high rates of leaf damage from chewing insects and fewer individuals. Habitats with low soil fertility and canopy cover values harbored species with low structural values, restricted geographic distribution and low rates of leaf damage by chewing insects. Although physical parameters play an important role in the establishment of forest islands, our results point to chemical indicators of soil fertility as a relevant environmental promoter, influencing the composition and structure of island tree communities. The impact of local habitat parameters on the tree species functional traits showed that habitat heterogeneity is essential in structuring tree communities in this natural archipelago of forest islands. We advocate that understanding the connection between habitat parameters and species functional traits can help to predict the ecological consequences of anthropogenic or natural impacts to those forests, supporting the development of effective conservation strategies.

AB Background: The remaining forests in the extensive contact zone between southern Amazonia (seasonal rain forest) and the Cerrado (savanna) biomes are at risk due to intense land-use and climate change.Aims: To explore the vulnerability of these transitional forests to changes in land use and climate, we evaluated the effects of fragmentation and climatic variables on forest structure.Methods: We measured the diameter and height of 14,185 trees with diameter 10cm at 24 forest plots distributed over an area of 25,000km(2). For each plot, we obtained data on contemporary fragmentation and climatic variables.Results: Forest structure variables (height, diameter, height:diameter allometry, biomass) varied significantly both within and among plots. The height, H:D and biomass of trees were positively correlated with annual precipitation and fragment area.Conclusions: The association between forest structure and precipitation indicates that these forests plots are likely to be vulnerable to dry season intensification anticipated for the southern edge of the Amazon. Additionally, the reduction in the fragment area may contribute to reductions in forest biomass and tree height, and consequently ecosystem carbon stocks. Given the likely susceptibility of these forests, urgent conservation action is needed to prevent further habitat degradation.

AB Global food security is one if the major issues that needs utmost attention of the scientific community in near future. The growing food demand of the society is putting enormous pressure on the resources over which the food supply of the civilization depends. The two major components affecting the global food security are population and global climate change. The rate at which the population of the World is increasing, the food production needs to be doubled to meet the growing requirements. Consequences of global climate change not only reduce the productivity of major staple crops, but also cause destruction of the arable land that can be used for agricultural purposes. The present chapter discusses the effects of population increase and climate change upon food production, which will play a significant role in food security around the globe in near future.

AB Roots and leaves comprise two of the largest microbial habitats on Earth, particularly in tropical forests where root and leaf surface areas are extremely high and microbes are abundant and diverse. Fungal and bacterial endophytes are primarily acquired via contagious spread from the surrounding environment. The soil is an important reservoir for both fungal and bacterial endophytes; we term this a soil microbial bank and suggest that it functions similarly to a soil seed bank. Because most (similar to 75%) studies have found a strong positive relationship between plant diversity and soil microbial diversity, we predict that as plant diversity increases so will endophyte taxonomic and functional diversity. Once inside plant host tissues, endophytes can act as mutualists and increase plant performance directly by producing plant hormones, or indirectly by decreasing fungal or insect damage by up to 80%. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that there are costs associated with hosting "beneficial" endophytes for tropical trees. This is important because it challenges more traditional dichotomies (e.g., beneficial or deleterious) about endophytes and suggests that there are highly complex and context-dependent trade-offs and costs involved in plant-endophyte interactions. Though they comprise a cryptic component of tropical forests, plant-microbe interactions may typically regulate tree diversity, composition, and forest function at neighborhood and even regional scales. For example, pathogens may maintain tree diversity by reducing the fitness of common species in areas where plant host density is high or where hosts are close to reproductive conspecific adults. Moreover, plant-endophyte interactions, whether pathogenic or mutualistic, may comprise an entirely novel dimension of niche differentiation for coexisting tree species. Overall, tree endophytes in tropical forests are complex, yet critical drivers of forest dynamics and function.

AB In this study, the combination of surface reflectance products from Terra-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat-Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensors are explored through the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) algorithm within the framework of forest fire studies over tropical savannah environments. Thus, 60 fusion-derived images were generated from four spectral bands [red, near-infrared, shortwave infrared (SWIR1 and SWIR2)] and six spectral indices [normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, global environment monitoring index, soil-adjusted vegetation index, normalized burn ratio (NBR), and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR)] over two selected study sites. For all fusion processes performed, the actual Landsat images for the corresponding dates are available, which supports validation of the blended images. Additionally, integration of blended spectral indices in the immediate post-fire evaluation and the generation of fire severity were analysed. The blended bands presented correlation and Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values that were consistently higher than 0.819 and root mean square error values of less than 0.027, which confirms good accuracy levels obtained from the model. Similar correlation and SSIM accuracy levels were observed in the blended indices assessment for both study sites, which enables its values to be well-integrated for an analysis of the immediately post-fire date. However, the fire severity mapping from fused images needs to be carefully implemented since the dNBR index is generally less accurate than other blended indices. FSDAF fusion proved to be a useful alternative to retrieving multi-spectral information from savannah environments affected by fires.

AB Ants can display modified behaviors that represent the extended phenotypes of genes expressed by parasites that infect them. In such cases, the modifications benefit the parasite. Alternatively, displayed behaviors can represent host responses to infection that benefit colony fitness. Though some enigmatic examples of behavioral manipulation have been reported, parasitism of ants and its effects on ant behavior and ecology are generally poorly understood. Here, we summarize some of the present-day literature on parasite-ant interactions. Our main focus is on interactions that change host behavior so drastically that infected ants play a seemingly different societal and, perhaps, ecological role. We highlight the parallels that can be found across parasite-ant symbioses that result in manipulated behaviors, such as summiting, phototaxis, substrate biting, and wandering. We also point out the many present knowledge gaps that could be filled by efforts ranging from novel parasite discovery, to more detailed behavioral observations and next-generation sequencing to start uncovering mechanisms.

AB This study analyzes the sustainability of community forest management, representing four forest types of two physiographic region Hills and Terai of Nepal. We assess the sustainability based on species composition, stand density, growing stock volume, and growth-to-removal ratio using inventory data of 109 permanent forest plots from four consecutive intervals of three to five years. In addition, forest users, forest committee members, and forest officials were consulted. We observed increment on the representation of economically valuable tree species in all forest types of both regions. The pole-size tree dominates in all forest types with declining number of trees and regeneration. In case of Hills forests, they were over-harvested until 2013 but were under-harvested in the recent period. In contrary, forests were under-harvested in the Terai. We found that ecological objectives of sustainable management are fully achieved while economic benefits remained unharnessed where harvesting is far below the growth. We conclude that maintaining a large number of trees may contribute to ecological but not on economical sustainability. We argue to rationalize annual harvest in all categories of the forest to enhance resource conditions together with regular benefits to the local communities.

AB Ornithophily is a widespread pollination syndrome that has evolved independently several times along the evolution of plants. It is reported in sixty-five plant families, including Gesneriaceae. One of the most diverse genera within gesneriads is Sinningia, which comprises species pollinated by bees, hummingbirds and bats. However, little is known about the reproduction biology of either species or on pollinator specificity in this genus. Based on investigations on flowering phenology, flower morpho-anatomy, volume and concentration of floral nectar, pollinators, and breeding system, this paper reports the reproduction and the pollinator specificity of Sinningia douglasii and Sinningia araneosa in natural areas in Brazil. Both species offer nectar as a resource and are exclusively pollinated by a single species of hermit hummingbird. Nectar is produced by glands around the ovary. Pollen is deposited between the base of the beak and the head feathers. Both species are self-compatible and pollinator-dependent. In both Sinningia species, the combination of protandry, pollinator specificity, due to long corolla tubes that exclude the visitation of short-billed hummingbirds. The presence of particular flower features influence the occurrence of pollination by specific pollen vectors, such as hermit hummingbirds, in deterrence of illegitimate visitors (i.e. territorial hummingbirds), protection against vigorous foraging, and accurate placement of pollen on legitimate pollinators. In addition, the foraging of Phaethornis on flowers of Sinningia is independent of relative humidity and air temperature, whereas the main factor influencing hummingbird visits is the luminosity.

ID HABITAT FRAGMENTATION
AB This article examines the results of many years of research on the reproductive performance of six species of leguminous plants (FabaceaeLind., 1836) under conditions of urbanization of habitat (Kazan). The range of variability of the main reproductive indices in six species is illustrated: the potential productivity, the actual productivity of the six main types of leguminous plants. The features of variability of seed death at different stages of development are shown depending on habitat conditions. It is established that the main regularities of changes in reproductive parameters depending on habitat conditions are manifested both in native species and in the introduced species Caraganaarborescens Lam., 1785. Based on the results of the study we made conclusion about the advisability of monitoring the reproductive parameters of leguminous plants for indicating the state of the environment in a large city.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the trait-specific response of ground beetles in terms of abundance, species richness, and composition for habitat fragmentation in temperate forests. In addition, we examined how different ecological groups and species of ground beetles responded to environmental variables. During middle May to early November in 2013, ground beetles were sampled using pitfall traps in 27 sites (18 patches and 9 continuous forests) in central Korea. A total of 51 species were identified from 17,845 ground beetles in the 27 study sites. Continuous forests had generally higher abundance and species richness of ground beetles than forest patches. Canonical correspondence analysis for ground beetles was significant, and the proportion of variance explained by environmental variables, such as patch size, elevation, organic matter (C), and soil moisture and pH, was 43.61%. In addition, species composition of ground beetles in continuous forests was grouped distinctively away from those in medium and small-sized patches. In conclusion, both small (1.1-9.6 ha) and medium patches (12.8-51.2 ha) were failed to preserve similar ground beetle biodiversity compared to continuous forests. However, our study revealed that medium-sized forest patches clearly had higher conservation value for forest specialist ground beetles than small-sized forest patches irrespective of forest type.

AB Moist evergreen forests of southwestern Ethiopia host high levels of biodiversity and have a high economic value due to coffee production. Coffee is a native shrub that is harvested under different management systems; its production can have both beneficial and detrimental effects for biodiversity. We investigated how bird community composition and richness, and abundance of different bird groups responded to different intensities of coffee management and the landscape context. We surveyed birds at 66 points in forest habitat with different intensities of coffee management and at different distances from the forest edge. We explored community composition using detrended correspondence analysis in combination with canonical correspondence analysis and indicator species analysis, and used generalized linear mixed models to investigate the responses of different bird groups to coffee management and landscape context. Our results show that (1) despite considerable bird diversity including some endemics, species turnover in the forest was relatively low; (2) total richness and abundance of birds were not affected by management or landscape context; but (3) the richness of forest and dietary specialists increased with higher forest naturalness, and with increasing distance from the edge and amount of forest cover. These findings show that traditional shade coffee management practices can maintain a diverse suite of forest birds. To conserve forest specialists, retaining undisturbed, remote forest is particularly important, but structurally diverse locations near the forest edge can also harbour a high diversity of specialists.

AB Fire management is an important issue in the Brazilian Cerrado, since both anthropogenic high intensity fires and complete fire suppression can reduce the biodiversity in this biome. In this paper, we highlight the trends in scientific literature about fire effects in the Cerrado, aiming to detect possible gaps and to indicate directions of future scientific research. We searched for articles in the periodic database Web of Knowledge from 1991 to 2016, and observed an increase in the number of publications throughout the years. Most articles were associated with Brazilian institutions (58%), followed by those with collaboration between Brazilian and international institutions (33%), and those published by authors exclusively from international institutions (9%). Most articles addressed the effects of fire on biodiversity (77%), followed by articles about abiotic environment (19%), and then biotic interactions or interactions between organisms and environment (4%). The most studied taxonomic group was plants (75%), followed by mammals (8%) and insects (6%), with the remaining taxa comprising about 11% of publications. The Federal District was the federative unit with the greatest number of studies (31%). The majority of studies was conducted in areas with fewer fire events, whereas areas with major incidence of fires are poorly studied. Our data shows that studies on the effect of fires on the Brazilian Cerrado are geographically and taxonomically biased. This lack of knowledge limits the extrapolations about the effects of fire on this biome. Therefore, we emphasize the need for investment in research in areas with high fire frequency and also for an increase in knowledge about these effects on the biota, especially on the fauna. This action is fundamental to support the development of public policies for effective and directed fire management in the Cerrado.

AB This study conducts a biogeographical review of Aniba in Brazil, including its actual and potential distribution, and a review on the species conservation status. The potential distribution of each Aniba species was modeled using the Brazilian Plants and Fungi Biogeography system, which is interconnected with the SpeciesLink network. A consensus model based on up to five algorithms was used to model the potential distribution of each species. The endemism, conservation status and rarity of each species in Brazil were also analyzed. A total of 3059 records of 30 Brazilian Aniba species were found. In total, 16.1% of the records were excluded because of the lack of valid names, and 53.4% were excluded because of the lack of georeference and name of the person who identified the record. The consensus model showed good results for species with 20 or more pixels. The other species had many errors, and their models could only be used to determine new areas for collections. Nine species were endemic to Brazil, and only three species showed no indicator of rarity. The geographical distribution of Brazilian Aniba species shows a predominantly Amazonian pattern. Only four species are not actually found in the Amazon. Some Amazonian species may also be found in Atlantic Forest areas, and many other species have the potential to live there. Our results indicate that only three species have no conservation problems, whereas 14 species have conservation problems, and 13 other species require further population studies to be best evaluated.

AB The Restinga forests are plant formations associated to the Atlantic Forest which still have not been much studied in terms of their mastofauna. The objective of the present work was to list for the first time the mammal species found in a Restinga on northeastern Brazil and show the similarities on species composition to other areas of the same environment and of Atlantic Forest. Our records were based on several complementary approaches: field survey, interviews, and museum collections. Subsequently, we performed similarity analysis between Restinga areas along Brazil and Atlantic Forest areas. We found a total of 30 species of mammals distributed in 28 genera, 16 families and 7 orders for Restinga of Mataraca. Species richness was similar to other Restinga areas and similarity analyzes pointed out that Restingas are more closely related to adjacent Atlantic Forest areas than to other Restingas in the country. This suggests that Restingas do not exhibit an autochthone fauna, but rather a faunal subsample of neighbor Atlantic Forest. Therefore, conservations policies for the Restinga habitat depends not only on actions focused on this habitat, but on initiatives that encompass nearby Atlantic Forest remnants, allowing the connectivity between these habitats.

AB Rafflesia speciosa is a threatened endo-holoparasitic species. It has several populations in the Central Panay Mountain Range (CPMR) of Panay island and a single population on Negros Island. Because R. speciosa is the only Philippine species of the genus that is not endemic to an individual island, it is a suitable species for improving our understanding of the factors underlying the high island endemism of Philippine Rafflesia. For this purpose and to inform the conservation management of R. speciosa, patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation were studied using 15 microsatellite loci and samples from nine populations. None of these populations shows evidence of inbreeding and R. speciosa has similar levels of heterozygosity as generally observed in outcrossing or perennial plant species. The results of AMOVA and Bayesian cluster analyses indicate that the Negros population is genetically differentiated from the CPMR populations. In addition, it has lower genetic diversity than similar-sized R. speciosa populations. These findings suggest that sea straits potentially provide significant reproductive barriers to Rafflesia species, and are perhaps responsible for their high island endemism. The general lack of genetic differentiation among the CPMR populations as suggested by the AMOVA, PCoA, and STRUCTURE results indicates recent gene flow among them and this finding improves our understanding of the geographical scale and context at which gene flow between Rafflesia populations occurs. Conservation efforts should be targeted towards avoiding further habitat degradation in the Negros population. We also recommend protective status for the entire CPMR and reforestation efforts to mitigate the severe habitat fragmentation, destruction, and degradation in this area.

AB Fir forests (Abies religiosa) in central Mexico have been subjected to strong human pressures and their richness and the geographic affinity of their flora in some regions have been poorly analyzed. Through field trips and collections of botanical specimens, the floristic composition and patterns of current geographical distribution of families, genera and species were determined of a fir forest located in the Transmexican Volcanic Belt. We obtained a list of 94 species grouped in 74 genera and 42 families. 67 % of the flora is grouped in 13 families of which Asteraceac family stands out for gather the largest number of species (24.5 %) and genera (22 %). "The floristic similarity between the study area and neighboring forests increases with geographical proximity. 60 % of the families have a widespread distribution, while 50 % of the genera are exclusive of the Americas, distributed mainly from Mexico to Central America. At the species level 95.8 % have American distribution, of which 44.2 % are found only in Mexico and 36.8 % from Mexico to Central America. Among the tree species 61.4 % elements are from Mexico to Central America, while the shrubs and herbs are mainly endemic species to Mexico (60 % and 43.6 % respectively). The high proportion of endemic species in the analyzed fir forest; require continuous monitoring to ensure the generation of new alternatives for its conservation.

AB Herbivory-induced responses in plants can both negatively affect subsequently colonizing herbivores and mitigate the effect of herbivory on the host. However, it is still less known whether plants exhibit specific responses to specialist and generalist herbivores in non-secondary metabolite traits and how specificity to specialists and generalists differs between invasive and native plant populations. We exposed an invasive plant, Alternanthera philoxeroides, to Agasicles hygrophila (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae; specialist), Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae; generalist), manual clipping, or application of exogenous jasmonic acid and examined both the specificity of elicitation in traits of fitness (e.g., aboveground biomass), morphology (e.g., root:shoot ratio), and chemistry (e.g., C/N ratio and lignin), and specificity of effect on the subsequent performance of A.hygrophila and S.litura. Then, we assessed variation of the specificity between invasive and native populations (USA and Argentina, respectively). The results showed S.litura induced higher branching intensity and specific leaf area but lower C/N ratio than A.hygrophila, whereas A.hygrophila induced higher trichome density than S.litura. The negative effect of induction on subsequent larval growth was greater for S.litura than for A.hygrophila. Invasive populations had a weaker response to S.litura than to A.hygrophila in triterpenoid saponins and C/N ratio, while native populations responded similarly to these two herbivores. The specific effect on the two herbivores feeding on induced plants did not vary between invasive and native populations. Overall, we demonstrate specificity of elicitation to specialist and generalist herbivores in non-secondary metabolite traits, and that the generalist is more susceptible to induction than the specialist. Furthermore, chemical responses specific to specialist and generalist herbivores only exist in the invasive populations, consistent with an evolutionary change in specificity in the invasive populations.

AB Many landscapes exist as unstable spatial-temporal mosaics where changes in patterns of biodiversity are affected by nature processes and the dynamic interaction between social and ecological factors. It is a consequence of the natural dynamics of socio-economic systems that regulate man-made tropical forests. However, a significant proportion of studies have made generalizations about the relative values of biodiversity, without taking into account the high levels of internal heterogeneity in the biophysical properties and land uses of each site. The purpose of this study is to propose and validate a methodology to delimit the heterogeneity of the landscape based on criteria that integrate the coupling of human-ecological systems such as: space-time dynamics of deforestation and fragmentation; complexity of the landscape structure; current and historical land use and biophysical variability. For this, the use of satellite images, landscape metrics, field work, documentary review and multivariate analysis were combined. The proposed methodology is intended to help guide the empirical delimitation of landscape heterogeneity as a prerequisite for the selection of similar landscapes and forest patches in studies of the diversity of tree species, in order to provide an opportunity to control the possible difficulties caused by variability in the proportion of forests, landscape configuration and successional states, in estimating its effects on forest richness and floristic composition.

AB The host range of a plant virus is the number of species in which it can reproduce. Most studies of plant virus host range evolution have focused on the genetics of host-pathogen interactions. However, the distribution and abundance of plant viruses and their hosts do not always overlap, and these spatial and temporal discontinuities in plant virus-host interactions can result in various ecological processes that shape host range evolution. Recent work shows that the distributions of pathogenic and resistant genotypes, vectors, and other resources supporting transmission vary widely in the environment, producing both expected and unanticipated patterns. The distributions of all of these factors are influenced further by competitive effects, natural enemies, anthropogenic disturbance, the abiotic environment, and herbivory to mention some. We suggest the need for further development of approaches that (i) explicitly consider resource use and the abiotic and biotic factors that affect the strategies by which viruses exploit resources; and (ii) are sensitive across scales. Host range and habitat specificity will largely determine which phyla are most likely to be new hosts, but predicting which host and when it is likely to be infected is enormously challenging because it is unclear how environmental heterogeneity affects the interactions of viruses and hosts.

AB Soil organic phosphorus has broad agronomic and ecological significance, but remains a neglected topic of research. This opinion paper reflects a collaborative discussion between three generations of scientists who have collectively studied soil organic phosphorus for almost 50 years. We discuss personal reflections on our involvement in the field, opinions about progress and promising opportunities for future research. We debate an apparent overemphasis on analytical methodology at the expense of broader questions, and whether this has stifled progress in recent decades. We reiterate the urgent need to understand organic phosphorus cycling in the environment to address fundamental questions about phosphate supply, crop nutrition, water quality and ecosystem ecology. We also contend that we must encourage and integrate the study of organic phosphorus across all scales, from molecular chemistry to global cycling. Our discussion among three generations of researchers shows the value of a long-term perspective, emphasizes the changing nature of this field of research, and reinforces the importance of continuing to be curious about the dynamics of organic phosphorus in the environment.

AB Understanding the role of the environmental drivers that determine plant population dynamics is essential to promote the conservation of target species and their habitats. Vellozia aff. sincorana is an endemic key species from the rupestrian grasslands (campos rupestres) of the Chapada Diamantina region in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). The branches are important in the local culture and are harvested to light wood stoves. Synchronized flowering is triggered by fire, and no flowers have been recorded in theabsence of a recent fire. We built matrix population models to project the demography of six V. aff. sincorana populations, three that had recently burned and three that had not burned for four years. Based on local harvesting practices and our population models, we assessed the long-term effects of two common harvesting techniques and different fire intervals on this species' demography. Fire is necessary for the long-term persistence of V. aff. sincorana populations; adult survival is the most important vital rate for population persistence and it is mostly unaffected by fire. Recent fires primarily caused increases in reproductive rates, and populations are projected to decrease in size (lambda < 1) under fire intervals longer than 25 years. Harvest effects depend on its frequency and intensity; our models indicated that harvesting maybe sustainable as long as it is low-intensity and fire also occurs periodically. As in many other fire-prone ecosystems, this species benefits from fire occurrence. These results indicate that the 'zero-fire' policy currently in place in the Brazilian savanna is inadequate for the conservation of this, and probably many other, Cerrado species.

AB Despite the importance of tropical forest fragmentation on carbon balance, most of our knowledge comes from few sites in the Amazon and disregard long-term underlying processes related to landscape configuration. Accurate estimation of fragmentation effects should account for additive edge effects and edge age. Here we investigated those effects on C stock and forest structure (density, height, basal area) in fragments (13 to 362 ha) of forest with >= 70 years old, surrounded by pasture, in the Brazilian Atlantic forest region. We measured 5297 stems sampled in four categories replicated in eight fragments: fragment interiors (> 110 m from edges); old (> 50 years) corner edges (< 50 m); old straight edges; and new (ca. 44 years) straight edges. Aboveground biomass was estimated from tree height and diameter at breast height, and converted to carbon. Carbon stock was highly variable between categories, scoring from 10.44 Mg ha(-1) up to 107.59 Mg ha(-1) (average of 41.27 +/- 23 Mg ha(-1)). Contrary to our expectations, interior plots did not have higher carbon stock, basal area or tree stem density than edges, but only taller trees. We found no significant effects of edge age or additive edge effects on carbon stocks. These results suggest that edge effects in the Atlantic rainforest may differ from those observed in more recently fragmented tropical forests, such as the Amazonian forest. We hypothesize that in heavily human-modified landscapes, more extensive edge effects combined with other human disturbances on tree mortality and carbon stock may contribute to overall high levels of degradation, reducing differences between edge and interior habitats. Existing models based on Amazonian forest data may underestimate the true impacts of fragmentation on carbon storage in landscapes with an old history of human disturbance.

AB To establish cultural practice based on a consecutive growth model for potted 1-year-old seedlings of Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.), growth analysis by classical and functional approaches was conducted under different light conditions and air temperatures over 2.5 years, and the active growth of potted seedlings in the greenhouse was investigated. Under the classical approach, the general change patterns of relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were hard to determine because of irregularities including quiescence of vegetative growth. Under the functional approach, plant mass modeled using linear, exponential, power-law, monomolecular, three-parameter logistic, four-parameter logistic (4L), and Gompertz functions showed significant correlations with the observed plant mass. 4L was the best model because it showed the highest r, and the lowest root mean square error and Akaike Information Criterion, so RGR and NAR were estimated by 4L. Analysis of the RGR components showed significant positive correlations between RGR and NAR. Analysis of covariance indicated the NAR costs for increasing RGR were lower in the greenhouse than in open culture; this was explained by differences in specific leaf area (SLA). Therefore, in greenhouse culture, growth was primarily enhanced by NAR as net photosynthesis and underpinned by SLA as a morphological trait improvement for the relatively low light intensity compared with open culture. A multiple regression model for NAR using the pooled data (n = 60) suggested solar radiation had a positive effect (P < 0.0001) and air temperature had a negative effect (P < 0.01) on NAR.

AB To predict the seasonal vegetative growth of potted seedlings of Satsuma mandarin, the effects of initial plant conditions (age, shoot pruning), environment (greenhouse, greenhouse + shading, open-field culture), and pot size on growth were researched for 1.5-2.5 years. The growth pattern was evaluated using a curve fitting with the 4-parameter logistic (4L) model, biomass allocation, and classical (interval) growth analysis, and a generalized linear model analysis based on thermal time (tt). Growth delays from shoot pruning were confirmed by growth trajectories with the 4L model based on tt. Plant growth was positively affected by enlarging the pot size (from 20-L to 45-L), while shading significantly suppressed the growth of 45-L potted Satsuma mandarin seedlings in the greenhouse. In the growth analysis, the relative growth rate was not always determined by the net assimilation rate (NAR), which included both shoot-pruning and pot size effects. To predict the plant mass of Satsuma mandarin seedlings (M-p), we proposed several generalized linear models using a log link function assuming that M-p followed a Gamma-distribution. The best model to predict M-p was selected based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) values, and contained explanatory variables for initial plant biomass, NAR, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf mass ratio (LMR), pot size, and tt. Some simpler models excluding NAR, but including SLA and/or LMR as explanatory variables, were more useful than a model lacking growth analysis parameters (NAR, SLA, and LMR).

AB Mainstream ecological thought is explored in three sections: (i) Epistemological traits. Given the typical scientific development and the necessity of preserving our intellectual heritage, the conservatism outlined in (i) is cyclical, so its stages are graphically summarized. (ii) Methodological benchmarks antithetically derived from (i), in order to get faster advancement consistent with the growing environmental challenges which spur ecological development. (iii) The renaissance of an old paradigm. This section exposes the misunderstanding of the physical concept of equilibrium by the mainstream ecological thought; this explains its current state. Consequently, section (iii) also summarizes the evolution of a recent set of proposals (organic biophysics of ecosystems) that rescues the foundational paradigm of ecosystem ecology based on physics, neglected by the mainstream thought before producing its most valuable results. We highlight that the main problems emerge from the weakness of integration between ecology, physics and epistemology, and spurious links between ecology and neoclassical economics.

AB High soil P concentrations hinder ecological restoration of biological communities typical for nutrient-poor soils. Phosphorus mining, i.e., growing crops with fertilization other than P, might reduce soil P concentrations. However, crop species have different P-uptake rates and can affect subsequent P removal in crop rotation, both of which may also vary with soil P concentration. In a pot experiment with three soil-P-levels (High-P: 125-155 mg P-Olsen/kg; Mid-P: 51-70 mg P-Olsen/kg; Low-P: 6-21 mg P-Olsen/kg), we measured how much P was removed by five crop species (buckwheat, maize, sunflower, flax, and triticale). Total P removal decreased with soil-P-level and depended upon crop identity. Buckwheat and maize removed most P from High-P and Mid-P soils and triticale removed less P than buckwheat, maize, and sunflower at every soil-P-level. The difference in P removal between crops was, however, almost absent in Low-P soils. Absolute and relative P removal with seeds depended upon crop species and, for maize and triticale, also upon soil-P-level. None of the previously grown crop species significantly affected P removal by the follow-up crop (perennial ryegrass). We can conclude that for maximizing P removal, buckwheat or maize could be grown.

AB 1. Along urbanised coastlines, urban infrastructure is increasingly becoming the dominant habitat. These structures are often poor surrogates for natural habitats, and a diversity of eco-engineering approaches have been trialled to enhance their biodiversity, with varying success.
   2. We undertook a quantitative meta-analysis and qualitative review of 109 studies to compare the efficacy of common eco-engineering approaches (e.g. increasing texture, crevices, pits, holes, elevations and habitat-forming taxa) in enhancing the biodiversity of key functional groups of organisms, across a variety of habitat settings and spatial scales.
   3. All interventions, with one exception, increased the abundance or number of species of one or more of the functional groups considered. Nevertheless, the magnitude of effect varied markedly among groups and habitat settings. In the intertidal, interventions that provided moisture and shade had the greatest effect on the richness of sessile and mobile organisms, while water-retaining features had the greatest effect on the richness of fish. In contrast, in the subtidal, small-scale depressions which provide refuge to new recruits from predators and other environmental stressors such as waves, had higher abundances of sessile organisms while elevated structures had higher numbers and abundances of fish. The taxa that responded most positively to eco-engineering in the intertidal were those whose body size most closely matched the dimensions of the resulting intervention.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The efficacy of eco-engineering interventions varies among habitat settings and functional groups. This indicates the importance of developing site-specific approaches that match the target taxa and dominant stressors. Furthermore, because different types of intervention are effective at enhancing different groups of organisms, ideally a range of approaches should be applied-simultaneously to maximise niche diversity.

AB Nutrient supplies to plants from ants are well known from specialised myrmecophytic symbioses and from plants growing in soil close to ant nests. However, above-ground nutrient pathways may play a largely unrecognised role also in less specialised ant-plant interactionsthe numerous facultative relationships, where ants forage on plants. In a laboratory experiment, weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) were confined to the canopies of coffee (Coffea arabica) seedlings, excluding any ant-to-plant transfer of nutrients via the soil strata. When ants were fed N-15-labelled glycine and subsequently deposited faecal droplets on the seedlings, coffee leaves showed increased levels of N-15 and total nitrogen compared to control plants without ants. This was evident for both exposed leaves and leaves covered in plastic bags (i.e. not directly exposed to ants). Thus, nitrogen from ant excretions was absorbed through the coffee leaves, and subsequently, translocated within the plants and possibly leading to the observed higher shoot/root (wet weight) ratios observed on ant-plants compared to controls.Synthesis. These results reveal an undescribed foliar uptake of ant-provided nutrients. If this is a general mechanism, a vast amount of ant-plant interactions involves fertilisation. Foliar fertilisation by ants may be an important steady benefit to plants, which has driven the evolution of ant-plant mutualisms in parallel with the well-recognised but probably more fluctuating benefit from herbivore protection. Given the world-wide abundance of plant canopies foraged by ants, this nutrient pathway may be of high ecological significance.

AB Developing nature-based tourism in private lands calls for new mechanisms to consolidate the interests of the tourism industry, visitors, and landowners. This choice experiment study elaborates on the heterogeneity of visitors' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for enhanced forest amenities and ecosystem services. The survey, targeting domestic and foreign tourists visiting the Ruka-Kuusamo area in Finland, considered four attributes: landscape quality, outdoor routes, forest biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. For observed heterogeneity, the visitors were grouped by their attitudes towards forest management. Unobserved heterogeneity in visitors' choice behaviour and WTP was examined with the latent class model. While most visitors had environmentally friendly attitudes and were willing to pay, especially for enhanced landscape quality and biodiversity, considerable heterogeneity was revealed in terms of three segments with distinctive attitudes, choice behaviour and WTP. The variation in WTP has important implications for the design of a scheme of payments for environmental management.

AB Studies have attempted to disentangle the relationships between urban properties and species richness patterns by studying them within the urban-rural gradient context, the Island Biogeography framework, or the patch matrix approach. We compared and contrasted these frameworks, to highlight their attributes. We assessed the role of patch properties and matrix characteristics, in light of these approaches, to identify the relative roles of different drivers in dictating urban plant species richness patterns.
   Vegetation surveys were conducted in 41 open space patches within the city boundaries of Haifa, Israel. Plants were classified into three categories: rare, native and non-native. Patch properties, distance to nearest neighboring patch, distance to city boundary, within patch heterogeneity and percentage of sealed surface buffering the patch were evaluated in relation to species richness. Non-linear regressions indicated that total, rare and native species richness were best explained by a combination of patch area, sealed surface and patch habitat heterogeneity. Non-native species richness was best explained indirectly by the proportion of sealed surface. No clear cut distinctions between the three frameworks were observed. The results point to the existence of non-linear interactive relationships between the drivers and species richness, which depend on patch and urban matrix properties, particularly on degree of urbanization. We conclude that patch-matrix mechanisms interact with the urban-rural gradient approach to determine plant richness patterns in urban landscapes. Additionally, the degree of urbanization is differentially associated with richness patterns, where rare and native species are negatively associated with it, and non-native species are positively associated with urbanization.

AB The dynamics of ecological communities have been described by neutral and niche theories that are now increasingly integrated into unified models. It is known that a critical transition exists between these two states, but the spatial aspect of this transition has not been studied. Our aim is to study the spatial aspect of the transition and propose early warning signals to detect it. We used a stochastic, spatially explicit model that spans a continuum from neutral to niche communities, and is driven by the intensity of hierarchical competition. The transition is indicated by the emergence of a large patch formed by one species that connects the whole area. The properties of this patch can be used as early warning indicators of a critical transition. If competition intensity increases beyond the critical point, our model shows a sudden decrease of the Shannon diversity index and a gentle decline in species richness. The critical point occurs at a very low value of competitive intensity, with the rate of migration from the metacommunity greatly influencing the position of this critical point. As an example, we apply our new method of early warning indicators to the Barro Colorado Tropical forest, which, as expected, appears to be far from a critical transition. Low values of competitive intensity were also reported by previous studies for different high-diversity real communities, suggesting that these communities are located before the critical point. A small increase of competitive interactions could push them across the transition, however, to a state in which diversity is much lower. Thus this new early warnings indicator could be used to monitor high diversity ecosystems that are still undisturbed.

AB This study presents the setup, calibration, validation and scenario application of the soil and water assessment tool for two contrasting macro-catchments along the Amazon agricultural frontier in the federal states of Para and Mato Grosso, Brazil. Calibration and validation of the model are realised for the periods of the most intensive deforestation and agricultural expansion. In order to give consideration to the rapid, however gradual nature of land use change, the model implements an annual land use update combined with a land use dependent soil parameterization of the upper most soil layer. The comparison of these results with the results of a setup with a steady land use distribution shows distinct improvements of the prediction quality. Discharge prediction improves through the application of gradual land use change in the model by 12 % for a 1.8 % deforestation rate per year and 1.2 % for a deforestation rate of 0.7 % per year. Consequently, the validated models are applied to four land use scenarios for the period 2026-2035. Scenario simulation results show effects on the water balance proportional to land use change. Further, the changes in the water balance follow clear seasonal patterns with highest hydrological effects due to land use change during the rainy season in both catchments. Overall, with continuous deforestation, peak discharge increases. Further, the conversion of native vegetation to pasture has the highest impact on the water balance. For example, monthly discharge in the rainy season increases by up to 24 % for a 13 % conversion of Cerrado savannah into pasture.

AB The paper suggests a minimum set of abiotic and biotic threshold indicators and progress indicators for forest landscape restoration (FLR), then also briefly discusses progress indicators of pressures and project outputs. FLR aims to restore multiple functions of forests at a landscape scale. It is predicated on the hypothesis that restoration produces enabling conditions for ecosystem services, including regulating services such as carbon sequestration and pollination, and provisioning services such as food and energy. As FLR gains greater uptake, it is increasingly important to monitor progress. The types of indicators required are influenced by the degree of forest loss and degradation. To measure the status of land under restoration, one or more abiotic and biotic threshold indicators are required, measuring the return of enabling conditions for restoration (soil quality, water, etc.), along with progress indicators measuring the reemergence of the ecosystem services. Although all elements of the proposed monitoring framework are well known, compiling them into a coherent system, suitable for application in a wide range of conditions, will take much further development.

AB Effective use of soil phosphorus (P) for crop production requires an understanding of how P pools are stabilized and cycled within soil aggregates, rather than assuming that P dynamics, particularly organic P, closely follow those of C. The main goal of this study was to compare C and N cycling with P dynamics in soil aggregate fractions under two distinct crop species, maize (Zea mays) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) in a highly-weathered Lixisol. We found that while C and N follow an open cycle, whereby C and N are mineralized from micro aggregates during macroaggregate turnover and partially exit the soil system as gas and leachate, P has a relatively closed cycle, where most of the mineralized and solubilized P from microaggregates is lost from the plant-available pool via sorption to the unaggregated silt and clay-sized particles (< 53 mu m). While the above postulated P cycling mechanisms were the same for maize and pigeon pea, P loss from microaggregates and subsequent enrichment of the silt and clay particles was significantly higher in soils under maize compared to pigeon pea (320 and 331 mg P kg(-1) lost from occluded microaggregates and gained by free silt and day partides, respectively, compared to 129 and 97 mg P kg(-1) under pigeon pea). This is attributed to the significantly increased soil aggregation under pigeon pea, which led to greater accumulation of P, particularly organic P, in the free microaggregates (77 mg P kg(-1) compared to 29 mg P kg(-1)) and slower rates of macro aggregate turnover. We conclude that increasing soil aggregation can substantially reduce organic P losses from aggregate occluded fractions and its subsequent sorption as inorganic P to silt and day particles. Thus, P cycling can be improved in tropical cropping systems on highly-weathered soils by introducing crop species that enhance the ocdusion of organic P into aggregates.

AB Anuran conservation is paramount, as frogs represent a group of vertebrates that is highly threatened by various anthropogenic and environmental factors. Habitat management decisions must therefore be made considering the interactions between amphibians and their microhabitats. We determined the resting microhabitats of an endemic arboreal male frog, considering biotic and abiotic variables in tropical montane forest fragments and shaded coffee agroecosystems in Central Veracruz, Mexico. In a sampling effort undertaken by 580 person-hours, covering 1100ha, 157 male small-eared treefrogs, Rheohyla miotympanum (Cope, 1863), were recorded resting in 29 plant species. Using coinertia analysis, the resting microhabitats were shown to mainly consist of five herbaceous and shrub species. Post hoc analysis showed that the significant relationship with the resting microhabitats was explained by the importance of the presence of plant species that grow at higher elevations, enabling low frog body temperature, and at a crucial distance of no more than two meters from the nearest water body. We therefore emphasize the importance of conserving coffee agroecosystems and tropical montane forest fragments, which provide resting microhabitats essential to the survival of this endemic frog in Mexico.

AB The success of conservation interventions often depends on the multifaceted and sometimes competing interests and motivations that lead local people to sustainably manage natural resources in the first place. Yet despite an extensive literature exploring the effects of conservation on human livelihoods, there is a lack of robust evidence about which type of conservation intervention works, for whom, and how. This is partly because the social impacts of conservation interventions often affect multiple aspects of human well-being, with changes taking place over long periods during which unintended feedbacks can occur. This paper assesses the medium-term impacts of Protected Areas (PAs) and of three Payment for Environmental Services (PES) projects on three socio-economic indicators across 16 villages in Northern Cambodia. We present a multi-period evaluation including three panel surveys over six years from villages inside and outside PAs to clarify the mechanisms through which social effects of conservation take place and how this translates into the development pathways adopted by households. While livelihood improvements were recorded across all villages, we found that PAs slightly reduce households' socio-economic status, though does not impede their development. PAs also protect traditional livelihoods. Participants in one of the three PES projects recorded higher economic status and agricultural productivity than non-participants, suggesting that there can be important social co-benefits to conservation interventions when programs are well-designed to respond to local contexts.

   OPOSSUM
AB The Atlantic Forest is one of the most disturbed Brazilian biomes, with 183 out of 298 species of mammals occurring in the state of Rio de Janeiro. In this study, we aimed to characterize the diversity, community structure, and habitat use of small mammals in the FIOCRUZ Atlantic Forest Campus (CFMA), including areas of Pedra Branca State Park (PBSP, subunit Pau da Fome), state of Rio de Janeiro. We also compared species diversity and composition between two moments 15 years apart (2001 and 2012-2015) and analyzed the population dynamics of the marsupial Didelphis aurita (Wied-Neuwied, 1826). Small mammal captures were made in different habitats: sylvatic-urban interface areas near human dwellings, disturbed forest, and preserved forest areas. Five marsupial species and four rodent species were captured in both periods. There was a reduction in species richness and beta diversity between the two periods, indicating that disturbances in the environment over the years may have affected the small mammal community structure. The most altered environment showed the greatest species richness and abundance, while the forest areas showed the smallest values, which may be explained by the loss of mammal species, mainly specialist species in forested areas. We identified three groups of species according to habitat preferences: one related to environments with a higher density of vegetation in upper strata-Marmosa paraguayana (Tate, 1931) and Monodelphis americana (Muller, 1776), another related to a higher density in lower forest strata-Akodon cursor (Winge, 1887), and another with no association with the investigated habitat variables-D. aurita and Oligoryzomys nigripes (Olfers, 1818). The small mammal community structure showed a low level of nestedness in both sampling periods. This study is the first report to evaluate the community structure of small mammals in the sylvatic-urban interface area of Pedra Branca State Park, the largest forest reserve within an urban area in Brazil. The surveys indicate that the small mammal diversity was low in both sampling periods and in both areas, and a species loss in the Pau da Fome locality was observed, despite it is a conservation unit. The greater species abundance and richness in the most disturbed areas suggest an increase of factors favoring the occurrence of synanthropic and opportunistic species.

AB Two new Brazilian Protoneurinae damselflies, Forcepsioneura regua sp. nov. (holotype male deposited in DZRJ: Brazil, Rio de Janeiro State, Cachoeiras de Macacu municipality, RPPN Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu) and Forcepsioneura serrabonita sp. nov. (holotype male deposited in DZRJ: Brazil, Bahia State, Camacan municipality, RPPNs Serra Bonita), are described, illustrated and diagnosed based on males and females. The bluish and smaller F. regua sp. nov. has been confused with at least three previously described species, being very similar to the type species of Forcepsioneura, F garrisoni Lencioni, 1999, but lacking a defined tubercle-like process on the posterolateral margin of the median lobe of the prothorax in both sexes, which allows it to be distinguished from all other known species. The shape of the cercus of the male of F serrabonita sp. nov. is similar to that of F. grossiorum Machado, 2001 and F. lucia Machado, 2000, two species with very short ventrobasal process. However, it differs from them mainly by the mediobasal process of the cercus, which is rounded in dorsal view and almost not visible in lateral view. The taxonomic status of Forcepsioneura is discussed and a comparison with the other species of the genus is provided. Based on size, habitat and coloration, Forcepsioneura can be informally divided into two groups: (1) large, orange-black and montane species, including F. grossiorum, F. itatiaiae (Santos, 1970), F. lucia and F. serrabonita sp. nov.; (2) small, bluish and lowland species, including F. garrisoni, F. haerteli Machado, 2001, F. regua sp. nov. and F. sancta (Hagen in Selys, 1860). Our findings highlight the urgency in directing collecting efforts to unexplored areas, as well as the importance of private preserves that harbor the type localities as guardians of the threatened and diverse Atlantic Forest diversity. Together these two localities surveyed account for more than 210 species of odonates, representing almost 24% of the number of Brazilian species. Brazil has the greatest number of known species of odonates in the world. This study shows that further research is required in order to fully understand the diversity of Forcepsioneura.

AB Differences in demographical patterns of the bank vole, Myodes glareolus Schreb. population, a frequent rodent species in the Drava plain region, were analysed through spatial and seasonal changes of survival and capture probability as well as through habitat dependence of abundance. As part of the Croatian-Hungarian interregional programme (DRAVA-INTERECO), small mammal population level monitoring was performed during 2007 applying the capture-mark-recapture method. Trapping sessions were implemented in three forest habitats with different vegetation structure, two sample areas in Lankoci forest, Hungary (protected old forest and reforested habitat) and one sample plot in Repas forest, Croatia (habitat under forestry management) during a period of four months (July-October). The bank vole was an eudominant species in the three investigated habitats. The POPAN formulation of Jolly-Seber models was used to perform the comparative estimates of bank vole population traits. Based on model selection, the first two best candidate models supported our hypothesis that survival and abundance were influenced by forest age and structure. Our results confirmed that the bank vole is an appropriate indicator species to evaluate the population-level responses to the changes of forest structure and management.

AB This article examines the social and environmental costs of living in the mineral age, wherein contemporary global livelihoods depend almost completely on the extraction of mineral resources. Owing to the logic of extractivism-the rapid and widespread removal of resources for exchange in global capitalist markets-both developed and developing countries are inextricably entangled in pursuing resource extraction as a means of sustaining current lifestyles as well as a key mechanism for promoting socioeconomic development. The past 15 years has seen a massive expansion of mineral resource extraction as many developing countries liberalized their mining sectors, allowing foreign capital and mining companies onto the lands of peasant farmers and indigenous people. This mining expansion has also facilitated the rise of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). Transformations in livelihoods and corporate practices as well as the environmental impacts and social conflicts wrought by mining are the central foci of this article.

AB Environmental stress on primate populations can take many forms. Abiotic factors, such as temperature and precipitation, may directly influence the behavior of primates owing to physiological demands of thermoregulation or through indirect influences on vegetation that primates rely on for food. These effects can also scale up to the macro scale, impacting primate distributions and evolution. Primates also encounter stress during interactions within and between species (i.e., biotic interactions). For example, selective pressure from male-perpetrated infanticide can drive the development of female counterstrategies and can impact life-history traits. Predation on primates can modify group size, ranging behavior, and habitat use. Finally, humans have influenced primate populations for millennia. More recently, hunting, habitat disturbance, disease, and climate change have increased in frequency and severity with detrimental impacts on primate populations worldwide. These effects and recent evidence from camera traps emphasize the importance of maintaining protected areas for conserving primate populations.

AB Soil and changes in vegetation may affect ant assemblages, but the relative importance of each in different habitats is not well characterized. In particular, information on the effects of ecological restoration on arthropods is scarce. It was decided, therefore, to study how reforestation may affect an ant assemblage. Ants were sampled in area that had been reforested and adjacent grassland using pitfall traps. Soil surface and vegetation were characterized. The disturbance of the vegetation caused by reforestation resulted in a decrease in the cover of Stipa tenacissima and Cistaceae and an increase in the cover of pine. The mechanical preparation of the site also resulted in changes in the soil surface, with an increase in the cover of stones and rocks. Ant species richness and abundance were greater at the reforested site than in the grassland and more species showed a positive than a negative response to reforestation. The underlying causes of this pattern are mainly related to changes in vegetation and structure of the soil surface and are associated with the increase in the cover of pine, which most probably provided additional food resources, and the greater cover of stones and rocks that provided more shelter for the ant assemblage.

AB Tropical forests are dynamic communities where stochastic and unpredictable events such as climate change affect key ecological processes. The objective of this study was to describe the dynamic behaviour of a semideciduous seasonal forest during 15 years of monitoring, with four sampling intervals, in order to verify if fluctuations in forest dynamics are related to precipitation variations. The work was carried out based on diameter at breast height measured in 25 plots of 400 m(2) each in four forest inventories (2000, 2005, 2009, 2015). To evaluate the direction of forest dynamic changes over time, we performed analyses of mortality rates, recruitment and net changes in number of individuals and rates of loss and gain in basal area. The results suggested that the forest was undergoing a rhythmic cycle characterised by the imbalance in forest dynamics, with rates of mortality and gain in basal area greater than those of recruitment and loss in basal area respectively. However, this natural cycle may be influenced by variation in precipitation, since in the periods characterised as dry, mortality rates increased and there was less increment in basal area.

AB We present the bird diversity of the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico-El Cerrillo campus in Toluca de Lerdo, Mexico State. Bird inventory was realized through transects with point counts inside the campus and surroundings. A total of 141 bird species were recorded, the greatest species richness were terrestrial birds (107), and the rest were species with aquatic and semiaquatic habits (34). Of the total species, four are listed under some risk status in NOM-059-Semarnat-2010. Bird diversity recorded on campus suggests that this area represents an important source of food resources, as nesting area by resident species and well as passage site by migratory species.

AB Overwater structures within coastal estuaries are novel habitats that may facilitate the introduction and spread of non-native fouling organisms, although permitting agencies lack quantitative data to develop mitigation measures. To explore this habitat impact, abundance (percentage cover) and community composition of fouling communities were examined over space and time, using photoquadrats on floating docks. Floating dock pontoons within 12 bays and harbours were sampled throughout southern California to document spatial patterns in non-native species. To evaluate community development on newly available substrate, dock floats within Alamitos Bay were sampled quarterly for 1 year following removal of fouling organisms. Percentage coverage of non-native species was greater than coverage of native or cryptogenic species both underneath and along the sides of structures in outer and inner bay areas of embayments and community composition varied significantly among sampling locations. The percentage cover of non-native species and community composition in cleared floats rapidly converged on those of uncleared control floats, suggesting that seasonal dynamics are a strong driver of non-native species colonisation. Quantification of these dynamics could serve as a starting point in the development of mitigation measures and highlights the importance of evaluating all possible impacts from coastal development projects during the permitting process.

AB Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) from Savannah landscapes is a popular source of vegetable oil for household and industrial consumption. The fruits are usually collected by women and processed into shea kernels and/or handcrafted shea butter for household consumption and sale in national and international markets. The volume of processed shea butter exported from Ghana has almost doubled from under 20,000 metric tons in 2009 to approximately 40,000 metric tons in 2013. The processing methods and technologies used at the microlevel are characterized by high consumption of water, fuelwood, and labor per unit output of crude shea butter. The level of input consumption and the operations performed by local processors have implications for the sustainability of the production process. Based on field interviews with experts and traders as well as on-site input inventory and measurements of consumption levels, this study analyzed the material demands and opportunities for improving production efficiency, marketing, and the livelihoods of the actors in urban and rural areas along the shea supply chain. The analysis goes beyond the shea value chain and applies material flow analysis to a discussion of simple efficiency scenarios for the most resource-consuming stages in the shea processing chain. Practical options for achieving sustainability through reduced material consumption and maintaining the supply capacity of natural capital are also discussed.

AB Most studies of foraging in shell-less gastropods have focused on the ubiquitous generalist sea hares (family Aplysiidae; subfamily Aplysiinae: Aplysia spp., Dolabella spp). Here we studied movement in a specialist sea hare (the seacat, Dolabrifera dolabrifera; subfamily Dolabriferinae). Seacats in each of 7 different tidepools on Isla Naos in the Gulf of Panama emerged precisely when the daytime ebbing tide fell below the height of their pool, returning to their hiding places within 1-3 hours. This short, precise foraging pattern contrasts sharply with long, variable schedule of the generalist sea-hares. Combined with their reduced chemical and behavioral defenses, these observations on seacats raise the possibility that they are avoiding predators during high tides and at night.

AB Saplings of 19 valuable rain forest timber species representative of three successional status groups (early secondary, late secondary and climax) were grown in a polyhouse to examine their responses to three light intensity/quality treatments and nitrogen supply. Solar radiation was modified using painted polyethylene sheet to mimic natural light environments across a rain forest vertical column as follows: 1. Transparent plastic, 80% of full sunlight, R:FR = 0.95, 2. Blue shade, 14% of full sunlight, R: FR = 0.69; 3. Green shade, 7% of full sunlight, R: FR = 0.50. Transparent plastic conditions promoted an increase in stem height and diameter (i.e., growth), leaf thickness and gas exchange per unit leaf area. Additional nitrogen availability enhanced growth and specific leaf area (i.e., leaves were thinner), particularly in the full sun environment and on early secondary and late secondary successional species, but did not influence photosynthetic rate. Successional status of the species did not affect photosynthetic rate although early secondary successional species grew faster and had fewer branches than species of the other successional groups. We recommend that for a successful mixed stand the high-light requiring species should be planted first, with increased nitrogen supply, and the shade tolerant species should be introduced later with no extra nitrogen supply required.

To accomplish this, we employed the unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography to examine migration within the metacommunity, defined as a set of interacting local communities linked by the dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species.Methods: We sampled 12,975 individuals with dbh 1 cm in 26 1-ha permanent plots, including habitats of terra firme, transitional forests, varzea and campinarana, on the upper Madeira River, Brazilian Amazon.Results: Campinarana drew individuals from outside the metacommunity species pool at a mean probability of recruitment of 0.06, a much lower probability than terra firme (0.31), transitional (0.21) and varzea forests (0.22). Environmental variables, such as water table depth, soil texture and fertility, were related to differences in community assembly.Conclusions: Species abundance distribution and diversity patterns of plant assemblages in a large river landscape in the Amazon highlight the importance of environmental heterogeneity that conditions beta-diversity. The high variation in recruitment probabilities from the metacommunity species pool to local communities suggests high habitat variability in the process of maintaining patterns of local diversity.

AB Wetlands have been greatly reduced by agriculture expansion and have become one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world. On the other hand, depopulation and the aging of farmers in developed countries have recently led to an increase in abandoned farmland. These abandoned farmlands, which were originally back marshes, may be succeeded by natural vegetation, and their recovery may contribute to the restoration of habitat for wetland species. In this chapter, we examine whether abandoned farmland provides habitats for wetland species of two focal taxa (ground beetles and birds) and whether the effects of farmland abandonment differ between taxa. We compared the species composition of both taxa between abandoned farmland and wetlands (reference sites for restoration) and assessed the effects of landscape and local factors on species composition. Our results indicated that the species richness and abundance of wetland species of both taxa were similar between abandoned farmland and wetlands. A landscape variable, area of abandoned farmland, affected the species composition of birds only, whereas local environmental factors affected the compositions of both taxa. These observed differences in the responses of the taxa to farmland abandonment could be related to taxon-specific traits such as environmental requirements or dispersal abilities. Our findings suggest that natural recovery of abandoned farmland can provide an opportunity for efficient restoration of wetland species. The natural recovery of wetland vegetation and ground beetle in the abandoned farmland should contribute to an increase of food and breeding habitat of red-crowned crane. Additional information regarding the responses of other taxa to farmland abandonment is needed to implement successful conservation and restoration projects using abandoned farmland.

AB Indonesia's deforestation is a crisis of global proportions. Its causes are highly complex, spanning local social and community dynamics to national political hierarchies and global corporate politics, current and historic. Development plays a key role, with global neo-liberal imperatives leveraged, resisted and competing with myriad multi-level agendas and actors. Gramscian analysis of logics and ideology, which combine to construct a global and local common sense, helps to explain the mixed messages of policy and conservation, which themselves make Indonesian deforestation and its solutions so complicated. Solutions to forest destruction, presented in the form of payment for ecosystem services, multi-stakeholder initiatives, improved governance and transparency within a neo-liberal market framework, have had limited success. The reason for this limited success lies in the notion, encouraged by multilateral and development thinking, that commodification of communities and nature will also conserve forests. Drawing on fieldwork in Indonesia and the United States, this article argues that discrepancies in development and economic policy, which lead to ecologically destructive outcomes like tropical deforestation, cannot be patched up by innovative market tools. Rather, they reflect irreconcilable flaws in contemporary political economy.

DT Article
DE Payment for Ecosystem Services; Choice Experiment; Conditional Logit;
   Random Parameter Logit; Latent Class
AB Forest protection and conservation may provide many non-timber ecosystem services (aesthetics, watersheds, habitat, and carbon sequestration) that provide benefits to humans However, forest conservation may conflict with local landowners or members of the community who prefer to harvest timber or lack alternate income opportunities. Monetary incentives for forests conservation can be established by using payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs. The feasibility of introducing a PES program in Kam Cha i, Thailand was performed using a Choice Experiment survey. Across several econometric models, responses from the survey demonstrate a robust heterogeneity in attitudes towards a PES program. Results from conditional logit, random parameter logit, and latent class estimation models show a large vanation in attitudes towards a PES. This variation in attitudes is further explored by relaxing llA assumptions and introducing dependence across choice responses by including demographic information and other survey response information. Results from this new model demonstrate that frequent forest users are more likely to be unsympathetic to PES programs, regardless of varying levels of income, education, or distance to the forest. Responses suggest that this result is caused by lack of information about PES programs, the lack of credibility with PES programs, and general distrust towards outside agencies. This information may be helpful in constructing and targeting successful PES programs in order to maintain the benefits provided by a healthy forest.

AB Behavioural plasticity is important for survival and to adapt to a dynamic environment. However, it is known that many animals exhibit fixed behavioural responses termed behavioural syndromes. That said, even when exhibiting such fixed behavioural responses, animals still show variability in their behaviour. We here evaluate the variability in exploration behaviour in the frog Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis by quantifying two different metrics of variability: the absolute difference between two sets of measurements, and the individual stability statistic. Our results show differences in the intra-individual variability between groups of frogs that can be assigned to different behavioural syndromes. Marked differences in variability also occur between males and females, with males being more stereotyped in their responses. Frogs identified as belonging to different behavioural groups (i.e. shy, intermediate, and bold) differed in the variability of the expression of these strategies, with bold individuals being more stereotypic in the exploration of an identical, novel environment. These observations may have implications for the evolution of behaviour in natural populations.

AB Mapping ecosystem services (ES) over large scales is important for environmental monitoring but is often prohibitively expensive and difficult. We test a hybrid, low-cost method of mapping ES indicators over large scales in Para State, Brazil. Four ES indicators (vegetation carbon stocks, biodiversity index, soil chemical quality index and rates of water infiltration into soil) were measured in the field and then summarized spatially for regional land-cover classes derived from satellite imagery. The regionally mapped ES values correlated strongly with independent and local measures of ES. For example, regional estimates of the vegetation carbon stocks are strongly correlated with actual measures derived from field samples and validation data (significant anova test - p-value=4.51(e-9)) and differed on average by only 20Mg/ha from the field data. Our spatially-nested approach provides reliable and accurate maps of ES at both local and regional scales. Local maps account for the specificities of an area while regional maps provide an accurate generalization of an ES' state. Such up-scaling methods infuse large-scale ES maps with localized data and enable the estimation of uncertainty of at regional scales. Our approach is first step towards the spatial characterization of ES at large and potentially global scales.

AB African Tropical natural forests have played an important role to the global ecosystem, human survival, and natural diversity for decades. They equally provide a great deal of heritable diversity such as medicinal plants, high quality food and various additional useful products both non timber, and wood timber. The region has been in the lead in production and exportation of hard and quality wood of species for example; African ash, African Teak, African mahogany, Afrormosia, African Cherry, and the Utile.
   Our study is focused on analyzing the trend in forest wood and timber production and export in combination with the trend in deforestation processes in Tropical Africa. A statistical examination of the linkages between tropical timber production, and deforestation.
   Findings demonstrate a linear increasing trend in both production and export of major forestry products, and continuous decrease in the coverage of the natural rain forests. We recommend that interest in nature, technology and development, economics and finance, and legislation for natural forest conservation be taken seriously and as a matter of urgency in the region.

AB The need to complement primary forest protection with the conservation of regenerating tropical forest is becoming increasingly well-understood. However, the persistence of biodiversity differences between areas once subjected to different anthropogenic landuses, after long periods of regeneration, remains poorly understood. We investigate long-term differences in species richness, diversity, relative abundance and community evenness within a regenerating rainforest previously subjected to two different but common types of human disturbance: selective logging and clear-felling for agriculture. Even after a 30 year recovery period, and despite close-proximity to protected primary forest that provided favourable recolonization potential, species richness and diversity of amphibians, butterflies, understorey birds and nocturnal birds were all lower in post-agriculture secondary forest, compared to regenerating selectively logged forest; in contrast, mammals showed no significant difference. Species richness in secondary forest was on average 18 +/- 6.7% lower, and diversity was 13 +/- 7.6% lower than in the selectively logged forest. Community evenness and relative abundances also displayed differences related to historic human disturbance type. However, the measured difference in species richness (18%) between selectively logged and secondary forest was 60% smaller than previous indirect comparisons based on young areas of regenerating forests have suggested. We find that human-induced differences in tropical biodiversity are long lasting but also suggest that even historically highly disturbed regenerating tropical forests could, with appropriate management, provide important opportunities for conserving tropical forest biodiversity.

AB From long-term stratigraphic records in Pacific Island archaeological sites, researchers have documented alterations to molluskan species richness and abundance, decreases or increases in mollusk shell size and, in rare cases, human foraging may have contributed to the extirpation of mollusk taxa. Mollusks perform critical ecosystem functions in tropical intertidal environments, including improving water quality through filtration, regulating algal cover, and increasing habitat and substratum complexity through ecosystem engineering. These critical ecosystem functions can be negatively affected by human foraging, possibly contributing to decreased resilience of coral reefs to climatic alterations. We review modern ecological research on human impacts to mollusks and intertidal ecosystems that illustrates the mechanisms and effects of human foraging. We then examine centuries to millennial scale archaeological records from the Pacific Islands to understand long-term, time-averaged trends in human impacts to intertidal ecosystems.

AB Soil organic phosphorus (P) is an important P source for biota especially in P-limited forests. Organic P has various chemical formations which differ in bioavailability and these organic P can be degraded by phosphatase enzymes. Here, we report soil P fractions inferred from solution P-31-NMR spectroscopy and soil phosphatase activities of two tropical rain forests on contrasting parent materials; sedimentary and ultramafic igneous (serpentinite) rocks. Compared to the sedimentary soils and previous studies, P fractions of the serpentinite soils have distinctly high proportions of pyrophosphate and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate (scyllo-IP6). The accumulation of pyrophosphate and scyllo-IP6 may be related to strong sorptive capacity of iron oxides present in the serpentinite soils, which implies a consequent low P availability in the serpentinite soils. Mean value of soil phosphatase activities was higher in the serpentinite soils than in the sedimentary soils, suggesting that biota in these serpentinite forests depend more on soil organic P as a P source.

AB Capsule: Although survival of nests was similar between forest fragments and continuous forest, the range of predators differed. Artificial nests provide an under-estimate of nest predation by snakes.
   Aims: To estimate the natural nest predation rate in continuous primary forest, compare it with predation rates in forest fragments. To assess the reliability of nest survival rates determined by the use of artificial nests with clay eggs and identify the main nest predators.
   Methods: We observed survival of natural nests during the incubation period in continuous primary forest in Papua New Guinea. Some nests were monitored with infrared cameras. We also used artificial nests deployed with clay eggs to identify predators.
   Results: There was a predation rate of 50% for natural nests and snakes were major predators of nest contents. Clutch daily survival rates (DSRs) differed among nest types. The DSR of artificial nests (0.977) was not significantly different to that of natural cup nests (0.969). Survival rates of artificial nests were similar in forest fragments and continuous forest. Forest fragments had, however, a higher proportion of avian predators than continuous forest.
   Conclusion: Although, we observed similar survival rates in artificial and natural nests, the composition of nest predators was different between natural and artificial nests. Artificial nests were not suitable for estimating the real predation caused by reptiles. Nevertheless, we find that participation of avian nest predators can be estimated correctly with the use of artificial nests.

AB Species' traits have been widely championed as the key to predicting which species are most threatened by habitat loss, yet previous work has failed to detect trends that are consistent enough to guide large-scale conservation and management. Here we explore whether traits and environmental variables predict species sensitivity to habitat loss across two data sets generated by independent avifaunal studies in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, both of which detected a similar assemblage of species, and similar species-specific responses to habitat change, across an overlapping sample of sites. Specifically, we tested whether 25 distributional, climatic, ecological, behavioral, and morphological variables predict sensitivity to habitat loss among 196 bird species, both within and across studies, and when data were analysed as occurrence or abundance. We found that four to nine variables showed high explanatory power within a single study or data set, but none performed as strong predictors across all data sets. Our results demonstrate that the use of species traits to predict sensitivity to anthropogenic habitat loss can produce predictions that are species- and site-specific and not scalable to whole regions or biomes, and thus should be used with caution.

AB Forest ecosystems can modify the atmospheric CO2 through biomass accumulation mostly in tree stems with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 10 cm. Aboveground biomass increment (Delta AGB), and changes in stand AGB, no. stems and basal area (BA) were calculated from mortality, recruitment, and growth data of tree stems in tropical evergreen broadleaved forest, Central Highland Vietnam. Data were derived from ten 1-ha permanent plots established in 2004, where all stems with DBH >= 10 cm were tagged, identified to species, and measured for DBH in 2004 and 2012. In an 8-year duration, the increment was 53 +/- 10 stems ha(-1), 7.8 +/- 0.3 m(2) ha(-1) for BA and 86.0 +/- 4.6 Mg ha(-1) for AGB. The stem mortality rate was 0.9% year(-1) and the stem recruitment rate was 2.2% year(-1). Annual Delta AGB was 10.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), equaling to 5.4 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Of which, tree stems of 35-80 cm DBH classes accounted for 65%. The results indicated that the forest is in stage of carbon sequestration. Any disturbances causing death of 35-80 cm DBH tree stems will much reduce carbon sequestration capacity and it will take a long time for AGB to return to pre-disturbance stage.

AB The intense harvesting of inflorescences prior to seed setting and the persistent use of fire to boost flowering are considered to be the main factors driving starflower species to extinction along the Espinhac omountain range, in eastern Brazil. In this study we experimentally reproduced these traditional management practices upon a natural population of the starflower Comanthera elegantula (Ruhland) L.R. Parra & Giul. (Eriocaulacece) using eight distinct treatments consisting of 'fire', "harvest" and the combined absence of these interventions over two years, in order to assess their effects on seedling recruitment. The study was conducted at the central Espinhaco range region, in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Our results show that the extractive management practices interfere with the recruitment dynamics of C. elegantula, with fire significantly reducing the competing herbaceous cover and stimulating seedling recruitment. An intermittent fire regime seem to favor seedling establishment and growth, while sequential fire episodes seem to negatively impact the progression of seedling cohorts and the regrowth of the herbaceous cover. Additional seed input took place at local scale, probably through dispersion from outer sources and/or from seed banks. Seed pool depletion isto be expected under a persistent and efficient inflorescence collection regime and may ultimately contribute to population senescence. (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Epiphytic bromeliads represent a major component of Neotropical forests, but the potential effect of climate change on these plants is unclear. We investigated whether and how bromeliads are affected by the predicted 3 degrees C temperature rise by the end of the century.
   We conducted growth experiments with 17 epiphytic bromeliad species at different temperatures to determine their fundamental thermal niches. By comparing those with niches for germination, we tested whether ontogenetic niche shift or niche contraction occurs in Bromeliaceae. Applying a classical growth analysis, we assessed the relative importance of the underlying growth components on interspecific variations in growth.
   Members of two bromeliad subfamilies differed in their response to elevated temperatures: Tillandsioideae may be negatively affected, whereas Bromelioideae moved closer to their thermal optimum. Across different ontogenetic stages, thermal niche characteristics revealed both niche shift and niche contraction. Interspecific variation in growth was driven almost exclusively by net assimilation rate at all temperatures.
   We conclude that the vulnerability of tropical plants to a future increase in temperature may be more variable than suggested by previous studies. We emphasize the importance of assessing niche breadth over multiple life stages and the need for better microclimatic data to link laboratory data with field conditions.

AB Past climate changes provide important clues for advancement of studies on current global change biology. We have tested large-scale biogeographic patterns through four marine groups from twelve Atlantic Ocean archipelagos and searched for patterns between species richness/endemism and littoral area, age, isolation, latitude and mean annual sea-surface temperatures. Species richness is strongly correlated with littoral area. Two reinforcing effects take place during glacial episodes: i) species richness is expected to decrease (in comparison with interglacial periods) due to the local disappearance of sandy/muddy-associated species; ii) because littoral area is minimal during glacial episodes, area per se induces a decrease on species richness (by extirpation/extinction of marine species) as well as affecting speciation rates. Maximum speciation rates are expected to occur during the interglacial periods, whereas immigration rates are expected to be higher at the LGM. Finally, sea-level changes are a paramount factor influencing marine biodiversity of animals and plants living on oceanic islands.

AB We present the microscopic analysis of growth-ring boundary anatomy of 27 tree species from a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh and evaluate their dendrochronological potential. We observed high inter-species variability in the anatomical features that define growth-ring boundaries. Marginal parenchyma, fibre zones, and thick-walled latewood fibres were identified as the dominant anatomical features delineating growth-ring boundaries. The evaluation of growth-ring boundary distinctness in thin-sections and scanned images revealed that 25 out of 27 studied species (93%) showed distinct to fairly distinct growth-ring boundaries. Cluster analysis of wood anatomical features was used to select an additional 5 species for further investigation. Ring-width series of these species crossdated well within the same tree. Between trees crossdating was also successful in all 5 species. The Gleichlaufigkeit (GLK; i.e. the proportion of agreement/disagreement of inter-annual growth tendencies among the trees) varied among species between 0.55 and 0.71. A strong synchronization of tree-ring series between trees suggests that growth rings are annual and influenced by common environmental factors. The derived tree-ring series, estimated tree ages, and growth trajectories underline the high potential of our study area for answering a variety of climatological, ecological and archaeological questions by applying den-drochronology. This study will therefore provide a new endeavor in tropical dendrochronology of South Asian moist tropical forests.

   KNOWLEDGE
AB Ants are a very diverse taxonomic group. They display remarkable social organization that has enabled them to be ubiquitous throughout the world. They make up approximately 10% of the world's animal biomass. Ants provide ecosystem services in agrosystems by playing a major role in plant pollination, soil bioturbation, bioindication, and the regulation of crop-damaging insects. Over recent decades, there have been numerous studies in ant ecology and the focus on tree cropping systems has given added importance to ant ecology knowledge. The only missing point in this knowledge is the reasons underlying difference between the positive and negative effects of ants in tree cropping systems. This review article provides an overview of knowledge of the roles played by ants in orchards as functional elements, and on the potential of Oecophylla weaver ants as biological control agents. It also shows the potential and relevance of using ants as an agro-ecological diagnosis tool in orchards. Lastly, it demonstrates the potential elements which may determine the divergent negative and positive of their effects on cropping systems.

AB Bats are responsible for many ecological services, such as seed dispersal of several plant species, contributing to the processes of succession and forest regeneration. A factor that can interfere with this process is the animal digestion, which can affect germination, altering the patterns of seedling distribution. The effects of seed passage through bats' guts varies with the species, leading to some discrepancies in the literature. In this study, we tested the digestion time of one Phyllostomidae bat species, Sturnira lilium, in two Neotropical plants: Solanum paniculatum and Ficus organensis, and the effects on seed germination. The experiment was conducted in captivity and the germination tests were made in laboratory conditions. The results suggested that most seeds ingested by S. lilium are dispersed within 40min for both species and the digestion seems not to significantly affect the germination of F. organensis, despite the slight acceleration of germination. In S. paniculatum, germination occurred only in the control (39%), whereas in the treatments, all the seeds remained dormant during the 25 experimental days. In this case, the digestion of S. lilium possibly contributes to the formation of seed banks, randomizing the temporal distribution of seedlings.

TI The co-evolution of herbivore impact: field estimates of impact in older

AB Background: Novel associations of specialist insect herbivores with host plants are frequently assembled. If herbivore and host co-evolve following their first interactions, we would expect increases over evolutionary time in plant tolerance to attack, and usually decreases over time in insect virulence (because most insect herbivores depend for resources on continued survival of their hosts). The result should be a pattern of decreased herbivore impact through time. This is the 'evolution-of-impact hypothesis'.
   Organism: Two specialist gallmakers of the goldenrods Solidago altissima L. and S. gigantea Ait.: Rhopalomyia solidaginis/capitata (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), and Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae).
   Site of experiments: Tallgrass prairie at two sites in Iowa, USA.
   Predictions: For both gallmakers, S. gigantea is the novel host and S. altissima the older one. We therefore predict a higher impact of both gallmakers on S. gigantea than S. altissima. However, we predict a similar impact on each species of mechanical damage, with which both hosts have long evolutionary experience.
   Methods: We measured the aboveground biomass of galled and ungalled ramets from the field to assess herbivore impact by each gallmaker on each species. We used stem width-biomass relationships for ungalled ramets, applied to stem widths of galled ramets, to estimate the potential biomass of galled ramets in the absence of attack. We calculated impact as potential minus actual biomass. We also re-analysed similar data for a third gallmaker of the same hosts, Gnorimoschema gallaesolidaginis (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) from Heard and Kitts (2012). We assessed impacts of mechanical damage with field and greenhouse experiments of clipping and defoliation damage imposed on ramets of each species.
   Results: All three gallmakers had a higher impact on the novel host (S. gigantea) and, combined across all datasets, the pattern of higher impact on the novel host was highly significant. Impacts of mechanical damage did not differ between host species.
   Conclusions: Patterns in impacts of goldenrod gallmakers on their hosts are consistent with the evolution-of-impact hypothesis.

AB Structural complexity and local biodiversity of species-rich tropical forests can be characterized by their spatial patterns, which contribute to species intra- and interspecific interactions. Aiming to describe spatial patterns of species at fine spatial scales, we applied the quantitative analyses based on the relationships of nearest neighbors of conspecific and heterospecific trees. In a two-hectare plot of a tropical broadleaved forest stand in central Vietnam with minimal human influence, all tree individuals with diameter at breast height 2.5 cm were mapped and their characteristics were recorded. We applied two different types of analyses: (1) Intraspecific structural characteristics using nearest neighbor statistics; (2) overall interspecific associations through a classification scheme based on bivariate nearest neighbor distribution function D-12(r) and Ripley's K function K-12(r). The findings showed that: (1) Most of studied species in the forest were highly mixed with other species, while conspecifics were regular to aggregated distribution at small spatial scales. Tree individuals with different diameter values were surrounded by heterospecific trees; (2) The majority of 306 species-species pairs showed spatial independence (66.7%), whereas 29.8% of all species showed an overall positive association and negative association consisted only a small percentage (3.5%) up to spatial scales of 50 m. We found significant evidences of the main ecological theories such as dispersal limitation, Neutral theory, Janzen-Connell hypothesis, and other effects like the stochastic dilution. We suggest using both the bivariate distribution of the structural parameters and the spatial point pattern analysis based on nearest neighbor distance as advantageous approaches for further understanding of population structure, as well as discovering and protecting biodiversity in the future.

AB The contributions of green infrastructure (GI) to human well-being have been widely recognised; however, pathways for its systematic implementation are missing. Local governments can play a crucial role in the conservation of GI, and a formal recognition of this role in budgeting systems would foster the inclusion of GI in their agenda. The aim of this study is to identify the principal components of GI at the local level to form a basis for a compensatory economic scheme. We identified the principal components of GI based on the mapping of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision. Furthermore, we analysed the potentiality of an incentive mechanism to promote GI based on the protection status of GI. Finally, an incentive mechanism to promote GI at the municipality level was proposed. The results showed that the GI of Biscay is mainly composed of the natural forests presented in the area, and that 50% of the principal components of the GI are not protected. Furthermore, one third of the protected principal components of the GI only has protection at the municipality level. So, we propose a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES)-like scheme at the municipality level based on the cover of natural forests, where the objective is the conservation and promotion of the GI.

AB Hummingbirds are important pollinators of many native Neotropical plants but their abundance and diversity in landscapes dominated by intensive human uses such as agriculture have rarely been examined, despite such land-uses prevailing in the tropics. We examined how tropical deforestation affects hummingbird community structure in premontane forest patches embedded in a tropical countryside of Coto Brus Canton, Costa Rica. We captured hummingbirds in fourteen landscapes representing a gradient in patch size and forest amount, and tested for the effects of these variables on (1) hummingbird captures at flowers (pollinator availability); (2) species richness; and (3) filtering of functional traits. After accounting for sampling effects, both hummingbird availability and species richness declined by 40% and 50%, respectively, across the gradient in deforestation that we observed (9-66% forest within 1000m). Focal patch size was the strongest predictor, even after statistically accounting for the amount of forest and matrix composition of landscapes. These reductions in availability and richness were well predicted by functional traits; morphologically specialized species with the capacity to transport long-distance outcrossed pollen and low functional redundancy within the pollinator network showed the greatest sensitivity to landscape change. We hypothesize that declines in hummingbird availability, diversity, and functional traits are important mechanisms driving the observed pollen limitation of ornithophilous flowers in fragmented tropical landscapes. Efforts to conserve large forest patches and enhance matrix permeability are critical for maintaining forest hummingbird communities and pollination services under current and predicted deforestation regimes.

AB Over 80% of Atlantic Forest remnants are <50ha and protected areas are embedded in a matrix dominated by human activities, undermining the long-term persistence of carnivores. The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is an opportunistic species, but little is known about its tolerance to habitat alterations and the influence of other species on its occupancy in Atlantic Forest remnants. We used camera traps to assess ocelot occupancy in protected areas of Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. We found a positive correlation between the occupancy of ocelots and top predators (jaguars, Panthera onca, and pumas, Puma concolor), and a weaker negative effect between the number of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) detected and ocelot occupancy. Ocelot detection was higher at sites with more eucalyptus, suggesting that ocelots frequently use these areas. Better-protected areas surrounded by permeable matrices may be critical to the persistence of ocelots in the fragmented Atlantic Forest.

AB Plants that are consumed by herbivores incur a reduction in fitness. Therefore, plants need to prepare to defend against and/or avoid herbivory using resistance' and/or tolerance' systems. Phengaris teleius is a specialist herbivore of Sanguisorba tenuifolia. Phengaris teleius lays eggs in the flower buds of S. tenuifolia and the larvae of P. teleius feed on the ovaries and ovules of S. tenuifolia. In order to clarify the extent of herbivory damage by P. teleius and effect on reproduction in S. tenuifolia, we conducted field observations and artificial cutting experiments carried out in the natural habitat where both P. teleius and S. tenuifolia live sympatrically. Phengaris teleius often lays one egg per spike, and about half of the total eggs were laid on the spike that developed at the shoot apex and was largest in size. The fruits were damaged most heavily in the spike in which an egg was laid. However, the number of fruits was almost the same between individuals with no damage and individuals with a feeding damage rate of 40% or less. This showed that compensation would be achieved by increasing the number of fruits in other spikes without damage. On the other hand, because no compensation was detected in the cutting experiments, it was considered that compensation may be induced by biological stimuli produced by P. teleius. These responses may be one of the mechanisms for continuing the interspecific relationship between S. tenuifolia (host plant) and P. teleius (herbivore insect).

AB The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography has gained the status of a quantitative null model for explaining patterns in ecological (meta)communities. The theory assumes that individuals of trophically similar species are functionally equivalent. We empirically evaluate the relative contribution of neutral and deterministic processes in shaping fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in three tropical forests in Africa, using both direct (confronting the neutral model with species abundance data) and indirect approaches (testing the predictions of neutral theory using data other than species abundance distributions). Abundance data were obtained by sampling butterflies using banana baited traps set at the forest canopy and understorey strata. Our results indicate a clear consistency in the kind of species or species groups observed at either the canopy or understorey in the three studied communities. Furthermore, we found significant correlation between some flight-related morphological traits and species abundance at the forest canopy, but not at the understorey. Neutral theory's contribution to explaining our data lies largely in identifying dispersal limitation as a key process regulating fruit-feeding butterfly community structure. Our study illustrates that using species abundance data alone in evaluating neutral theory can be informative, but is insufficient. Species-level information such as habitat preference, host plants, geographical distribution, and phylogeny is essential in elucidating the processes that regulate biodiversity community structures and patterns.

Nonetheless, their effectiveness and additionality in preventing deforestation and degradation remain contested. The design of PFC contracts can influence landowner participation and in-turn a program's prospects for additionality. We examined preferences for select PFC contractual attributes among over 200 private forest owners in Ecuador's Amazon basin using a discrete choice experiment. Forest owners at high-risk of deforestation, as compared to others of lower risk, were almost eight-times more likely to select contracts that allowed timber harvest under a management plan, about three-times more likely to select contracts managed by local municipalities or international NGOs, and showed stronger preferences for long-term contracts. To increase enrollment of forest lands at higher risk of deforestation and degradation PFC contracts might need to reconsider the benefits of increasing financial incentives, pursue administration through local municipalities or international NGOs, allow sustainable timber harvesting, and seek permanent agreements.

AB Forest conversion in the tropics is increasingly driven by global demand for agricultural forest-risk commodities such as soy, beef, palm oil and timber. In order to be effective, future forest conservation policies should include measures targeting both producers (the supply side) and consumers (the demand side) to address commodity driven deforestation. Whereas the UN Conventions on Biodiversity (CBD) and Climate Change (UNFCCC) do not make reference to this driving factor, here we explore whether and how recent national strategies by member states to the Conventions acknowledge the role of agricultural commodities in tropical deforestation. A text analysis of 139 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to climate change mitigation and 132 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) shows that the general trade-off between national development aspirations and forest conservation is commonly acknowledged. However, only few strategies link deforestation to commodity production and consumption, whereas most documents do not mention this topic. This lack of reference to a key driver of tropical deforestation limits the prospects of safeguarding tropical forests for biodiversity and climate change mitigation purposes as part of the two UN Conventions, and might jeopardise their overall effectiveness.
   These findings were complemented by a content analysis of INDCs, NBSAPs and REDD + documents from eight case countries affected by commodity-driven deforestation. We investigated whether this driver is acknowledged in the national strategies, and which policy measures are suggested to address forest loss from agricultural commodities. We found that six case countries mention agricultural commodities as deforestation driver in their REDD + documents, whereas the biodiversity and climate change strategies were silent on the topic. Policy measures targeting commodity production were suggested in four REDD + strategies, ranging from incentive payments, sustainable agricultural practices and land-use planning to demand-side approaches such as certification and the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.
   One conclusion from this exercise is that UN member states seem not to consider climate and biodiversity national plans the adequate forum to discuss detailed forest conservation approaches. We argue that in order to increase effectiveness, strategies under the UN Conventions should take commodity-driven deforestation into account, through measures that address both the producer and the consumer side.

AB In this study, effects of temperature, light and their interactions on allelopathic effects and the functional traits specific leaf area (SLA) and stem mass fraction (SMF) of different allelopathic potential rice accessions at different growth stages were analyzed. The main results were as follows: Allelopathic responses to temperature and light varied with different allelopathic potential rice accessions at different growth stages. With the rise of temperature and the extension of photoperiod, allelopathic effect increased firstly and then decreased at 2-3 leaf stage, but increased constantly at the 4-5 and 7-8 leaf stages in strong allelopathic rice accessions [O. longistaminata, F-1 (O. longistaminata x RD23), F-2 (RL159 and RL169)]. Temperature had significant impact on allelopathic effect without considering light factors, but light showed little effect on rice allelopathy at the same temperature conditions. The greatest allelopathic effect was attained with moderate temperature and long photoperiod at 2-3 leaf stage in strong allelopathic rice accessions, but all the rice accessions showed weak allelopathic effects at the low temperature condition (15 degrees C/10 degrees C), and the influence of different factors on allelopathy followed a general trend as temperature > leaf stage > light, indicating that among the multiple factors impacting rice allelopathy, temperature was the main factor. Allelopathic characteristics of F-1 and F-2 to various temperature and light were similar to O. longistaminata, showing that allelopathic genes from wild rice can be expressed in its descendants. Temperature and light also had significant effects on SLA and SMF, and rice allelopathy was closely correlative to SLA in strong allelopathic rice accessions at the 4-5 and 7-8 leaf stages, but there was no correlation between rice allelopathy and SMF at different growth stages. These results suggested that rice adjust the relationship between allelopathy and SLA and adapt to the varied environments, and that high temperature and long photoperiod can enhance rice allelopathic activity.

AB Soil fungi are key mediators of negative density-dependent mortality in seeds and seedlings, and the ability to withstand pathogens in the shaded understory of closed-canopy forests could reinforce light gradient partitioning by tree species. For four species of tropical rainforest trees-two shade-tolerant and two shade-intolerant-we conducted a field experiment to examine the interactive effects of fungal pathogens, light, and seed density on germination and early seedling establishment. In a fully factorial design, seeds were sown into 1 m(2) plots containing soil collected from underneath conspecific adult trees, with plots assigned to forest edge (high light) or shaded understory, high or low density, and fungicide or no fungicide application. We monitored total seed germination and final seedling survival over 15 weeks. Shade-intolerant species were strongly constrained by light; their seedlings survived only at the edge. Fungicide application significantly improved seedling emergence and/or survival for three of the four focal species. There were no significant interactions between fungicide and seed density, suggesting that pathogen spread with increased aggregation of seeds and seedlings did not contribute to pathogen-mediated mortality. Two species experienced significant edge-fungicide interactions, but fungicide effects in edge vs. interior forest varied with species and recruitment stage. Our results suggest that changes to plant-pathogen interactions could affect plant recruitment in human-impacted forests subject to fragmentation and edge-effects.

AB Metacommunity matrices contain data on species incidence or abundance across sites, compactly portraying community composition and how it varies over sites. We constructed models based on an initial metacommunity matrix of either species incidence or abundance to test whether such data suffice to predict subsequent changes in incidence or abundance at each site. The models reflect both species and site mass effects in using products of the row and column totals to predict the incidence or abundance of each species expected at each site. We tested these models against empirical data on vascular plant incidence and abundance collected from two sets of forested sites in both the 1950s and 2000s. Predictions from these models parallel observed changes in species incidence and abundance in these distinctly different metacommunities and differ greatly from null model predictions. The abundance model shows greater power than the incidence model reflecting its higher information content. Predictions were more accurate for the more diverse forests of southern Wisconsin that are changing quickly in response to succession and fragmentation. Simulations show that these results are robust but sensitive to sampling intensity. Because these models require no data on site conditions or species' characteristics, they provide a useful baseline to assess more complex models based on species' functional traits, local site conditions, or landscape context. They may also prove useful to conservation biologists seeking to predict local population declines and extinction risks.

AB The State of Mato Grosso in Brazil has undergone intensive land use changes over the past decades. Native ecosystems have been converted into agrosystems for the production of cash crops and cattle. The Brazilian Forest Code advocates full protection of specifically sensitive habitats, and it also safeguards a fixed percentage of native vegetation known as "Legal Reserves" (LRs) inside private rural properties. As part of Brazilian Legal Amazonia region, in Mato Grosso, these percentages account for 35 % of savannas and 80 % of forests found inside each rural property. Here we analyze at the scale of the three biomes: Cerrado, Amazonia and Pantanal, the changes in native vegetation cover (NVC) from 1992 to 2007 and the representativeness of NVC types within the LRs, as well as the role of LRs for general landscape configuration and conservation. In Mato Grosso, 90 % of all studied NVC types are represented inside LR patches. Legal Reserves also accounted for 37 % of the total protected areas and for 37.8 % of all remnant NVCs found in Mato Grosso in 2007. The importance of LRs for landscape structure varied greatly according to biome, but it is noteworthy that LRs were generally missing in highly deforested zones. The relative small size of LRs in all biomes (55 to 64 % of them are <= 12 ha) makes them specifically vulnerable to further changes in land use. Considering the current tendency of ongoing fragmentation, the importance of LRs for landscape connectivity should be increased, specifically by improving the network of corridors between these remnant native vegetation areas.

AB The emergent properties of the collection of species in a natural community, such as diversity and the distribution of relative abundances, are influenced by both niche-based and neutral (stochastic) processes. This pluralistic view of the natural world reconciles theory with empirical observations better than does either a strictly niche- or neutrality-based perspective. Even so, rules (or rules of thumb) that govern the relative contributions that niche-based and stochastic processes make as communities assemble remain only vaguely formulated and incompletely tested. For example, the translation of non-random (non-neutral) ecological processes, which differentially sort among species within a community, into species-compositional patterns may occur more influentially within some demographic subsets of organisms than within others. In other words, the relative contributions of niche vs. neutral processes may vary among age-, size-, or stage-classes. For example, non-random patterns of mortality that occur among seedlings in a rain forest, or among newly settled juveniles in communities of sessile marine communities, could be more influential than non-random mortality during later stages in determining overall community diversity. We propose two alternative, mutually compatible, hypotheses to account for different levels of influence from mortality among life-cycle stages toward producing non-random patterns in organismal communities. The Turnover Model simply posits that those demographic classes characterized by faster rates of turnover contribute greater influence in the short-term as sufficient mortality gives rise to non-random changes to the community, as well as over the longer-term as multiple individuals of a given fast-turnover demographic class transition into later classes compared to each individual that ratchets from a slow-turnover starting class into a later class. The Turnover Model should apply to most communities of organisms. The Niche Model, which posits that niche-based processes are more influential in some demographic classes relative to others, may alternatively or additionally apply to communities. We also propose several alternative mechanisms, especially relevant to forest trees, that could cause dynamics consistent with the Niche Model. These mechanisms depend on differences among demographic classes in the extent of demographic variation that individual organisms experience through their trait values or neighborhood conditions.

AB Phosphorus (P) is an essential but limited nutrient in highly weathered subtropical or tropical forest soils; however, increased P demands owing to elevated nitrogen (N) deposition might further exacerbate the P limitation in these regions. How soil P fractions respond to N enrichment and the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood completely. To address this issue, we conducted an experiment with 3 years of N addition to a Castanopsis carlesii natural forest in Fujian, China; the soil P fractions, microbial biomass, enzyme activities, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) levels were determined. We found that N addition did not significantly alter the microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN), but significantly decreased microbial biomass P (MBP); further, the ratios of MBC:MBP and MBN:MBP increased significantly after N application, indicating that N enrichment enhanced the P demands of plants and soil microorganisms. Moreover, neither resin-P nor NaHCO3-P (extracted by resin and NaHCO3, respectively) was decreased, whereas organic P extracted by NaOH (NaOH-Po) was decreased after N addition, implying that NaOH-Po is a potentially significant source of available P. In particular, appositive correlation between abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi and NaOH-Po and significant relationships between acid phosphomonoesterase activity (ACP) and labile P contents were noted, suggesting that ectomycorrhizal fungi can play a major role in the depletion of soil organic P, and these enzyme activities can mobilize the unavailable P to labile P in the investigated forest. Taken together, our results revealed a novel mechanism for the maintenance of soil labile P in a subtropical natural forest under chronic stress of N deposition.

AB Aim: Stacked species distribution models (SDMs) are an important step towards estimating species richness, but frequently overpredict this metric and therefore erroneously predict which species comprise a given community. We test the idea that developing hypotheses about accessible area a priori can greatly improve model performance. By integrating dispersal ability via accessible area into SDM creation, we address an often-overlooked facet of ecological niche modelling.
   Innovation: By limiting the training and transference areas to theoretically accessible areas, we are creating more accurate SDMs on the basis of a taxon's explorable environments. This limitation of space and environment is a more accurate reflection of a taxon's true dispersal properties and more accurately reflects the geographical and environmental space to which a taxon is exposed. Here, we compare the predictive performance of stacked SDMs derived from spatially constrained and unconstrained training areas.
   Main conclusions: Restricting a species' training and transference areas to a theoretically accessible area greatly improves model performance. Stacked SDMs drawn from spatially restricted training areas predicted species richness and community composition more accurately than non-restricted stacked SDMs. These accessible area-based restrictions mimic true dispersal barriers to species and limit training areas to the suite of environments to those which a species is exposed to in nature. Furthermore, these restrictions serve to 'clip' predictions in geographical space, thus removing overpredictions in adjacent geographical regions where the species is known to be absent.

AB Cloud forests and savannas differ in several environmental aspects, particularly in light irradiance and water availability. Such differences can be selective for specific sets of leaves and architectural strategies to capture light and use water. In the present study we evaluated functional traits variation in a generalist species in two adjacent habitats experiencing an abrupt change in resource availability (light and water availability). We collected several leaf, stem and architectural traits of the tree species Eremanthus erythropappus (DC.) MacLeish in shrubland savanna (habitat facing higher drought stress and wind exposure) and cloud forest (shaded environment). Trees in the shrubland savanna exhibited functional trait values that enhance drought tolerance (i.e. higher wood density and leaf thickness) whereas trees in the cloud forest exhibited functional trait values that enhance light capture (i.e. taller individuals with higher leaf area and specific leaf area). Additionally, the individuals in the shrubland savanna had wider and deeper crowns, pointing that the benefits of a larger canopy area to capture light during the day and humidity from condensation at night exceed the higher risk of mechanical damage by falling debris due to high wind exposure. For all traits, variation among the individuals was lower than variation among habitats. Our results indicate the strong role of the environment as a driver of intraspecific variation and that architectural traits (usually poorly studied compared with other traits) should be included as an important parameter of variation in functional analyses when evaluating the effect of environmental conditions on tree performance.

AB A large area previously dominated by native ecosystems in South America is now covered by monocultures of non-native tree species, mainly of the genus Pinus. Currently, pine plantations and the invasions that have been generated from these are causing a homogenization process at the landscape, stand, and even micro--site scales. The continuous and extensive areas covered by pine plantations have replaced the native ecosystem heterogeneity in many landscapes of South America. Within these plantations, the diversity of plants and animals is lower than that of the nearest remnant native ecosystems. These plantations can also act as a barrier to the movement of species across the landscape. In addition, in most places where pine plantations have been established, invasions have occurred into the surrounding ecosystems. Overall, pine invasions are more evident in open ecosystems (e.g., grasslands, steppes, and degraded native forest), but they can also occur in denser vegetation (e.g., temperate forests). Native species loss as a consequence of pine invasions has been recorded in tropical, mediterranean, and temperate ecosystems. Increased pine abundance and the resultant native species loss bring changes to all levels of organization within the ecosystem, from soil microorganisms to invertebrates, plants, and vertebrates. These changes reduce the ecosystem's spatial heterogeneity and thus cause biotic homogenization. These biodiversity losses can affect the stability of ecosystems by decreasing their resilience to environmental change and disturbances. To mitigate the impacts caused by pines, it is important to implement comprehensive landscape planning, understanding that pine plantations coexist and interact with other land uses in a complex ecological and social setting.

AB The Atlantic Forest is one of the world's top biodiversity hotspots, but the diversification processes of its biota are still poorly known, with competing models attributing dominant roles to either Quaternary climatic changes or geographic barriers. Many studies identify the Doce river as a major phylogeographic break, but the reasons for this phenomenon are highly debated. Here we test the predictions of the refugial and barrier models for a common species of praying mantis, Miobantia fuscata, focusing in the areas immediately south and north of the Doce river. Our analyses show high intraspecific genetic diversity, deep coalescence times and no evidence for recent population expansion. Phylogeographic structure is inconsistent with a refugial hypothesis. Significant gene flow between northern and southern populations also conflicts with a strong role for geographic barriers. This study highlights the need for considering invertebrate taxa to infer recent landscape changes, and points towards a more complex picture of genetic diversification in the Atlantic Forest.

AB Southern Amazonia is the first region of Brazil's Amazon area to be exposed to intensive conversion to agriculture and ranching. This conversion emits greenhouse gases from the carbon stock in the biomass and soils of the previous vegetation. Quantifying these carbon stocks is the first step in quantifying the impact on global warming from this conversion. This review is limited to information on Brazilian Amazonia's carbon stocks. It indicates large amounts of carbon at risk of emission in both biomass and soils, as well as considerable uncertainty in estimates. Reducing uncertainty is a priority for research but the existence of uncertainty must not be used as an excuse for delaying measures to contain deforestation. The magnitude of carbon stocks is proportional to greenhouse gas emissions per hectare of deforestation and consequently to impact on global climate.

AB Primary forests represent the ultimate intact habitat for saproxylic insects. However, their extent has been considerably reduced over the past centuries, and those remaining are very heterogeneously distributed. Primary forests are still locally abundant in tropical and boreal zones but are rare in temperate zones. Consequently, many saproxylic insects that were adapted to typical characteristics of primary forests, such as large amounts of dead wood or overmature and senescent trees, might have become extinct regionally due to habitat loss. The remaining primary forests therefore function as refuges for those saproxylic species that cannot survive in managed forests because of their high ecological requirements. Here we identify six characteristics of primary forests important for saproxylic insects that differentiate these forests greatly from managed forests, namely, absence of habitat fragmentation, continuity, natural disturbance regimes, dead-wood amount and quality, tree species composition and habitat trees. These six characteristics highlight the importance of primary forests for the conservation of saproxylic insects in all three main climatic domains (tropical, boreal and temperate). As primary forests are rare in northern temperate zones and are being dramatically lost in boreal and tropical zones, we propose that they should be strictly conserved independently of their climatic zone. Furthermore, we recommend that studies in primary forests intensify to provide reference data for integrating primary forest characteristics into managed forests to improve the conservation of saproxylic species.

AB 1. Ants are diverse and abundant, especially in tropical ecosystems. They are often cited as the agents of key ecological processes, but their precise contributions compared with other organisms have rarely been quantified. Through the removal of food resources from the forest floor and subsequent transport to nests, ants play an important role in the redistribution of nutrients in rainforests. This is an essential ecosystem process and a key energetic link between higher trophic levels, decomposers and primary producers.
   2. We used the removal of carbohydrate, protein and seed baits as a proxy to quantify the contribution that ants, other invertebrates and vertebrates make to the redistribution of nutrients around the forest floor, and determined to what extent there is functional redundancy across ants, other invertebrate and vertebrate groups.
   3. Using a large-scale, field-based manipulation experiment, we suppressed ants from c. 1ha plots in a lowland tropical rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia. Using a combination of treatment and control plots, and cages to exclude vertebrates, we made food resources available to: (i) the whole foraging community, (ii) only invertebrates and (iii) only non-ant invertebrates. This allowed us to partition bait removal into that taken by vertebrates, non-ant invertebrates and ants. Additionally, we examined how the non-ant invertebrate community responded to ant exclusion.
   4. When the whole foraging community had access to food resources, we found that ants were responsible for 52% of total bait removal whilst vertebrates and non-ant invertebrates removed the remaining 48%. Where vertebrates were excluded, ants carried out 61% of invertebrate-mediated bait removal, with all other invertebrates removing the remaining 39%. Vertebrates were responsible for just 24% of bait removal and invertebrates (including ants) collectively removed the remaining 76%. There was no compensation in bait removal rate when ants and vertebrates were excluded, indicating low functional redundancy between these groups.
   5. This study is the first to quantify the contribution of ants to the removal of food resources from rainforest floors and thus nutrient redistribution. We demonstrate that ants are functionally unique in this role because no other organisms compensated to maintain bait removal rate in their absence. As such, we strengthen a growing body of evidence establishing ants as ecosystem engineers, and provide new insights into the role of ants in maintaining key ecosystem processes. In this way, we further our basic understanding of the functioning of tropical rainforest ecosystems.

AB 1. Poaching is one of the greatest threats to wildlife conservation world-wide. However, the spatial and temporal patterns of poaching activities within protected areas, and the effectiveness of ranger patrols and ranger posts in mitigating these threats, are relatively unknown.
   2. We used 10 years (2006-2015) of ranger-based monitoring data and dynamic multi-season occupancy models to quantify poaching-related threats, to examine factors influencing the spatio-temporal dynamics of these threats and to test the efficiency of management actions to combat poaching in Nyungwe National Park (NNP), Rwanda.
   3. The probability of occurrence of poaching-related threats was highest at lower elevations (1,801-2,200 m), especially in areas that were close to roads and tourist trails; conversely, occurrence probability was lowest at high elevation sites (2,6013,000 m), and near the park boundary and ranger posts. The number of ranger patrols substantially increased the probability that poaching-related threats disappear at a site if threats were originally present (i.e. probability of extinction of threats). Without ranger visits, the annual probability of extinction of poaching-related threats was an estimated 7%; this probability would increase to 20% and 57% with 20 and 50 ranger visits per year, respectively.
   4. Our results suggest that poaching-related threats can be effectively reduced in NNP by adding ranger posts in areas where they do not currently exist, and by increasing the number of patrols to sites where the probability of poaching activities is high.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our application of dynamic occupancy models to predict the probability of presence of poaching-related threats is novel, and explicitly considers imperfect detection of illegal activities. Based on the modelled relationships, we identify areas that are most vulnerable to poaching, and offer insights regarding how ranger patrols can be optimally deployed to reduce poaching-related threats and other illegal activites, while taking into account potential sampling biases. We show that poaching can be effectively reduced by increasing ranger patrols to areas under high risk of poaching activities, and by adding ranger patrols near these sites. These findings are broadly applicable to national parks and protected areas experiencing a high degree of poaching and other illegal activities.

AB Potential variability in nutrient limitation among tree size classes, functional groups and species calls for an integrated community- and ecosystem-level perspective of lowland tropical rainforest nutrient limitation. In particular, canopy trees determine ecosystem nutrient conditions, but competitive success for nutrients and light during the sapling bottleneck determines canopy composition. We conducted an in situ multi-nutrient sapling fertilization experiment at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, to determine how functional group identity, species identity and light availability can impact nutrient limitation of stem growth in three functional groups and nine species. Despite high soil fertility, we found nutrient-light limitation in two functional groups and four species. Unexpectedly, the nitrogen-fixing (N-2 fixers) and shade-tolerant functional groups were significantly nutrient limited, while the light-demanding functional group was not. This was partially explained by species-level variation in nutrient limitation within these functional groups, with only some species conforming to the prediction of stronger nutrient limitation in light demanders compared to shade-tolerants. Most surprisingly, we found strong nutrient limitation at low-light levels in the N-2 fixers (which were shade-tolerant), but not in the shade-tolerant non-fixers. We hypothesize that the N-2 fixers were actually nitrogen limited at low-light levels because of their nitrogen-rich leaves and the high carbon cost of their symbionts. This finding suggests a highly shade-tolerant, N-2 fixation strategy, in addition to the perception that N-2 fixation is mostly advantageous in high-light environments during early and gap succession. The shade-tolerant, N-2 fixation strategy may be part of a sapling and canopy tree feedback, where the canopy N-2 fixers enrich the soil N, enhancing growth of their shade-tolerant saplings relative to non-fixing competitors, enabling further canopy domination by shade-tolerant N-2 fixers, as seen at La Selva.Synthesis. The pervasiveness of functional group- and species-specific nutrient and light co-limitation in our saplings indicates that these interactions likely play an important role in the dynamics of lowland tropical rainforest nutrient limitation, potentially via other such sapling and canopy tree feedbacks as the one hypothesized.

AB Fire has shaped plant evolution and biogeochemical cycles for millions of years in savanna ecosystems, but changes in natural fire regimes promoted by human land use threaten contemporary conservation efforts. In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity. Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP), southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector, non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of interest regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more ecologically sustainable fire regimes. The study has broader implications for conservation management in fire-prone savannas in South America generally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tailings are artificial soil-forming substrates that have not been created by the natural processes of soil formation and weathering. The extreme pH environment and corresponding low availability of some macro-and micronutrients in alkaline tailings, coupled with hostile physical and geochemical conditions, present a challenging environment to native biota. Some significant nutritional constraints to ecosystem reconstruction on alkaline tailings include i) predominant or complete absence of combined nitrogen (N) and poor soil N retention; ii) the limited bioavailability of some micronutrients at high soil pH (e.g., Mn, Fe, Zn and Cu); and iii) potentially toxic levels of biologically available soil phosphorus (P) for P-sensitive plants. The short regulatory time frames (years) for mine closure on tailings landforms are at odds with the long time required for natural pedogenic processes to ameliorate these factors (thousands of years). However, there are similarities between the chemical composition and nutrient status of alkaline tailings and the poorly-developed, very young calcareous soils of biodiverse regions such as southwestern Australia. We propose that basic knowledge of chronosequences that start with calcareous soils may provide an informative model for understanding the pedogenic processes required to accelerate soil formation on tailings. Development of a functional, stable root zone is crucial to successful ecological restoration on tailings, and three major processes should be facilitated as early as possible during processing or in the early stages of restoration to accelerate soil development on alkaline tailings: i) acidification of the upper tailings profile; ii) establishment of appropriate and resilient microbial communities; and iii) the early development of appropriate pioneer vegetation. Achieving successful ecological restoration outcomes on tailings landforms is likely one of the greatest challenges faced by restoration ecologists and the mining industry, and successful restoration on alkaline tailings likely depends upon careful management of substrate chemical conditions by targeted amendments.

AB During the past 100 years in densely populated south-eastern Brazil, wetlands have been severely transformed due to urbanization, agriculture and mining. The recently discovered Sao Paulo Marsh Antwren (Formicivora paludicola) is endemic to these wetlands, and is listed as "Critically Endangered" by the IUCN. The species is only found in an area of 1.42 km 2, it has a sparse and fragmented distribution, low dispersal capacity, and has probably lost around 300 km 2 of habitat in the past 100 years. Furthermore, very little is known about F. paludicola natural history, and so it is difficult to construct a robust conservation plan. Using Kernel home range estimations and the Adjusted-SD/Torus Shift test (a novel tool for animal-habitat association studies), we showed that the species avoids patches of the alien invasive ginger lily (Hedychium coronarium). Given the high density of their population (3.6 mature individuals/ha), F. paludicola could thrive in relatively small areas of suitable wetlands protected from human occupation and water contamination, however special attention should be paid to biological invasions, which may represent a serious threat to the remaining populations. Protecting a few small wetlands used by F. paludicola would be an important step towards general conservation and restoration of Atlantic Forest wetlands and its endemic endangered species.

AB Tropical forests have been a permanent feature of the Amazon basin for at least 55 million years, yet climate change and land use threaten the forest's future over the next century. Understory forest fires, which are common under the current climate in frontier forests, may accelerate Amazon forest losses from climate-driven dieback and deforestation. Far from land use frontiers, scarce fire ignitions and high moisture levels preclude significant burning, yet projected climate and land use changes may increase fire activity in these remote regions. Here, we used a fire model specifically parameterized for Amazon understory fires to examine the interactions between anthropogenic activities and climate under current and projected conditions. In a scenario of low mitigation efforts with substantial land use expansion and climate change - Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 - projected understory fires increase in frequency and duration, burning 4-28 times more forest in 2080-2100 than during 1990-2010. In contrast, active climate mitigation and land use contraction in RCP4.5 constrain the projected increase in fire activity to 0.9-5.4 times contemporary burned area. Importantly, if climate mitigation is not successful, land use contraction alone is very effective under low to moderate climate change, but does little to reduce fire activity under the most severe climate projections. These results underscore the potential for a fire-driven transformation of Amazon forests if recent regional policies for forest conservation are not paired with global efforts to mitigate climate change.

AB Native species that forage in farmland may increase their local abundances thereby affecting adjacent ecosystems within their landscape. We used two decades of ecological data from a protected primary rainforest in Malaysia to illutrate how subsidies from neighboring oil palm plantations triggered powerful secondary 'cascading' effects on natural habitats located >1.3 km away. We found (i) oil palm fruit drove 100-fold increases in crop-raiding native wild boar (Sus scrofa), (ii) wild boar used thousands of understory plants to construct birthing nests in the pristine forest interior, and (iii) nest building caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over the 24-year study period. The long-term, landscape-scale indirect effects from agriculture suggest its full ecological footprint may be larger in extent than is currently recognized. Cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

AB In tropical tree communities, processes occurring during early life stages play a critical role in shaping forest composition and diversity through differences in species' performance. Predicting the future of tropical forests depends on a solid understanding of the drivers of seedling survival. At the same time, factors determining spatial and temporal patterns of seedling survival can play a large role in permitting species coexistence in diverse communities. Using long-term data on the survival of more than 45 000 seedlings of 238 species in a Neotropical forest, we assessed the relative importance of key abiotic and biotic neighbourhood variables thought to influence individual seedling survival and tested whether species vary significantly in their responses to these variables, consistent with niche differences. At the community level, seedling survival was significantly correlated with plant size, topographic habitat, neighbourhood densities of conspecific seedlings, conspecific and heterospecific trees and annual variation in water availability, in descending order of effect size. Additionally, we found significant variation among species in their sensitivity to light and water availability, as well as in their survival within different topographic habitats, indicating the potential for niche differentiation among species that could allow for species coexistence.

AB Background: Fujian cypress (Fokienia hodginsii) is a highly valued but endangered tree species. The Ta Xua Nature Reserve in Vietnam is one of its main conservation centers. This nature reserve consists of a fully protected core zone, a buffer zone in which low intensity forest use is permitted, and a forest restoration zone in which forest regenerates after shifting cultivation.
   Methods: The community and population status of F. hodginsii and two other threatened tree species (Aglaia spectabilis and Quercus platycalyx) were assessed across the three conservation zones. Based on 120 random sample plots of 400 m(2), we applied adaptive cluster sampling for trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of at least 6 cm. In addition, tree regeneration (DBH < 6 cm) was assessed.
   Results: In the core zone, F. hodginsii, A. spectabilis and Q. platycalyx occurred at moderate densities (4.9, 5.1 and 4.4 trees center dot ha(-1), respectively). F. hodginsii and A. spectabilis were however much less abundant in the buffer and restoration zones. In contrast, Q. platycalyx had its highest density in the restoration zone. Regeneration of all three target species occurred in the core zone; however, there were only a few regenerating trees of F. hodginsii and A. spectabilis in the buffer and regeneration zones. Regeneration of F. hodginsii and A. spectabilis was mostly in the vicinity of conspecific adult trees.
   Conclusions: F. hodginsii and A. spectabilis were mostly confined to the core zone, and regeneration of these species was rare in the buffer and restoration zones. For these two species, the core zone was the most important refuge, so continued conservation of this zone is important for the preservation of these species. The results of this study in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve do not confirm the classification of Q. platycalyx as ` vulnerable' in the Vietnam Red List. Further forest monitoring including repeated population assessments is needed to evaluate the vulnerability of threatened tree species.

AB Background. Since 1996, when Vivo questioned how many species of mammals occur in Brazil, there has been a huge effort to assess this biodiversity. In this contribution, we present new records for rare species of the sigmodontine rodent genera Rhagomys and Neusticomys previously unknown to Brazilian Amazon. We provided detailed information on the morphologic variation to allow the proper identification of these species. We also furnished updated information on their collection, aiming to establish hypothesis of their geographic distribution, based on SDM's, aiming to hypothesize potential occurrence areas for these species.
   Methods. Rodent specimens were sampled in separate inventories in two sites of Rondonia State (Hydroelectric Dam Jirau and Parque Nacional de Pacaas Novos) and one site in Para State (Pacaja), Brazil, and were compared to specimens from museum collections to apply appropriate names. The SDM were conducted using two algorithms for rare species, MaxEnt and randomForest (RF), and were based on seven localities for Rhagomys, and 10 for Neusticomys.
   Results. All specimens were collected with pitfall traps. One specimen of genus Rhagomys was trapped in the Hydroelectric Dam Jirau. We identified this specimen as R. longilingua, and the SDM species indicates suitable areas for its occurrence at high elevations near on the Andes and lowlands of Amazon Basin to the South of the Rio Amazonas. Two specimens of Neusticomys were recorded, and we identified the specimen from Pacaas Novos as N. peruviensis, with SDM suggesting main areas of occurrence on Western Amazon. We applied the name N. ferreirai to the specimen from Pacaja, with SDM recovering suitable areas in Eastern Amazon.
   Discussion. We reinforced the importance of pitfall traps on the study of Neotropical rodents. We described morphologic variation within and among all species that do not invalidate their specific status, but in the near future a re-evaluation will be mandatory. The new records extended the species distribution considerably. SDM was successful to predict their distributions, as the two algorithms presented important differences in range size recovered by the models that can be explained by differences in the thresholds used for the construction of the models. Most suitable areas coincide with the areas facing most of the deforestation in Amazon. We added two rare species of sigmodontine rodents to the list of Brazilian Mammals, which now comprises 722 species (or 775 valid nominal taxa). Although more information is available than in 1996, it is essential that mammal experts maintain inventory and revisionary programs to update and revise this information. This is even more important, as changes in Brazilian environmental legislation are being discussed, suggesting reduced need for environmental impact reports prior to beginning commercial enterprises, resulting in the loss of information about native biodiversity in the affected areas.

AB Tropical rainforests harbor a high diversity of tree species, offering a potentially rich array of timber (TFP) and non-timber (NTFP ) forest products. The supply of such products has been commonly evaluated at the local (plot) scale; however, little is known about how their availability and diversity change at the landscape scale, particularly in heterogeneous environments. This information is critical in designing landscape forest management programs. Here, we assess the extent to which the frequency, abundance, diversity, composition and productivity (aboveground biomass) of tree assemblages with potential forest products (PFPs) change across three landscape units (LUs) that differ in soil and topographic conditions. The study was carried out in a well-conserved old-growth tropical rainforest in southeastern Mexico. Three plots (0.5 ha each) were established per LU, in which all trees >= 10 cm were inventoried, taxonomically identified and assigned to eight forest product categories. General linear models, multiple regression and ordination analysis (CCA) were used to assess structural and compositional changes in the tree assemblages supplying different PFPs among LUs and along soil physicochemical gradients. More than half (94 species, 57%) of the total number of identified species (165) had one or more PFPs, mostly related to timber products. Ordination analysis showed that the abundance of species with different PFPs has a heterogeneous distribution among LUs, mostly related to changes in soil nitrogen, pH and aluminum saturation. Variation among LUs in terms of tree biomass was strongly driven by soil available phosphorus and soil physiological depth. Each LU had a different potential to provide forest products, producing a diverse mosaic of PFPs within the landscape. Decisions concerning sustainable forest management should consider such variability in the availability and diversity of forest products across landscapes, as well as the environmental factors that govern this spatial variation.

AB A taxonomic revision of Colletes Latreille species with known geographic distribution in Chile is presented. In addition to the traditional morphological approach to taxonomy, DNA barcoding was employed to facilitate sexual association and cryptic species recognition. I provide diagnoses, synonymies, geographic and floral records, and a fully-illustrated key for 31 recognized species, 23 of them previously described: C. alocochila Moure, C. atacamensis Janvier, C. atripes Smith, C. bicolor Smith, C. chusmiza Rojas & Toro, C. cognatus Spinola, C. cyanescens (Haliday), C. cyaniventris Spinola n. stat., C. flaminii Moure, C. fulvipes Spinola, C. gilvus Vachal, C. guanta Rojas & Toro, C. longiceps Friese, C. lucens Vachal, C. mastochila Moure, C. murinus Friese, C. musculus Friese, C. nigritulus Friese, C. patagonicus Schrottky, C. quelu Rojas & Toro, C. rutilans Vachal, C. sulcatus Vachal, and C. vicugnensis Rojas & Toro. In addition, eight new species are described: C. arthuri n. sp., C. coquimbensis n. sp., C. flavipilosus n. sp., C. kuhlmanni n. sp., C. nigropilosus n. sp., C. simulatus n. sp., C. toroi n. sp., and C. ventricarinatus n. sp. Lectotypes for the following species are designated: Andrena cyanescens, Colletes bicolor, C. campoi Herbst, C. chubutensis Cockerell, C. gilvus, C. lucens, C. patagonicus, C. rufosignatus Cockerell, and C. viridans Vachal. Colletes seminitidus Spinola and C. viridans are both proposed as junior synonyms of C. cyanescens, and C. araucariae Friese is considered a junior synonym of C. sulcatus. Colletes cyaniventris n. stat. is resurrected from synonymy.

AB Integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) has been viewed as an appropriate approach to identifying conservation priorities. Taking Xishuangbanna tropical region in Southwest China, different BESs (habitat quality [used as a proxy for biodiversity], carbon storage, and water yield) were quantified using the InVEST model and conservation hotspots from 1976, 1990, and 2010 were identified by overlapping and ranking the service layers. Results showed that BESs areas were unevenly distributed. High habitat quality and carbon storage areas located in the eastern part of the region were mainly occupied by broad-leaved forest, while high water yield areas were covered by grassland and tropical forests. Recognized hotspots were primarily composed of the broad-leaved forest and shrub grassland. However, these habitat types declined by nearly 50% from 1.25x10(5) ha to 0.63x10(5) ha and became more fragmented during the study period. We also found that the sub-watersheds which decreased in BES had fewer hotspots distributed and suffered greater landscape fragmentation. Our study further explored the impacts of land-use conversion on BES, and illustrated the necessity and feasibility of BESs in identifying potential conservation areas.

AB Understanding the effects of global climate disruption on biodiversity is important to future conservation efforts. While taxonomic diversity is widely studied, functional diversity of plants, and recently animals, is receiving increasing attention. Most studies of mammals are short-term, focus on temperate habitats, and rely on traits described in the literature rather than generating traits from observations. Unlike previous studies, this long-term field study assessed the factors driving the functional and taxonomic diversity of small-mammal assemblages in dry tropical forests using both traits recorded from literature and a demographic database. We assessed the drivers (abundance and biomass, temperature and rainfall) of taxonomic richness and functional diversity for two rain-driven seasons in two adjacent but distinct forests-upland and lowland (arroyo or riparian) forests. Our analysis found that rainfall, both seasonal and atypical, was the primary factor driving functional and taxonomic diversity of small-mammal assemblages. Functional responses differed between the two types of forests, however, with effects being stronger in the harsher conditions of the upland forests than in the less severe conditions prevailing in the arroyo (riparian) forest. The latter also supports a richer, more diverse, and more stable small-mammal assemblage. These findings highlight the importance of climate to tropical biological diversity, as extreme climate events (hurricanes, droughts and floods) and disruption of rainfall patterns were shown to decrease biodiversity. They also support the need to preserve these habitats, as their high taxonomic diversity and functional redundancy makes them resilient against global climate disruption and local extreme events. Tropical dry forests constitute a potential reservoir for biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Unfortunately, these forests are among the most endangered terrestrial ecosystems because of deforestation and the likely impacts of global climate disruption.

   from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, CONACyT
   (http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/) and it was divided in two parts. The first
   one was a PhD student grant (grant number 205321) for Edgard Mason-Romo,
   which lasted from 2011-2015) and it was destined to maintenance (the
   amount was 32,000 USD divided among four years) and a mobility grant
   (grant number 202672) and it was given for Edgard Mason-Romo to go to
   Santiago de Chile to work with Ariel Farias on the methodological and
   statistical analysis, the first half of 2013, (the amount was around
   2,000 USD for six months abroad). Any other financial support was given
   directly either by Edgard Mason-Romo family and there searchers of the
   Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (Mauricio Lima and Fabian

AB Ensemble techniques, common in many disciplines, have yet to be fully exploited with spatially explicit projections from land-change models. We trial a land-change model ensemble to assess the impact of policies designed to conserve tropical rainforest at the municipality scale in Brazil, noting the achievements made and challenges ahead. Four spatial model frameworks that were calibrated with the same predictor variables produced 21 counterfactual simulations of the actual landscape. Individual projections with a uniform calibration period gave estimates that between 29 and 68% of the simulated deforestation was saved, but lacked an uncertainty estimate, whilst batch projections from two different model frameworks provided a more dependable mean estimate that 38 and 49% deforestation was prevented with an uncertainty range of 1900 and 1000 km(2). The consensus ensembles used agreement between the projections and found that the seven examples with a uniform calibration period produced an error margin of +/- 435.94 km(2) and a prevented forest loss estimate of 50%. Using all 21 projections with diverse calibration periods improved these errors to +/- 179.26 km(2) with a 53% estimate of prevented forest loss. Whilst we achieved a method of combining projections of different frameworks to reduce uncertainty of individual modelling frameworks, demonstrating a control model and accounting for non-linear conditions are challenges that will provide better confidence in this method as an operational tool. Such retrospective evidence could be used to make timely rewards for efforts of governments and municipalities to support tropical forest conservation and help mitigate deforestation.

AB Conservation practitioners often rely on areas designed to protect species of greatest conservation priority to also conserve co-occurring species (i.e., the umbrella species concept). The extent to which vertebrate species may serve as suitable umbrellas for invertebrate species, however, has rarely been explored. Sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.) have high conservation priority throughout much of the rangelands of western North America and are considered an umbrella species through which the conservation of entire rangeland ecosystems can be accomplished. Harvester ants are ecosystem engineers and play important roles in the maintenance and function of rangeland ecosystems. We compared indices of the abundance of western harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) and Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) at 72 sites in central Wyoming, USA, in 2012. The abundance of harvester ant mounds was best predicted by a regression model that included a combination of local habitat characteristics and the abundance of sage-grouse. When controlling for habitat-related factors, areas with higher abundances of sage-grouse pellets (an index of sage-grouse abundance and/or habitat use) had higher abundances of ant mounds than areas with lower abundances of sage-grouse pellets. The causal mechanism underlying this positive relationship between sage-grouse and ant mound abundance at the fine scale could be indirect (e.g., both species prefer similar environmental conditions) or direct (e.g., sage-grouse prefer areas with a high abundance of ant mounds because ants are an important prey item during certain life stages). We observed no relationship between a broad-scale index of breeding sage-grouse density and the abundance of ant mounds. We suspect that consideration of the nonbreeding habitat of sage-grouse and finer-scale measures of sagegrouse abundance are critical to the utility of sage-grouse as an umbrella species for the conservation of harvester ants and their important role in rangeland ecosystems.

AB Not all plant traits from all regions have been standardized or databased. Some ecosystems, such as tropical grasslands, are under-represented in such databases owing to the difficulty in assessing bud banks and evaluating clonal growth. This study aimed to (i) determine whether Brazilian morphological traits of belowground organs can be translated into categories used in the CLO-PLA database and (ii) assess the applicability of clonal and bud bank traits standardized in the CLO-PLA database for Brazilian Aldama species, which have specialized belowground organs and are able to resprout. In all, 165 species, including herbs, subshrubs and shrubs, of 37 genera from different Brazilian ecosystems, were evaluated. Not all the traditional Brazilian morphological categories could be translated into CLO-PLA traits, resulting in a lower number of categories and loss of information regarding plant morphology. Furthermore, clonal and bud bank traits could be only partially evaluated for Aldama, since some traits showed seasonal variation. The CLO-PLA classification focused on the organs in relation to the soil surface, the connection between mother and daughter shoots, and the origin of buds from which daughter shoots sprout. In the Brazilian classification, by contrast, anatomical features or early ontogeny of the organ are very important. Nevertheless, our results might form the basis for future comparative studies across ecosystems and biomes, for which common trait standardization is necessary. However, further research is needed to assess the functional morphology of clonal and bud bank traits in tropical regions.

AB We characterize the vegetation types of the upper basin of the Madeira River in the Brazilan state of Rondnia, a biodiverse region with elevated rates of habitat loss. Vegetation and environmental parameters were recorded from 37 observation points distributed along and near a 160 km stretch of the Madeira River and representing the range of regional environments. Analysis of structure and floristic variables, as well as associated edaphic attributes and water table fluctuation, permitted recognition of five main vegetation types and seven subtypes. Open Ombrophilous Forest was the most frequently encountered vegetation type and occurred on well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, whereas Dense Ombrophilous Forest was seldom recorded. Alluvial Ombrophilous Forests (varzea) were found along a narrow strip of land along the banks of the Madeira River on the most fertile soils in the study area. Semideciduous Forests were found on small areas of rocky outcrops with shallow soils and reduced water availability during the dry season. Campinaranas, which range from open savanna physiognomies to closed canopy forests, were found to be a key environment in the lowlands south of the Madeira River on silty hydromorphic soils, where they harbor a peculiar flora tolerant of flooding during the rainy season. Our classification of the main vegetation types in the upper Madeira River illuminates a high degree of floristic and environmental heterogeneity in a highly threatened region. Our results will be useful for designing conservation strategies aimed at protecting the full range of floristic diversity present in the region.

ID GENERIC CLASSIFICATION
AB The Lecythidaceae or Brazil Nut family are ubiquitous in non-flooded lowland forests of the Amazon, where they are indicative of well-preserved or little-disturbed habitats. A recent checklist of the Brazilian flora reported 10 genera and 119 species for that country, of which 104 are found in the Amazon region. However, the botanical knowledge in many regions of the country remains far from complete. This study aimed to analyze the diversity of Lecythidaceae in the upper Madeira River region in Rondnia, an area where botanical data is scarce. Lecythidaceae collections deposited in the CEN, INPA and RON herbaria were examined, and four field expeditions in the study area were carried out. For that region, we recorded 37 species of Lecythidaceae belonging to 7 genera: Eschweilera (21 species), Couratari (6), Cariniana (3), Gustavia (3), Allantoma (2), Bertholletia (1) and Lecythis (1). Among these species, five are listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List. The total number of species found in the upper Madeira River of Rondnia alone is higher than the 28 species reported to date for the entire state of Rondnia in the Brazilian Flora Checklist (Smith et al., 2015), and adds 13 new records of Lecythidaceae for the state. Considering that this study is restricted to the northern part of the state, our results suggest that the number of Lecythidaceae species in Rondnia is severely underestimated. Our findings highlight the need for more intensive floristic studies in the Amazon region, which should target areas that are botanically unexplored but have high biodiversity potential.

AB Recent collections of Ceratozamia from the Sierra Norte of Puebla, Mexico, point to a new undescribed species, which was previously subsumed under the concept of C. mexicana. Identification of this new species resulted from a review of three associated species: C. mexicana, C. tenuis, and C. delucana. Here we describe Ceratozamia totonacorum and provide information regarding its distribution and natural history. The Ceratozamia species from the Sierra Madre Oriental, Mexico, are circumscribed using morphological characters, including a detailed evaluation of reproductive structures such as the apex, position, color and shape of the ovulate strobilus.

AB The community temperature index (CTI) is increasingly used to identify the impacts of global warming on local biotic communities such as birds, butterflies, and plants. Temperature is one of the main determinants of global ant diversity and local ant assemblages. Therefore, the CTI can be used to identify the relationship between temperature and ant assemblages or to estimate the influence of global warming. This study aimed at finding the relationship between temperature and CTI values of ant assemblages. Ants were surveyed using baits and pitfall traps at six forest sites in South Korea, differing in mean annual temperature (MAT) from 7.4 C-circle to 12 C-circle. The national ant data was used to calculate the species temperature index (STI) of each species that was then used to estimate CTI. The CTI values were significantly positively correlated to MAT values, but the slopes of regression models were lower than one (0.43-0.62). The low slope might be partly caused by the bias of local occurrence data: Overestimation of STI of northern species and underestimation of southern species. The slope values varied according to data types (abundance-individuals, abundance-trap, and occurrence).

AB This study, held in vineyards from Douro Demarcated Region, aimed to: a) identify the communities and main functional groups of spiders and ants; b) check patterns of co-occurrence between the two communities; and c) evaluate the impact of ground cover and non-crop habitats adjacent to vineyards, on the two communities. Samplings were done using pitfall trapping. Twenty species of ants and 44 species of spiders were identified. The most abundant were: Aphaenogaster gibbosa (Latreille 1798), Aphaenogaster iberica Emery 1908, Cataglyphis hispanica (Emery 1906), Cataglyphis iberica (Emery 1906), Messor barbarus (L. 1767) and Tapinoma nigerrimum (Nylander 1856) which totalized 71.21% of ants; and Alopecosa albofasciata (Brulle 1832), Callilepis concolor Simon 1914, Eratigena feminea Simon 1870, Zodarion alacre (Simon 1870) and Zodarion styliferum (Simon 1870) which accounted for 38% of spiders. Three Iberian endemic ants and nine Iberian endemic spiders were also identified. Abundance of both ant-mimicking and ant-eating spiders were positively correlated with abundance of Formicinae, while only abundance of ant-eating spiders showed positive correlation with abundance of Myrmicinae ants. All genera/species of ant-associated spider were associated with one or more genera/specie of ants. Both spiders and ants have not benefited from the adjacent non-crop habitat. Sheet web weaver spiders were found to be positively correlated with the percentage of ground cover. These results show that a) vineyard agroecosystem support a rich assemblage of ants and spiders evincing that wine production and species conservation is possible and b) non-random co-occurrence between ants and ant-associated spiders exist in the field.

AB The population of the Chilean endemic marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas locally called "loco" has dramatically decreased in the past 50 years as a result of intense activity of local fisheries and high environmental variability observed along the Chilean coast, including episodes of hypoxia, changes in sea surface temperature, ocean acidification and diseases. In this study, we set out to explore the molecular basis of C. concholepas to cope with biotic stressors such as exposure to the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio anguillarum. Here, 454pyrosequencing was conducted and 61 transcripts related to the immune response in this muricid species were identified. Among these, the expression of six genes (CcNF kappa beta, CcI kappa beta, CcLITAF, CcTLR, CcCas8 and CcCath) involved in the regulation of inflammatory, apoptotic and immune processes upon stimuli, were evaluated during the first 33 h post challenge (hpc). The results showed that CcTLR, CcCas8 and CcCath have an initial response at 4 hpc, evidencing an up-regulation from 4 to 24 hpc. Notably, the response of CcNFKB occurred 2 h later with a statistically significant up-regulation at 6 hpc and 10 hpc. Furthermore, the challenge with V. anguillarum induced a statistically significant down regulation of CcIKB between 2 and 10 hpc as well as a down-regulation of CcLITAF between 2 and 4 hpc followed in both cases by an up-regulation between 24 and 33 hpc. This work describes the first transcriptomic effort to characterize the immune response of C. concholepas and constitutes a valuable transcriptomic resource for future efforts to develop sustainable aquaculture and conservations tools for this endemic marine snail species.

AB The understanding of the degree of forest fragmentation and landscape transformation is crucial for landscape sustainability and biodiversity conservation. Within the Chilean hotspot the Nahuelbuta Mountain can be found, which is considered as a high biodiversity value area under an intense human pressure. However, there is no information on the degree of transformation of the landscape and the conservation status of its natural forest ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the state of the landscape and the spatiotemporal changes in native forests in Nahuelbuta. Through the use of Landsat imagery acquired for 1986 and 2011, land-cover and use maps were generated. Results revealed a loss of 33% of native forest in 25 years, mainly associated with the conversion to forest plantations. Changes in spatial patterns of land-cover and uses revealed a profound transformation of the study landscape and an advanced fragmentation of native forests. We discuss how these changes threaten the persistence of different endemic species at high risk of extinction. If the current trend of spatial pattern changes continues, it is probable that these species might face an increase in their extinction risk.

AB Ecosystem engineers are profoundly important in many biological communities. A Neotropical taxonomic group considered to have engineering effects is the Formicidae (ants). Leaf-cutter ants (LCAs), in particular, which form extensive colonies of millions of individuals, can be important ecosystem engineers in these environments. While the effects of LCAs on plant community structure and soil chemistry are well-studied, their effects on consumers are poorly understood. Therefore, we examined the indirect effects of the LCA Atta cephalotes L. on the leaf-litter arthropod community. We compared abundance and diversity patterns at ant nests to areas distant from nests, utilizing both a factorial design and gradient analysis for both nocturnal and diurnal arthropods. We found that arthropod abundance and diversity was significantly lower for multiple taxonomic groups and trophic levels near leaf-cutter nests, and this pattern was strongest at night. Exceptions to this pattern included two morphospecies of Collembola that were more abundant on nests, suggesting some specialization for these species. For the gradient analysis, abundance increased exponentially for most groups of arthropods. However, for the dominant arthropod species, the amphipod Cerrorchestia hyloraina Lindeman, a quadratic function was the best fit curvilinear model for abundance. It appeared that C. hyloraina had maximal abundance at the transition between nest site and less disturbed forest. These results indicate that LCA activity has a strong effect on the leaf-litter arthropod community, adding to spatial heterogeneity within neotropical forests. These effects may translate into changes in important ecological processes such as nutrient cycling and food web function.

AB Understanding patterns of species diversity relies on accurate taxonomy which can only be achieved by long-term natural history research and the use of complementary information to establish species boundaries among cryptic taxa. We used DNA barcoding to characterize the ant diversity of Iguazu National Park (INP), a protected area of the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest ecoregion, located at the southernmost extent of this forest. We assessed ant diversity using both cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences and traditional morphological approaches, and compared the results of these two methods. We successfully obtained COI sequences for 312 specimens belonging to 124 species, providing a DNA barcode reference library for nearly 50% of the currently known ant fauna of INP. Our results support a clear barcode gap for all but two species, with a mean intraspecific divergence of 0.72%, and an average congeneric distance of 17.25%. Congruently, the library assembled here was useful for the discrimination of the ants of INP and allowed us to link unidentified males and queens to their worker castes. To detect overlooked diversity, we classified the DNA barcodes into Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) using three different clustering algorithms, and compared their number and composition to that of reference species identified based on morphology. The MOTU count was always higher than that of reference species regardless of the method, suggesting that the diversity of ants at INP could be between 6% and 10% higher than currently recognized. Lastly, our survey contributed with 78 new barcode clusters to the global DNA barcode reference library, and added 36 new records of ant species for the INP, being 23 of them new citations for Argentina.

TI Effectiveness of direct payments to increase reproductive success of

AB Direct payments to communities or individuals have gained traction as a tool for species conservation; however, few studies have evaluated their effectiveness. From 2010 to 2014, we monitored nests and implemented a direct payment nest protection programme for six sandbar-nesting bird species on the Mekong River, Cambodia, and tested if nest protection improved reproductive success. Nests were guarded by community members; additionally, exclosures were used to protect nests of River Tern Sterna aurantia, the species of highest conservation concern. We investigated factors affecting nest and chick survival, and probability of nest failure due to egg harvest or predation. Nesting later in the season generally resulted in lower nest and chick survival. Nest protection improved survival rates of River Tern nests and chicks, and Small Pratincole Glareola lactea nests. River Tern nest success was 60% for exclosed (and guarded) nests, 29% for guarded (but unexclosed) nests, and 5% for unprotected nests. River Tern fledging success was 82% for exclosed chicks, 40% for chicks that were guarded only, and 2% for unprotected chicks. Small Pratincole nest success was 21% for guarded and 6% for unguarded nests. Egg harvest by humans was lower among protected nests and declined during the study. Nest predation by animals increased during the study despite nest guarding; however, predator exclosures effectively protected nests and chicks. Additional predator control measures could further improve reproductive success of sandbar-nesting birds. Overall, nest protection involving direct payments was highly effective, but required diligent use of nest exclosures, frequent monitoring, and strong community relationships.

AB Two main theories attempt to explain species coexistence: the neutral theory considers all the species as equivalents so biodiversity is mainly regarded as a function of total available resources (i.e. niche expansion), while the niche theory stresses the relevance of differences in niche use between species (i.e. niche packing). The relative importance of these forces is under discussion and has been largely tested in natural ecosystems. However, few studies have addressed this issue in tropical-urban environments. In this work we studied niche overlap asymmetries among the most common urban resident birds, and the effect of habitat type on this pattern, in a subtropical location of South China (Nanning, Guangxi). We found differences in abundances and niche use among species and urban habitats (parks, streets and orchards). We also recorded strong asymmetries in niche use between species, which we divided into three categories: species with positive asymmetries, which showed highly specific niches and were able to exploit other species' niches; species with neutral asymmetries, which showed high levels of niche overlap with the rest of species; and species with negative asymmetries, which showed low specificity in their niches and were unable to exploit other species' niches. These differences in niche use correlated with differences in fat scores. Species from the first group showed higher fat scores than other two groups. Ultimately, niche asymmetries correlated with species' body condition and mediated their differences in abundance, which supports the view that in this urban context niche theory is more appropriate than neutral theory.

AB Trade-offs between functional traits are ubiquitous in nature and can promote species coexistence depending on their shape. Classic theory predicts that convex trade-offs facilitate coexistence of specialized species with extreme trait values (extreme species) while concave trade-offs promote species with intermediate trait values (intermediate species). We show here that this prediction becomes insufficient when the traits translate non-linearly into fitness which frequently occurs in nature, e.g., an increasing length of spines reduces grazing losses only up to a certain threshold resulting in a saturating or sigmoid trait-fitness function. We present a novel, general approach to evaluate the effect of different trade-off shapes on species coexistence. We compare the trade-off curve to the invasion boundary of an intermediate species invading the two extreme species. At this boundary, the invasion fitness is zero. Thus, it separates trait combinations where invasion is or is not possible. The invasion boundary is calculated based on measurable trait-fitness relationships. If at least one of these relationships is not linear, the invasion boundary becomes non-linear, implying that convex and concave trade-offs not necessarily lead to different coexistence patterns. Therefore, we suggest a new ecological classification of trade-offs into extreme-favoring and intermediate-favoring which differs from a purely mathematical description of their shape. We apply our approach to a well-established model of an empirical predator-prey system with competing prey types facing a trade-off between edibility and half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake. We show that the survival of the intermediate prey depends on the convexity of the trade-off. Overall, our approach provides a general tool to make a priori predictions on the outcome of competition among species facing a common trade-off in dependence of the shape of the trade-off and the shape of the trait-fitness relationships.

AB Agricultural conversion of tropical forests is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Slowing rates of deforestation is a conservation priority, but it is also useful to consider how species diversity is retained across the agricultural matrix. Here, we assess how bird diversity varies in relation to land use in the Taita Hills, Kenya. We used point counts to survey birds along a land-use gradient that included primary forest, secondary vegetation, agroforest, timber plantation and cropland. We found that the agricultural matrix supports an abundant and diverse bird community with high levels of species turnover, but that forest specialists are confined predominantly to primary forest, with the matrix dominated by forest visitors. Ordination analyses showed that representation of forest specialists decreases with distance from primary forest. With the exception of forest generalists, bird abundance and diversity are lowest in timber plantations. Contrary to expectation, we found feeding guilds at similar abundances in all land-use types. We conclude that whilst the agricultural matrix, and agroforest in particular, makes a strong contribution to observed bird diversity at the landscape scale, intact primary forest is essential for maintaining this diversity, especially amongst species of conservation concern.

AB In the present work, we have considered the vulnerability of some rare tree species to human disturbances in a high biodiversity tropical region. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the combined effect of deforestation and artificial flooding of the large Jirau hydroelectric reservoir on potential distribution areas of 13 locally rare tree species in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We performed species distribution modeling (SDM) by using the environmental distance algorithm. Based on these models, we found new sites and subsequently applied rapid ecological assessment to collect further species occurrence data. Additional SDMs were carried out using MaxEnt to determine the potential distribution areas of these rare species. We found that artificial flooding and deforestation caused combined losses of potential distribution areas of rare tree species between 8 and 39% of the total area. The most vulnerable species were Semaphyllanthe megistocaula (K. Krause) L. Andersson (Rubiaceae) (39%), Chrysophyllum colombianum (Aubrev.) T.D. Penn. (Sapotaceae) (34%), Lacunaria jenmanii (Oliv.) Ducke (Quiinaceae) (32%), Brosimum parinarioides Ducke (Moraceae) (32%) and Xylopia benthamii R.E. Fr. (Annonaceae) (30%). These results indicate an additive effect of human disturbances such that artificial flooding, when combined with deforestation, has an overall effect by orders of magnitude. SDMs can be effectively used as a predictive tool in the assessment of human impacts on rare tree species in tropical forests. The results also showed different vulnerability among the rare species, and these results may indicate that some species are more seriously threatened by the extreme loss of potential distribution areas.

AB The importance of community learning in effecting social change towards ecological sustainability has been recognised for some time. More recently, the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools to promote socio-ecological sustainability has been shown to have potential in community education for sustainable development (ESD). The effective design and use of technology for community learning implies an understanding of a range of cross-dimensional factors including: socio-cultural characteristics and needs of the target audience; considerations of available and culturally responsive types of technology; and non-formal pedagogical ESD strategies for community empowerment. In addition, both technology itself and social communities are dynamically evolving and complex entities. This article presents a case study which evaluated the potential of ICT for promoting ecological literacy and action competence amongst community members in southern Chile. The case study addressed the ecological deterioration of a lake, which is having deep social, economic, recreational and cultural implications locally. The authors' research involved developing a theoretical framework for the design, implementation and use of ICT for community learning for sustainability. The framework was based on key ideas from ESD, ICT and community education, and was underpinned by a systems thinking approach to account for the dynamism and complexity of such settings. Activity theory provided a frame to address overarching socio-cultural elements when using technology as a mediating tool for community learning. The authors' findings suggest that the use of an ICT tool, such as a website, can enhance ecological literacy in relation to a local socio-ecological issue.

AB Seed heteromorphism is the formation of different seed morphs from the same individual. Two seed morphs have been preliminarily observed in Leptocereus scopulophilus. One morph shows an apparent natural scarification of its coat. Herein we describe the seeds, taking into account shape, coat integrity, surface, dimensions, mass and the position of germination cracks. We defined two seed morphs using the integrity of the spermoderma: fragmented seed coats (FSC) and complete seed coats (CSC). We also evaluated minimum germination time, germination rate and germinability. The seed morphs did not differ significantly in traits; however, regular striations along the cuticle of the periclinal walls were more visible in the FSC compared with the CSC. Both seed morphs displayed anticlinal cell boundaries in the border region that are channelled and straight in the dorsal-ventral region but difficult to define in the lateral region. We found four morphological variations in different positions where the radicle or cotyledons emerge and variations in cuticle thickness in different regions of the seed that could determine the formation of cracks during germination. All germination variants occurred in both seed morphs, albeit in different proportions. Germination was higher and faster for the FSC compared with the CSC. These germination differences could be related to a thinner cuticle in the FSC and the punctual release of its spermoderma, which facilitates a quick imbibition of the embryo and the breaking of the seed coat. Our results indicate that differences in germination parameters between the two seed morphs relate to differences in the percentage of dormant seeds, which favour the temporal expansion of germination and reduce competition between siblings. To propagate the species for conservation purposes, we recommend using FSC, while CSC may be used to establish a seed collection ex situ.

AB Connectivity losses lead to a reduction of the amount of habitat resources that can be reached and used by species, and hence to a decline in the ranges and abundance of multiple taxa. Despite the recognized important role of small habitat patches for many species inhabiting fragmented landscapes, their potential contribution as stepping stones for maintaining overall landscape connectivity has received less attention. Using connectivity metrics based on a graph-theoretic approach we (i) quantified the connectivity of grassland patches in a sector of the Pampa region in Argentina, using a range of dispersal distances (from 100 to 10,000 m) representative of the scale of dispersal of different species; (ii) identified the most relevant patches for maintaining overall connectivity; and (iii) studied the importance of small patches (defined for different area thresholds of 5, 20, and 50 ha) as connectivity providers in the landscape. Although grassland patches were in general poorly connected at all distances, some of them were critical for overall connectivity and were found to play different crucial roles in the patch network. The location of small patches in the grassland network allowed them to function as stepping stones, yielding significant connectivity gains for species that move large distances (> 5000 m) for the three area thresholds considered. Thus, under the spatial pattern of the studied landscape, species that move long distances would benefit from stepping stones, while less mobile organisms would benefit from, and mostly rely on the largest patches. We recommend that future management activities should (i) aim at preserving the grassland patches with the highest potential as stepping stones to promote landscape-level connectivity; and (ii) pay more attention to the conservation of key small patches, particularly given that usually they are those more vulnerable to land clearing for agriculture.

AB Environmental stressors and changes in land use have led to rapid and dramatic species losses. As such, we need effective monitoring programs that alert us not only to biodiversity losses, but also to functional changes in species assemblages and associated ecosystem processes. Ants are important components of terrestrial food webs and a key group in food web interactions and numerous ecosystem processes. Their sensitive and rapid response to environmental changes suggests that they are a suitable indicator group for the monitoring of abiotic, biotic, and functional changes. We tested the suitability of the incidence (i.e. the sum of all species occurrences at 30 baits), species richness, and functional richness of ants as indicators of ecological responses to environmental change, forest degradation, and of the ecosystem process predation on herbivorous arthropods. We sampled data along an elevational gradient (1000-3000m a.s.l.) and across seasons (wetter and drier period) in a montane rainforest in southern Ecuador. The incidence of ants declined with increasing elevation but did not change with forest degradation. Ant incidence was higher during the drier season. Species richness was highly correlated with incidence and showed comparable results. Functional richness also declined with increasing elevation and did not change with forest degradation. However, a null-model comparison revealed that the functional richness pattern did not differ from a pattern expected for ant assemblages with randomly distributed sets of traits across species. Predation on artificial caterpillars decreased along the elevational gradient; the pattern was not driven by elevation itself, but by ant incidence (or interchangeable by ant richness), which positively affected predation. In spite of lower ant incidence (or ant richness), predation was higher during the wetter season and did not change with forest degradation and ant functional richness. We used path analysis to disentangle the causal relationships of the environmental factors temperature (with elevation as a proxy), season, and habitat degradation with the incidence and functional richness of ants, and their consequences for predation. Our results would suggest that the forecasted global warming might support more active and species-rich ant assemblages, which in turn would mediate increased predation on herbivorous arthropods. However, this prediction should be made with reservation, as it assumes that the dispersal of ants keeps pace with the climatic changes as well as a one-dimensional relationship between ants and predation within a food-web that comprises species interactions of much higher complexity. Our results also suggested that degraded forests in our study area might provide suitable habitat for epigaeic, ground-dwelling ant assemblages that do not differ in incidence, species richness, functional richness, composition, or predation on arthropods from assemblages of primary forests. Most importantly, our results suggest that the occurrence and activity of ants are important drivers of ecosystem processes and that changes in the incidence and richness of ants can be used as effective indicators of responses to temperature changes and of predation within mega-diverse forest ecosystems.

AB One of the main challenges of modern physics is to provide a systematic understanding of systems far from equilibrium exhibiting emergent behavior. Prominent examples of such complex systems include, but are not limited to the cardiac electrical system, the brain, the power grid, social systems, material failure and earthquakes, and the climate system. Due to the technological advances over the last decade, the amount of observations and data available to characterize complex systems and their dynamics, as well as the capability to process that data, has increased substantially. The present issue discusses a cross section of the current research on complex systems, with a focus on novel experimental and data-driven approaches to complex systems that provide the necessary platform to model the behavior of such systems.

AB Urban and peri-urban forests determine different habitat services for biodiversity according to their characteristics. In this study, we relate ecological characteristics of urban and peri-urban forests to forest bird species richness and we assess whether their effect changed over time due to the urban sprawl within the urban region of Milan, Italy. We analyse two periods (1998-2002 and 2010-2014) using weighted generalized linear models that considered urban and peri-urban forests collectively and urban and peri-urban forests separately. Patch area, proximity to source areas and number of surrounding urban and peri-urban forests were the main factors predicting species richness within urban and peri-urban forests in both periods. While there were no differences in factors affecting bird richness in peri-urban forests between the two periods, the negative effect of urban matrix density was statistically significant for birds inhabiting urban forests in the second period. Moreover, protected areas within urban and peri-urban forests and urban forests in the second period were important determinants in providing suitable habitat for birds at the regional scale. This study offered important insights regarding urban and peri-urban forests characteristics that should be maintained to ensure biodiversity conservation across changing urban landscapes.

AB Land use change has been the primary driving force of human alteration of terrestrial ecosystems. With 80% of agricultural land dedicated to livestock production, the sector is an important lever to attenuate land requirements for food production and carbon emissions from land use change. In this study, we quantify impacts of changing human diets and livestock productivity on land dynamics and depletion of carbon stored in vegetation, litter and soils. Across all investigated productivity pathways, lower consumption of livestock products can substantially reduce deforestation (47-55%) and cumulative carbon losses (34-57%). On the supply side, already minor productivity growth in extensive livestock production systems leads to substantial CO2 emission abatement, but the emission saving potential of productivity gains in intensive systems is limited, also involving trade-offs with soil carbon stocks. If accounting for uncertainties related to future trade restrictions, crop yields and pasture productivity, the range of projected carbon savings from changing diets increases to 23-78%. Highest abatement of carbon emissions (63-78%) can be achieved if reduced consumption of animal-based products is combined with sustained investments into productivity increases in plant production. Our analysis emphasizes the importance to integrate demand- and supply-side oriented mitigation strategies and to combine efforts in the crop and livestock sector to enable synergies for climate protection.

We evaluated abundance dynamics of five common species of diurnal lizards over 25 years in a Sonoran Desert transition zone where precipitation decreased and temperature increased across time, and assessed hypotheses for the influence of climatic flux on spatiotemporal variation in abundances. We repeatedly surveyed lizards in spring and summer of each year at up to 32 sites, and used hierarchical mixture models to estimate detection probabilities, abundances, and population growth rates. Among terrestrial species, abundances of a short-lived, winter-spring breeder increased markedly by an estimated 237%-285% across time, while two larger spring-summer breeders with higher thermal preferences declined by up to 64%. Abundances of two arboreal species that occupy shaded and thus sheltered microhabitats fluctuated but did not decline systematically. Abundances of all species increased with precipitation at short lag times (1-1.5 years) likely due to enhanced food availability, but often declined after periods of high precipitation at longer lag times (2-4 years) likely due to predation and other biotic pressures. Although rising maximum daily temperatures (T-max) are expected to drive global declines of lizards, associations with T-max were variable and weak for most species. Instead, abundances of all species declined with rising daily minimum temperatures, suggesting degradation of cool refugia imposed widespread metabolic or other costs. Our results suggest climate warming and drying are having major impacts on lizard communities by driving declines in species with traits that augment exposure to abiotic extremes and by modifying species interactions. The complexity of patterns we report indicates that evaluating and responding to the influence of climate change on biodiversity must consider a broad array of ecological processes.

AB The skull of the polydolopimorphian marsupialiform Epidolops ameghinoi is described in detail for the first time, based on a single well-preserved cranium and associated left and right dentaries plus additional craniodental fragments, all from the early Eocene (53-50 million year old) Itaborai fauna in southeastern Brazil. Notable craniodental features of E. ameghinoi include absence of a masseteric process, very small maxillopalatine fenestrae, a prominent pterygoid fossa enclosed laterally by a prominent ectopterygoid crest, an absent or tiny transverse canal foramen, a simple, planar glenoid fossa, and a postglenoid foramen that is immediately posterior to the postglenoid process. Most strikingly, the floor of the hypotympanic sinus was apparently unossified, a feature found in several stem marsupials but absent in all known crown marsupials. "Type II" marsupialiform petrosals previously described from Itaborai plausibly belong to E. ameghinoi; in published phylogenetic analyses, these petrosals fell outside (crown-clade) Marsupialia. "IMG VII" tarsals previously referred to E. ameghinoi do not share obvious synapomorphies with any crown marsupial clade, nor do they resemble those of the only other putative polydolopimorphians represented by tarsal remains, namely the argyrolagids. Most studies have placed Polydolopimorphia within Marsupialia, related to either Paucituberculata, or to Microbiotheria and Diprotodontia. However, diprotodonty almost certainly evolved independently in polydolopimorphians, paucituberculatans and diprotodontians, and Epidolops does not share obvious synapomorphies with any marsupial order. Epidolops is dentally specialized, but several morphological features appear to be more plesiomorphic than any crown marsupial. It seems likely Epidolops that falls outside Marsupialia, as do morphologically similar forms such as Bonapartherium and polydolopids. Argyrolagids differ markedly in their known morphology from Epidolops but share some potential apomorphies with paucituberculatans. It is proposed that Polydolopimorphia as currently recognised is polyphyletic, and that argyrolagids (and possibly other taxa currently included in Argyrolagoidea, such as groeberiids and patagoniids) are members of Paucituberculata. This hypothesis is supported by Bayesian non-clock phylogenetic analyses of a total evidence matrix comprising DNA sequence data from five nuclear protein-coding genes, indels, retroposon insertions, and morphological characters: Epidolops falls outside Marsupialia, whereas argyrolagids form a clade with the paucituberculatans Caenolestes and Palaeothentes, regardless of whether the Type II petrosals and IMG VII tarsals are used to score characters for Epidolops or not. There is no clear evidence for the presence of crown marsupials at Itaborai, and it is possible that the origin and early evolution of Marsupialia was restricted to the "Austral Kingdom" (southern South America, Antarctica, and Australia).

AB Cranial ontogenetic analyses improve our understanding of function from developmental, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives. Akodon montensis is an abundant, omnivorous forest species that occupies many habitat types. We used traditional and geometric morphometric approaches to describe ontogenetic variation in skulls of A. montensis. We tested for sexual dimorphism and described patterns of variation associated with both age and size based on 6 postweaning age classes. We found no evidence for sexual dimorphism. Growth patterns showed an initial narrowing of the braincase, and associated changes in the rostrum as specimens reached adulthood. Older animals had an elongated rostrum and palate. Geometric morphometric analysis revealed allometric variation associated with the basicranium for the entire age series, while traditional morphometric analyses showed allometric variation in the facial component. The patterns found for A. montensis are similar to those of other species of Akodon. We characterize ontogenetic patterns for Akodontines, the second most diverse Sigmodontine tribe, and a model group for studies of shape change in generalist rodents.

AB Aims
   Relationships between local habitat heterogeneity and tree communities in miombo woodlands have been very little studied. While some studies have addressed this topic at broad scales and based on few environmental parameters, this study aims at (i) detecting fine-scale habitats (<= 10 ha) on the basis of a detailed characterisation of soil explicitly considering past anthropogenic disturbances, and an exhaustive census of the tree community, and at (ii) searching for indicator tree species corresponding to the resulting habitats.
   Methods
   The study was carried out in the miombo woodland of Mikembo Forest Reserve, Upper Katanga, The Democratic Republic of the Congo. A complete census of the tree community was conducted in a 10-ha forest dynamics plot comprising 160 adjacent quadrats of 25 x 25 m, with a total of 4604 trees (diameter at breast height > 10 cm). Thirty-six physicochemical soil parameters were measured. Studying the frequency distribution of soil charcoal content allowed identifying local signature of past human agriculture in the soil. Two strategies were used to define habitats: (i) a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) on soil variables and Ward clustering and (ii) multivariate regression trees (MRT) to search for key soil parameters allowing the best prediction of species composition. Tree-habitat associations were tested by means of a robust statistical framework combining the IndVal index and torus randomisations.
   Important Findings
   The forest contained 82 tree species and a significant proportion of wet miombo species (e.g. Marquesia macroura). We detected a strong east-west edaphic gradient driven by soil texture; most chemical soil parameters followed this pattern. Five habitats were identified based on soil factors and floristic composition. Nine indicator species of these habitats were found. The key soil factors discriminating habitats were total calcium, available forms of phosphorus and clay content. Even though past agricultural practices were successfully detected in soils, they did not display any significant influence neither on habitat differentiation nor on the associated tree communities. Based on an unprecedented large number of soil parameters, fine-scale soil heterogeneity and niche partitioning were shown to contribute to the variability of the floristic composition in this forest. Our results indicated that considering the most variable environmental parameters, as in PCA, is a poor manner for defining habitats. In contrast, combining MRT with the IndVal index and torus randomisation has proved to be a much more robust and sensitive approach to highlight tree-habitat associations at this scale. The common dichotomous viewpoint of considering deterministic and neutral effects as acting at broad and fine scales, respectively, is not confirmed when measuring suitable environmental variables, even in a case where the physical environment does not exhibit strong heterogeneity.

AB Understanding the mechanisms controlling community diversity, functions, succession, and biogeography is a central, but poorly understood, topic in ecology, particularly in microbial ecology. Although stochastic processes are believed to play non-negligible roles in shaping community structure, their importance relative to deterministic processes is hotly debated. The importance of ecological stochasticity in shaping microbial community structure is far less appreciated. Some of the main reasons for such heavy debates are the difficulty in defining stochasticity and the diverse methods used for delineating stochasticity. Here, we provide a critical review and synthesis of data from the most recent studies on stochastic community assembly in microbial ecology. We then describe both stochastic and deterministic components embedded in various ecological processes, including selection, dispersal, diversification, and drift. We also describe different approaches for inferring stochasticity from observational diversity patterns and highlight experimental approaches for delineating ecological stochasticity in microbial communities. In addition, we highlight research challenges, gaps, and future directions for microbial community assembly research.

AB Thermal performance curves (TPCs) represent an increasingly popular tool in ecology for anticipating species responses to climate change. TPC theory has been developed using species that experience similar temperatures during activity and at rest and consequently exhibit thermal ranges for activity that closely coincide with their physiological thermal tolerances. Many species, however, experience other stressors, such as desiccation, that limit active behaviour at temperatures below the maximum values experienced. As a result, activity is constrained to a narrow thermal window that is a subset of the range of temperatures that can be tolerated physiologically. This results in a decoupling of behavioural and physiological TPCs that does not conform to the present paradigm. To test the generality of TPC theory, we measured thermal responses for behaviour (crawling speed) and physiological tolerance (heart rate) for six rocky shore gastropods spanning a thermal/desiccation stress gradient. We hypothesized a positive relationship between shore level and the degree of decoupling of behavioural and physiological TPCs. This prediction was confirmed, and was explained by the extension of the physiological TPC beyond the range of the behavioural TPC. Decoupling of behavioural and physiological TPCs is central to predicting accurately the fitness dynamics of ectothermic species subject to multiple stressors. We believe that this decoupling should be explicitly considered as an adaptive trait defining an organism's thermal niche.

AB Plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning usually have been studied from a plant perspective. However, the mechanisms underlying biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships may also depend on positive or negative interactions between plants and other biotic and abiotic factors, which remain poorly understood. Here we assessed whether plant-herbivore and/or plant-detritivore interactions modify the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship and the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects, including complementarity and selection effects, biomass allocation, vertical distribution of roots, and plant survival using a microcosm experiment. We also evaluated to what extent trophic and non-trophic interactions are affected by abiotic conditions by studying drought effects. Our results show that biotic and abiotic conditions influence the shape of the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship, varying from hump-shaped to linear. For instance, total biomass increased linearly with plant richness in the presence of detritivores, but not in the absence of detritivores. Moreover, detritivore effects on belowground plant productivity were highly context dependent, varying in the presence of herbivores. Plant interactions with soil biota, especially with herbivores, influenced the mechanisms underlying diversity effects. Herbivores increased plant complementarity and modified biomass allocation and vertical distribution of roots. Furthermore, biotic-abiotic interactions influenced plant productivity differently across plant functional groups. Our findings emphasize the importance of complex biotic interactions underlying biodiversity effects, and that these biotic interactions may change with abiotic conditions. Despite minor changes in productivity in the short-term, soil biota-induced changes in plant-plant interactions and plant survival are likely to have significant long-term consequences for ecosystem functioning. Considering the context-dependency of multichannel interactions may contribute to reconciling differences among observed patterns in biodiversity studies. Further, abiotic conditions modified the effects of biotic interactions, suggesting that changes in environmental conditions may not only affect ecosystems directly, but also change the biotic composition of and dynamics within ecosystems.

AB A rich fossil flora occurs in the roof shale of the Middle Pennsylvanian (Moscovian) age, Springfield Coal flanking the Galatia channel, a river deposit approximately 1 km in width and 150 km long, partially contemporaneous with the Springfield peat swamp. Siltstone and sandstone, > 30 m thick, were deposited in the channel during the final estuarine phase. The river formed under seasonal subhumid climate during early deglaciation as marine waters retreated from the land surface. It existed continuously through glacial maximum, under increasingly humid climate, as a low-sediment or black-water river with peat along its flanks. During early deglaciation, under subhumid climate and sea-level rise, the river became a sediment-laden estuary, drowning the peat swamp and burying vegetation in place under extensive mudflats. This buried flora was studied in three underground mines in southern Illinois, permitting vegetation to be characterized spatially. Three transects, comprising 100 sites, a total linear distance of similar to 12 km, reveal distinct zonation perpendicular to the channel margin. An innermost belt, 0.5 to 2.5 km wide, consists almost exclusively of the pteridosperm Neuropteris fiexuosa. North of a river bend, three belts succeed the N. flexuosa zone: mixed pteridosperms and marattialean tree ferns; mixed arborescent lycopsids and marattialians; lycopsids with rare marattialians. South and inside the same bend, N. flexuosa is succeeded by mixed lycopsids, particularly Sigillaria, and marattialean ferns. Within the transects, marattialian ferns have wider distribution than other groups, suggesting broader environmental tolerances. Neuropteris flexuosa channel-margin mono-dominance may reflect high sedimentation rates, elevated nutrient conditions, or floating-seed dispersal. Lycopsid dominance in interior areas conforms with tolerance of deep, standing water. The spatial scale examined affects our perception of community assembly. Overall, distinct vegetational zonation suggests niche-assembly; however, within vegetational bands, there is considerable small-scale spatial variation suggesting stochastic properties.

AB Fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients often increases growth of plants, especially clonal species. Herbivory could change this positive effect of soil heterogeneity. Furthermore, detritivory may alter soil heterogeneity and indirectly modify herbivory. However, little is known about the interactive effects of soil nutrient heterogeneity, herbivory, and detritivory on plant growth.
   We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we grew the creeping, perennial herb Hydrocotyle vulgaris in two soil treatments (homogeneous and heterogeneous) with or without the aphid Myzus persicae and with or without the earthworm Eisenia fetida.
   H. vulgaris grew more in heterogeneous than in homogeneous soil, even though total nutrient availability was held constant, and less with than without aphids. The presence of aphids decreased plant growth less in both the high- and the low-nutrient patches in the heterogeneous soil treatment than in the medium-nutrient soil in the homogeneous soil treatment. Earthworms did not affect plant growth but survived better in soil with higher nutrients and in the presence of aphids.
   Herbivory can increase the positive effects of soil heterogeneity on clonal plants. However, results do not suggest that detritivory modifies effects of soil heterogeneity on plant growth.

AB The tropical dry forest is a typical lowland ecosystem that is threatened by a strong seasonality and anthropogenic pressures, which can affect the forest composition and structure. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of two agricultural matrices on the floristic composition and carbon storage in riparian forests. For this, five permanent plots (10 x 10 m each) were established and sampled in the forest interior and at the edge of two agricultural matrices (rice fields and pasture lands), in July 2013. All individuals with a diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 5 cm were recorded and measured, and the aboveground biomass was estimated with a general allometric model. Additionally, the importance value index (IVI), species richness and Alpha's diversity indexes were estimated; an analysis of variance and means comparison tests of Fisher LSD were also carried out. A total of 32 families, 21 genera and 45 species (29 and 33 species in pasture lands and rice fields, respectively) of trees in 0.2 ha were recorded. The most abundant and most ecologically important species were Oxandra espintana and Calliandra sp. (520 and 241 individuals/ha and 72 and 48 % of IVI, respectively). These forests presented a mean dominance of 33.9 m(2)/ha with no effect (P < 0.05) of forest location or agricultural matrix. The matrix of the landscape did not affect (P > 0.05) the Alpha diversity indexes. The biggest trees and greatest carbon storage were found in forests with pasture matrices when compared to rice fields (14.6 vs 13.4 cm of dbh and 72.9 vs 45.6 t C/ha, respectively). This research provides an understanding of the tree richness and composition and carbon storage of riparian forests in two agricultural matrices, which could be a basis for the establishment of silvopastoral systems with native species.

AB Neotropical wetlands comprise contrasting habitats with highly diverse avifauna, including herbivores, insectivores and carnivores, of both terrestrial and aquatic species. Therefore, comparisons between wetland bird assemblages based only on species identity may disregard turnover within ecological groups, and eclipse important variations between habitat types. We studied bird assemblages from mangrove and estuary habitat types from a coastal lagoon system in Oaxaca, Mexico. For this, we used 640 point counts to obtain data on bird species using those habitats between October 2009 and May 2012. We ascertained guild structure by classifying 139 species in a scalar hierarchy of two-levels: 17 key-resource guilds nested within seven trophic guilds. To evaluate variation in guild structure between habitat types, we contrasted richness and diversity across trophic guilds and tested for variation in abundance within key-resource guilds. We exposed a tendency of greater diversity within terrestrial guilds in mangrove and within aquatic guilds at the estuary. However, these differences were compensatory and neither richness nor diversity varied between habitat types in comparisons across the sets of trophic guilds. Parallel analyses at two hierarchical levels supported the theoretical prediction of greater change at lower levels. Herpetofauna, wood invertebrates, aquatic invertebrates and seeds emerged as dietary components that may explain the distribution of abundance in key-resource guilds. Although the guilds from mangrove and estuary produced comparable sets of richness and diversity values, the actual identity of guilds with high values varied between habitats. On the other hand, species abundance comparisons within guilds pinpointed specific associations with habitat types and this method represents a suitable strategy for identifying habitat preferences in complex wetland bird assemblages.

AB Landscape ecology is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary science, especially in Mexico. Despite its theoretical and applied relevance, no study to date has summarized the current and future state of the discipline in Mexico, especially in biological sciences. In this review, we identified: (i) regions, broad ecosystems and biological groups evaluated in Mexico; (ii) some applied, theoretical and conceptual contributions developed by Mexican authors; (iii) knowledge gaps and theoretical and methodological challenges, and (iv) some future perspectives. We found 472 scientific papers on the topic (1992-2016), mostly carried out with plants, mammals and birds in tropical ecosystems of Southeastern Mexico. Particularly notable are the evaluations on the patterns and causes of land use change and its consequences for biodiversity - studies of key relevance to identify potential threats and conservation strategies. Unfortunately, there is no empirical evidence for many of the theoretical models proposed to date. Furthermore, the geographic and taxonomic bias, and the lack of long-term, multi-scale and comparative studies have limited the progress of this discipline. Landscape ecology thus offers many challenges and research opportunities which, once served, will allow developing a science with higher predictive capacity to solve many environmental problems in Mexico and the world.

AB Non-compliance with conservation regulations is a key issue for protected area management effectiveness in most parts of the world. Effectively managing such behaviours requires a clear understanding of who is noncompliant, what is driving their non-compliance, and what the likely conservation consequences of compliant and non-compliant behaviours are. However, such information is notoriously difficult to obtain due to the (understandable) reluctance of transgressors to discuss illegal activities. Here, we adopt the Kiping social survey method to assess the drivers of non-compliance with resource use rules in two national parks (Catimbau and Chapada Diamantina) in Northeast Brazil. The method is therefore used to support the exploration of suitable solutions for coping with non-compliance on the ground. We found high levels of social acceptability for illegal behaviours in both Parks, though hunting and cutting trees inside the park were viewed more negatively by local residents. Respondents from both areas generally supported the collection of plants and firewood, especially by poor people and local residents. Acceptance of illegal activities was statistically correlated with awareness of park regulations in both parks and, in Catimbau NP, it was also prevalent among older, poorer and less educated residents. To deter non-compliance, a mix of interventions from more coercive measures to softer instruments are recommended, especially in Catimbau NP where the area is not patrolled and the close proximity of indigenous lands gives rise to land-and resource-use conflicts.

AB Invasive plant species generally reduce the abundance and diversity of local plant species, which may translate into alterations at higher tropic levels, such as arthropods. Due to the diverse functional roles of arthropods in the ecosystems, it is critical to understand how arthropod communities are affected by plant invasions. Here, we investigated the impact of the invasive ornamental herb Lupinus polyphyllus (Lindl.) on arthropod communities during its main flowering period in southwestern Finland over two years. The total number of arthropods was about 46% smaller at the invaded sites than at the uninvaded sites in both study years, and this difference was mainly due to a lower abundance of beetles, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and ants. However, the number of bumblebees (particularly Bombus lucorum) was about twice as high at invaded sites compared with uninvaded sites, even though bumblebee richness did not differ between sites. There was no statistically significant difference between invaded and uninvaded sites in the abundances of the other arthropod groups considered (Hymenoptera (excluding bumblebees and ants), Hemiptera, and Arachnida). In addition, L. polyphyllus affected the relative abundance of four arthropod groups, with the order Lepidoptera being less common at invaded sites than at uninvaded sites, while the opposite was true for bumblebees, Hemiptera, and Arachnida. Overall, these results demonstrate that the negative impact of L. polyphyllus on biodiversity goes beyond its own trophic level, suggesting that this species has the potential to alter the abundance of different arthropod groups and, consequently, the structure of arthropod communities at a large scale.

AB Deforestation threatens the earth's biodiversity and the ecosystem services upon which humans depend. Formal regulation is a key mechanism by which governments seek to protect forests. However, whether regulation can effectively protect remaining areas of the most threatened and most heavily cleared forests is unknown. We addressed this question using forest loss data for Queensland, Australia between 2000 and 2014 under existing vegetation clearing regulation (Vegetation Management Act 1999). This regulation is specifically designed to provide the greatest protection for threatened forest types that have already lost the greatest amount of their original extent. Importantly, enforcement and governance of this regulation is relatively strong allowing an assessment of regulation design. We applied path analysis to model the direct and indirect effects (mediated by variables representing deforestation pressure) of forest protection level on clearing rates. There was strong evidence for a decline in clearing rates over time, except of clearing for non-agricultural purposes. However, threatened forest types, which have already lost > 70% of their original extent and should have the greatest level of protection under the regulation, continue to be cleared 2.7-2.9 times faster than non-threatened forest types. There was also little evidence that the regulation has driven greater reductions over time in the clearing rates of threatened versus non-threatened forests types. There was much greater support for the indirect than direct effect of protection level. This is because protection level was correlated with variables associated with deforestation pressure, resulting in higher clearing rates for threatened compared to non-threatened forest types. We hypothesise that this arises because the additional protection afforded to threatened relative to non-threatened forests is insufficient to counter the continuing higher level of deforestation pressure on threatened forests. We argue that a potential solution is to build explicit targets for forest retention into regulation, below which no further forest loss is permitted. This could be combined with spatially targeted enforcement and incentive strategies where threats are highest.

AB Aim: Effective management of biodiversity in human-modified landscapes demands an understanding of how biotas respond to landscape features and management actions. Yet, biotic responses are complex and varied, resulting in numerous conceptual models being developed to aid interpretation and generalization. We examined the relevance of a range of conceptual landscape models that describe how the distribution of habitat influences species richness, abundance, occurrence and spatial dynamics, using an empirical data set of reptile and frog responses to agricultural management.
   Location: South-eastern New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods: We tested predictions developed from five conceptual landscape models using data collected from five land cover types and two grazing regimes.
   Results: At least one species responded in a manner consistent with each of the five conceptual models tested. Most species responded to gradients of environmental variables and species-specific responses were observed, in congruence with the Continuum model. No species were consistently congruent with predictions from concepts of Island Biogeography theory. One-third of responses were congruent with the Matrix Quality model. The main prediction tested from the Matrix Tolerance model was upheld by both reptile and frog species. The predictions of the Habitat Amount hypothesis were upheld by rare reptile abundance and richness, and one frog species.
   Main conclusions: Our study suggests that most conceptual models have some relevance to real-world systems and can be useful for interpreting biotic responses to landscape change and management. Importantly, no one model fully captured the range of species responses to our agricultural landscape, but the Continuum model, Matrix Quality model, Matrix Tolerance model and Habitat Amount hypothesis had complementary predictions that together appeared to explain most of the assemblage's responses to the management and environmental conditions of the agricultural landscape.

AB Savanna vegetation is variable, and predicting how water, nutrients, and chronic disturbances interact to determine vegetation structure in savannas represents a challenge.
   Here, we examined in situ interactions among rainfall, soils, grasses, fire, and elephants that determine tree layer responses to resource gradients in Kruger National Park in South Africa, using 363 long-term monitoring sites throughout the park.
   Grass biomass increased with rainfall and on nutrient-rich clay soils. Fire frequency, too, increased with rainfall. Conversely, tree density was greater on sandier soils, where water infiltrates more readily, and in areas where the maximum interval between fires was longer, irrespective of average fire frequency. Elephant density responded positively to tree density, but did not contribute significantly to decreasing tree density.
   Savanna vegetation structure was reasonably predictable, via a combination of rainfall (favoring grasses), soil (sandy soils favoring trees), and fire (limiting trees until a longer interval between fires allows them to establish). Explicit consideration of bottom-up and top-down interactions may thus contribute to a predictive understanding of savanna vegetation heterogeneity.

AB Radiocarbon dating shows that Cedrela trees from Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela form one ring per year but Cedrela trees from Suriname form two rings per year.
   Tropical tree rings have the potential to yield valuable ecological and climate information, on the condition that rings are annual and accurately dated. It is important to understand the factors controlling ring formation, since regional variation in these factors could cause trees in different regions to form tree rings at different times. Here, we use 'bomb-peak' radiocarbon (C-14) dating to test the periodicity of ring formation in Cedrela trees from four sites across tropical South America. We show that trees from Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela have reliably annual tree rings, while trees from Suriname regularly form two rings per year. This proves that while tree rings of a particular species may be demonstrably annual at one site, this does not imply that rings are formed annually in other locations. We explore possible drivers of variation in ring periodicity and find that Cedrela growth rhythms are most likely caused by precipitation seasonality, with a possible degree of genetic control. Therefore, tree-ring studies undertaken at new locations in the tropics require independent validation of the annual nature of tree rings, irrespective of how the studied species behaves in other locations.

AB Human induced savannas in subtropical regions are often favored by small-holder farmers for livestock production and extraction of wood or non-wood products. Frequent burning and grazing are required to maintain the savanna vegetation structure. However, in conservation areas, fire suppression is promoted to avoid wild-fires; whereas domestic livestock grazing is considered a strong interfering factor for tree establishment, due to trampling and browsing. In tropical forests which were converted to savannas, competitive exotic grasses have often replaced the native grasses. Where exotic grasses are present, aboveground biomass accumulation and thus man-induced fire risk are high and potentially undermine tree recruitment. On the long-term, the savanna state may shift into a grass-dominated state with little tree cover, generating unfavorable conditions from a livelihood perspective. We examined this problem in a human-induced pine savanna in the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. Smallholder farmers highly valued this savanna for both livestock production and resin extraction from the fire resistant pine Pinus oocarpa. However, fire suppression and the presence of exotic grasses are reducing the tree recruitment. The main research question was to what degree can cattle grazing replace fire in its role of biomass removal and thereby stimulate pine recruitment and maintain the desired savanna state. We determined current savanna extension in the region and interviewed farmers to reconstruct past savannazation processes and expansion of exotic grasses. We related adult species-specific tree density to the herbaceous-grass cover, and pine and oak seedling and sapling densities to understory vegetation cover, canopy closure, and cattle grazing history. Finally, a field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of livestock grazing on survival and growth of planted pine saplings. The savanna currently covers 20% of the study site; it is the result of past slash-and-burn agriculture and selective logging, which have favored the expansion of several exotic grass species. In savannas where exotic grasses are abundant, sapling density was lower compared to sites with a native grass cover. While livestock grazing seemed to increase pine seedling density likely as a consequence of reduced grass cover, pine sapling survival however, was significantly reduced by livestock trampling. By seeking a balance between the livestock's benefits and adverse effects on pine recruitment, farmers may develop an integrated management system adapted to their specific biotic rangeland conditions. It should allow forage production, while controlling the negative effects of exotic grasses on pine recruitment, thus maintaining a productive pine savanna system.

AB In addition to causing physical degradation and nutrient depletion, erosion of cultivated soils in the Amazon affects aquatic ecosystems through the release of natural soil mercury (Hg) towards lakes and rivers. While traditional agriculture is generally cited as being among the main causes of soil erosion, agroforestry practices are increasingly appreciated for soil conservation. This study was carried out in family farms of the rural Tapajos region (Brazil) and aimed at evaluating soil erosion and associated Hg release for three land uses. Soils, runoff water and eroded sediments were collected at three sites representing a land cover gradient: a recently burnt short-cycle cropping system (SCC), a 2-year-old agroforestry system (AFS) and a mature forest (F). At each site, two PVC soil erosion plots (each composed of three 2 x 5 m isolated subplots) were implemented on steep and moderate slopes respectively. Sampling was done after each of the 20 rain events that occurred during a 1-month study period, in the peak of the 2011 rain season. Runoff volume and rate, as well as eroded soil particles with their Hg and cation concentrations were determined. Total Hg and cation losses were then calculated for each subplot. Erosion processes were dominated by land use type over rainfall or soil slope. Eroded soil particles, as well as the amount of Hg and cations (CaMgK) mobilized at the AFS site were similar to those at the F site, but significantly lower than those at the SCC site (p < 0.0001). Erosion reduction at the AFS site was mainly attributed to the ground cover plants characterizing the recently established system. Moreover, edaphic change throughout AFS and F soil profiles differed from the SCC site. At the latter site, losses of fine particles and Hg were enhanced towards soil surface, while they were less pronounced at the other sites. This study shows that agroforestry systems, even in their early stages of implementation, are characterized by low erosion levels resembling those of local forest environments, thus contributing to the maintenance of soil integrity and to the reduction of Hg and nutrient mobility.

AB Fire activity plays an important role in the past, present and future of Earth system behavior. Monitoring and assessing spatial and temporal fire dynamics have a fundamental relevance in the understanding of ecological processes and the human impacts on different landscapes and multiple spatial scales. This work analyzes the spatio-temporal distribution of burned areas in one of the biggest savanna vegetation enclaves in the southern Brazilian Amazon, from 2000 to 2016, deriving information from multiple remote sensing data sources (Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance, TRMM pluviometry and Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers). A fire scars database with 30m spatial resolution was generated using a Landsat time series. MODIS daily surface reflectance was used for accurate dating of the fire scars. TRMM pluviometry data were analyzed to dynamically establish time limits of the yearly dry season and burning periods. Burned area extent, frequency and recurrence were quantified comparing the results annually/seasonally. Additionally, Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers were used to analyze fire incidence over different types of tree cover domains. In the last seventeen years, 1.03 million ha were burned within the study area, distributed across 1432 fire occurrences, highlighting 2005, 2010 and 2014 as the most affected years. Middle dry season fires represent 86.21% of the total burned areas and 32.05% of fire occurrences, affecting larger amount of higher density tree surfaces than other burning periods. The results provide new insights into the analysis of burned areas of the neotropical savannas, spatially and statistically reinforcing important aspects linked to the seasonality patterns of fire incidence in this landscape.

AB We analysed the flora of 46 forest inventory plots (25 m x 100 m) in old growth forests from the Amazonian region to identify the role of environmental (topographic) and spatial variables (obtained using PCNM, Principal Coordinates of Neighbourhood Matrix analysis) for common and rare species. For the analyses, we used multiple partial regression to partition the specific effects of the topographic and spatial variables on the univariate data (standardised richness, total abundance and total biomass) and partial RDA (Redundancy Analysis) to partition these effects on composition (multivariate data) based on incidence, abundance and biomass. The different attributes (richness, abundance, biomass and composition based on incidence, abundance and biomass) used to study this metacommunity responded differently to environmental and spatial processes. Considering standardised richness, total abundance (univariate) and composition based on biomass, the results for common species differed from those obtained for all species. On the other hand, for total biomass (univariate) and for compositions based on incidence and abundance, there was a correspondence between the data obtained for the total community and for common species. Our data also show that in general, environmental and/ or spatial components are important to explain the variability in tree communities for total and common species. However, with the exception of the total abundance, the environmental and spatial variables measured were insufficient to explain the attributes of the communities of rare species. These results indicate that predicting the attributes of rare tree species communities based on environmental and spatial variables is a substantial challenge. As the spatial component was relevant for several community attributes, our results demonstrate the importance of using a metacommunities approach when attempting to understand the main ecological processes underlying the diversity of tropical forest communities.

AB Understanding the spatial distribution of tree species in subtropical evergreen-deciduous broadleaf karst forest is fundamental to studying species coexistence and karst species diversity. Here, complete spatial randomness and heterogeneous Poisson process models were used to analyze the spatial distribution patterns of 146 species with at least one individual per ha in a 25-ha plot in southwest China. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and the torus-translation test (TTT) to explain the distributions of observed species. Our results show that an aggregated distribution was the dominant pattern in Mulun karst forests; the percentage and intensity of aggregated decreased with increasing spatial scale, abundance, mean diameter at breast height (DBH), and maximum DBH. Rare species were more aggregated than intermediately abundant and abundant species. However, functional traits (e.g., growth form and phenological guild) had no significant effects on the distributions of species. The CCA revealed that the four analyzed topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, and convexity) had significant influences on species distributions. The TTT showed that not all species have habitat preferences and that 68.5% (100 out of 146 species) show a strongly positive or negative association with at least one habitat. Most species were inclined to grow on slopes and hilltops.

AB In the following paper, we use robust optimization to calculate portfolios of Chilean forest stands which minimize the greatest underperformance among all considered ecosystem services (ES) and biodiversity. Forest experts were asked to score the six most important ES indicators and biodiversity for forest stands with either exotic or native tree species. Average scores and their variation were used to form an optimal forest portfolio (proportions of the five stand types). Quantitative indicators of ES were used to calculate the reference portfolio. Portfolios based on expert opinions (49% Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 51% native Nothofagus and mixed Pseudotsuga) did not differ significantly from portfolios based on quantitative indicators (51% Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 49% Nothofagus, mixed Pseudotsuga and Acacia). Both portfolios offer good protection against low achievement levels and prevent the degradation of important ES and biodiversity, while pure stands showed low achievement levels for specific ES. We conclude that integrating expert knowledge into forest planning may well support considering ES and biodiversity. Forest owners in the Mediterranean region, of Chile should be encouraged to integrate native Nothofagus species into their forest portfolios to better provide for multiple ES and the conservation of biodiversity.

AB The creation of baseline climate series is the first step towards the analysis of climate characteristics and behaviour in any region of the world. The objective of this article is to construct homogeneous precipitation series for the period 1982-2011, for the study of its spatial distribution and temporal evolution (dynamics) in the Province of Santa Elena, most occidental region of continental Ecuador. Data from 22 rainfall stations at the study location enabled the construction of five precipitation series using statistical and correlation techniques to complete information gaps. Precipitations present irregular temporal and spatial variation throughout the year, with a wet season between December and May. The December-January-February (DJF) and March-April-May (MAM) trimesters account for 59.7 and 39.1 of annual rainfall. The dry season, between June and November, presents almost zero rainfall. Small precipitations were also identified in coastal, topographically low areas, with precipitations more frequent events towards the continental region. Throughout the years, there has been high variability in precipitations, with the occurrence of wet-dry episodes associated with the El Nino-La Nina' events, which were correlated with the sea surface temperature values of the Oceanic Nino Index. Trend analysis detected an average increase in rainfall of 2.1 mmyear(-1) in the Province, however, the trimestral rates oscillated between 2.2 and 4.3 mmquart(-1). The construction of these precipitation series has been an important step for the spatial-temporal characterization of this peculiar tropical climate region that presents arid characteristics.

AB Linear disturbances such as roads are common in areas of intensive resource development. When roads cross peatlands, they can interrupt natural hydrologic processes and alter vegetation composition and structure. Hydrological changes to a poor fen impacted by a road in northeastern Alberta were evaluated using tree rings of living and dead black spruce trees. All trees that were less than 83.5 cm above the road's single culvert died in 1989. The temporal uniformity of dieback suggested that a single inundation event caused the trees to drown. The inundation likely was caused by a culvert blocked by beavers, and indicates the critical role of hydrologic patterns and processes for controlling vegetation composition, including tree growth patterns and mortality. The disturbance of peatlands by roads could be reduced or eliminated by improving road designs to include multiple culverts that cannot easily be blocked by debris or beavers, or underdrain systems that create more natural surface and ground water flow patterns. In addition, regular inspection and maintenance could limit the negative effects of blocked point locations that can be dammed by beavers.

AB Subsistence hunting of neotropical birds is common and widespread in the tropical forests of Latin America. Although its sustainability under different scenarios is subject to debate, hunting has already contributed to the decline and local extirpation of several taxa and is considered to be a significant threat to a range of large-bodied species. Gaining a better understanding of the variability of hunting patterns, as well as the factors that can potentially be used to predict them, is important if we are to develop conservation strategies that target the species most likely to be experiencing declines. In this article, we examine the avian hunting profiles of 65 communities in the neotropics. We describe their variability and look at the relationship between a hunting profile and (a) its geographical location, (b) the community's age, (c) the community's population size, and (d) the year in which the survey was carried out. We find that there is a significant but weak relationship between a community's geographic location and the composition of its bird hunting profile, and that prey profiles can be considerably different even among close neighbors. We found no relationship between a community's age or size and the mean biomass of bird prey hunted. Our results challenge the assumption that older and larger settlements have a predictable impact upon avian prey communities and suggest that cultural preferences or the starting availability of prey species can change rapidly over short distances.

AB The Pantanal is one of the world's largest tropical wetland areas and harbors high mammal biomass. There is no formal list of dung beetle species, and studies on their functional roles have never being carried out in Pantanal. In this study, we identified dung beetle species occurring in the north Pantanal region (Pocone sub-region, Brazil) and studied their functional organization, by measuring morphological, behavioral land phenological traits. We collected 25,278 individuals belonging to 17 genera and 35 species. We identified eight functional groups in the habitat: Noturnal Telecoprids, Diurnal Telecoprids, Nesting Endocoprids, Small Nonrollers, Nocturnal Nester Paracoprids, Big Nesters Paracoprids, Non Nesters Paracoprids and Diurnal Nesters Paracoprids. The functional groups were defined mostly by two reproductive traits and two niche differentiation traits related to the use of fecal resources. This high diversification of both species and functional roles shows the importance of the group in a habitat with strong variation in availability of habitat and resources.

AB Effects caused by human management and natural disturbances as well as by ecological mechanisms such as those described, for example, by the Janzen-Connell and the herd immunity hypotheses play an important role in maintaining species diversity. These processes are often accompanied by local size-hierarchy effects and as a likely consequence of them we hypothesised that large plants generally have a tendency to show high species mingling, where plants and their nearest neighbours are heterospecific. To carry out a first benchmark study in forests from different parts of Europe, Africa and North America, we selected spatial data from twelve forest ecosystems and analysed the mingling situation based on an index of spatial species mingling. Using stem diameter at breast height and stem diameter differentiation among the nearest neighbours as explanatory variables we then applied logistic regression to explain mingling probability. Overall we found significant support for the expectation that large trees and trees growing at low local densities often (75% of all analysed forest stands) have indeed a tendency towards high species mingling. This supports our expectation that the tendency of larger trees towards high species mingling generally is either a consequence of disturbances/forest management or of the aforementioned ecological processes, although a few forest stands also deviated from the expected pattern. We also found that size differentiation and species mingling are strongly related in local neighbourhoods. Thus the results of our study strongly support the view that local species richness promotes local size hierarchy irrespective of climate zone. This leads to situations where in local neighbourhoods with large size diversity there is also high mingling and vice versa. This allows conservation to focus on maintaining or improving one diversity aspect, e.g. size diversity, whilst obtaining the other, e.g. species mingling, as a byproduct.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance has led to the loss of biodiversity, altering ecosystem processes and decreasing stability. Top predators have been disproportionately affected by this degradation. Functional complementarity via niche overlap is one mechanism by which ecosystem processes may be maintained in the absence of a top predator. Aquatic ecosystems have shown a decline in top predators such as salmonids, but few studies have addressed the functional complementarity of alternative predators. In beaver ponds in the western U.S., Western Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium) often become the top aquatic predator in the absence of fish, yet no previous studies have explored their trophic ecology. We evaluated this knowledge gap and used criteria including population size structure, diet, and stable isotope analysis to investigate the functional complementarity of a degradation tolerant species, the Arizona Tiger Salamander (A. m. nebulosum), compared to the native but extirpated salmonid top predator, Colorado River Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus). Field data for tiger salamanders and published accounts of various salmonid species suggested that, although both species are characterized by size-structured populations with ontogenetic shifts in a generalist diet, the trophic position of A. m. nebulosum is lower than reported values for large salmonids. This lower trophic positioning suggests that salamanders are likely to be functionally complementary with only the smallest size classes of salmonids. These results support previous work suggesting that functional complementarity exists under a narrow range of environmental conditions, which may limit the degree to which degradation-tolerant species can maintain communities.

AB As an important freshwater lake and wetland area with international significance in biodiversity conservation, Poyang Lake is facing increasing pressure from human activities, including prescribed fire. In the present study, two representative wetland plants from Poyang Lake (Carex cinerascens and Artemisia selengensis) were selected to determine their in situ regeneration success following a prescribed winter fire. Monitoring of plant growth and species composition was carried out monthly for one year following burn treatments. Results showed that significantly higher densities of both C. cinerascens and A. selengensis were observed in the spring. Moreover, the prescribed fire had little influence on the aboveground and belowground biomasses of C. cinerascens, whereas a significant effect on A. selengensis was observed. A smaller difference in dominance values of constructive species was detected between burned and unburned plots. However, a significant increase in biodiversity was found within the burned A. selengensis community in spring. In addition, there was little difference in plant traits and community characters found between burned and unburned plots after the flooding season. Our findings suggest that the water regime is the main driving factor in regulating the ecological process of Poyang Lake, and a single prescribed fire was not sufficient to change the plant community structure, although it did have a significant influence on biomass and species composition in the season following the fire.

AB Bipolar disjunct distributions are a fascinating biogeographic pattern exhibited by about 30 vascular plants, whose populations reach very high latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres. In this review, we first propose a new framework for the definition of bipolar disjunctions and then reformulate a list of guiding principles to consider how to study bipolar species. Vicariance and convergent evolution hypotheses have been argued to explain the origin of this fragmented distribution pattern, but we show here that they can be rejected for all bipolar species, except for Carex microglochin. Instead, human introduction and dispersal (either direct or by mountain-hopping)-facilitated by standard and nonstandard vectors-are the most likely explanations for the origin of bipolar plant disjunctions. Successful establishment after dispersal is key for colonization of the disjunct areas and appear to be related to both intrinsic (e.g., self-compatibility) and extrinsic (mutualistic and antagonistic interactions) characteristics. Most studies on plant bipolar disjunctions have been conducted in Carex (Cyperaceae), the genus of vascular plants with the largest number of bipolar species. We found a predominant north-tosouth direction of dispersal, with an estimated time of diversification in agreement with major cooling events during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Bipolar Carex species do not seem to depend on specialized traits for long-distance dispersal and could have dispersed through one or multiple stochastic events, with birds as the most likely dispersal vector.

TI Niche shifts after long-distance dispersal events in bipolar sedges

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Bipolar species represent the greatest biogeographical disjunction on Earth, raising many questions about the colonization and adaptive processes behind such striking distribution. We investigated climatic niche differences of five Carex bipolar species in North and South America to assess niche shifts between these two regions. Moreover, we assessed potential distribution changes with future climate change.
   METHODS: We used 1202 presence data points from herbarium specimens and 19 bioclimatic variables to assess climatic niche differences and potential distributions among the five species using ordination methods and Maxent.
   KEY RESULTS: The niche overlap analyses showed low levels of niche filling and high climatic niche expansion between North and South America. Carex macloviana and C. maritima showed the greatest niche expansion (60% and 96%, respectively), followed by C. magellanica (45%) and C. microglochin (39%). Only C. canescens did not colonize new environments (niche expansion = 0.2%). In contrast, all species but C. magellanica had niche filling that was <40%; hence, they are absent in the south from many environments they inhabit in North America. Climate change will push all species toward higher latitudes and elevation, reducing the availability of suitable environments.
   CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of South America seems to have involved frequent climatic niche shifts. Most species have colonized new environments from those occupied in the North. Observed niche shifts appear congruent with time since colonization and with current genetic structure within species. In these cold-dwelling species, climate change will most likely decrease their suitable environments in the future.

AB Regeneration niches for tree seedlings are defined as possessing the biotic and abiotic requirements to successfully replace adults. However, two critical discrepancies obscure our understanding of the role of regeneration niches in forest community assembly: a weak association between seedling assemblages and environmental factors, and an uncoupling between seedling and adult-tree assemblages. However, understory plants, which may interact with microenvironments and seedlings, may be a better spatial descriptor of regeneration habitats. To test this, the spatial variations of seedling assemblages in a montane cloud forest of Taiwan were analyzed in terms of their association with neighborhood assemblages of understory plants, the shrub layer, and overstory trees, as well as environmental variables. We found that the understory plant spatial structure contributed most in explaining spatial variations of the seedling assemblages (especially for widespread Lauraceae and patchy Fagaceae) and facilitated the identification of patches of different regeneration habitats for specific seedling assemblages. Moreover, among these regeneration patches, tall herbs affected seedling density and diversity differently. We found segregation between tall herbs and Lauraceae seedlings, indicating that tall herbs shape seedling assemblages and uncouple the association between seedling and adult stages. However, positive covariations between seedlings/tall herbs and between seedlings/adults were found for Fagaceae and Pentaphylacaceae in different regeneration patches, suggesting that positive, neighboring effects and dispersal limitation may cause the patchy distribution of seedling assemblages and affect their coupling with adults. Thus, the understory plant spatial structure shapes seedling assemblages and provides a better link to spatial associations with regeneration habitats.

AB In semi-arid savannas, abandoned cattle (Bos taurus) enclosures or kraals have been demonstrated to be nutrient-hotspots for large herbivores. In this study, we examined the interaction between herbivory and forage quality, structure and diversity at 12 kraals (abandoned for 22 years) paired with savanna control plots in Save Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe. Plant diversity was not different between sites. Herbaceous cover was higher and woody species density lower on abandoned kraals than control plots. Furthermore, abandoned kraals had higher herbaceous productivity and foliar nutrient concentration for grasses than forbs. The abandoned kraals had higher concentration of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), organic carbon (C) compared with control plots and a slightly acidic pH. Grasses were grazed more than forbs on nutrient-rich abandoned kraals. Only herbaceous biomass for grasses had a significant influence on the interaction between plants and herbivory. No clear relationships were observed between forage quality and herbivory and plant species diversity. Abandoned kraals provide patches of nutrient-rich forage, increasing savanna heterogeneity and in turn influence grazing patterns of large herbivores, and therefore influence ecosystem functioning. A conservation monitoring programme is recommended on such nutrient-rich patches as they serve as foraging-hotspots for herbivores in a dystrophic African semi-arid savanna.

AB Protected areas are a major approach for conserving ecosystem services globally. Effective conservation in protected areas must integrate human livelihoods into the design and management of conservation. Although ecosystem services can contribute to reducing local peoples costs of conservation, exploitation of ecosystem services often results in ecosystem degradation. One important ecosystem service is fuelwood, which is used by > 2.5 billion people worldwide. Conservation policy design needs information on the demand for and values of fuelwood that can be extracted without compromising conservation goals of protected areas. We estimated local peoples willingness to pay (WTP) for access to fuelwood in China's Wolong Nature Reserve, which is undergoing a net increase in forest area. Forest recovery in Wolong resulted from both the protection of the reserve and conservation under China's Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP). The estimated mean WTP for access to fuelwood accounted for about 21% of the payment under the NFCP. Among household characteristics, the cultural practice of cooking pig fodder, for which there were poor substitutes, played a major role in driving the demand for fuelwood. Although fuelwood collection can be prevented through increased conservation payments, fuelwood collection under forest management that fulfills conservation goals of the reserve can substantially reduce the costs of conservation. In addition, many other ecosystem services are also important to local people's livelihoods, and the combined values of different ecosystem services can substantially lower the costs of effective conservation in Wolong and many other protected areas around the world.

AB Despite expanding interest in ecosystem service research over the past three decades, in-depth understanding of the contribution of forests and trees to food production and livelihoods remains limited. This review synthesizes the current evidence base examining the contribution of forest and trees to agricultural production and livelihoods in the tropics, where production often occurs within complex land use mosaics that are increasingly subjected to concomitant climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Using systematic review methodology we found 74 studies investigating the effect of forest or tree-based ecosystem service provision on a range of outcomes such as crop yield, biomass, soil fertility, and income. Our findings suggest that when incorporating forests and trees within an appropriate and contextualized natural resource management strategy, there is potential to maintain, and in some cases, enhance yields comparable to solely monoculture systems. Furthermore, this review has illustrated the potential of achieving net livelihood gains through integrating trees on farms, providing rural farmers with additional income sources, and greater resilience strategies to adapt to market or climatic shocks. However, we also identify significant gaps in the current knowledge that demonstrate a need for larger-scale, longer term research to better understand the contribution of forest and trees within the broader landscape and their associated impacts on livelihoods and food production systems.
