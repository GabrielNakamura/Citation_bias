AB Although cultivated and degraded lands outnumber natural ecosystems in many regions of the world, there are relatively few studies focusing on their biodiversity. Here, we investigated the drosophilid assemblages recorded in eight Brazilian fig plantations and discussed probable invasive species among the identified fauna. Each plantation was sampled monthly, from September 2010 to August 2011, using five drosophilid retention traps arranged in an 80-m transect. The 125,428 drosophilids captured represent 52 nominal and 10 unidentified species belonging to eight genera: Diathoneura Duda, Drosophila Fallen, Neotanygastrella Duda, Rhinoleucophenga Hendel, Scaptodrosophila Duda, Scaptomyza Hardy, Zaprionus Coquillett, and Zygothrica Wiedemann. Besides this rich diversity, our samples were dominated by widespread generalists representing exotic and neotropical species: Zaprionus indianus Gupta, Drosophila simulans Sturtevant, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis (Duda), Drosophila sturtevanti Duda, Drosophila mercatorum Patterson and Wheeler, Drosophila cardini Sturtevant, and Drosophila buzzatii Patterson and Wheeler. These species should be carefully monitored, especially in the first half of the year, to prevent environmental and economic losses due to their eventual introduction in new areas.

AB Rainfall, fire and competition are emphasized as determinants of the density and basal area of woody vegetation in savanna. The semi-arid savannas of Australia have substantial multi-year rainfall deficits and insufficient grass fuel to carry annual fire in contrast to the mesic savannas in more northern regions. This study investigates the influence of rainfall deficit and excess, fire and woody competition on the population dynamics of a dominant tree in a semi-arid savanna. All individuals of Eucalyptus melanophloia were mapped and monitored in three, 1-ha plots over an 8.5year period encompassing wet and dry periods. The plots were unburnt, burnt once and burnt twice. A competition index incorporating the size and distance of neighbours to target individuals was determined. Supplementary studies examined seedling recruitment and the transition of juvenile trees into the sapling layer. Mortality of burnt seedlings was related to lignotuber area but the majority of seedlings are fire resistant within 12months of germination. Most of the juveniles (1cm dbh) of E.melanophloia either died in the dry period or persisted as juveniles throughout 8.5years of monitoring. Mortality of juveniles was positively related to woody competition and was higher in the dry period than the wet period. The transition of juveniles to a larger size class occurred at extremely low rates, and a subsidiary study along a clearing boundary suggests release from woody competition allows transition into the sapling layer. From three fires the highest proportion of saplings (1-10cm dbh) reduced to juveniles was only 5.6% suggesting rates of top-kill' of E.melanophloia as a result of fire are relatively low. Girth growth was enhanced in wet years, particularly for larger trees (>10cm dbh), but all trees regardless of size or woody competition levels are vulnerable to drought-induced mortality. Overall the results suggest that variations in rainfall, especially drought-induced mortality, have a much stronger influence on the tree demographics of E.melanophloia in a semi-arid savanna of north-eastern Australia than fire.

AB Soil patchiness is a key feature of arid rangelands. As root proliferation contributes to soil exploration and resource uptake, it is ecologically relevant to understand how species respond to soil heterogeneity and coexist. Campbell et al.'s influential 1991 hypothesis proposes that dominant species deploy root systems (scale) that maximize soil volume explored. Instead, subordinate species show accurate root systems that exclusively proliferate in nutrient-rich patches (precision). After many experiments under controlled conditions, the generality of this hypothesis has been questioned but a field perspective is necessary to increase realism in the conceptual framework. We worked with a guild of perennial graminoid species inside a grazing exclosure in an arid Patagonian steppe, a model system for ecological studies in arid rangelands for four decades. We buried root traps in bare ground patches with sieved soil, with or without a pulse of nitrogen addition, to measure specific root biomass and precision at 6 and 18months after burial. We also estimated scale (root density) in naturally established plants, and root decomposition in litter bags. Several species grew in root traps. Dominant species showed the highest root biomass (in both harvests) and scale. Subordinate species grew more frequently with nitrogen addition and showed lower biomass and scale. Similar total root biomass was found with and without nitrogen addition. Species differed in root decomposition, but correcting species biomass by decomposition did not change our conclusions. We did not find a relation between scale and precision, indicating that Campbell's hypothesis is probably not supported in this Patagonian steppe. Soil resource acquisition differences probably do not utterly explain the coexistence of dominant and subordinate species because the steppe is also affected by large herbivore grazing. We propose that root proliferation in this steppe is the result of the interaction between individual density in the community and specific root growth rates.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation affect the structure and functioning of forested ecosystems worldwide, yet we lack an understanding of how species respond to environmental changes. Here, we examined reproductive success and seedling performance of Poulsenia armata (Moraceae) in continuous and fragmented forests of Los Tuxtlas, southern Mexico. We further investigated how maternal habitat and soil conditions manifested in the seedling stage. We determined seed quality and seedling performance by combining isotopic analyses in seed quality with field observations of P. armata fruit production and a common-garden experiment. Soil conditions in forest fragments negatively impacted P. armata reproductive success. Trees of P. armata in forest fragments were smaller in size and produced fewer fruits and smaller seeds with lower quality compared with trees from the continuous forest. The combined effects of maternal habitat and soil conditions determined seedling survival and growth of this tropical tree. Notably, seedlings had restricted plasticity for biomass allocation to roots, limiting the capacity of fragmented populations to compensate for the initial low N content in seeds. Trees in forest fragments at Los Tuxtlas produced offspring competitively inferior and potentially less resilient than counterparts in continuous forest, jeopardizing future persistence of this late-successional tree species.

AB Large-bodied frugivorous birds play an important role in dispersing large-sized seeds in Neotropical rain forests, thereby maintaining tree species richness and diversity. Conversion of contiguous forest land to forest fragments is thought to be driving population declines in large-bodied frugivores, but the mechanistic drivers of this decline remain poorly understood. To assess the importance of fragment-level versus local landscape attributes in influencing the species richness of large-bodied (>100 g) frugivorous birds, we surveyed 15 focal species in 22 forest fragments (2.7 to 33.6 ha, avg. = 16.0 ha) in northwest Ecuador in 2014. Fragment habitat variables included density of large trees, canopy openness and height, and fragment size; landscape variables included elevation and the proportion of tree cover within a 1 km radius of each fragment. At both the individual species level, and across the community of 12 species of avian frugivore we detected, there was higher richness and probability of presence in fragments with more tree cover on surrounding land. This tendency was particularly pronounced among some endangered species. These findings corroborate the idea that partially forested land surrounding fragments may effectively increase the suitable habitat for forest-dwelling frugivorous birds in fragmented landscapes. These results can help guide conservation priorities within fragmented landscapes, with particular reference to retaining trees and reforesting to attain high levels of tree cover in areas between forest patches.

AB Post-dispersal seed agents of mortality include pathogens, invertebrates, and vertebrates, which may shape tropical tree populations and communities. In this study I experimentally evaluated Dipteryx alata endocarp removal both in the interior and edge of Cerrado vegetation. Specifically, I simulated primary dispersion of endocarps by bats and evaluated secondary removal intensity according to habitat, season, and endocarp number. This study was developed in the Pombo Natural Municipal Park, a large Cerrado remnant with an area of 9,000 ha, located in the Western Brazil. In each of the two habitat types, I set down 45 points in which D. alata piles of 1, 3, 7, 15, and 40 endocarps were positioned. On average, endocarp removal in the interior was higher than in the edge, so that the intensity of removal varied from positive density-dependent (interior: rains), to negative density-dependent (edge: both seasons). Also, at both habitat types and seasons non removed endocarps were intensely attacked by fungus. Indeed, seed mortality by fungus infestation was positive density-dependent. The results indicate high propensity of endocarps to escape from removal in the edge, in principle, a defaunated area. As Dipteryx species strongly rely on caviomorph rodents for their dispersal, the scarcity of these vectors might reduce recruitment chances of D. alata in remnants of Cerrado. This imply in future changes in the vegetation structure from the edge to the interior towards low tree diversity.

AB Forest dynamic models predict the current and future states of ecosystems and are a nexus between physiological processes and empirical data, forest plot inventories and remote-sensing information. The problem of biodiversity representation in these models has long been an impediment to a detailed understanding of ecosystem processes. This challenge is amplified in species-rich and high-carbon tropical forests. Here we describe an individual-based and spatially explicit forest growth simulator, TROLL, that integrates recent advances in plant physiology. Processes (carbon assimilation, allocation, reproduction, and mortality) are linked to species-specific functional traits, and the model was parameterized for an Amazonian tropical rainforest. We simulated a forest regeneration experiment from bare soil, and we validated it against observations at our sites. Simulated forest regeneration compared well with observations for stem densities, gross primary productivity, aboveground biomass, and floristic composition. After 500years of regrowth, the simulated forest displayed structural characteristics similar to observations (e.g., leaf area index and trunk diameter distribution). We then assessed the model's sensitivity to a number of key model parameters: light extinction coefficient and carbon quantum yield, and to a lesser extent mortality rate, and carbon allocation, all influenced ecosystem features. To illustrate the potential of the approach, we tested whether variation in species richness and composition influenced ecosystem properties. Overall, species richness had a positive effect on ecosystem processes, but this effect was controlled by the identity of species rather by richness per se. Also, functional trait community means had a stronger effect than functional diversity on ecosystem processes. TROLL should be applicable to many tropical forests sites, and data requirement is tailored to ongoing trait collection efforts. Such a model should foster the dialogue between ecology and the vegetation modeling community, help improve the predictive power of models, and eventually better inform policy choices.

AB Humid tropical forests are major players in the global carbon cycle, despite evidence that cations (rock-derived, positively charged ions) can limit or co-limit net primary productivity (NPP). In mature forests, tight cation cycling, i.e., without leaching losses, could maintain cation stocks on site. That mechanism does not explain how regenerating tropical secondary forest trees start from seeds and accrue large cation stocks in biomass, when growing on soils depleted in available cations. We propose a new mechanism that links tree species' traits to soil cation availability via impacts on soil pH, a master biogeochemical driver. We tested plot-level effects of tree species on soil pH, soil extractable cations, and cation accrual in biomass in a unique, 25-yr-old, randomized-complete-block experiment in which climate, soil, and previous land-use history were similar across four native tree species grown in mono-dominant plantations in Costa Rica. Surface-soil pH in this Oxisol, initially 4.52 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE (standard error)), declined to 4.14 +/- 0.02 under Pentaclethra macroloba, a nodulated legume, and increased to 4.71 +/- 0.08 under Vochysia guatemalensis, an aluminum (Al) accumulator. The range in pH corresponds to a five-fold difference in proton concentrations, which is sufficient to alter dispersion of organo-mineral colloids. Cation stocks in biomass differed across species by 1.7-, 1.9-, 2.8-, 2.9-, 3.1-, 3.5-, and 17.2-fold for iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), strontium (Sr), magnesium (Mg), and Al, respectively. Differential acquisition of available soil cations was an unlikely explanation for measured differences among species because changes in extractable soil cation stocks were unrelated to cation accrual in biomass. Soil pH and biomass cation stocks were highly correlated, however. By our proposed conceptual framework, species traits that strongly increase proton concentrations and decrease pH in soil, e.g., support of N fixation, increase colloid aggregation, reducing cation availability. Traits that reduce soil protons and increase pH, e.g., Al+3 accumulation, disperse colloids, thereby releasing cations occluded during pedogenesis. This highlights a novel biogeochemical role for the Al-accumulation trait, i.e., liberation of occluded soil cations. Further studies would clarify effects of soil pH on cation supply via colloid dispersion, and its importance for nutrient acquisition in cation-depleted soils.

AB Treefall gaps have long been a central feature of discussions about the maintenance of tree diversity in both temperate and tropical forests. Gaps expose parts of the forest floor to direct sunlight and create a distinctive microenvironment that can favor the recruitment into the community of so-called gap pioneers. This traditional view enjoys strong empirical support, yet has been cast into doubt by a much-cited article claiming that gaps are inherently "neutral" in their contribution to forest dynamics. We present concurrent data on seedfall and sapling recruitment into gaps vs. under a vertically structured canopy in an Amazonian floodplain forest in Peru. Our results strongly uphold the view of gaps as important generators of tree diversity. Our methods differed significantly from those employed by the neutralist group and can explain the contrasting outcomes. We found that seedfall into gaps differs both quantitatively and qualitatively from that falling under a multi-tiered canopy, being greatly enriched in wind-dispersed and autochorus species and sharply deficient in all types of zoochorous seeds. Despite a reduced input of zoochorous seeds, zoochorous species made up 79% of saplings recruiting into gaps, whereas wind-dispersed species made up only 1%. Cohorts of saplings recruiting into gaps are less diverse than those recruiting under a closed canopy (Fisher's alpha = 40 vs. 100) and compositionally distinct, containing many light-demanding species that rarely, if ever, recruit under shaded conditions. Saplings recruiting into gaps appear to represent a variable mix of shade-tolerant survivors of the initiating treefall and sun-demanding species that germinate subsequently.

AB Savannas are characterized by the coexistence of trees and flammable grasses. Yet, tree-grass coexistence has been labeled as paradoxical-how do these two functional groups coexist over such an extensive area, despite being generally predisposed to excluding each other? For instance, many trees develop dense canopies that limit grass growth, and many grasses facilitate frequent/intense fires, increasing tree mortality. This study revisits tree-grass coexistence with a model of hierarchical competition between pyrogenic grasses, "forest trees" adapted to closed-canopy competition, and "savanna trees" that are inferior competitors in closed-canopy communities, but more resistant to fire. The assumptions of this model are supported by empirical observations, including a systematic review of savanna and forest tree community composition reported here. In general, the model simulations show that when savanna trees exert weaker competitive effects on grasses, a self-reinforcing grass community is maintained, which limits forest tree expansion while still allowing savanna trees to persist (albeit as a subdominant to grasses). When savanna trees exert strong competitive effects on grasses, savanna trees cover increases initially, but as grasses decline their inhibitory effect on forest trees weakens, allowing forest trees to expand and exclude grasses and savanna trees. Rather than paradoxical, these results suggest that having weaker competitive effects on grasses may be advantageous for savanna trees, leading to greater long-term abundance and stability. We label this the "enemy of my enemy hypothesis," which might apply to species coexistence in communities defined by hierarchical competition or with species capable of generating strong ecological feedbacks.

AB Aim: Biotic interactions have traditionally been predicted to be stronger towards the tropics. However, all previous studies about the latitudinal gradient in seed predation were either based on single species or compiled data from studies that used different methods in different ecosystems. Our goal was to provide the first broad-scale quantification of the latitudinal gradient in seed predation at both cross-species and within-species levels.
   Location: Twenty-five sites spanning 28 degrees of latitude on the east coast of Australia.
   Methods: Using consistent protocols, we measured pre-dispersal seed predation for 256 species x site combinations (including a total of 170 species) and post-dispersal seed removal for 126 species x site combinations (including a total of 91 species), as well as removal of standard rice grains at each site. The relationships between seed predation and latitude were quantified using generalized mixed-effects models and meta-analyses.
   Results: Contrary to expectations, the proportion of seeds lost to pre-dispersal seed predation increased with latitude at the cross-species level and showed no latitudinal trend at the within-species level. There was no significant relationship between latitude and the proportion of seeds lost to post-dispersal seed removal, either within species or across species. We found significantly higher removal of standard rice grains at lower latitudes, but this trend reversed if we excluded the four island sites from analysis.
   Main conclusions: Seed predation on natural seeds was not higher at lower latitudes. Thus, our study joins a growing body of evidence contrary to the idea that tropical species suffer greater losses to herbivores than do temperate species. The latitudinal gradient in removal rates for standard rice grains suggests that natural seeds from low latitudes may have achieved a similar predation rate to high-latitudinal species through increased investment in defenses. However, additional data will be necessary to test this hypothesis.

AB The conservation of tropical rainforest biodiversity is a pressing issue, due to the rapid rate of deforestation. Secondary forests may provide a useful alternative to old growth forests, as they often contain a substantial proportion of the original biodiversity. In this study, we investigate species richness, density and composition of ants and termites in six forest sites in Singapore, each differing in habitat isolation and land-use history. The six sites include an old growth forest, a selectively logged old growth forest, and four secondary forests: either located on abandoned agricultural lands or in abandoned villages, and either isolated or adjacent to old growth forests. We found that the old growth forest had significantly higher species density of ants and termites than any other site. Rarefaction curves showed that ant and termite species richness were highest in the old growth forest followed by the selectively logged forest albeit these results were not significantly different from other sites. Ant species composition changed along a gradient of fragment isolation. Termite community composition in the old growth forest shared a higher proportion of species with the adjacent secondary forest, than with the selectively logged old growth forest, suggesting that the species pool of adjacent habitats is important for species re-colonisation of regenerating habitats. Our results suggest, albeit without replications, that secondary forests differ in conservation value and that disturbed habitats in continuous forest fragments recover more rapidly than isolated ones. Further, we emphasise the importance of old growth forest fragments within man-made ecosystems as sources of original biodiversity.

AB Quantitative assessment of tree species diversity from sample plots in seven forest ranges of Nayagarh Forest Division in Odisha state in the Eastern Ghats of India was made during the period April, 2011 to November, 2013. A total of 120 transects (1000 m x 5 m) were laid in Nayagarh, Odogaon, Pancharida, Khandapada, Dasapalla, Mahipur, and Gania forest ranges and tree stems of at least 30 cm GBH were measured. The regeneration potential of trees was assessed from 5 m x 5 m sample plots located within the main transect. A total of 177 tree species belonging to 120 genera and 44 families were recorded from the study area. Shorea robusta, Buchanania lanzan, Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia alata and Cleistanthus collinus were the predominant tree species. The stand density varied in the range of 355.33-740.53 stems ha(-1) while basal area ranged from 7.77 to 31.62 m(2) ha(-1). The tree density and species richness decreased with increasing girth class. The highest number of species and maximum density was recorded in the girth class of 30-60 cm. The Shannon-Weiner and Simpson Indices with respect to trees with ae<yen>30 cm GBH varied in the range of 2.07-3.79 cm and 0.03-0.37 cm respectively and the values of diversity indices are within the reported range for tropical forests of Indian sub-continent. The families, Dipterocarpaceae, Anacardiaceae, Combretaceae and Euphorbiaceae contributed to maximum species richness, stand density, and basal area. Regeneration of many tree species was observed to be poor. The present study provides baseline data for further ecological studies, forest management, and formulation of site-specific strategies for conservation of biological diversity in moist deciduous forests of Eastern India.

AB Disturbances that create gaps can shape the structure and function of forests. However, such disturbance regimes in Asian tropical montane rainforests remain largely unquantified. Least studied are typhoon disturbances that are attributable to climate change. We investigated gap characteristics in terms of size, age, and gap-maker to quantify the gap disturbance regimes in an intact old-growth tropical montane rainforest on Hainan Island, China. The intensity of typhoons has increased since 1949, and typhoon winds blow mostly (45.5%) from the northeast corner of Hainan Island, resulting in a higher frequency of gaps in the northeast. A total of 221 gap-makers (trees that fell to create canopy gaps) and 53 gaps were observed in a 3.16 ha old-growth rainforest. Most canopy gaps (85%) were < 200 m(2). The average size of canopy gaps was smaller in the rainforest than in other tropical forests, while the average size of expanded gaps was similar to those in other tropical forests. The maximum age of gaps was 23.5 years indicating that gaps had more rapid turnover than other parts of tropical forests. The frequency distribution of gap-makers followed a lognormal distribution with a distinctive peak at three gap-makers, which was different from the inverse J-shaped curve typical of other tropical forests. Gaps were recorded mainly on slopes between 20A degrees and 35A degrees and wood density of gap-makers was between 0.6 and 0.7 g cm(-3). Our results suggest that small-scale disturbance was the dominant agent of gap formation in this old-growth rainforest that is subject to increasing typhoon disturbances.

AB Stomach content analysis was used to assess the feeding habits of Acanthocybium solandri based on samples obtained on purse seine fishing trips off the Pacific coasts of Central and South America. A total of 226 samples were obtained; 160 stomachs contained food and 33 prey taxa were identified. Based on the Prey Specific Index of Relative Importance (%PSIRI), cephalopods and fishes were the main prey groups (50.4 and 49.5% PSIRI). Dosidicus gigas (23.4% PSIRI), Stenoteuthis oualaniensis (9.9% PSIRI) and Argonauta spp. (9.4% PSIRI) were the most representative prey. Acanthocybium solandri is a generalist predator based on the results of the Amundsen analysis and niche breadth (B-a = 1).

AB The complex orogenic history and structure of Southern South America, coupled with Pleistocene glacial cycles, have generated paleoclimatic and environmental changes that influenced the spatial distribution and genetic composition of natural populations. Despite the increased number of phylogeographic studies in this region and given the frequent idiosyncratic phylogeographic patterns, there is still the need to focus research especially on species that are currently distributed within a wide range of bioclimatic regimes, and that historically have been subject to contrasting scenarios. Liolaemus tennis is a widely distributed lizard species inhabiting latitudinally in almost 1000 km through central and southern Chile. Here we describe the geographical patterns of genetic variation and lineage diversification within L. tenuis, and their association with geography and Pleistocene glaciations, using sequences from one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, and five microsatellite loci, and covering most of the species distributional range. Our results revealed a high diversity both within and among populations, as well as two phylogeographic breaks, which are consistent with two of the larger rivers of central Chile, the Maipo and Biobio Rivers. Liolaemus tenuis is characterized by several allopatric lineages, especially in its north and central range, which suggest a history of multiple vicariance processes. Conversely, populations found in the southern range, south of the Biobio River, show signatures of recent decreases in effective population sizes, coupled with recent range expansions and secondary contact. Niche "envelope" data are consistent with patterns of genetic variation; both suggest a history of discontinuous areas of relatively stable populations throughout all of the distribution of L. tennis. These data are also consistent with higher probabilities of habitat suitability north of the Maipo River (ca. 33 S), in both coastal areas and the "Intermediate Depression" between 34 and 37 S, as well as in the southern Coastal Cordillera between the Biobio and Araucania regions. Interestingly, both molecular and niche envelope modeling data suggest that some populations may have persisted in fragmented refugia in Andean valleys, within the limits of the ice sheet. Finally, our results suggest that several populations of L. tenuis colonized glaciated regions from refugial areas in lowlands and coastal regions, and in the southern distribution, historic migration events would have occurred from refugial areas within the limits of the ice sheet.

AB Pericopsis elata (a.k.a. African teak) is one of the most valuable timber species in Central Africa. Like other shade intolerant tropical tree species, P. elata could play a vital role in economic development, and ecological sustainability, but regenerates poorly following selective logging. Now endangered, there is a critical need for sustainable silvicultural systems to restore this once prominent timber species. To assess management options for P. elata we analyzed growth performance and survival in primary and secondary forest plots under burning and weeding treatments in Yoko Forest Reserve, Ubundu Democratic Republic of Congo. We transplanted nursery-grown seedlings of P. elata to experimental gaps and followed their growth and survival for 1 year. Seedlings in large canopy gaps 50 x 50 m were taller (mean difference; P = 0.006) and more likely to survive (mean difference; P < 0.001). Weeding improved both diameter (P = 0.024) and height (P = 0.007) growth rates; however, burning alone did not significantly improve the performance of P. elata seedlings. Our data suggest that P. elata regeneration is compatible with shelterwood harvesting and traditional swidden agricultural systems widely practiced in the region.

AB The aim of this study was used a basic hypothetical structural model with latent variables to analyze the interconnections between the pools of stable P (inorganic P (Pi) and organic P (Po)), labile P (Pi and Po) and available P (Mehlich-1 P) and the pools of organic matter (OM) content and physicochemical properties in tropical soils of differing pedogenesis. We used structural equation modeling for designing models for two groups of soil: (1) mineral soils with low to medium organic matter content and (2) mineral soils with high organic matter content and organic soils. The proposed structural models were consistent with the hypothesis of dependence between the pools of P and organic matter as well as physicochemical properties in tropical soils. In general, stable and labile P pools acted as P sources for the available P pool; furthermore, the strength of these structural relationships was strongly associated with soil organic matter content. Yet the pool of physicochemical properties behaved as a sink of P for the labile P pool, however with a beneficial effect in maintaining the stable P pool. The pools of P and OM are strongly bonded in tropical soils under different pedogenesis. All structural models evidenced that various forms of P in different levels of lability could contribute in keeping the supply of bioavailable P, yet its magnitude would be regulated by P buffer capacity of each soil.

   AVAILABILITY
AB While community-weighted means of plant traits have been linked to mean environmental conditions at large scales, the drivers of trait variation within communities are not well understood. Local environmental heterogeneity ( such as microclimate variability), in addition to mean environmental conditions, may decrease the strength of environmental filtering and explain why communities support different amounts of trait variation. Here, we assess two hypotheses: first, that more heterogeneous local environments and second, that less extreme environments, should support a broader range of plant strategies and thus higher trait variation. We quantified drivers of trait variation across a range of environmental conditions and spatial scales ranging from sub-meter to tens of kilometers in montane and alpine plant communities. We found that, within communities, both environmental heterogeneity and environmental means are drivers of trait variation. However, the importance of each environmental factor varied depending on the trait. Our results indicate that larger-scale trait-climate linkages that hold across communities also apply at small spatial scales, suggesting that microclimate variation within communities is a key driver of community functional diversity. Microclimatic variation provides a potential mechanism for helping to maintain diversity in local communities and also suggests that small-scale environmental heterogeneity should be measured as a better predictor of functional diversity.

AB BACKGROUNDInvestigating the impact of pesticides on non-target organisms is essential for sustainable integrated pest management programs. We therefore assessed the toxicity of ten insecticides to the brassica caterpillar Ascia monuste and its ant predator Solenopsis saevissima and examined the effect that the insecticide synergists had on toxicity to the predator. We also assessed the residual period of control and impact of the insecticides during the brassica growing cycle.
   RESULTSAll insecticides except flubendiamide exhibited mortality above the threshold required by Brazilian legislation (80%). Chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, indoxacarb and spinosad exhibited lower toxicity to the ant predator than they did to the brassica caterpillar. The results obtained for synergized insecticides suggest that selectivity to the predator was due the involvement of cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases. Chlorfenapyr and cyantraniliprole exhibited the highest residual periods of control to the brassica caterpillar, whereas malathion had the greatest impact on the predator.
   CONCLUSIONMost of the insecticides efficiently controlled the brassica caterpillar, but not all exhibited selectivity to the predator. Therefore, due to the distinctive responses of organisms with respect to residual periods of control and the impact of the insecticides, spraying frequency must be strongly considered in integrated pest management programs.

AB Wildlife trade is increasingly recognized as an unsustainable threat to primate populations and informing its management is a growing focus and application of primatological research. However, management policies based on ecological research alone cannot address complex socioeconomic or cultural contexts as drivers of wildlife trade. Multidisciplinary research is required to understand trade complexity and identify sustainable management strategies. Here, we define multidisciplinary research as research that combines more than one academic discipline, and highlight how the articles in this issue combine methods and approaches to fill key gaps and offer a more comprehensive understanding of underlying drivers of wildlife trade including consumer demand, enforcement patterns, source population status, and accessibility of targeted species. These articles also focus on how these drivers interact at different scales, how trade patterns relate to ethics, and the potential effectiveness of different policy interventions in reducing wildlife trade. We propose priorities for future research on primate trade including expanding from multidisciplinary to interdisciplinary research questions and approaches co-created by research teams that integrate across different disciplines such as cultural anthropology, ecology, economics, and public policy. We also discuss challenges that limit the integration of information across disciplines to meet these priorities.

   RESPONSES
AB Plant tolerance of herbivory, i.e., the ability to recover after damage, is an important component of how plants cope with herbivores. Tolerance has long been hypothesized to be constrained evolutionarily by plant resistance to herbivores, traits that allow plants to cope with stressful growing conditions, and traits that influence the timing of damage in relation to reproduction. Variation in tolerance and resistance can be caused by differences in the identity of the plant (e.g., genotype, species, clade) and by the context of the herbivore threat (e.g., identity of the herbivore, type of damage it causes, abiotic conditions in which the plant is growing). To date, the vast majority of studies have explored trade-offs with tolerance within species. Here, we test hypotheses of constraints on tolerance using comparative approaches in a clade of mustards, emphasizing the variety of contexts in which damage is realistically tolerated. We estimated tolerance to leaf damage, tolerance to apical clipping at the bolting stage - simulating browsing -, and resistance to a specialist and generalist lepidopteran herbivore for a group of native mustards, grown in field soils unique to each population and in a common potting soil. Resistance to herbivores was soil dependent, while surprisingly, tolerance was not. Phylogenetic signal in resistance to specialist and generalist lepidopteran herbivores was present, but only when plants were grown in field soils. Tolerance had low phylogenetic signal. Tolerance to leaf damage was unrelated to tolerance to simulated browse. We found no evidence for a resistance-tolerance trade-off, and some evidence for a soil-dependent positive correlation between tolerance and resistance to both herbivores. Drought-tolerant species had poorer ability to tolerate browse damage, and earlier flowering species tended to be less tolerant to leaf damage. Our results suggest that tolerance trades off with traits that allow mostly annual, monocarpic Streptanthus (s.l.) to persist in drought-prone conditions but is largely unrelated to resistance to herbivores. Our study highlights a need for a new framework for tolerance to herbivory that explicitly acknowledges that the relationship among tolerance, resistance, and traits that ameliorate abiotic stress.

AB In hyperdiverse tropical forests, the key drivers of litter decomposition are poorly understood despite its crucial role in facilitating nutrient availability for plants and microbes. Selective logging is a pressing land use with potential for considerable impacts on plant-soil interactions, litter decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Here, in Borneo's tropical rainforests, we test the hypothesis that decomposition is driven by litter quality and that there is a significant home-field advantage, that is positive interaction between local litter quality and land use. We determined mass loss of leaf litter, collected from selectively logged and old-growth forest, in a fully factorial experimental design, using meshes that either allowed or precluded access by mesofauna. We measured leaf litter chemical composition before and after the experiment. Key soil chemical and biological properties and microclimatic conditions were measured as land-use descriptors. We found that despite substantial differences in litter quality, the main driver of decomposition was land-use type. Whilst inclusion of mesofauna accelerated decomposition, their effect was independent of land use and litter quality. Decomposition of all litters was slower in selectively logged forest than in old-growth forest. However, there was significantly greater loss of nutrients from litter, especially phosphorus, in selectively logged forest. The analyses of several covariates detected minor microclimatic differences between land-use types but no alterations in soil chemical properties or free-living microbial composition. These results demonstrate that selective logging can significantly reduce litter decomposition in tropical rainforest with no evidence of a home-field advantage. We show that loss of key limiting nutrients from litter (P & N) is greater in selectively logged forest. Overall, the findings hint at subtle differences in microclimate overriding litter quality that result in reduced decomposition rates in selectively logged forests and potentially affect biogeochemical nutrient cycling in the long term.

AB Neotropical freshwater fishes are the most diverse on the planet (>5,500 species), although nations in Latin America have been negligent regarding their conservation. National policies have historically encouraged unsustainable practices, and recent decades have witnessed a sharp increase in harmful activities. Our aim with this review was to expose this situation and illustrate how national policies constitute the main threat to freshwater fish biodiversity. We explain that the most devastating, pervasive and systemic threats are rooted in official policies, particularly unsustainable activities (e.g. hydropower, water diversion, mining, aquaculture, agriculture and fishing), poor management/conservation (e.g. fish stocking and passages) and harmful legislation (e.g. poor licensing, non-native species). We provide a broad portrait of the Neotropical scenario, where unsustainable policies have caused considerable damage to freshwater ecosystems, and focus on major examples from Brazil, where development projects have caused large-scale losses to fish biodiversity. Such modus operandi of human development is incompatible with the persistence of biodiversity, and no simple solution is available to correct or minimize its effects. The current situation demands a profound behavioural shift towards better practices and policies, or these multiple high-impact activities will continue eroding freshwater fish biodiversity and impairing essential ecosystem services.

AB The progressive development of economic valuations of biodiversity in recent decade enables the application of the concept of payments for ecosystem services (PES) in order to conservation of forest biodiversity in protected areas. In this article, the PES concept principles are applied for the monetary valuation of natural forest habitats, which were mapped in the Czech Republic in order to create the Natura 2000 European network. The method is based on expert evaluation of every type of mapped habitat by a point value (ranging from 1 to 6 points) for specific ecological evaluating criteria. The monetary value of every point of specific natural forest habitats was defined from the economic analysis of financial expenses of realised ecological restoration projects in the Czech Republic. This method is therefore based on a rather exceptional application of the PES concept, which is still rare in literature because it is based on actual invested financial means, not only on the potential willingness to spend these financial means. The presented results of the monetary valuation of the natural forest habitats in the Czech Republic indicate that the method used for the monetization of forest biodiversity in protected areas can represent a promising decision support tool in countries where habitat mapping results are available.

AB Collective payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs make payments to groups, conditional on specified aggregate land-management outcomes. Such collective contracting may be well suited to settings with communal land tenure or decision-making. Given that collective contracting does not require costly individual-level information on outcomes, it may also facilitate conditioning on additionality (i.e., conditioning payments upon clearly improved outcomes relative to baseline). Yet collective contracting often suffers from free riding, which undermines group outcomes and may be exacerbated or ameliorated by PES designs. We study impacts of conditioning on additionality within a number of collective PES designs. We use a framed field-laboratory experiment with participants from a new PES program in Mexico. Because social interactions are critical within collective processes, we assess the impacts from conditioning on additionality given: (1) group participation in contract design, and (2) a group coordination mechanism. Conditioning on above-baseline outcomes raised contributions, particularly among initially lower contributors. Group participation in contract design increased impact, as did the coordination mechanism. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Aims: Tree mortality can determine forest dynamics and succession, alter nutrient cycling and contribute to tree species co-existence. Understanding the mechanisms that maintain species diversity is a central goal of community ecology. In this study, we incorporated survival data from a 10-yr interval census to determine whether there is significant interspecies variation in the effects of biotic neighbourhood variables and whether there is significant spatial variation in the effects of topographic variables on tree survival in a broadleaved-Korean pine temperate forest.
   Location: Temperate forest, northeast China.
   Methods: We used GLMM and geographically weighted GLM as well as their corresponding test approaches to determine whether there is significant interspecies variation in the effects of biotic neighbourhood variables over variable neighbourhood radii and whether there is significant spatial variation in the effects of topographic variables on tree survival across multiple spatial scales in an old-growth temperate forest dynamics plot in northeast China.
   Results: Our results showed that the effects of neighbourhood variables on tree survival varied among species and effects of topography varied over space. However, the results depended on the neighbourhood radius and spatial scale. The neighbourhood radius affected detection of variation in neighbourhood effects among species, and the spatial scale similarly affected detection of spatial variation in the effects of topography. The effect of conspecific neighbour density on survival varied more widely among species than that of the average phylogenetic dissimilarity of heterospecific neighbours, regardless of the neighbourhood radius. Moreover, the effect of elevation varied more widely over space than those of convexity and hill shade at any quadrat scale.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight that future studies should account for variations in the neighbourhood radius among species and/or circumstances as well as the spatial scale when assessing factors that contribute to species co-existence in long-lived organisms. Species leaf phenology, shade and drought tolerance and environmental filtering may explain these variations in the effects of neighbourhood and topographic variables on tree survival. Overall, our results indicate that both density dependence and resource niche partitioning are important mechanisms for maintaining biodiversity in this broad-leaved Korean pine temperate forest.

AB The uneven representation of frugivorous mammals and birds across tropical regions-high in the New World, low in Madagascar and intermediate in Africa and Asia-represents a long-standing enigma in ecology. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these differences but the ultimate drivers remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that fruits in Madagascar contain insufficient nitrogen to meet primate metabolic requirements, thus constraining the evolution of frugivory. We performed a global analysis of nitrogen in fruits consumed by primates, as collated from 79 studies. Our results showed that average frugivory among lemur communities was lower compared to New World and Asian-African primate communities. Fruits in Madagascar contain lower average nitrogen than those in the New World and Old World. Nitrogen content in the overall diets of primate species did not differ

AB The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis provides a conceptual framework for explaining the maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. Its central tenet-that recruits experience high mortality near conspecifics and at high densities-assumes a degree of host specialization in interactions between plants and natural enemies. Studies confirming JC effects have focused primarily on spatial distributions of seedlings and saplings, leaving major knowledge gaps regarding the fate of seeds in soil and the specificity of the soilborne fungi that are their most important antagonists. Here we use a common garden experiment in a lowland tropical forest in Panama to show that communities of seed-infecting fungi are structured predominantly by plant species, with only minor influences of factors such as local soil type, forest characteristics, or time in soil (1-12 months). Inoculation experiments confirmed that fungi affected seed viability and germination in a host-specific manner and that effects on seed viability preceded seedling emergence. Seeds are critical components of reproduction for tropical trees, and the factors influencing their persistence, survival, and germination shape the populations of seedlings and saplings on which current perspectives regarding forest dynamics are based. Together these findings bring seed dynamics to light in the context of the JC hypothesis, implicating them directly in the processes that have emerged as critical for diversity maintenance in species-rich tropical forests.

AB DNA barcoding is a fast and reliable tool to assess and monitor biodiversity and, via community phylogenetics, to investigate ecological and evolutionary processes that may be responsible for the community structure of forests. In this study, DNA barcodes for the two widely used plastid coding regions rbcL and matK are used to contribute to identification of morphologically undetermined individuals, as well as to investigate phylogenetic structure of tree communities in 70 subplots (10 x 10m) of a 25-ha forest-dynamics plot in Brunei (Borneo, Southeast Asia). The combined matrix (rbcL + matK) comprised 555 haplotypes (from >= 154 genera, 68 families and 25 orders sensu APG, Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2016), making a substantial contribution to tree barcode sequences from Southeast Asia. Barcode sequences were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships using maximum likelihood, both with and without constraining the topology of taxonomic orders to match that proposed by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. A third phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the program Phylomatic to investigate the influence of phylogenetic resolution on results. Detection of non-random patterns of community assembly was determined by net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest taxon index (NTI). In most cases, community assembly was either random or phylogenetically clustered, which likely indicates the importance to community structure of habitat filtering based on phylogenetically correlated traits in determining community structure. Different phylogenetic trees gave similar overall results, but the Phylomatic tree produced greater variation across plots for NRI and NTI values, presumably due to noise introduced by using an unresolved phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that using a DNA barcode tree has benefits over the traditionally used Phylomatic approach by increasing precision and accuracy and allowing the incorporation of taxonomically unidentified individuals into analyses.

   CONSERVATION; POPULATION
AB The degree to which terrestrial vertebrate populations are depleted in tropical forests occupied by human communities has been the subject of an intense polarising debate that has important conservation implications. Conservation ecologists and practitioners are divided over the extent to which community-based subsistence offtake is compatible with ecologically functional populations of tropical forest game species. To quantify depletion envelopes of forest vertebrates around human communities, we deployed a total of 383 camera trap stations and 78 quantitative interviews to survey the peri-community areas controlled by 60 semi-subsistence communities over a combined area of over 3.2 million hectares in the Medio Jurua and Uatuma regions of Central-Western Brazilian Amazonia. Our results largely conform with prior evidence that hunting large-bodied vertebrates reduces wildlife populations near settlements, such that they are only found at a distance to settlements where they are hunted less frequently. Camera trap data suggest that a select few harvest-sensitive species, including lowland tapir, are either repelled or depleted by human communities. Nocturnal and cathemeral species were detected relatively more frequently in disturbed areas close to communities, but individual species did not necessarily shift their activity patterns. Group biomass of all species was depressed in the wider neighbourhood of urban areas rather than communities. Interview data suggest that species traits, especially group size and body mass, mediate these relationships. Large-bodied, large-group-living species are detected farther from communities as reported by experienced informants. Long-established communities in our study regions have not "emptied" the surrounding forest. Low human population density and low hunting offtake due to abundant sources of alternative aquatic protein, suggest that these communities represent a best-case scenario for sustainable hunting of wildlife for food, thereby providing a conservative assessment of game depletion. Given this 'best-case' camera trap and interview-based evidence for hunting depletion, regions with higher human population densities, external trade in wildlife and limited access to alternative protein will likely exhibit more severe depletion.

AB Background. The Brazilian Amazon is the world's largest rainforest regions and plays a key role in biodiversity conservation as well as climate adaptation and mitigation. The government has created a network of protected areas (PAs) to ensure long-term conservation of the region. However, despite the importance of and positive advances in the establishment of PAs, natural resource depletion in the Brazilian Amazon is pervasive.
   Methods. We evaluated a total of 4,243 official law enforcement records generated between 2010 and 2015 to understand the geographical distribution of the illegal use of resources in federal PAs in the Brazilian Amazon. We classified illegal activities into ten categories and used generalized additive models (GAMs) to evaluate the relationship between illegal use of natural resources inside PAs with management type, age of PAs, population density, and accessibility.
   Results. We found 27 types of illegal use of natural resources that were grouped into 10 categories of illegal activities. Most infractions were related to suppression and degradation of vegetation (37.40%), followed by illegal fishing (27.30%) and hunting activities (18.20%). The explanatory power of the GAMs was low for all categories of illegal activity, with a maximum explained variation of 41.2% for illegal activities as a whole, and a minimum of 14.6% for hunting activities.
   Discussion. These findings demonstrate that even though PAs are fundamental for nature conservation in the Brazilian Amazon, the pressures and threats posed by human activities include a broad range of illegal uses of natural resources. Population density up to 50 km from a PA is a key variable, influencing illegal activities. These threats endanger long-term conservation and many efforts are still needed to maintain PAs that are large enough and sufficiently intact to maintain ecosystem functions and protect biodiversity.

AB The tropical forests of Borneo and Amazonia may each contain more tree species diversity in half a square kilometre than do all the temperate forests of Europe, North America, and Asia combined(1). Biologists have long been fascinated by this disparity, using it to investigate potential drivers of biodiversity(2). Latitudinal variation in many of these drivers is expected to create geographic differences in ecological(2-4) and evolutionary processes(4,5), and evidence increasingly shows that tropical ecosystems have higher rates of diversification, clade origination, and clade dispersal(5,6). However, there is currently no evidence to link gradients in ecological processes within communities at a local scale directly to the geographic gradient in biodiversity. Here, we show geographic variation in the storage effect, an ecological mechanism that reduces the potential for competitive exclusion more strongly in the tropics than it does in temperate and boreal zones, decreasing the ratio of interspecific-to-intraspecific competition by 0.25% for each degree of latitude that an ecosystem is located closer to the Equator. Additionally, we find evidence that latitudinal variation in climate underpins these differences; longer growing seasons in the tropics reduce constraints on the seasonal timing of reproduction, permitting lower recruitment synchrony between species and thereby enhancing niche partitioning through the storage effect. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the storage effect, and therefore its impact on diversity within communities, varies latitudinally in association with climate. This finding highlights the importance of biotic interactions in shaping geographic diversity patterns, and emphasizes the need to understand the mechanisms underpinning ecological processes in greater detail than has previously been appreciated.

AB The rapidly declining tropical forests of Asia support a diversity of felid species, many of which are rare and little known. We used camera traps in Dampa Tiger Reserve (TR), Mizoram, northeastern India, to estimate population density and describe activity patterns of 2 rare felids, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) and marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata). With a survey effort of 4,962 trap nights, we obtained 84 photo-captures of clouded leopards and 36 of marbled cats. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to estimate population densities of both species. Using the Bayesian approach implemented in SPACECAP, we derived estimates of 5.14 (+/- 1.80 SD)/100 km(2) for clouded leopards and 5.03 (+/- 2.07 SD)/100 km(2) for marbled cats. Using camera-trap images, we compared diel activity patterns and activity overlaps for these 2 rare felids, together with 3 other sympatric carnivores, by estimating a coefficient of overlap between species. Among felids, clouded leopards and golden cats (Catopuma temminckii) displayed the highest overlap in activity, whereas marbled cats and leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) showed the lowest, with marbled cats being primarily diurnal and leopard cats nocturnal. Our study provides the first density estimates from continental Southeast Asia for marbled cats and one of the highest recorded densities for clouded leopards. These results are of special significance since Dampa sustains an ecosystem that has in recent times undergone near extirpation of large predators.

AB Recent debates on the number of plant species in the vast lowland rain forests of the Amazon have been based largely on model estimates, neglecting published checklists based on verified voucher data. Here we collate taxonomically verified checklists to present a list of seed plant species from lowland Amazon rain forests. Our list comprises 14,003 species, of which 6,727 are trees. These figures are similar to estimates derived from nonparametric ecological models, but they contrast strongly with predictions of much higher tree diversity derived from parametric models. Based on the known proportion of tree species in neotropical lowland rain forest communities as measured in complete plot censuses, and on overall estimates of seed plant diversity in Brazil and in the neotropics in general, it is more likely that tree diversity in the Amazon is closer to the lower estimates derived from nonparametric models. Much remains unknown about Amazonian plant diversity, but this taxonomically verified dataset provides a valid starting point for macroecological and evolutionary studies aimed at understanding the origin, evolution, and ecology of the exceptional biodiversity of Amazonian forests.

AB Surrogate groups have been used as a useful tool for biodiversity conservation. The occurrence and distribution of a taxon can be predicted based on the occurrence of other biological species or groups. Consequently, the current study sought to determine the presence of one or more surrogate groups in a seasonally flooded region in the South American Pantanal wetlands. Data on the occurrence and distribution of species were collected at Pantanal Long-Term Sampling Sites (PLTSS). We assayed for congruence between woody plants, herbaceous plants, spiders, anurans, birds and small mammals using Mantel tests. We also evaluated the effect of selected environmental and spatial factors on each biological group, using variance partitioning. Based on the average correlation between groups, the group with the highest congruence was woody plants, and it was therefore considered the best surrogate group for the PLTSS area. The soil texture (percentage of silt, sand and clay) are not important in defining plant group distributions. However, plants were distributed as a function of flood intensity and hydroperiod. The effect of flooding and vegetation structure differed between the analyzed zoological taxa. Additionally, spatial factors, here represented by Moran Eigenvector Maps, were important for all evaluated biological groups. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper sets out to analyze the changes in vegetation cover and land use in the Huasteca region during the period 1990-2015, to find out its causes, and to create future land use scenarios based on historical trends. The last remnants of the most northerly tropical rain forest in the Americas are found in the region in Mexico known as the Huasteca. The main factors causing changes in land use that threaten biodiversity in the Huasteca are crop and livestock agriculture, making this region a conservation priority for the Mexican government. Historically, the region has long been subject to transformation by human activity, from Spanish colonization to development by the oil industry in the mid-twentieth century. Images from the SPOT and Landsat satellite, and the Dinamica EGO program were used. During the twenty-five-year period examined, 87,173 ha of tropical rain forest, 4709 ha of cloud forest and 388 hectares of Oak forest were lost. Projections for the years 2030, 2040 and 2050 show potential increases in agricultural land use at the expense of natural vegetation. By 2050, 155,856 ha of tropical rain forest and 7208 ha of cloud forest could be lost if current government agricultural policies and social trends continue. An analysis of changes in land use is fundamental for devising actions leading to the implementation of policies for both sustainable agricultural production and improving the living conditions of residents, as well as conservation of tropical rain forests in the Huasteca.

AB Here we describe novel post-dispersal seed predation by Atlantic Forest squirrels (Guerlinguetus ingrami). We show that the squirrel preys on seeds defecated by lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) in the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. The squirrel consumed seeds in tapir feces at a latrine, including Spondias macrocarpa, S. venulosa and Elaeis guineensis. In videos and photographs taken by a camera trap, squirrels are clearly seen removing and eating seeds from tapir fecal pellets. Squirrels are known to be both seed dispersers (primary and secondary) and predators, and seed dispersal and predation are important for plant community structure. We demonstrate that as seed predators, squirrels seems to monitor and opportunistically take advantage of seeds dispersed by other mammals, thereby reducing primary dispersal effectiveness and compromising the ecosystem service provided by other dispersers. Squirrels may take advantage of latrines when other food sources are locally unavailable. Also, tapirs, because they travel large distances while foraging, often predictably return to latrines, thereby providing squirrels with an otherwise unavailable resource. If seeds become very abundant in latrines, perhaps squirrels then hoard (secondary dispersal) the excess. If the behavior described is a general trend, the pattern is likely to be often repeated, especially in tropical forests with similar mammalian assemblages, and this complex dynamic will require further study to better understand consequences of post-dispersal seed predation.

   DYNAMICS; INSECTS; DEHYDRATION; PREDATION; BUDGETS
AB Recent research has documented shifts in per capita trophic interactions and food webs in response to changes in environmental moisture, from the top-down (consumers to plants), rather than solely bottom-up (plants to consumers). These responses may be predictable from effects of physiological, behavioral, and ecological traits on animal water balance, although predictions could be modified by energy or nutrient requirements, the risk of predation, population-level responses, and bottom-up effects. Relatively little work has explicitly explored food web effects of changes in animal water balance, despite the likelihood of widespread relevance, including during periodic droughts in mesic locations, where taxa may lack adaptations for water conservation. More research is needed, particularly in light of climate change and hydrological alteration.

AB We developed the first tree-ring chronology of Chukrasia tabularis from a moist tropical forest in Bangladesh, spanning the 102-year period 1911-2012. The species showed wood anatomically clear annual tree-ring boundaries which crossdated between tree individuals. Bootstrapped correlation analyses revealed that the ring-width index was significantly negatively correlated with current year mean and minimum temperatures. This relationship was stronger during the dry season (November-March), the pre-monsoon (February-April) and the post-monsoon season (September-November) than during the main monsoon season (May-August). We interpret this result as an indication that temperature-driven higher evapotranspiration outside the main rainy season leads to water stress limiting tree growth. This is confirmed by negative correlations of the ring-width index with the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during the dry season. Precipitation did not show significant relationships to tree growth, except in current year June. However, cloud cover strongly negatively affected tree growth, likely by reducing photosynthetic capacity particularly during the rainy summer (May-August) monsoon season. On a regional scale, the ring-width index was correlated with both Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, but during different seasons. Ring width of C. tabularis was also significantly correlated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Monthly Nino 3.4 region positive temperature anomalies enhanced current year tree growth but negative temperature anomalies reduced tree growth in the following year mainly through modulating local climate. Hence, tree-ring variations of C. tabularis in Bangladesh record local and regional climate signals and are a potential proxy to reconstruct local and regional paleoclimatic variability during the past centuries.

AB The last few decades have seen an increasing interest and strong development in spatial point process methodology, and associated software that facilitates model fitting has become available. A lot of this progress has made these approaches more accessible to users, through freely available software. However, in the ecological user community the methodology has only been slowly picked up despite its obvious relevance to the field. This paper reflects on this development, highlighting mutual benefits of interdisciplinary dialogue for both statistics and ecology. We detail the contribution point process methodology has made to research on biodiversity theory as a result of this dialogue and reflect on reasons for the slow take-up of the methodology. This primarily concerns the current lack of consideration of the usability of the approaches, which we discuss in detail, presenting current discussions as well as indicating future directions.

AB Tropical forest restoration is increasingly seen as an activity that may counteract or reduce biodiversity loss. However, few studies monitor fauna or consider measures of functional diversity to assess restoration success. We assessed the effect of a tropical montane forest restoration program on species and functional diversity, using amphibians as the target group. We compared amphibian assemblages in three types of land use: restoration areas, tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF; reference ecosystem) and cattle pastures (degraded ecosystem) in southern Mexico. We also described microclimate, microhabitat heterogeneity, woody vegetation structure and diversity for each type of land use, and their relationship to amphibian species and functional diversity. Compared to TMCF, restoration areas had similar environmental conditions. However, amphibian species richness was similar in the three types of land use and abundance was lower in the restoration areas. In TMCF, the amphibian assemblage was dominated by forest-specialist species, the pastures by generalist species, and the restoration areas by a combination of both species types. Interestingly, functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence did not vary with land use, though the number of functional groups in restoration areas and TMCF was slightly higher. Overall, the results suggest that after seven years, active restoration provided habitat heterogeneity and recovered woody vegetation capable of maintaining amphibian species and functional groups similar to those inhabiting TMCF. Forest fragments adjacent to restoration areas seem to facilitate fauna recolonization and this emphasizes the importance of the conservation of the reference ecosystems to achieving restoration success.

AB The spatial distribution of species is affected by dispersal barriers, local environmental conditions and climate. However, the effect of species dispersal and their adaptation to the environment across geographic scales is poorly understood. To investigate the distribution of species from local to broad geographic scales, we sampled termites in 198 transects distributed in 13 sampling grids in the Brazilian Amazonian forest. The sampling grids encompassed an area of 271 500 km(2) and included the five major biogeographic regions delimited by Amazonian rivers. Environmental data for each transect were obtained from local measurements and remote sensing. Similar to previous studies, termite species composition at the local scale was mostly associated with measures of soil texture and chemistry. In contrast, termite species composition at broad geographic scales was associated with soil nutrients, and the geographic position of the transects. Between 17 and 30% of the variance in termite species composition could be attributed exclusively to the geographic position of the transects, but could not be attributed to measured environmental variables or the presence of major rivers. Isolation by distance may have strong effects on termite species composition due to historic processes and the spatially structured environments along distinct geological formations of Amazonia. However, in contrast to many taxa in Amazonia, there is no evidence that major rivers are important barriers to termite dispersal.

AB Vertebrate granivores destroy plant seeds, but whether animal-induced seed mortality alters plant recruitment varies with habitat context, seed traits, and among granivore species. An incomplete understanding of seed predation makes it difficult to predict how widespread extirpations of vertebrate granivores in tropical forests might affect tree communities, especially in the face of habitat disturbance. Many tropical forests are simultaneously affected by animal loss as well as habitat disturbance, but the consequences of each for forest regeneration are often studied separately or additively, and usually on a single plant demographic stage. The combined impacts of these threats could affect plant recruitment in ways that are not apparent when studied in isolation. We used wire cages to exclude large (elephants), medium, (sambar deer, bearded pigs, muntjac deer), and small (porcupines, chevrotains) ground-dwelling mammalian granivores and herbivores in logged and unlogged forests in Malaysian Borneo. We assessed the interaction between habitat disturbance (selective logging) and experimental defaunation on seed survival, germination, and seedling establishment in five dominant dipterocarp tree species spanning a 21-fold gradient in seed size. Granivore-induced seed mortality was consistently higher in logged forest. Germination of unpredated seeds was reduced in logged forest and in the absence of small to large-bodied mammals. Experimental defaunation increased germination and reduced seed removal but had little effect on seed survival. Seedling recruitment however, was more likely where logging and animal loss occurred together. The interacting effects of logging and hunting could therefore, actually increase seedling establishment, suggesting that the loss of mammals in disturbed forest could have important consequences for forest regeneration and composition.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) have become the flagship of conservation organizations in recent years. However, PES schemes are as much criticized as they are acclaimed in the literature. Researchers have pointed that many PES schemes, particularly water-related ones, are based on unreliable assumptions and lack strong causal links between land use and ecosystem services. Evidence of outcomes is hardly demonstrated. This uncertainty in PES schemes arises not only from practical difficulties, but from the complexity of the human-environment systems (HES), and the limits of current knowledge about HES. Many scientists and practitioners have proposed that more research is needed to improve the scientific basis of PES. Here we argue that this research should be complemented with a deeper understanding of the uncertainties involved in PES, an explicit treatment of these in the whole process of PES negotiation, design and monitoring, and dear uncertainty communication among the actors involved. Neglecting uncertainties could lead to unfounded expectations and poor assessments of PES outcomes. If recognizing and accounting for uncertainties are to threaten the success of PES, then uncertainty can be seen as an opportunity to open up the dialogue to alternative ways of achieving the desired conservation goals.

AB Host-associated microbiomes are integral components of host health, but microbiome community structure varies among and within hosts. Reconciling community variability with the apparent dependence of hosts on community function, and characterizing how functional divergence proceeds across niches, remains challenging. Here, through the study of gut microbiomes and diets of three insectivorous bat species we characterize how community structure is shaped by predicted functional properties of community members. We found that while host diet and microbiome community composition do not significantly relate to each other, host diet and metagenome function do, suggesting that diet directly selects metagenomic functions rather than communities. We use a novel inference framework to show how the discordance between community structure and functional variation derives from functional equivalence and is influenced by the continuum of shared and derived gene sets across microbial lineages. Our findings help clarify how metagenome community structure-function relationships contribute to deterministic processes in community assembly, and describe the basis for metagenomic differences across ecologically similar hosts.

AB Biodiversity has become a topic of study in a variety of disciplines. Within criminology the study of biodiversity loss is often emphasised in the poaching literature. However, an alternative perspective on the political economy of biodiversity loss exists within criminology. While both approaches to biodiversity provide important information for the discipline of criminology, the implications of those approaches have very different implications for environmental discourse related to poverty and social justice. We suggest that poaching studies be viewed with caution as there is a possibility that those studies can be used to 'blame the poor' for biodiversity loss.

AB The competitive exclusion principle is one of the most influential concepts in ecology. The classical formulation suggests a correlation between competitor species similarity and competition severity, leading to rapid competitive exclusion where species are very similar; yet neutral models show that identical species can persist in competition for long periods. Here, we resolve the conflict by examining two components of similarity - niche overlap and competitive similarity - and modeling the effects of each on exclusion rate (defined as the inverse of time to exclusion). Studying exclusion rate, rather than the traditional focus on binary outcomes (coexistence versus exclusion), allows us to examine classical niche and neutral perspectives using the same currency. High niche overlap speeds exclusion, but high similarity in competitive ability slows it. These predictions are confirmed by a well-known model of two species competing for two resources. Under ecologically plausible scenarios of correlation between these two factors, the strongest exclusion rates may be among moderately similar species, while very similar and highly dissimilar competitors have very low exclusion rates. Adding even small amounts of demographic stochasticity to the model blurs the line between deterministic and probabilistic coexistence still further. Thus, focusing on exclusion rate, instead of on the binary outcome of coexistence versus exclusion, allows a variety of outcomes to result from competitive interactions. This approach may help explain species coexistence in diverse competitive communities and raises novel issues for future work.

AB Plants have numerous mechanisms to cope with the negative effects of herbivory, including plant resistance, structural and chemical traits that reduce damage, and plant tolerance, the ability to compensate for tissues lost. It has been argued that resistance and tolerance represent alternate strategies and thus there should be a trade-off between resistance and tolerance. However, resistance and tolerance are controlled via the same molecular pathway, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the process of endoreduplication. Endoreduplication is the replication of the genome without mitosis, which leads to an increase in cellular chromosome number. Increasing chromosome number and therefore gene copy number provides a means of increasing gene expression that has been shown to enhance compensation following herbivory. By measuring glucosinolate levels and seed production following the removal of apical dominance in genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana we show that there is a positive association between tolerance and induced chemical defense. Similarly, the direct association between tolerance and resistance is demonstrated by genetically manipulating the endoreduplication pathway. By overexpressing ILP1, a positive regulator of endoreduplication, and thus compensation, we experimentally increased glucosinolate production and tolerance in the Col-0 genotype. We suggest that many herbaceous plants that endoreduplicate (similar to 90%) would show a positive relationship between compensation and chemical defense, given that the molecular pathways are shared in common. We discuss these findings in light of contrasting results on measures of tolerance and resistance, given that the true relationship can be masked by ignoring genetic variation in endoreduplication and the timing of chemical measurement.

AB We discuss evidence of effects of an accidental fire on shoot growth and leaf development in six cerrado tree species with distinct leaf phenologies. Buds of all six species were marked before shoot and leaf emergence in the dry season. After fire, leaf and shoot growth were monitored weekly and specific leaf area (SLA) was determined. Shoot order was determined in the growing season. Evergreens and semideciduous woody species had rapid leaf and shoot growth and decreased leaf life span (LLS) after fire compared with published data for evergreens in cerrado areas without fire. On the other hand, Kielmeyera variabilis, a deciduous species, showed intense branching and produced two orders of shoots in one growing season. Fires promote rapid leaf and shoot growth in evergreens owing to reserve accumulations that allow survivorship after disturbances. However, the leaves produced by evergreens after fire had high SLAs and were discarded before the next rainy season (short LLS). This leaf cohort was produced with less carbon per leaf, and the decreased LLS prevented herbivory and water loss during the dry season. Fire is an important factor of cerrado environments, influencing leaf production and shoot architecture in cerrado trees.

AB Extreme climatic events affecting the Amazon region are expected to become more frequent under ongoing climate change. In this study, we assessed the responses to the 2010 drought of over 14,000 trees >= 10 cm dbh in a 25 ha lowland forest plot in the Colombian Amazon and how these responses varied among topographically defined habitats, with tree size, and with species wood density. Tree mortality was significantly higher during the 2010-2013 period immediately after the drought than in 2007-2010. The post-drought increase in mortality was stronger for trees located in valleys (+243%) than for those located on slopes (+67%) and ridges (+57%). Tree-based generalized linear mixed models showed a significant negative effect of species wood density on mortality and no effect of tree size. Despite the elevated post-drought mortality, aboveground biomass increased from 2007 to 2013 by 1.62 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (95% CI 0.80-2.43 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Biomass change varied among habitats, with no significant increase on the slopes (1.05, 95% CI -0.76 to 2.85 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), a significant increase in the valleys (1.33, 95% CI 0.37-2.34 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), and a strong increase on the ridges (2.79, 95% CI 1.20-4.21 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). These results indicate a high carbon resilience of this forest to the 2010 drought due to habitat-associated and interspecific heterogeneity in responses including directional changes in functional composition driven by enhanced performance of drought-tolerant species that inhabit the drier ridges.

AB Ecosystem restoration can help reverse biodiversity loss, but whether faunal communities of forests undergoing restoration converge with those of primary forest over time remains contentious. There is a need to develop faunal indicators of restoration success that more comprehensively reflect changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function. Ants are an ecologically dominant faunal group and are widely advocated as ecological indicators. We examine ant species and functional group responses on a chronosequence of rainforest restoration in northern Australia, and develop a novel method for selecting and using indicator species. Four sampling techniques were used to survey ants at 48 sites, from grassland, through various ages (1-24years) of restoration plantings, to mature forest. From principal components analysis of seven vegetation metrics, we derived a Forest Development Index (FDI) of vegetation change along the chronosequence. A novel Ant Forest Indicator Index (AFII), based on the occurrences of ten key indicator species associated with either grassland or mature forest, was used to assess ant community change with forest restoration. Grasslands and mature forests supported compositionally distinct ant communities at both species and functional levels. The AFII was strongly correlated with forest development (FDI). At forest restoration sites older than 5-10years that had a relatively closed canopy, ant communities converged on those of mature rainforest, indicating a promising restoration trajectory for fauna as well as plants. Our findings reinforce the utility of ants as ecological indicators and emphasize the importance of restoration methods that achieve rapid closed-canopy conditions. The novel AFII assessed restoration status from diverse and patchily distributed species, closely tracking ant community succession using comprehensive species-level data. It has wide applicability for assessing forest restoration in a way that is relatively independent of sampling methodology and intensity, and without a need for new comparative data from reference sites.

AB The relationships between biodiversity and aboveground biomass in forest ecosystems have been intensively studied in recent decades. Still, the mechanisms that underlie it remain highly debated. We hypothesized that overstorey species diversity and individual tree size variation contribute to aboveground biomass and understorey species diversity through the niche complementarity effect, while weaken the relationship between understorey aboveground biomass and individual tree size variation due to the mixed effects of tree development, biotic interaction and reduced available resources by over storey strata. The integrative relationships of species diversity and tree size variation (variation in diameter at breast height-DBH) with aboveground biomass were analysed at overstorey and understorey strata across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. For comparison, we tested these relationships at individual strata (isolation modelling), and whole-community level, by using linear structural equation model while accounting for the effects of soil nutrients. The integrative modelling accounted for 35, 31, 16, 12, 4, and 0% of the variation in understorey aboveground biomass, overstorey aboveground biomass, overstorey DBH variation, overstorey species diversity, understorey species diversity, and understorey DBH variation, respectively. Overstorey DBH variation and species diversity had the positive direct effects on overstorey aboveground biomass. Overstorey species diversity significantly promoted the understorey species diversity, but DBH variation and aboveground biomass of overstorey strata had negligible effects on the diversity and aboveground biomass of understorey strata. Soil nutrients had positive direct effect on overstorey DBH variation, but negative direct effects on overstorey and understorey aboveground biomass and overstorey species diversity. These results provide strong evidence for the niche complementarity effect for driving positive relationships of species diversity and individual tree size variation with aboveground biomass at overstorey strata. The strong and consistent negative effects of soil nutrients on overstorey aboveground biomass and species diversity suggest an important mechanism that high species diversity of overstorey strata with great tree size variation on nutrient-poor soils is crucial for driving high aboveground biomass in subtropical forest ecosystems. In conclusion, this study suggests that no sole and ubiquitous relationship between biodiversity and aboveground biomass exists in a structurally complex forest, but rather that the magnitude and direction of this relationship is greatly dependent on the forest strata where available resources shift substantially. We argue that ecological models for predicting aboveground biomass would be improved by including separate effects of overstorey and understorey diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphatase enzymes regulate organic phosphorus (OP) turnover in eutrophic wetland soils, but a clear understanding of their relationships remains elusive. In this study, soil samples were collected from rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of three dominant aquatic plants Phragmites communis, Zizania latifolia, and Scirpus planiculmis in Yeyahu Wetland of Beijing, China to investigate the phosphatase enzyme activities, including phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase and phytase, and the impact on OP turnover dynamics in wetlands. Results demonstrated that soil phosphatase activities in rhizosphere were higher than those in non-rhizosphere for all the three plants. Phosphatase activities were correlated strongly with soil labile organic P, although the relationships showed different trends for the three kinds of phosphatases. Moderate liable organic P had a positive correlation to phosphomonoesterase (r = 0.367, P < 0.01) and phosphodiesterase (r = 0.564, P < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between highly resistant organic P and phytase (r = -0.438, P < 0.05), indicating that phytase had obvious effects on the process of degrading highly stable P compounds in soils. These results suggest that phosphatase enzymes regulated OP turnover to increase available P and phytase had a strong impact on wetland P cycle system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims
   The vegetation on Brazilian Paramos consists of assemblages that are driven mainly by the influence of strong environmental filtering. It is very important to understand the effect of environmental variation on taxonomic diversity and on functional diversity. Considering the lack of information about the functional diversity in Brazilian Paramos, we analyzed for the first time the effects of altitude and edaphic attributes on functional traits, as well as on taxonomic and functional diversity. We also wanted to answer the questions: Which ecological strategies are favorable in high-altitude grassland? Does soil attributes determine distributions of traits in high-altitude grassland? Considering the studied altitudinal gradient is altitude an important variable in the community assembly?
   Methods
   The study was conducted on three mountains: Mammoth (1850 m), Elephant (1790 m) and Totem (1690 m) in Serra do Brigadeiro State Park, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Those mountains represent the 'Serra das Cabecas', a smaller ridge that is surrounded by the Atlantic Forest, one of the 25 hotspot of biodiversity. The samples were taken using 100 plots of 1 m(2) per mountain that were randomly distributed. All plants except mosses were sampled. The taxonomic diversity was evaluated using richness, Shannon diversity, effective number of species and Pielou evenness. For the functional diversity, we considered the functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence. Generalized linear models (GLM/Poisson and quasi-Poisson) were used to evaluate the effect of abiotic variables (altitude, soil depth and soil chemical attributes) on biotic variables (number of species and individuals, life form, dispersal and fruit type) and ordinary least squares regression to evaluate the effect of abiotic variables on the functional and taxonomic diversity.
   Important Findings
   The soil variables presented a considerable edaphic gradient associated with altitude. The soil in Serra das Cabecas plays an important role for the plant diversity: richness and diversity index were positively related with fertility. With regard to the life form, nanophanerophytes tended to increase with altitude and soil depth, while therophytes tended to decrease with altitude. The dispersal type was also associated with the abiotic variables: autochory decreases with altitude, while zoochory increases. Functional richness increases with fertility and the functional evenness with altitude. The studied gradient showed that altitude is working as a filter for functional traits and indices and is, together with soil attributes, an important determinant for the distribution of plants on Brazilian Paramos.

AB The emerging consensus posits that ultraviolet (UV) radiation accelerates litter decomposition in xeric environments mainly by preconditioning litter for subsequent microbial decomposition. However, how UV radiation affects the interactions among litter chemistry, microbes, and eventually litter mass during different decomposition stages is still poorly understood.
   Here, we conducted a 29-month in situ decomposition experiment with litter exposed to ambient and reduced UV in a semi-arid grassland.
   The decomposition rate for Cleistogenes squarrosa and Stipa krylovii under ambient UV was 82 and 111% greater than that under reduced UV, respectively. UV's positive effect showed three-stage temporal dynamics. During the early stage, UV had no impact on either litter chemistry or mass loss. During the intermediate stage, UV decreased litter carbon concentration and increased dissolved organic carbon concentration, but still had no effect on litter mass. During the late stage, UV exposure increased microbial population size in the surface soil and significantly increased litter mass loss.
   Overall, our study suggested that UV exposure accelerated litter decomposition first by improving litter biodegradability during the intermediate stage and then by enhancing microbial decomposition during the late stage. More long-term photodegradation experiments are needed to explore the biotic and abiotic interactions during different decomposition stages.

AB 1. Uptake of environmental contaminants by lower trophic groups can have negative effects on higher trophic groups. This study tested the ability of selenium, an environmental contaminant found in high concentrations throughout the tissues of certain accumulating plants, to be transferred to ants via aphid tissue and honeydew.
   2. Plants of the selenium accumulator, Raphanus sativus (wild radish), were watered with three different selenium treatments (0, 0.25 or 0.5 mu g Se ml(-1)). Aphids, Myzus persicae, and Argentine ant colonies, Linepithema humile, were added to each caged plant and allowed to interact freely, Ant colonies were supplemented with one of three different food options to encourage the consumption of aphids, aphid honeydew, or aphids and honeydew.
   3. The accumulation of selenium by each trophic group and a trophic transfer factor (TTF) was calculated, The TTF for plants to aphids was > 1, indicating biomagnification, whereas the TTF for aphids to worker ants was < 1, indicating only biotransfer. Accumulated levels by worker ants did not statistically differ as a result of diet.
   4. The amounts of selenium acquired by ants as a factor of diet and caste were compared. Plants, aphids and worker ants accumulated selenium in a dose-dependent manner. Ant queens did not contain detectable amounts of selenium. Honeydew contained comparable amounts of selenium to plant selenium. levels.
   5. Access to toxic compounds via honeydew and insect protein may have negative effects On the range, expansion of invasive species, such as the Argentine ant.

AB Ecosystems worldwide have a long history of use and management by indigenous cultures. However, environmental degradation can reduce the availability of culturally important resources. Ecological restoration aims to repair damage to ecosystems caused by human activity, but it is unclear how often restoration projects incorporate the return of harvesting or traditional life patterns for indigenous communities. We examined the incorporation of cultural use of natural resources into ecological restoration in the context of a culturally important but protected New Zealand bird; among award-winning restoration projects in Australasia and worldwide; and in the peer-reviewed restoration ecology literature. Among New Zealand's culturally important bird species, differences in threat status and availability for hunting were large. These differences indicate the values of a colonizing culture can inhibit harvesting by indigenous people. In Australasia among award-winning ecological restoration projects, <17% involved human use of restored areas beyond aesthetic or recreational use, despite many projects encouraging community participation. Globally, restoration goals differed among regions. For example, in North America, projects were primarily conservation oriented, whereas in Asia and Africa projects frequently focused on restoring cultural harvesting. From 1995 to 2014, the restoration ecology literature contained few references to cultural values or use. We argue that restoration practitioners are missing a vital component for reassembling functional ecosystems. Inclusion of sustainably harvestable areas within restored landscapes may allow for the continuation of traditional practices that shaped ecosystems for millennia, and also aid project success by ensuring community support.

AB Although hunting is a key component of subsistence strategies of many Amazonians, it is also one of the greatest threats to wildlife. Because indigenous reserves comprise over 20% of Amazonia, effective conservation often requires that conservation professionals work closely with indigenous groups to manage resource use. We used hunter-generated harvesting data in spatially explicit biodemographic models to assess the sustainability of subsistence hunting of indigenous Waiwai in Guyana. We collected data through a hunter self-monitoring program, systematic follows of hunters, and semistructured interviews. We used these data to predict future densities of 2 indicator species, spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus) and bearded sakis (Chiropotes sagulatus), under different scenarios of human population expansion and changing hunting technology. We used encounter rates from transect surveys and hunter catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) to validate model predictions. Paca (Cuniculus paca) (198 /year), Currosaw (Crax alector) (168), and spider monkey (117) were the most frequently harvested species. Predicted densities of spider monkeys were statistically indistinguishable from empirically derived transect data (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D = 0.67, p = 0.759) and CPUE (D = 0.32, p = 1.000), demonstrating the robustness of model predictions. Ateles paniscus and C. sagulatus were predicted to be extirpated from <13% of the Waiwai reserve in 20 years, even under the most intensive hunting scenarios. Our results suggest Waiwai hunting is currently sustainable, primarily due to their low population density and use of bow and arrow. Continual monitoring is necessary, however, particularly if human population increases are accompanied by a switch to shotgun-only hunting. We suggest that hunter self-monitoring and biodemographic modeling can be used effectively in a comanagement approach in which indigenous parabiologists continuously provide hunting data that is then used to update model parameters and validate model predictions.

AB Producing and retaining leaves underlie the performance and survivorship of seedlings in deeply shaded tropical forests. These habitats are characterized by conditions ideal for foliar bacteria, which can be potent plant pathogens. Leaf production, retention and susceptibility to enemies may ultimately depend upon interactions among soil nutrients and foliar microbes, yet this has never been tested.
   We experimentally evaluated the degree that foliar bacteria and soil resource supply mediate leaf dynamics for five common tree species (five different families) in a Panamanian forest. We reduced foliar bacteria with antibiotics for 29 months and measured leaf production, retention and damage for seedlings nested within a replicated 15-yr factorial nutrient enrichment experiment (nitrogen, N; phosphorus, P; potassium, K).
   Our results demonstrate that when we applied antibiotics, soil nutrients - particularly N - always regulated seedling leaf production (and to a lesser extent herbivore damage) for all five tree species. In addition, it was common for two macronutrients together to negate or completely reverse the impact of applying either one alone.
   Our findings of frequent plant-microbe-nutrient interactions are novel and suggest that these interactions may reinforce plant species-environment associations, thereby creating a fairly cryptic and fine-scale dimension of niche differentiation for coexisting tree species.

AB Ecological restoration of forests is largely favored by tree planting, often leaving out other important growth forms. Despite their relevant ecological roles, in restoration plantations, epiphytic richness rarely reaches values found in reference ecosystems. At the same time, epiphytes are wasted when forests are cleared for infrastructure projects, instead of being properly relocated. The goal of this study is to improve the knowledge for epiphytic relocation and enrichment, in restoration forests. We seek to answer the following questions: (i) Over a one year period, can six species of epiphytes survive, attach to phorophytes and reproduce, after being transplanted to host trees? (ii) Is epiphyte development after transplantation affected by species of phorophytes, bark roughness, canopy cover and position of transplantation? (iii) Is performance of relocated epiphytes species specific? For this purpose, 360 adult individuals of vascular epiphytes (Bromeliaceae, Cactaceae and Orchidaceae) were transplanted onto host trees located in two semi -deciduous seasonal forests in the Atlantic Forest of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Epiphytes achieved high survival rates after one year (55.2-100% of individuals) and all species presented structures for either sexual or asexual reproduction. Their overall development was enhanced when we carried out transplantations at the beginning of wet season and using sisal string to attach epiphytes and palm fiber to cover phorophyte's bark, which were relevant factors attributing to the success of transplantations. Species of phorophyte was not an attributing factor to the successful development of transplanted individuals, which only showed slight responses to conditions they provided. However, responses among epiphytes were species specific, demonstrating the importance of studying their biology in order to successfully enrich restoration forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background
   Woody plant diversity from the Amazonian savannas has been poorly quantified. In order to improve the knowledge on wood plants of these regional ecosystems, a tree inventory was carried out in four different habitats used by indigenous people living in the savanna areas of the Northern Brazilian Amazon. The habitats were divided into two types (or groups) of vegetation formations: forest (riparian forest, forest island, and buritizal = Mauritia palm formation) and non-forest (typical savanna). The inventory was carried out in two hectares established in the Darora Indigenous Community region, north of the state of Roraima.
   New information
   The typical savanna is the most densely populated area (709 stems ha(-1)); however, it has the lowest tree species richness (nine species, seven families) in relation to typical forest habitats: riparian forest (22 species, 13 families and 202 stems ha(-1)), forest islands (13 species, 10 families and 264 stems ha(-1)), and buritizal (19 species, 15 families and 600 stems ha(-1)). The tree structure (density and dominance) of the forest habitats located in the savanna areas studied in this work is smaller in relation to forest habitats derived from continuous areas of other parts of the Amazon. These environments are derived from Paleoclimatic fragmentation, and are currently affected by the impact of intensive use of natural resources as timberselective logging and some land conversion for agriculture.

AB Background. Why biodiversity is not uniformly distributed on the Earth is a major research question of biogeography. One of the most striking patterns of disparity in species distribution are the biodiversity hotspots, which generally do not fit with the distribution of relevant components of the Neotropical biota. In this study, we assess the proximal causes of the species-richness pattern of one of the most conspicuous groups of Neotropical mammals, the New World monkeys the Platyrrhini. We test two complementary hypotheses: (1) there is a historical source-sink dynamic (addressed using macroevolutionary and macroecological approaches); (2) the large number of species in the Amazon basin is due to the constraints imposed by environmental variables occurring outside this area.
   Methods. We first characterize spatial patterns of species richness and biodiversity hotspots using a new, objective protocol based on probabilities. Then we evaluate the source-sink hypothesis using BioGeoBEARS analysis and nestedness analysis of species richness patterns. Complementarily, to measure how often different species pairs appear in the same sites, we used null models to estimate the checkerboard score index (C-score). Finally, we evaluate the relationship between several climatic variables and species richness through ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial autoregressive (SAR) models, and the potential environmental constraints on the pattern.
   Results. We found one significant cluster of high values for species richness in the Amazon basin. Most dispersal events occurred from the Amazonian subregion to other Neotropical areas. Temperature (T), discrepancy (BR), and NODF indexes show a significant nesting in the matrix ordered by species richness and available energy. The C-score observed was significantly smaller than the null expectation for all sites in the Neotropics where there are records of platyrrhine species. Ten climatic variables comprised the best-fitting model that explains species richness. OLS and SAR models show that this set of variables explains 69.9% and 64.2% of species richness, respectively. Potential of evapotranspiration is the most important variable within this model, showing a linear positive relationship with species richness, and clear lower and upper limits to the species richness distribution.
   Discussion. We suggest that New World monkeys historically migrated from their biodiversity hotspot (energetically optimal areas for most platyrrine species) to adjacent, energetically suboptimal areas, and that the different dispersal abilities of these species, the lack of competitive interactions at a macroecological scale, and environmental constraints (i.e., energy availability, seasonality) are key elements which explain the non-uniform pattern of species richness for this clade.

AB Effects of biodiversity on productivity are more likely to be expressed when there is greater potential for niche complementarity. In soil, chemically complex pools of nutrient resources should provide more opportunities for niche complementarity than chemically simple pools. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal genotypes can exhibit substantial variation in nutrient acquisition traits and are key components of soil biodiversity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that increasing the chemical complexity and forms of soil nutrients would enhance the effects of intraspecific ECM diversity on host plant and fungal productivity. In pure culture, we found substantial variation in growth of strains of the ECM fungus Laccaria bicolor on a range of inorganic and organic forms of nutrients. Subsequent experiments examined the effects of intraspecific identity and richness using Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings colonized with different strains of L. bicolor growing on substrates supplemented with either inorganic or organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. Intraspecific identity effects on plant productivity were only found under the inorganic nutrient amendment, whereas intraspecific identity affected fungal productivity to a similar extent under both nutrient treatments. Overall, there were no significant effects of intraspecific richness on plant and fungal productivity. Our findings suggest soil nutrient composition does not interact strongly with ECM intraspecific richness, at least under experimental conditions where mineral nutrients were not limiting. Under these conditions, intraspecific identity of ECM fungi becomes more important than richness in modulating plant and fungal performance.

AB Introduced species have the potential to become invasive and jeopardize entire ecosystems. The success of species establishing viable populations outside their original extent depends primarily on favorable climatic conditions in the invasive ranges. Species distribution modeling (SDM) can thus be used to estimate potential habitat suitability for populations of invasive species. Here we review the status of six amphibian species with invasive populations in Brazil (four domestic species and two imported species). We (i) modeled the current habitat suitability and future potential distribution of these six focal species, (ii) reported on the disease status of Eleutherodactylus johnstonei and Phyllodytes luteolus, and (iii) quantified the acoustic overlap of P. luteolus and Leptodactylus labyrinthicus with three cooccurring native species. Our models indicated that all six invasive species could potentially expand their ranges in Brazil within the next few decades. In addition, our SDMs predicted important expansions in available habitat for 2 out of 6 invasive species under future (2100) climatic conditions. We detected high acoustic niche overlap between invasive and native amphibian species, underscoring that acoustic interference might reduce mating success in local frogs. Despite the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus being recognized as a potential reservoir for the frog-killing fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in Brazil, we did not detect Bd in the recently introduced population of E. johnstonei and P. luteolus in the State of Sao Paulo. We emphasize that the number of invasive amphibian species in Brazil is increasing exponentially, highlighting the urgent need to monitor and control these populations and decrease potential impacts on the locally biodiverse wildlife.

AB Fire is a major environmental factor influencing vegetation heterogeneity, with closed forest and savanna ecosystems having different management needs due to their different responses to fire disturbance. However, the differences in post-fire vegetation dynamics between these ecosystems have seldom been compared using a uniform set of parameters. Additionally, post-fire dynamics of forest-savanna ecotones is poorly characterized. With the hypothesis that closed forest, savannas and ecotones will exhibit different post-fire responses, we studied the vegetation diversity, structure and dynamics in an upland forest savanna vegetation mosaic in Minas Gerais, Brazil following a fire that occurred in September 2011. In January 2012, we identified, tagged, and measured the basal diameter of all regenerating juvenile tree stems within forty-six 4 m(2) plots in closed forest, savanna and ecotone vegetation, and conducted recensuses in 2013 and 2014. We modelled the relationship between short-term dynamics parameters (recruitment, mortality, basal area loss and gain, and the turnover and net changes in the number of individual stems and basal areas) and vegetation type. Species diversity was higher in closed forests and ecotones than in savanna. Across all vegetation types, stem density decreased and basal area increased. Parameters such as recruitment, net changes in the number of individuals, and the gain, loss and turnover in basal area did not differ across vegetation types. However, stem mortality was higher in closed forest and ecotones combined than in savannas, and the net change in the number of individuals was the lowest in the savanna. Overall, our results support that within a climatically-similar vegetation mosaic, closed forests exhibit different post-fire regeneration dynamics from savanna as expected. Ecotones exhibited post-fire responses and dynamics more similar to closed forests than to savanna, but more studies will be needed to establish if this pattern is applicable to other areas.

AB Fires have influenced atmospheric composition and climate since the rise of vascular plants, and satellite data have shown the overall global extent of fires. Our knowledge of historic fire emissions has progressively improved over the past decades due mostly to the development of new proxies and the improvement of fire models. Currently, there is a suite of proxies including sedimentary charcoal records, measurements of fire-emitted trace gases and black carbon stored in ice and firn, and visibility observations. These proxies provide opportunities to extrapolate emission estimates back in time based on satellite data starting in 1997, but each proxy has strengths and weaknesses regarding, for example, the spatial and temporal extents over which they are representative. We developed a new historic biomass burning emissions dataset starting in 1750 that merges the satellite record with several existing proxies and uses the average of six models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) protocol to estimate emissions when the available proxies had limited coverage. According to our approach, global biomass burning emissions were relatively constant, with 10-year averages varying between 1.8 and 2.3 PgC yr(-1). Carbon emissions increased only slightly over the full time period and peaked during the 1990s after which they decreased gradually. There is substantial uncertainty in these estimates, and patterns varied depending on choices regarding data representation, especially on regional scales. The observed pattern in fire carbon emissions is for a large part driven by African fires, which accounted for 58% of global fire carbon emissions. African fire emissions declined since about 1950 due to conversion of savanna to cropland, and this decrease is partially compensated for by increasing emissions in deforestation zones of South America and Asia. These global fire emission estimates are mostly suited for global analyses and will be used in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations.

AB Explanations for the occurrence of hysteresis (asynchronicity) between diel soil respiration (R-s) and soil temperature (T-s) have evoked both biological and physical mechanisms. The specifics of these explanations, however, tend to vary with the particular ecosystem or biome being investigated. So far, the relative degree of control of biological and physical processes on hysteresis is not clear for drylands. This study examined the seasonal variation in diel hysteresis and its biological control in a desert-shrub ecosystem in northwest (NW) China. The study was based on continuous measurements of R-s, air temperature (T-a)temperature at the soil surface and below (T-surf and T-s ) volumetric soil water content (SWC), and photosynthesis in a dominant desert shrub (i.e., Artemisia ordosica) over an entire year in 2013. Trends in diel R-s were observed to vary with SWC over the growing season (April to October). Diel variations in R-s were more closely associated with variations in T-surf than with photosynthesis as SWC increased, leading to R-s being in phase with T-surf, particularly when SWC>0.08m(3) m(-3) (ratio of SWC to soil porosity = 0.26). However, as SWC decreased below 0.08m(3) m(-)3, diel variations in R-s were more closely related to variations in photosynthesis, leading to pronounced hysteresis between R-s and T-surf. Incorporating photosynthesis into a Q10-function eliminated 84.2% of the observed hysteresis, increasing the overall descriptive capability of the function. Our findings highlight a high degree of control by photosynthesis and SWC in regulating seasonal variation in diel hysteresis between R-s and temperature.

AB This review covers long-term ecological studies in Central America, South America, and Antarctica that include at least 10 years of data on both terrestrial and marine mammals as well as birds. Specifically, we compiled long-term research on social systems, population ecology, and community ecology. Long-term research is necessary to understand decadal trends and dynamics that would otherwise go unnoticed in short-term studies. This review highlights the impact of ecological conditions as well as territoriality and conflict on social organization and structure, the role that environmental perturbations and climate change have on populations, and how interaction between biotic and abiotic factors influence entire ecological communities. It especially highlights the need for additional long-term studies to assess climate change trends and the ecological changes that will follow.

AB The best-known mechanism that herbivory affects species coexistence of tree seedlings is negative density-dependency driven by specialist natural enemies. However, in a forest with intense herbivory by non-specialists, what causes a diversifying seedling bank if rare species do not benefit from negative density-dependency in dominant species? We hypothesize that generalist herbivores can cause unevenly distributed species-specific mortality, which mediates recruitment dynamics and therefore affects species coexistence. To answer this question, we conducted a fence-control experiment in a montane cloud forest, Taiwan, and found that herbivorous damages were mainly caused by ungulates, which are generalists. We explored ungulate herbivory effects on recruitment dynamics by censusing tree seedling dynamics for three years. We found that herbivorous damages by ungulates significantly cause seedling death, mostly at their early stage of establishment. The percentage of death caused by herbivory varied among species. In particular, nurse plants and seedling initial height help shade-tolerant species to persist under such intense herbivory. Whereas, deaths caused by other factors occurred more often in older seedlings, with a consistent low percentage among species. We then tested species coexistence maintenance by dynamic modelling under different scenarios of ungulate herbivory. Raising percentages of death by herbivory changes relative species abundances by suppressing light-demanding species and increasing shade-tolerant species. Density-dependent mortality immediately after bursts of recruitments can suppress dominance of abundant species. With ungulate herbivory, fluctuating recruitment further prevent rare species from apparent competition induced by abundant species. Such bio-processes can interact with ungulate herbivory so that long-term coexistence can be facilitated.

AB Forest fragmentation and the associated potential habitat loss is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. One strategy that promotes its maintenance at a landscape scale is the establishment of biological corridors that enhance structural and functional connectivity of the biotic components. However, the applicability and functionality of this tool is limited due to the lack of planning at the moment of the design and establishment of corridors or connectivity networks that are guided by detailed and rigorous methods. In this research, we developed a theoretical proposal of ecological connectivity for the Santa Elena village, Medellin municipality, Colombia, using tools from landscape ecology. Initially, 21 forest fragments or nucleus were selected based on their minimum size (larger than 5 ha), core area (larger than 1 ha), and shape index (rounded or nearly rounded). Then, based on a friction matrix, we designed a potential network that would allow to connect 1356.35 ha of remnants forests through 31 ecological corridors of 100 m wide, comprising 208.33 ha in total. Finally, we discussed the importance of promoting this kind of strategies based on landscape ecology that enhance both habitat conservation and landscape connectivity in areas near large Latin-American cities.

AB Improved knowledge of climate interactions and effects on the development of plant species is essential in order to define management strategies aimed at increasing production. This study aimed to compare one silvopastoral system with native species and a forest in the secondary stage of succession, through the analysis of the influence that climate variables temperature and rainfall have on the chronologies of growth of Araucaria angustifolia. Nondestructive samples were collected from 60 subjects per site and made correlations between chronologies and annual climatic variables and monthly averages. Rainfall was significantly correlated in october in both locations, while the average temperature in october and january showed a significant negative correlation in the area regeneration. The species showed a similar pattern of growth during this period, being common the influence of precipitation in october, when there is renewed growth. The non-similarity of chronologies seems to be related to the effect of temperature between different locations, since the secondary forests have demonstrated negative influence on growth during the rainy months of the year historically.

AB This paper examines the historical drivers and barriers of three mitigation actions in Brazil: the expansion of no-till agriculture, reduction of deforestation, and increased displacement of gasoline with ethanol. The characteristics of these three economic changes align with evolutionary economic theories rather than neoclassical or environmental economics. Despite its cost-effectiveness, diffusion of no-till agriculture was contingent on social learning and flows of information within the agricultural regime. Brazil's success in reducing deforestation rates was driven not by policies that changed the microeconomic calculation of farmers, but by command-and-control policies on deforestation enabled through landscape shifts. Brazil's ethanol biofuels industry emerged due to both niche level innovation of ethanol production systems and pure-ethanol vehicles, and shifts at the landscape level that enabled mandated fuel blends, public procurement programmes, and public investment in R&D. These three economic changes correspond with the categories of reproduction, transformation and transition, respectively. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Among the many Magnolia species that are endangered by anthropogenic disturbance, some are known to have the capacity to produce new shoots. Demographic studies are an important tool to evaluate the impact of disturbances as well as the resilience and resistance of endangered species. Our study looked at the demographic dynamics of two Magnolia schiedeana populations, with an aim to determine the role played by disturbances. The questions were: 1) what demographic trends characterize this species? 2) What differences are there between disturbed and undisturbed populations? 3) Is M. schiedeana a disturbance-resilient species in general? 4) How important is the contribution of the resprouting trait to lambda in a population under anthropogenic disturbance? The demographic attributes evaluated were: elasticity, population growth rate (lambda), and sensitivity to concrete disturbances (LTRE, Life Table Response Experiment). The results indicated that the lambda of the two populations did not differ significantly. The transitions that contributed the most to lambda and presented the largest variation were similar in both populations under study. More than 90% of the contribution came from those individuals measuring < 5 cm in diameter. Surprisingly, M. schiedeana is not sensitive to moderate anthropogenic disturbance. Resprouting contributed to lambda with less than 0.2%. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB We compared the ability of physiological and morphological adaptations of the invasive Bidens pilosa L. and the native Bidens bipinnata L. under different light intensities (LI). The morphological and physiological characteristics of the invasive B. pilosa were compared with B. bipinnata at 3-Light intensities (Control (100% full sunlight), 40% full sunlight and 10% full sunlight) for 64 days. Decreased LI significantly decreased the germination and root and shoot biomasses but significantly increased the leaf biomass of both plant species. Under the same LI the invasive species B. pilosa higher leaf mass ratio (LMR), total leaf area (LA), relative growth rate (RGR), maximum net photosynthesis rate (P-max), light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point (LCP) and dark respiration (R-d) and lower root mass ratio (RMR), stem mass ratio (SMR) and root mass/crown mass (R/C) than in B. bipinnata. Decrease in LI significantly reduced the photosynthesis efficiency of the non-invasive B. bipinnata compared with the invasive B. pilosa. The higher photosynthetic response of B. pilosa to variable lighting conditions also indicated its better competitive ability. Our results provide key information concerning the effects of light intensity on the growth and photosynthetic characteristics of B. pilosa and B. bipinnata and indicated that former exhibits greater physiological and morphological adaptation to different light intensities, which facilitates its further invasion.

AB Policy instruments for implementing the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+) mechanism operate within an orchestra of policy mixes that affect the forest and other land sectors. How will policymakers choose between the myriad of options for distributing REDD+ benefits, and be able to evaluate its potential effectiveness, efficiency and equity (3Es)? This is a pressing issue given the results-based aspect of REDD+. We present here a three-element assessment framework for evaluating the outcomes and performance of REDD+ benefit sharing mechanisms, using the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and equity: (1) the structures (objective and policies) of a REDD+ benefit sharing mechanism; (2) the broader institutional and policy contexts underlying forest governance; (3) outcomes of REDD+ including emission reductions, ecosystem service provision and poverty alleviation. A strength of the assessment framework is its flexible design to incorporate indicators relevant to different contexts; this helps to generate a shared working understanding of what is to be evaluated in the different REDD+ benefit sharing mechanisms (BSMs) across complex socio-political contexts. In applying the framework to case studies, the assessment highlights trade-offs among the 3Es, and the need to better manage access to information, monitoring and evaluation, consideration of local perceptions of equity and inclusive decisionmaking processes. The framework does not aim to simplify complexity, but rather serves to identify actionable ways forward towards a more efficient, effective and equitable implementation and re-evaluation of REDD+ BSMs as part of reflexive policymaking.

AB The relationship between populations of marine organisms and physicochemical gradients directly influence distributions of species within associated seascapes. This study examines the impact that exposure to sunlight and substrate type has on the distribution of decapods in a tropical coastal reef environment. The study was performed at night when the species are at their most active using a visual census methodology to observe the natural nocturnal behaviour. The research revealed the existence of three distinct habitats housing specific decapod assemblages within tropical hard substrate environments; the External-Reef habitat which accommodates colonial benthic host decapods; the Crevicular-Reef habitat which accommodates the reef-stygofauna; and the Interface habitat between the reef and soft substrate which is habituated by transient decapod species. The findings extend the previous zonation patterns for decapods to the subtidal zone using physical parameters as the rationale defining allocation. The study collated and reviewed documented taxonomic and ecological evidence which supports this division of decapods into similar reef seascapes worldwide. It further proposes that this format of subtidal zonation may be applicable on a global scale to species which inhabit a comparable ecological niche within tropical zones.

AB Tropical forests are three-dimensional spaces with species and resources heterogeneously distributed. The vertical stratification of tropical forest biotas has been observed for several organisms and regions, but, surprisingly, the vertical structuring of large areas of important tropical forests, such as Brazil's Atlantic Forest, remains poorly studied. Here, we addressed the use of different Atlantic Forest strata by bats, comparing ensemble composition and relative abundance between the understorey and the canopy. A total of 618 bats belonging to 31 species and four families were recorded, including 11 species of frugivores and seven species of gleaning insectivores, the two trophic guilds predominantly represented in our sampling. Fifteen species were captured exclusively in the canopy, and six exclusively in the understorey, and many of those species were represented by a low number of captures (<5). The bat species composition, richness and relative abundance between canopy and understorey strata varied. Chiroderma villosum was exclusively captured in the canopy, Artibeus lituratus was netted predominantly in the canopy and Carollia perspicillata and Desmodus rotundus were mostly captured in the understorey. Although processes such as resource partitioning between species and ecomorphological constraints may explain the differential use of forest strata, this remains little understood because of the scarcity of data for the Atlantic forest canopies.

AB The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is at the moment one of the largest and most widely used biodiversity databases. Nevertheless, there are still some limitations, e.g. in terms of plant species status (native vs. non-native) and geographic resolution of records. At the same time, it is well known that alien plant invasions in inland freshwaters can alter community structure, ecosystem functions and services with significant negative impacts on biodiversity and human activities. We assessed if the GBIF database has a geospatial homogeneous information for native and non-native aquatic plant species for South America and whether or not literature resources not yet digitalized (floras, checklists and other papers) could provide additional information. We selected a set of 40 native and 40 non-native aquatic species. These 80 species included a sub-set of 40 alien species previously evaluated with the USAqWRA scheme (US Aquatic Weed Risk Assessment). Species with non-reliable identification, duplicates of the same collection, records poorly georeferenced were removed from the dataset. New records were manually compiled through classical literature research. All the georeferenced records (GBIF + literature) were used for the mapping and the comparative analysis. As a result, we can conclude that the two datasets provide quite significantly different information and the combination of the two offers new information that would not exist in a single data source. Nevertheless, a careful quality evaluation of the primary information, both in the case of literature and GBIF should be conducted, before the data is used for further analyses.

AB Understanding and predicting adaptations in body size of megabenthic invertebrates remains a major challenge in marine macroecology. This study was conducted in order to investigate size variations of benthic megafauna in the tropics and to identify the effect of biotic and abiotic factors that may produce changes to these organisms, testing unresolved hypothesis and paradigms of deep sea ecology from subtropical and temperate areas. The study area covered the continental shelf of the Colombian Caribbean. The samples were collected during 1998, 2001 and 2005, using semi-globe demersal net for a water depth of 10 to 500 m. The most common species were selected for further study: Eudoliwn crosseanwn, Cosmioconcha niters, Nuculana acuta (mollusks), Astropecten alligator, Brissopsis atlantica, B. elongata (equinoderms), Anasinnts Chasmocarcinus cylindricus and Achelous spinicarpus (crustaceans). Generalized Additive Models were used to detect significant changes in size and to infer the effects of biotic and environmental factors on organisms' size. The dependent variable was size and the predicting model variables were depth, temperature, intraspecific density, interspecific density, richness, latitude, and longitude. A total of 7000 individuals were measured. Six species showed an increase in body size towards deeper and colder sites. These species inhabit shallow and deep environments that exceed a variation in temperature of 10 degrees C. There was a remarkable size reduction in areas affected by the Magdalena River, possibly due to major physicochemical changes caused by the river. This region has the lowest planktonic primary productivity within the study area. An increase in sizes was observed north of the Magdalena River (74 degrees - 71 degrees W & 11 degrees - 13 degrees N), which may be attributable to the coastal upwelling occurring in this part of Colombia. The relationship between the density of benthic organisms and size was not clear. However, five species showed an inverse relation with intraspecific density and three with interspecific density. Temperature and depth were the variables that best explained the variations in size. Most of the studied species showed an increase in body size when temperature dropped along the bathymetric range. The trend of increasing size in deeper zones is contrary to the prediction of the optimal size theoretical model (but consistent with recent studies), which indicates a reduction in organisms' size in the deep sea, due to food limitation with increasing depth. It is possible that this increase in size is an adaptation to maximize energy, which is frequently observed in the coldest habitats of several species. Future studies in Caribbean should examine variations in size of benthic megafauna towards deeper zones (more than 500 m), were temperature is less variable and then other factors can play a more important role determining the size of these organisms.

AB The humid montane forest in Mexico, where ferns and lycophytes are diverse and abundant, is the richest ecosystem floristically per unit area. However, there are few comparative studies using a standard methodology on how richness and species composition change in different areas of this type of forest. Therefore, we sampled 10- 13 plots of 20 x 20 m each in 3 areas of this forest at the 2 main volcanoes in the region of Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz. We compared species richness and analyzed floristic similarity by Anosim and non- metric multidimensional scaling ( NMDS); we also identified the species that contribute most to the dissimilarity. Within our plots, we recorded 71 species of ferns and 3 of lycophytes in 37 genera and 15 families. Differences in species richness in the 3 areas were not significant, whereas species composition showed significant differences. These differences can be explained by the presence of unique species or contrasting frequencies between areas whose characteristics appear to be strongly related to the microclimate and soil, as well as to the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. The high variation in the floristic composition per area is relevant for proposing conservation strategies of these plants at the regional level.

AB Phenology and the floral visitors of Puya nitida and Puya trianae were evaluated at a paramo region of Chingaza National Natural Park, Colombia. During 1 year, field trips were made and diverse aspects of their spatial distribution, floral morphology and phenology, and their floral visitors were registered. Both, P. nitida and P. trianae present similar floral morphology fitting to ornithophily, but with differences in size and length of reproductive structures; both are separated spatially being dominant in different altitude and habitats; bloom in different times of the year indicating a clear temporal separation on blooming patterns. Both plants share visits from 2 bird species that because of their body differences can be adjusted to the flowers to place the pollen on different parts of their bodies and transport it to the correct plant in each visit. All these floral mechanisms from a spatio-temporal perspective, enable the use of the pollinators by P. nitida and P. trianae successfully, allowing coexistence among these 2 bromeliads, decreasing negative effects that may have in the pollen flow, outcrossing, and finally, in their sexual reproduction.

AB The tobacco and sugarcane industries play an important role in the national economy of Malawi. Collectively, they account for approximately 79 and 22% of the national foreign exchange earnings and gross domestic product, respectively. However, the sustainable production of high-quality tobacco and sugarcane has been threatened due to the continued deterioration of forest ecosystems. Considering the importance of tobacco/sugarcane production for the national economy and rural livelihoods, there is an urgent need to implement effectively different forest conservation initiatives in the country. Considering the complex linkages at the interface of deforestation, sugarcane/tobacco production, and economic activity, this is a complicated task that must be undertaken by both the government and tobacco/sugarcane companies. Incentive-based forest conservation management approaches, including Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes, can be one of the approaches that can help curb deforestation. However, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding how the private sector can be meaningfully involved in PES schemes, especially in developing country contexts. This paper draws on expert interviews with multiple stakeholders at the interface of tobacco/sugarcane production and forest conservation in Malawi to highlight the role of the private sector in promoting forest conservation among farming communities and the potential for participating in PES schemes. Different forest conservation initiatives are currently being implemented by the sugarcane and tobacco sector, but are not coordinated. While PES schemes are currently not operational in Malawi, there seems to be a relatively high support among private companies towards such incentive-based conservation mechanisms. The introduction of PES schemes as corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects or on a credit-based form (e.g., as conditionality to access credit for farm inputs or eligibility to be contracted to farm tobacco/sugarcane) could be the most appropriate structures for effectively involving the private sector. Establishing an independent multi-stakeholder PES coordination committee would be necessary for the effective coordination and implementation of such PES schemes. However, any future effort to promote a PES scheme in Malawi needs to informed with on-the-ground knowledge and should be weighed against other forest conservation options.

AB Natural environments on Earth are amenable to a diverse array of chemical reactions that can convert one form of nitrogen into another, often with the participation of additional substances such as minerals, dissolved metals, and organic compounds. These processes collectively define a natural chemical nitrogen cycle, analogous to the familiar biologically driven cycle but even more intricate with respect to the number of pathways by which nitrogen can be transformed and transported across land, air, and water. The fully assembled abiotic nitrogen cycle manifests a landscape rich in opportunities for investigation either with or without parallel attention to biological processes.

AB Despite its advantages over other energy sources, hydropower facilities are recognized as causes of terrestrial and freshwater environmental impacts. A deeper understanding of hydropower effects on surrounding riparian forests is thus important to the development hydropower facilities of less impact on the environment as well as to define criteria to manage the vegetation in the vicinity of large hydroelectric dams. We compared tree community structure on forest slopes exposed to a hydropower reservoir created in 2005 with control ones, in the biodiversity-rich subtropical forests of southern Brazil. Field data were collected between 2009 and 2011 on six forest slopes of which three were affected by the rise in water level caused by a hydropower dam, while the other three were in nearby sites unaffected by damming. Ninety 10 x 10 plots were set along six 50 m x 10 m transects. Forest structure was significantly affected by vicinity of reservoir, but this effect differed significantly between different tributaries of the Pelotas River. Rarefaction curves showed homogeneity in species richness among the studied hills. Composition differed significantly between reservoir and control areas. Variance partition results showed that pure reservoir effects explained a fraction of the variance in floristic composition comparable to environmental factors. Vicinity to reservoir was the main factor able to distinguish between communities in the studied system in a multiple regression tree. Our results highlight that hydroelectric facility building produces more extensive damage to remnant native forests than anticipated and that even forests upslope from reservoir border may suffer rapid structural and compositional degradation due to changes in environmental conditions caused by altered hydrology.

AB The lack of knowledge regarding many aerial insectivorous bats and their relationships with forest characteristics limits conservation decision-making for tropical rainforests and for this important bat group. Therefore, our objective was to understand the effects of forest structure and composition on these bats in the Neotropical evergreen broadleaf forest of Belize, Central America. We conducted bat monitoring and quantified 51 forest characteristics at 24 locations in the Chiquibul Forest Reserve (CFR) from May-July 2014. Simple linear and backward stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to examine relationships between bat richness and activity and forest characteristics. Bat genus richness and total activity were directly related to overstory canopy depth and inversely related to <= 4 structural characteristics. Lasiurus, Myotis, Promops, and Pteronotus spp. were affected by <= 7 forest characteristics; the responses were explained by preferences for less-cluttered, open space for flying and foraging and species-specific food and cover requirements. However, bat richness and activity were often unaffected by forest structure and composition in the CFR, suggesting that at this taxonomic level, bats may not be very sensitive to variation in forest characteristics, may not be very useful indicators of alteration, and may have some tolerance for disturbance and change.

AB Black-breasted Pufflegs (Eriocnemis nigrivestis) are hummingbirds endemic to Ecuador and are considered critically endangered because of their limited distribution, a population estimated at fewer than 1000 individuals, and ongoing habitat degradation. From November 2013 to June 2016, we examined the foraging preferences of these hummingbirds using a combination of direct observations, time-lapse cameras, and motion-detection software. We first identified 21 species of ornithophilous plants distributed among five sites in the northwestern flanks of the Pichincha volcano in northwest Ecuador. We then monitored these plant species using time-lapse cameras and recorded 144 visits by Black-breasted Pufflegs to seven of the 21 species. Most visits (128 of 144 visits, 89%) were to just two species of plants, Macleania rupestris and Palicourea fuchsioides, the latter of which is also an endemic and threatened species. In addition, Black-breasted Pufflegs were only observed in the most pristine habitats. Given the potential negative effects of climate change for species in the tropical Andes plus the possible loss and degradation of habitat resulting from human activities, efforts are needed to conserve habitats currently used by Black-breasted Pufflegs, recover degraded habitats, and connect isolated patches of suitable habitat. Our results concerning species of flowering plants used most by Black-breasted Pufflegs (P.fuchsioides and M.rupestris) should help guide any habitat restoration initiatives.

AB Functional diversity indicators are increasingly used to monitor forest function recovery because they connect biodiversity to ecosystem functions. However, identifying which functions deviate from a reference forest has not received much attention, despite its potential to inform restoration interventions. In this study, we used functional groups to assess the recovery of ecosystem functions in regenerating coastal dune forests. We surveyed birds and trees in forest of different ages and a reference old-growth forest in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We classified species into functional groups for each taxa based on functional traits or a priori defined categories (i.e. guilds) and quantified the number of species within functional groups as a proxy of function stability. Bird species density followed an asymptotic trajectory, reaching old-growth forest values after 25 years. Insectivores and granivores showed saturating trajectories, whereas small frugivores and generalists increased linearly. With the exception of large frugivores, relative abundances of bird functional groups progressed towards old-growth forest values as the forest aged. Tree species density increased linearly with forest age. In contrast to old-growth forests, large-canopy trees and understory shrubs were under-represented, while mid-canopy trees dominated regenerating forests. Our result suggests that most bird, but not tree, functions may have been restored. The trend in large frugivore numbers may warrant further investigation, as their low numbers may have hampered the recovery of tree functions. We conclude that functional group trajectories can track functions that deviate from a benchmark, and may therefore direct adaptive actions to recover the stability of regenerating forest.

AB Debate about the conservation value of secondary habitats has tended to focus on tropical forests, increasingly recognizing the role of secondary forests for biodiversity conservation. However, there remains a lack of information about the conservation value of secondary savannas. Here, we conducted a camera trap survey to assess the effect of secondary vegetation on large mammals in a Brazilian Cerrado protected area, using a single-season occupancy framework to investigate the response of individual species (species-level models) and of all species combined (community-level models). In addition, we investigated the cost effectiveness of different sampling designs to monitor globally threatened species in the study area. At the community level, savanna that regenerated from eucalyptus plantation had similar occupancy estimate as old growth areas. At the species level, none of the ten species individually assessed seemed to respond to succession stage, with greater support for the effect of other covariates on occupancy, such as distance from water and vegetation physiognomy. These results demonstrate that secondary vegetation does not appear to negatively impact large mammals in the study area and suggest that, given a favorable context, Cerrado mammals can recolonize and use secondary savannas that regenerated from clearcut. However, our study area should be considered a best-case scenario, as it retained key ecological attributes of high-value secondary habitats. Our simulations showed that a sampling design with 60 camera trap sites surveyed during nine occasions is appropriate to monitor most globally threatened species in the study area, and could be a useful starting point for new monitoring initiatives in other Cerrado areas.
   RESUMO O debate sobre a importancia de habitats secundarios para a conservacAo tende a focar em florestas tropicais, existindo evidencia consideravel sobre o papel das florestas secundarias na manutencAo da biodiversidade. Entretanto, praticamente nAo existe informacAo sobre a importancia de savanas secundarias para a conservacAo da biodiversidade. Neste trabalho realizamos uma amostragem atraves de armadilhas fotograficas para avaliar o efeito da vegetacAo secundaria sobre mamiferos de medio e grande porte em uma unidade de conservacAo do Cerrado, utilizando modelos de ocupacAo para investigar a resposta da comunidade (modelos de comunidade) e de cada especie individualmente (modelos de especie). Investigamos tambem o custo-beneficio de diferentes desenhos amostrais para monitorar especies globalmente ameacadas de extincAo na area de estudo. Nos modelos de comunidade, areas secundarias que regeneraram do plantio de eucalipto tiveram estimativa de ocupacAo similar as areas primarias. De acordo com os modelos de especie, nenhuma das 10 especies avaliadas parece responder ao estagio sucessional da vegetacAo, existindo maior suporte para o efeito de outras variaveis na estimativa de ocupacAo, como distancia da agua e fitofisionomia. Estes resultados mostram que aparentemente a vegetacAo secundaria nAo afeta de forma negativa os mamiferos de medio e grande porte na area de estudo. Alem disso, os resultados sugerem que, em um contexto favoravel, mamiferos do Cerrado podem recolonizar e usar habitats secundarios que regeneraram apos o corte raso. Entretanto, nossa area de estudo deve ser considerada como uma situacAo ideal, ja que manteve importantes atributos ecologicos de habitats secundarios de alto valor para a conservacAo. Nossas simulacoes mostraram que um desenho amostral com 60 pontos de armadilhas fotograficas amostrados durante nove ocasioes e apropriado para monitorar a maioria das especies globalmente ameacadas presentes na area de estudo, e pode ser um ponto de partida para novas iniciativas de monitoramento em outras areas do Cerrado.

AB The fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat for biodiversity. However, the impact and spatial scale of natural isolation mechanisms leading to species loss, compared to anthropogenic fragmentation, are not clear, mainly due to differences between fragments and islands, such as matrix permeability. We studied a 500km(2) Mediterranean region in France, including urban habitat fragments, continuous habitat, and continental-shelf islands. On the basis of 295 floristic releves, we built species-area relationships to compare isolation in fragments after urbanization, with continuous habitat and continental-shelf islands. We assumed either no dispersal, infinite dispersal, or estimated intermediate levels of habitat reachability through graph theory. Isolation mechanisms occurred in fragments but with a lower strength than in near-shore islands, and most importantly affected perennial plants. Annual plants were less affected, probably due to their smaller size and shorter life cycle. Isolation occurred at landscape level in fragments and at patch level in islands. The amount of reachable habitat (accounting for spatial configuration) explained local species richness in both systems, but the amount of habitat (no consideration of spatial configuration) was already a good predictor. These results suggest an important role of habitat amount around fragments in mitigating the isolation effects observed in near-shore islands, and the importance of carefully considering different functional groups.

AB Liana growth following forest disturbance is threatening the tropical carbon sink by delaying or preventing recovery. Tree growth can be stimulated by liana cutting; however, its applicability for conservation management remains uncertain, particularly in Africa (the least-studied continent for ecological restoration) and against pervasive barriers such as wildfires. We conducted a small-scale trial to investigate tree sapling regeneration following liana cutting in a lowland African forest prone to low intensity wildfires. We employed a BACI design comprising eighteen 25m(2) plots of sapling trees in liana-infested areas. After 5years of liana cutting, we saw greater recruitment, stem growth and net biomass. Wildfires caused 51% mortality and probably masked liana cutting influences on species and survival, but may have encouraged stem recruitment through interaction with liana cutting. Incorporating our data into a first quantitative review of previous studies, we found that tree growth, recruitment and net growth rates were all consistently higher where lianas were either absent or removed (respectively: 80%, 215%, 633%; n=14, 3, 4). Tree growth impacts were approximately equivalent across size-classes and continents. We give recommendations for improved plot and sample sizes, but conclude that liana cutting is a promising restoration method for lowland tropical forests, including Africa.

AB We recorded ground-foraging ant species in forest and savannah habitats along a 52-km-long road planned for upgrade in the buffer zone of the Moukalaba-Doudou National Park in south-west Gabon. Sixty stations were established with three sampling points on each side of the future road and baited with peanut butter to record the presence of invasive Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger, 1863). We documented 46 ant species including one genus and eight species not previously reported in Gabon, but no evidence of the presence of W. auropunctata. We also found species known to have an opportunistic behaviour such as Cardiocondyla emeryi (Forel, 1881), Tetramorium simillimum (Smith, 1851) and Trichomyrmex destructor (Jerdon, 1851). Species richness in forested stations was significantly higher than in savannah. Among the most common ant species in the area, we identified 13 associated with forests, eight associated with savannahs and one generalist. Four species were highly tolerant to human disturbance. Our study, even if biased towards stress-tolerant species, provides new insights about ant species associations with habitats and contributes to the establishment of a reference system to classify African ant species that could be used to monitor the success of restoration of areas impacted by human activities.

AB Due to anthropogenic activities, tropical rain forests face many challenges in sustaining biodiversity and maintaining global climates. This study explores how forest successional stage, tree composition, and stratum affect communities of saproxylic cerambycid beetlesconcealed feeders that play important roles in forest nutrient cycling. Forty trees in five families (Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae, and Sapotaceae) were sampled in a mosaic of old-growth and secondary forest on the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. Bait branches yielded 3549 cerambycid individuals in 49 species. Species richness was almost identical in old-growth and secondary forest, and both yielded specialists, but abundance was higher in old-growth forest. Overall community structure was most strongly influenced by host plant species; within most plant families it was also impacted by forest successional status. Moraceae was the exception, presumably because the focal tree species was abundant in both old-growth and secondary forest. Several host and old-growth specialist species reached high densities within patches of old-growth forest, but seldom colonized apparently suitable trees within secondary forest. This suggests that even small areas of old-growth forest can act as refuges, but that secondary forest may act as a barrier to dispersal. The vulnerability of specialized saproxylic insects to land use change will be linked to the ability of their preferred hosts to disperse to and persist in successional habitats; rearing studies may provide the most accurate method to monitor community changes over time.
   Resumen Debido a las actividades antropogenicas, las selvas tropicales enfrentan muchos desafios en el mantenimiento de la biodiversidad y el mantenimiento de los climas mundiales. Esta investigacion explora como las etapa de sucesion de los bosques, composicion de los arboles, y el estrato afectan las comunidades de escarabajos cerambycido saproxilicos, los cuales desempenan papeles importantes en el ciclo de nutrientes del bosque. Cuarenta arboles en cinco familias (Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae, y Sapotaceae) fueron indentificados en un mosaico de bosques maduro y secundario en la Peninsula Osa, Costa Rica. Ramas de cebo produjeron 3549 individuos Cerambycid en 49 especies. La riqueza de especies fue casi identica en bosques maduro y secundario, y ambos cedio especialistas, pero la abundancia fue mayor en los bosques de edad madura. Estructura general de la comunidad fue mas fuertemente influenciada por las especies de plantas huesped; en la mayoria de las familias de plantas que tambien se vio afectado por el estado de sucesion forestal. Moraceae fue la excepcion, presumiblemente porque las especies de arboles focales era abundante en bosques maduro y secundario. Varias especies especialistas de bosques maduro alcanzaron altas densidades dentro de los parches de bosque maduro, pero rara vez colonizaron arboles aparentemente ideales de bosque secundario. Esto sugiere que pequenas areas de bosques antiguos pueden actuar como refugios, y que los bosques secundarios pueden actuar como una barrera para la dispersion. La vulnerabilidad de los insectos saproxilicos especializados al uso diferente del suelo estara vinculada con la capacidad de dispersar de sus arboles preferidos y que se mantenga en los habitats de sucesion; los estudios de cria puede proporcionar el metodo mas preciso para monitorear los cambios de la comunidad a traves del tiempo.

AB Elevated CO2 levels can improve growth and water use efficiency (WUE). However, the influence of atmospheric CO2 concentrations higher than 800 ppm has been less of a concern and has received little attention. In this study, experiments were conducted to explore the responses of four species to elevated CO2 levels. Seedlings of the four species were grown in growth chambers under four different CO2 concentrations. The results showed that elevated CO2 levels resulted in increased net assimilation rates (NARs) (12%-90%) and WUEs (1%-258%) as well as decreased leaf area ratios (LARs) (11%-72%) for the four species. For the two Artemisia species (Artemisia sphaerocephala Krasch. and Artemisia ordosica Krasch.), elevated CO2 significantly increased the relative growth rate (RGRs) (4%-8%) and total biomass increment (19%-44%), while elevated CO2 concentrations resulted in decreased RGRs (2%-20%) and transpiration rates (49%-61%) for Hedysarum laeve Maxim., and increased the height increment (7%-96%) of Caragana korshinskii Kom. The differences among the two Artemisia species (C-4 species), and C. korshinskii and H. laeve (C-3 species) might be associated with their different photosynthetic pathways. These findings suggest that the two Artemisia species had a stronger ability to adapt to CO2 concentration elevation. Considering its high WUE, C. korshinskii should be applied for vegetation restoration in water-limited areas affected by a warming climate.

AB We performed a literature review in order to improve our understanding of how landscape and climate drivers affect HCPS outbreaks. Anthropogenic landscape changes such as forest loss, fragmentation and agricultural land uses are related with a boost in hantavirus reservoir species abundance and hantavirus prevalence in tropical areas, increasing HCPS risk. Additionally, higher precipitation, especially in arid regions, favors an increase in vegetational biomass, which augments the resources for reservoir rodents, also increasing HCPS risk. Although these relationships were observed, few studies described it so far, and the ones that did it are concentrated in few places. To guide future research on this issue, we build a conceptual model relating landscape and climate variables with HCPS outbreaks and identified research opportunities. We point out the need for studies addressing the effects of landscape configuration, temperature and the interaction between climate and landscape variables. Critical landscape thresholds are also highly relevant, once HCPS risk transmission can increase rapidly above a certain degree of landscape degradation. These studies could be relevant to implement preventive measures, creating landscapes that can mitigate disease spread risk.

AB There is increasing recognition that community assembly theory can offer valuable insights for ecological restoration. We studied community assembly processes following tropical forest restoration efforts, using dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) as a focal taxon to investigate taxonomic and functional patterns of biodiversity recovery. We evaluated the relative importance of the local environment (i.e., canopy cover, understory cover, tree basal area, and soil texture), landscape context (i.e., habitat patch proximity and availability and percentage of surrounding area classified as natural forest or Eucalyptus spp. plantation), and space (i.e., spatial proximity of the study areas to estimate dispersal limitation or unmeasured spatially structured processes) on dung beetle species and functional trait composition across a gradient of 15 restoration sites in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We also assessed which factors were the primary determinants in the establishment of individual dung beetle functional groups, classified according to size, food relocation habit, diet, and period of flight activity. Both species and functional trait composition were most strongly influenced by the local environment, indicating that assembly was predominantly driven by niche-based processes. Most of the variation explained by space was co-explained by local environment and landscape context, ruling out a strong influence of dispersal limitation and random colonization on assembly following restoration. In addition, nearly all of the variance explained by landscape context was co-explained by local environment, suggesting that arrival and establishment at a site depends on both local and landscape-scale environmental factors. Despite strong evidence for niche-based assembly, a large amount of variation remained unexplained in all models, suggesting that stochastic processes and/or unmeasured environmental variables also play an important role. The relative importance of local environment, landscape context, and space changed considerably when analyzing the assembly mechanisms of each functional group separately. Therefore, to recover distinct functional traits in restoration sites, it may be necessary to manipulate different components of the local environment and surrounding landscape. Overall, this study shows that assembly rules can help to better understand recovery processes, enabling improvement of future restoration efforts.

AB Macroclimate has traditionally been considered the predominant driver of litter decomposition. However, in drylands, cumulative monthly or annual precipitation typically fails to predict decomposition. In these systems, the windows of opportunity for decomposer activity may rather depend on the precipitation frequency and local factors affecting litter desiccation, such as soil-litter mixing. We used a full-factorial microcosm experiment to disentangle the relative importance of cumulative precipitation, pulse frequency, and soil-litter mixing on litter decomposition. Decomposition, measured as litter carbon loss, saturated with increasing cumulative precipitation when pulses were large and infrequent, suggesting that litter moisture no longer increased and/or microbial activity was no longer limited by water availability above a certain pulse size. More frequent precipitation pulses led to increased decomposition at high levels of cumulative precipitation. Soil-litter mixing consistently increased decomposition, with greatest relative increase (+194%) under the driest conditions. Collectively, our results highlight the need to consider precipitation at finer temporal scale and incorporate soil-litter mixing as key driver of decomposition in drylands.

AB Experimental manipulations are essential for understanding the causal factors of plant growth and cambial activity. Here, we studied the potential effect of water availability and natural variation of day length and temperature on cambial activity in Cordiera concolor (Cham.) Kuntze, an evergreen tropical species. Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse using ninety one-year-old plants divided into two groups. Each group was observed for five weeks during two different times of the year (early spring and late summer). Plants were subjected to three distinct water regimes (waterlogging, field capacity and water deficit). Temperature and day length were recorded daily and stem samples were taken weekly during both sampling intervals. Anatomical procedures were used to describe the cambial activity per stem. Our results suggest that soil water content and its influence on cambial activity depend on the time of year, while cambial stimulus was positively related to day length, independent of the time of year. In early spring, cambial activity was stimulated by an increase of day length, regardless of water supply. In contrast, in late summer, cambial dormancy was delayed in waterlogged plants and advanced in plants subjected to a water deficit, followed by decreasing day length. Analyses of the wood anatomy showed that the marginal bands of axial parenchyma were initial. Our study highlights a more complex scenario of plant functioning and its causal factors in tropical systems.

AB Studies of contemporary populations have demonstrated an association between decreased dietary diversity due to resource scarcity or underutilization and an increase in diseases related to poor micronutrient intake. With a reduction of dietary diversity, it is often the women and children in a population who are the first to suffer the effects of poor micronutrient status. Scurvy, a disease of prolonged vitamin C deficiency, is a micronutrient malnutrition disorder associated with resource scarcity, low dietary diversity, and/or dependence on high carbohydrate staple-foods. The aim of this paper is to assess the potential impact of nutritional transition on the prevalence of diseases of nutritional insufficiency in an archaeological sample. Here, we report palaeopatho-logical findings from an Early Formative Period transitional site located in coastal Northern Chile (Quiani-7). The subadult cohort from this site is composed of four perinates who exhibit a number of non-specific skeletal changes suggestive of a systemic pathological condition. One of these is associated with an adult female exhibiting diagnostic skeletal lesions of scurvy. We argue that the lesions exhibited by these perinates may represent maternal transmission of vitamin C deficiency but acknowledge that there are difficulties in applying current diagnostic criteria for scurvy to individuals this young.

AB 1. Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, but the drivers of net forest biomass change (i.e. net carbon sequestration) are poorly understood. Here, we evaluate how abiotic factors (soil conditions and disturbance) and biotic factors (forest structure, diversity and community trait composition) shape three important demographic processes (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) and how these underlie net biomass change.
   2. To test this, we evaluated 9 years of biomass dynamics using 48 1-ha plots in a Bolivian tropical moist forest, and measured for the most abundant species eight functional traits that are important for plant carbon gain and loss. Demographic processes were related to the abiotic and biotic factors using structural equation models.
   3. Variation in net biomass change across plots was mostly due to stand-level mortality, but mortality itself could not be predicted at this scale. Contrary to expectations, we found that species richness and trait composition - which is an indicator for the mass-ratio theory - had little effect on the demographic processes. Biomass recruitment (i.e. the biomass growth by recruiting trees) increased with higher resource availability (i.e. water and light) and with high species richness, probably because of increased resource use efficiency. Biomass growth of larger, established trees increased with higher sand content, which may facilitate root growth of larger trees to deeper soil layers.
   4. In sum, diversity and mass-ratio are of limited importance for the productivity of this forest. Instead, in this moist tropical forest with a marked dry season, demographic processes are most strongly determined by soil texture, soil water availability and forest structure. Only by simultaneously evaluating multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of demographic processes, better insights can be gained into mechanisms playing a role in the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests and natural systems in general.

   PATTERNS
AB 1. The abundance of nitrogen (N)-fixing plants in ecosystems where phosphorus (P) limits plant productivity poses a paradox because N fixation entails a high P cost. One explanation for this paradox is that the N-fixing strategy allows greater root phosphatase activity to enhance P acquisition from organic sources, but evidence to support this contention is limited.
   2. We measured root phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity of 10 N-fixing species, including rhizobial legumes and actinorhizal Allocasuarina species, and eight non-N-fixing species across a retrogressive soil chronosequence showing a clear shift from N to P limitation of plant growth and representing a strong natural gradient in P availability.
   3. Legumes showed greater root PME activity than non-legumes, with the difference between these two groups increasing markedly as soil P availability declined. By contrast, root PME activity of actinorhizal species was always lower than that of co-occurring legumes and not different from non-N-fixing plants.
   4. The difference in root PME activity between legumes and actinorhizal plants was not reflected in a greater or similar reliance on N fixation for N acquisition by actinorhizal species compared to co-occurring legumes.
   5. Synthesis. Our results support the idea that N-fixing legumes show high root phosphatase activity, especially at low soil P availability, but suggest that this is a phylogenetically conserved trait rather than one directly linked to their N-fixation capacity.

AB QuestionsIs it possible to predict the composition of local plant assemblages? Trait-based approaches have offered some promise, especially in cases where deterministic processes such as environmental filtering and niche differentiation shape communities. In this study, we asked how much intraspecific variation contributes to trait distributions within and among plant communities, and whether trait distributions resulting from environmental filtering and niche differentiation can predict accurately the relative species abundances of montane plant species in local communities.
   LocationWest Elk Mountains, Colorado, USA.
   MethodsWe collected functional trait, species composition and environmental data from 14 sites along a broad climate gradient in Colorado, USA, ranging in elevation from 2480 to 3560m. We partitioned the variation within and among sites into intraspecific and interspecific components, and compared the results to values from a recent global meta-analysis, which examined intraspecific trait variability patterns. We also used these data to parameterize statistical models that have been shown to reproduce patterns associated with the processes of environmental filtering and niche differentiation. We fit two models to the data, one assuming that niche differentiation is invariant among sites, and another assuming that niche differentiation varies among sites.
   ResultsWe found that the trait-based models were worse at predicting species relative abundances in local communities than a null model assuming equal abundances of all species. One plausible explanation for the poor performance of the models is that intraspecific variation in functional traits, which in our system was higher than the global averages documented in the meta-analysis, swamped the effects of interspecific variation in functional traits along the climatic gradient. In particular, almost all variation in root traits was within rather than among species, even among sites.
   ConclusionOur results suggest that a greater focus be placed on measuring intraspecific trait variability and determining its consequences for community assembly and ecosystem properties.

AB Recreational activities can be an important source of anthropogenic disturbance in intertidal benthic assemblages. On rocky shores, activities such as trampling, snorkeling and the handling of organisms may have a negative effect on benthic communities by modifying the abundance and distribution of key species. Here, we describe and quantify impacts due to recreational activities on benthic communities on a Patagonian rocky shore by investigating their resilience to two types of human disturbance: vehicle traffic and human trampling. To evaluate the effects of these activities, we carried out an observational study and assessed post-disturbance assemblage recovery. The rocky shores is most intensively visited during summer, and marked differences in the distribution and abundance of benthic species among disturbed and control plots were found after this season. The benthic community on the high intertidal was weakly impacted by disturbance generated due to vehicle traffic in summer (one vehicle on a single occasion, pulse disturbance); which did not affect the cover of dominant species. This suggests that the high intertidal community would be resistant to the passage of one vehicle on a single occasion. The effects of continuous trampling (press disturbance) were drastic and the community of the mid intertidal level did not recover before the next recreational season. Mid intertidal communities exposed to press disturbances require more than one tourist season of human inactivity to recover from anthropogenic effects, suggesting that resilience mechanisms in this community operate at broad timescales. Our findings highlight the need to establish and implement management actions that contemplate the nature of the disturbance and intertidal level to minimize habitat degradation due to human recreational activities.

AB We introduce a simplified ecohydrological model to quantitatively assess the resiliency and stability of ecosystems over long periods. The model couples a hydrological soil moisture balance with a set of spatiotemporal systems dynamics and agent-based algorithms to represent the interactions among several plant populations in a gridded area under different water, soil and temperature constraints. We characterize the plant populations by allometric rules (i.e., power laws for generational and reproductive times; linear approximations for water and temperature gains, losses and optimal values; and a set of intra and interspecific interaction rules based on high, optimal and low competition responses among the populations), that represent different plant phenotypes. We define the disturbances by a clearance of populations in an area within the model's domain and calculate the resiliency and stability with simple indices to determine the ability of the ecosystem to recover from a disturbance. The indices evaluated on each population and over the structure of the entire ecosystem show how the populations respond differently to disturbances, following patterns similar to those expected in nature. The model can represent the spatial and temporal succession of the ecosystem after being disturbed, suggesting how the differences in the phenotypical characteristics of plant populations can be advantageous or disadvantageous for the ecosystem recovery.

AB The Guiana Center of Endemism (GCE) extends across Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, north of the Amazon River and east of the Negro River in Brazil, and Venezuela to the south of the Orinoco River. Regarding diversity of nonvolant mammals, the Brazilian part of this center is less studied, especially the area corresponding to the north of the State of Para. Seven field trips lasting 12-15 days each were conducted in five conservation units in northern Para, in order to assess the nonvolant mammalian fauna. Small mammals were captured using conventional and pitfall traps. Medium-sized and large mammals were recorded through direct observations on diurnal transect censuses, collections, camera traps, indirect evidence, and in some cases, interviews. We recorded 60 species distributed in nine orders. Among other contributions, a recently described species of Monodelphis was collected, and the range distribution of Didelphis imperfecta was extended. In addition, the night monkey Aotus sp. was recorded on the east of the Trombetas River for the first time. The high number of records for game and/or threatened species evidences that the studied area is highly preserved, and the newly created protected areas are strategic for the conservation of mammals in the GCE.

AB As ecology and evolution become ever more entwined, many areas of ecological theory are being re-examined. Eco-evolutionary analyses of classic coexistence mechanisms are yielding new insights into the structure and stability of communities. We examine fluctuation-dependent coexistence models, identifying communities that are both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. Members of these communities possess distinct environmental preferences, revealing widespread patterns of limiting similarity. This regularity leads to consistent changes in the structure of communities across fluctuation regimes. However, at high amplitudes, subtle differences in the form of fluctuations dramatically affect the collapse of communities. We also show that identical fluctuations can support multiple evolutionarily stable communities - a novel example of alternative stable states within eco-evolutionary systems. Consequently, the configuration of communities will depend on historical contingencies, including details of the adaptive process. Integrating evolution into the study of coexistence offers new insights, while enriching our understanding of ecology.

AB Root structures secreting carboxylates and phosphatases are thought to enhance a plant's phosphorus (P) acquisition. But do closely related species with and without such structures really differ in root exudation, P mobilization, or ecological niche? We investigated this by comparing 23 European Carex species with and without 'dauciform roots' (DRs).
   Plants grown in pots with sand were screened for DR formation, phosphatase activities, carboxylate exudation, and utilization of various organic and inorganic P compounds. Ecological niches were compared using ecological indicator values and nutrient concentrations of plant shoots in natural habitats.
   Species of subgenus Carex formed DRs, while species of subgenus Vignea did not. Species with DRs had higher root diesterase activity than species without DRs, exuded more citrate but less oxalate and less total carboxylates, and allocated less biomass to roots. Species with and without DRs showed similar growth responses to different forms of P and different amounts of P supplied; their natural habitats do not differ in soil fertility or degree of P limitation.
   Despite some differences in physiological function, DRs did not influence the P acquisition and nutritional niche of European Carex species, suggesting that species with and without DRs do not exhibit distinct P-acquisition strategies.

AB The Mechanism to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +), which is being implemented by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is considered essential to provide economic incentives for the adoption of forest-based mitigation measures against global climate change. This article analyses the key characteristics of REDD+ pilot initiatives in Brazil from different perspectives concerning the concept of payment for environmental services, while exploring how these characteristics relate to the funding models adopted, regardless of whether they are sourced from public funds or via the carbon market. Data collected from publicly available databases are analysed using hypothesis tests. Ten variables from 89 pilot initiatives approved by the Voluntary Carbon Market or the Fundo Amazonia (Amazon Fund) are examined. Findings show that initiatives under each funding model have distinct characteristics in terms of stakeholders, criteria for incentive concession, time frames, geographical reach, as well as Measurement, Report and Verification (MRV) practices. Differences are consistent with distinct theoretical conceptions on incentive-based economic instruments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in topsoils are critical for plant nutrition. Relatively little is known about the spatial patterns of N and P in the organic layer of mountainous landscapes. Therefore, the spatial distributions of N and P in both the organic layer and the A horizon were analyzed using a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model and vegetation metrics. The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of vegetation and topography on the spatial patterns of N and P in a small watershed covered by forest in South Korea. Soil samples were collected using the conditioned latin hypercube method. LiDAR vegetation metrics, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and terrain parameters were derived as predictors. Spatial explicit predictions of N/P ratios were obtained using a random forest with uncertainty analysis. We tested different strategies of model validation (repeated 2-fold to 20-fold and leave-one-out cross validation). Repeated 10-fold cross validation was selected for model validation due to the comparatively high accuracy and low variance of prediction. Surface curvature was the best predictor of P contents in the organic layer and in the A horizon, while LiDAR vegetation metrics and NDVI were important predictors of N in the organic layer. N/P ratios increased with surface curvature and were higher on the convex upper slope than on the concave lower slope. This was due to P enrichment of the soil on the lower slope and a more even spatial distribution of N. Our digital soil maps showed that the topsoils on the upper slopes contained relatively little P. These findings are critical for understanding N and P dynamics in mountainous ecosystems.

AB Although Brazil is a megadiverse country and thus a conservation priority, no study has yet quantified conservation gaps in the Brazilian protected areas (PAs) using extensive empirical data. Here, we evaluate the degree of biodiversity protection and knowledge within all the Brazilian PAs through a gap analysis of vertebrate, arthropod and angiosperm occurrences and phylogenetic data. Our results show that the knowledge on biodiversity in most Brazilian PAs remain scant as 71% of PAs have less than 0.01 species records per km(2). Almost 55% of Brazilian species and about 40% of evolutionary lineages are not found in PAs, while most species have less than 30% of their geographic distribution within PAs. Moreover, the current PA network fails to protect the majority of endemic species. Most importantly, these results are similar for all taxonomic groups analysed here. The methods and results of our countrywide assessment are suggested to help design further inventories in order to map and secure the key biodiversity of the Brazilian PAs. In addition, our study illustrates the most common biodiversity knowledge shortfalls in the tropics.

AB Differences in viability between asexually and sexually generated offspring strongly influence the selective advantage and therefore the prevalence of sexual reproduction (sex). However, no general principle predicts when sexual offspring will be more viable than asexual offspring. We hypothesize that when any kind of reproduction is based on a more complex cellular process, it will encompass more potential failure points, and therefore lower offspring viability. Asexual reproduction (asex) can be simpler than sex, when offspring are generated using only mitosis. However, when asex includes meiosis and meiotic restitution, gamete production is more complex than in sex. We test our hypothesis by comparing the viability of asexual and closely related sexual offspring across a wide range of plants and animals, and demonstrate that meiotic asex does result in lower viability than sex; without meiosis, asex is mechanistically simple and provides higher viability than sex. This phylogenetically robust pattern is supported in 42 of 44 comparisons drawn fromdiverse plants and animals, and is not explained by the other variables included in our model. Other mechanisms may impact viability, such as effects of reproductive mode on heterozygosity and subsequent viability, but we propose the complexity of cellular processes of reproduction, particularly meiosis, as a fundamental cause of early developmental failure and mortality. Meiosis, the leading cause of inviability in humans, emerges as a likely explanation of offspring inviability among diverse eukaryotes.

AB One of the most characteristic and abundant amphibian taxa of South American temperate forests is Eupsophus. The ten currently recognized species of the genus have been divided in two species groups, roseus and vertebralis, but most of them, eight, belong to the roseus group. Recent phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies have suggested that species diversity of the roseus group could be underestimated. An examination of the literature shows that species of the roseus group exhibit high levels of variation in their external characteristics, particularly those used as diagnostic characters, which compromises their taxonomy and hinders their field recognition. High levels of variation were also observed in several new populations of the roseus group discovered in southern Chile (36 degrees - 40 degrees S), which could not be identified to the species level by their external characteristics. On the other hand, the literature reveals a scarse karyotype differentiation and a high bioacoustic uniformity among the species of the roseus group. We performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear genes to reevaluate the species diversity of the roseus group, including all the nominal species of Eupsophus and new populations. This analysis was complemented with three species delimitation approaches, General Mixed Yule Coalescent, multi-rate Poisson Tree Process and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery. We favored a conservative delimitation of only four species for the roseus group, a result more consistent with the distribution of pairwise genetic distances, and the available chromosome and bioacoustic evidence. The four recognized lineages, which have nearly completely allopatric distributions, are named after the earliest nominal species that they include, but because high levels of phenotypic variation, they are not diagnosable by consistent differences in external morphology. We discuss the implications of this new proposal for the taxonomy and conservation of the genus, and the possible causes of the difficulty to estimate its species diversity.

AB Non-native ascidians are important members of the fouling community associated with artificial substrata and man-made structures. Being efficient fouling species, they are easily spread by human-mediated transports (e.g., with aquaculture trade and maritime transports). This is exemplified by the ascidian Asterocarpa humilis which displays a wide distribution in the Southern Hemisphere and has been recently reported in the Northern Hemisphere (NW Europe). In continental Chile, its first report dates back from 2000 for the locality of Antofagasta (23 degrees S). Although there was no evidence about the vectors of introduction and spread, nor the source, some authors suggested maritime transport by ship hulls and aquaculture devices as putative introduction pathways and vectors. In the present study, we report for the first time the presence of A. humilis on the hull of an international ship in a commercial port in Concepcion bay (36 degrees S), south central Chile. We also found one individual associated to a seashell farm, 70 km far from Concepcion bay. Further individuals were subsequently identified within Concepcion bay: one juvenile settled upon international harbor pilings and a dozen individuals along aquaculture seashell longlines. For the first specimens sampled, species identification was ascertained using both morphological criteria and molecular barcoding, using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and a nuclear gene (ribosomal RNA 18S). The nuclear 18S gene and the mitochondrial gene COI clearly assigned the specimens to A. humilis, confirming our morphological identification. Two haplotypes were obtained with COI corresponding to haplotypes previously obtained with European and Northern Chilean specimens. The present study thus reports for the first time the presence of A. humilis in the Araucanian ecoregion, documenting the apparent expansion of this non-native tunicate in Chile over 2,000 km, spanning over three ecoregions. In addition we reveal the potential implication of the international maritime transport as a vector of spread of this species along the Eastern Pacific coast, and the putative role of aquaculture facilities in promoting local establishments of non-native tunicates.

AB Terrestrial herbs are important elements of tropical forests; however, there is a lack of research on their diversity patterns and how they respond to different intensities of forest-use. The aim of this study was to analyze the diversity of herbaceous angiosperms along gradients of elevation (50 m to 3500 m) and forest-use intensity on the eastern slopes of the Cofre de Perote, Veracruz, Mexico. We recorded the occurrence of all herbaceous angio-sperm species within 120 plots of 20 m x 20 m each. The plots were located at eight study locations separated by similar to 500 m in elevation and within three different habitats that differ in forest-use intensity: old-growth, degraded, and secondary forest. We analyzed species richness and floristic composition of herb communities among different elevations and habitats. Of the 264 plant species recorded, 31 are endemic to Mexico. Both alpha-and gamma-diversity display a hump-shaped relation to elevation peaking at 2500 m and 3000 m, respectively. The relative contribution of between-habitat beta-diversity to gamma-diversity also showed a unimodal hump whereas within-habitat beta-diversity declined with elevation. Forest-use intensity did not affect alpha-diversity, but beta-diversity was high between old-growth and secondary forests. Overall,gamma-diversity peaked at 2500 m (72 species), driven mainly by high within-and among-habitat beta-diversity. We infer that this belt is highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and forest-use intensification. At 3100 m, high gamma-diversity (50 species) was driven by high alpha-and within-habitat beta-diversity. There, losing a specific forest area might be compensated if similar assemblages occur in nearby areas. The high beta-diversity and endemism suggest that mixes of different habitats are needed to sustain high gamma-richness of terrestrial herbs along this elevational gradient.

AB Spatial heterogeneity is an inherent property of any living environment and is expected to favour bio-diversity due to a broader niche space. Furthermore, edges between different habitats can provide additional possibilities for species coexistence. Using computer simulations, this study examines metacommunities consisting of several trophic levels in heterogeneous environments in order to explore the above hypotheses on a community level. We model heterogeneous landscapes by using two different sized resource pools and evaluate the combined effect of dispersal and heterogeneity on local and regional species diversity. This diversity is obtained by running population dynamics and evaluating the robustness (i.e., the fraction of surviving species). The main results for regional robustness are in agreement with the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, as the largest robustness is found in heterogeneous systems with intermediate dispersal rates. This robustness is larger than in homogeneous systems with the same total amount of resources. We study the edge effect by arranging the two types of resources in two homogeneous blocks. Different edge responses in diversity are observed, depending on dispersal strength. Local robustness is highest for edge habitats that contain the smaller amount of resource in combination with intermediate dispersal. The results show that dispersal is relevant to correctly identify edge responses on community level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change brings along trend-like changes as well as changes in the temporal variations in environmental conditions which interact with the biological dynamics of ecological systems. Therefore, only studies covering several decades may unveil long term trends in ecological systems, such as in animal communities. To demonstrate if recent climatic changes have caused fundamental changes in the structure of a key arthropod community, I studied the long-term dynamics of ant colonies for 37 years on a sandy grassland in central Hungary. To be able to monitor colonies - the natural units of ant communities - with the possible least disturbance, I applied two grids of a total of 80 slate plates as artificial nesting sites. Prior to the presented study, a well-defined spatial ant community structure had been identified in the studied habitat, which consisted of three species groups (dune top, transitional and dune slack groups), occupying different habitat patches. During the study period 2813 nests of 11 ant species were recorded under the slates. Over the 37 years, community pattern markedly changed, dune slack species disappeared from the studied plots, while the frequency of drought-tolerant dune top species increased by a significant trend. No significant trend was observed in the case of the transitional species group. On the species population level, two species, Lasius niger and Formica cunicularia, showed an intensive population decline; while the Plagiolepis taurica population significantly increased and spatially joined the transitional species group in the dune slack in the second half of the project. These changes led to a major decline in species richness and a homogenization of species composition across habitat patches. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that the depletion of groundwater had the strongest relationship with these population trends. The study indicates that climate change can be linked to a fundamental change in the community structure of major ecosystem actors.

AB Disturbed forest fragments comprise a substantial proportion of tropical landscapes, and these habitats along with associated ecotones have become important to tropical biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. This study evaluated how tropical avifaunal communities respond to moderate habitat disturbances, such as shifting cultivation, selective logging and restoration from exotic plant species, in the Yagirala Forest Reserve, a fragmented tropical lowland rainforest in south-west Sri Lanka. Thirty circular plots with a 25-m fixed-radius, located to cover four prominent habitat types (secondary forest, Pinus-dominated forest, abandoned paddy lands and home gardens), were studied from March to December 2014. The results suggest that despite being fragmented and disturbed by human actions, the Yagirala Forest Reserve and associated ecotone collectively provide an important refuge for avifauna in the landscape context. The forest-home garden interface supported the highest avifaunal diversity. Edge habitats represented by home gardens and abandoned paddy lands generally supported greater bird richness. However, less disturbed secondary forest and Pinus-dominated forest were be more important for endemic and forest-specialist birds. Our results further highlight the potential value of wooded forest-home garden interfaces and forest stands restored with exotic pines in supporting native forest bird assemblages, especially in fragmented and isolated forest patches.

AB Aims
   Closely related species frequently co-occur in plant communities. The role of niche partitioning for allowing their coexistence has been called into question, but most studies on community ecology neglect pollination as a niche component, and thus potentially underestimate niche partitioning. Here, we investigate the importance of the pollination niche for determining coexistence in a biodiversity hotspot. We specifically test whether co-flowering insect-pollinated species of Erica, the most species-rich plant genus of the South African Cape Floristic Region, are characterized by different functional floral traits and different specialized pollination systems.
   Methods
   Communities of co-flowering Erica species were studied at three sites in the fynbos biome in the Western Cape of South Africa. We focused on five species with flowers that conform to an insect pollination syndrome. We assessed whether floral traits important for pollinator attraction and mechanical fit overlap by comparison of scent (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry), colour (spectrophotometry and models of bee vision), nectar volume and concentration and corolla morphology. Pollinator partitioning was quantified by comparison of floral visitor profiles and pollinator importance, calculated as the product of visitation rate, number of flowers probed per visit and pollen load for each functional visitor group among species within communities. Potential effects of competition were assessed by comparing visitation rates both directly and using anther ring disturbance as a proxy for lifetime visitation.
   Important Findings
   Floral phenotypes differed among species within communities in all functional traits. Visitor assemblages were diverse, including ants, beetles, flies, honeybees, moths and solitary bees. However, the Cape honeybee, Apis mellifera capensis, was the main pollinator of all but one Erica species. Insect visitation rates were significantly lower for E. imbricata and E. calycina relative to congeners, but high rates of anther ring disturbance, which differed significantly in only two out of seven comparisons, suggest that long-term visitation rates are mostly similar among species that share pollinators. This study shows that coexistence of co-flowering insect-pollinated Erica species is not determined by specialization for different pollination systems. Pollinator sharing might rather lead to facilitation among co-flowering species, and floral constancy mediated by extensive interspecific floral trait variation might mitigate its potentially negative effects.

AB This research provides for the first time a valuation of Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park (VSSPNP) in Cambodia, which is a forest largely unfamiliar to the international community yet extremely significant in terms of biodiversity value. This study aimed to measure the monetary and non-monetary values of ecosystem services (ESS) of the forest. We estimated the total annual contribution of VSSPNP was US $129.84 million. Its primary contribution was air purification (US$ 56.21 million yr(-1)) followed by water storage (US$ 32.31 million yr(-1)), soil-erosion reduction (US$ 22.21 million yr(-1)), soil-fertility improvement (US$ 9.47million yr(-1)), carbon sequestration (US$ 7.87 million yr(-1)), provisioning services (US $ 1.76 million yr(-1)) and recreation (US$ 0.02 million yr(-1)). Traditionally the forest is used for timber and non-timber forest products, which in fact, composed only 1.36% of the total benefits. By analysing the published articles and reports on VSSPNP we determined the area had generated valuable academic and non-academic knowledge on natural resources. This forest had also created a diverse network among scientists and different organizations worldwide. We also identified the forest to be of cultural importance for indigenous people as they believe that their ancestors live inside the forest and protect them from vulnerabilities. Despite being part of one of the most important eco-regions in the world VSSPNP is undervalued and facing multiple threats such as illegal logging, poaching, population pressure and corruption. The current estimation of ESS would thus assist in the sustainable management of VSSPNP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index together with other metrics, e.g., richness, number of stems per species or species-specific density (N: S ratio), and kurtosis, were applied to characterize the woody plant diversity patterns of a subtropical broadleaved forest in south China. The aims of our study were to compare the efficacy and sensitivity to community diversity measures between Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index. Tree census data from a 5-ha sample plot was partitioned into 3 datasets by diameter class to represent 3 distinct woody plant communities for the characterization of diversity across communities. The 5-ha sample plot of the forest had a total abundance of 23,301 treestems >= 1 cm DBH and a richness of 139 species. The majority of tree stems were seedlings (41.1%) and saplings (38.8%), whereas canopy trees only accounted for 20.1% of the total tree stems. Both Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index decreased significantly in response to a decrease in the N: S ratio across the datasets, but Shannon-Wiener index was more sensitive to plot-based richness changes and had a higher efficacy in predicting changes in species richness. Our findings are contrary to the general belief that Shannon-Wiener index is an insensitive measure of the character of the N: S relationship and have demonstrated that it remains a good measure for species diversity in plant community studies for its sensitivity and efficacy. We also suggest that the kurtosis statistic can be used as a new diversity measure due to its sensitivity to diversity change.

AB In temperate climates, tree growth dormancy usually ensures the annual nature of tree rings, but in tropical environments, determination of annual periodicity can be more complex. The purposes of the work are as follows: (1) to generate a reliable tree-ring width chronology for Prioria copaifera Griseb. (Leguminoceae), a tropical tree species dwelling in the Atrato River floodplains, Colombia; (2) to assess the climate signal recorded by the tree-ring records; and (3) to validate the annual periodicity of the tree rings using independent methods. We used standard dendrochronological procedures to generate the P. copaifera tree-ring chronology. We used Pearson correlations to evaluate the relationship of the chronology with the meteorological records, climate regional indices, and gridded precipitation/sea surface temperature products. We also evaluated 24 high-precision C-14 measurements spread over a range of preselected tree rings, with assigned calendar years by dendrochronological techniques, before and after the bomb spike in order to validate the annual nature of the tree rings. The tree-ring width chronology was statistically reliable, and it correlated significantly with local records of annual and October-December (OND) streamflow and precipitation across the upper river watershed (positive), and OND temperature (negative). It was also significantly related to the Oceanic Nino Index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Southern Oscillation Index, as well as sea surface temperatures over the Caribbean and the Pacific region. However, C-14 high-precision measurements over the tree rings demonstrated offsets of up to 40 years that indicate that P. copaifera can produce more than one ring in certain years. Results derived from the strongest climate-growth relationship during the most recent years of the record suggest that the climatic signal reported may be due to the presence of annual rings in some of those trees in recent years. Our study alerts about the risk of applying dendrochronology in species with challenging anatomical features defining tree rings, commonly found in the tropics, without an independent validation of annual periodicity of tree rings. High-precision C-14 measurements in multiple trees are a useful method to validate the identification of annual tree rings.

AB Plants with simple architecture and strong constraints on their growth may offer critical insights into how growth strategies affect the tolerance of plants to herbivory. Although Dioscorea praehensilis, a wild yam of African forests, is perennial, both aerial apparatus and tuber are annually renewed. Each year, the tuber produces a single stem that climbs from the ground to the forest canopy. This stem bears no leaves and no branches until it reaches optimal light conditions. Once in the canopy, the plant's production fuels the filling of a new tuber before the plant dies back to the ground. We hypothesized that if deprived of ant defense, the leafless growth phase is a vulnerable part of the cycle, during which a small amount of herbivory entails a high cost in terms of loss of opportunity. We compared the growth of stems bearing ants or not as well as of intact stems and stems subjected to simulated or natural herbivory. Ants reduce herbivory; herbivory delays arrival to the canopy and shortens the season of production. Artificially prolonging the stem growth to the canopy increased plant mortality in the following year and, in surviving plants, reduced the stem diameter and likely the underground reserves produced. Tuber size is a key variable in plant performance as it affects both the size of the aerial apparatus and the duration of its single season of production. Aerial apparatus and tuber are thus locked into a cycle of reciprocal annual renewal. Costs due to loss of opportunity may play a major role in plant tolerance to herbivory, especially when architectural constraints interact with ecological conditions to shape the plant's growth strategy.

AB Deforestation, followed by abandonment and forest regeneration, has become one of the dominant types of land cover changes in the tropics. This study applied the eddy covariance (EC) technique to quantify the energy budget and evapotranspiration in a regenerated secondary dry dipterocarp forest in Western Thailand. The mean annual net radiation was 126.69, 129.61, and 125.65 W m(-2) day(-1) in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. On average, fluxes of this energy were disaggregated into latent heat (61%), sensible heat (27%), and soil heat flux (1%). While the number of energy exchanges was not significantly different between these years, there were distinct seasonal patterns within a year. In the wet season, more than 79% of energy fluxes were in the form of latent heat, while during the dry season, this was in the form of sensible heat. The energy closure in this forest ecosystem was 86% and 85% in 2010 and 2011, respectively, and varied between 84-87% in the dry season and 83-84% in the wet season. The seasonality of these energy fluxes and energy closure can be explained by rainfall, soil moisture, and water vapor deficit. The rates of evapotranspiration also significantly varied between the wet (average 6.40 mm day(-1)) and dry seasons (3.26 mm day(-1)).

AB Brazil holds the largest flora in the world, with more than 35,000 described native species. However, a large portion of its flora is poorly known, and more than 2000 species are threatened with extinction. Because similar situations exist in virtually all other countries, the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity launched a program called the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC). The vision of GSPC is to halt the continuing loss of plant diversity through the achievement of 16 outcome-oriented global targets set for 2020. Here we discuss the challenges ahead for countries committed to achieving GSPC targets and use the experience of the National Centre for Flora Conservation (CNCFIora), in Brazil, as a case study of successes in pursuing some targets, and some perceived failures. We offer information that might help other countries, decision makers, and policymakers to address difficulties and move themselves toward achieving GSPC targets. We also synthesize the main targets upon which CNCFIora acts, their current situation, and the desired improvements necessary to achieve targets by 2020. Finally, we provide recommendations to actors, stakeholders, decision makers, and policymakers in Brazil that could foster conservation actions and strategies in the country.

AB Biodiversity is known to increase ecosystem functioning. However, species vary in their contributions to ecosystem processes. Here, we investigated seven ecosystem functions based on the consumption of different resources in tropical ant communities. We analysed how different species influence site-level resource consumption, and determined how each species influenced performance and stability of these functions. Based on simulated extinctions, we identified 'key species' with significant functional contributions. We then investigated which traits, such as biomass, abundance, and specialisation, characterized them, and compared trait distributions across four sites to analyse differences in functional redundancy. Only few species significantly influenced ecosystem functions. Common generalist species tended to be the most important drivers of many ecosystem functions, though several specialist species also proved to be important in this study. Moreover, species-specific ecological impacts varied across sites. In addition, we found that functional redundancy varied across sites, and was highest in sites where the most common species did not simultaneously have the greatest functional impacts. Furthermore, redundancy was enhanced in sites where species were less specialised and had more even incidence distributions. Our study demonstrates that the ecological importance of a species depends on its functional traits, but also on the community context. It cannot be assessed without investigating its species-specific performance across multiple functions. Hence, to assess functional redundancy in a habitat and the potential for compensation of species loss, researchers need to study species-specific traits that concern functional performance as well as population dynamics and tolerance to environmental conditions.

AB China has the largest afforestation effort in the world, which was implemented in response to large-scale deforestation that has occurred over centuries. Although the outcomes for vegetation coverage are clear, it remains unclear if these efforts also translate into broader conservation outcomes for fauna. Here we use ant communities to assess the conservation potential of vegetation undergoing natural regeneration and subject to afforestation plantings in valley-type savanna in the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China. Species richness was almost always highest in the oldest (30 year) sites irrespective of habitat type. The two sites that were monocultures of Leucaena leucocephala had notably low species richness (1 and 6 species respectively). Plant species richness had a significant positive relationship with total ant abundance and richness. The number of exotic ant species present had a negative relationship with total species richness. Multivariate analysis of species presence/absence data found no distinction between ant communities of plantation and rehabilitating sites, except for the two Leucaena plantation sites. PCA analysis of abundance data found that the separation of the sites was dependent upon the analyses conducted. We conclude that afforestation efforts are a useful conservation tool, regardless of whether these are of regenerating purely native vegetation or the creation of novel ecosystems using non-native species. However, for plantations the conservation benefits are dependent upon the species that are planted.

AB Climate change in the Amazon region is the subject of many studies not only due to its stance as an emblematic ecosystem but also as a region where changes have been dramatic for over 30 years, mainly due to deforestation. We investigate how people settled in the Amazon perceive environmental changes by comparing these perceptions with satellite rainfall data for 12 sites representing the community diversity in the region. Perceptions are varied and agreement with physical, measured data is not always good. However, the arc of deforestation, where the downward trend of rainfall is more strongly observed, also appears as the region where the populations have the highest perception of rainfall change.

AB Theory predicts deterministic and stochastic factors will contribute to community assembly in different ways: Environmental filters should regulate those species that establish in a particular area resulting in the ecological requirements of species being the primary driver of species distributions, while chance and dispersal limitation should dictate the likelihood of species reaching certain areas with the ecology of species being largely neutral. These factors are specifically relevant for understanding how the area and isolation of different habitats or islands interact to affect community composition. Our review of the literature found few experimental studies have examined the interactive effect of habitat area and isolation on community assembly, and the results of those experiments have been mixed. We manipulated the area and isolation of rock islands created de novo in a grassland matrix to experimentally test how deterministic and stochastic factors shape colonizing animal communities. Over 64weeks, the experiment revealed the primacy of deterministic factors in community assembly, with habitat islands of the same size exhibiting remarkable consistency in community composition and diversity, irrespective of isolation. Nevertheless, tangible differences still existed in abundance inequality among taxa: Large, near islands had consistently higher numbers of common taxa compared to all other island types. Dispersal limitation is often assumed to be negligible at small spatial scales, but our data shows this not to be the case. Furthermore, the dispersal limitation of a subset of species has potentially complex flow-on effects for dictating the type of deterministic factors affecting other colonizing species.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are global threats to biodiversity and major research topics in ecology and conservation biology. We conducted a systematic review to assess where the geographic locations, and habitat types - and how - the study designs, conceptual underpinnings, landscape metrics and biodiversity measures scientists have studied fragmentation over the last two decades. We sampled papers from 1994 to 2016 and used regression modelling to explore changes in fragmentation research over time. Habitat loss and fragmentation studies are geographically and taxonomically biased. Almost 85% of studies were conducted in America and Europe, with temperate forests and birds the most studied groups. Most studies use a binary conceptual model of landscapes (habitat versus non-habitat) and static measures of biodiversity. However, research on fragmentation is slowly shifting from a focus on coarse patterns to more nuanced representations of biodiversity and landscapes that better represent ecological processes. For example, empirical research based on gradient or continuum models, that offer new insights into landscape complexity and species-specific responses to habitat fragmentation, are increasing in prevalence. We recommend that fragmentation research focuses on developing knowledge on underlying mechanisms and processes of how species respond to landscape changes, and that fragmentation studies be conducted in the full range of habitats currently experiencing high rates of landscape modification. This is crucial if we are to understand relationships between biodiversity and ecosystems and to develop effective management strategies in fragmented landscapes.

AB Higher trophic level interactions are key mediators of ecosystem functioning in tropical forests. A rich body of theory has been developed to predict the effects of plant diversity on communities at higher trophic levels and the mechanisms underlying such effects. The 'enemies hypothesis' states that predators exert more effective top-down control of herbivorous insects with increasing plant diversity. Support for this hypothesis has been found in temperate forests and agroecosystems, but remains understudied in tropical forests. We compared incidence of attacks of different natural enemies using artificial caterpillars in a tropical forest landscape and investigated the role of plant community structure (i.e. species richness, composition and density), and the role of forest fragmentation (i.e. patch size, edge distance and canopy openness) on predation intensity. Plant community effects were tested with respect to three vegetation strata: trees, saplings and herbs. Observed predation was substantially due to ants. Predation rates increased with plant species richness for trees and herbs. Density of saplings, herb cover and herb species composition were important factors for predation. No significant patterns were found for fragmentation parameters, suggesting that forest fragmentation has not altered predation intensity. We conclude that in tropical forests, top-down control of herbivorous insects in the understory vegetation is affected by a combination of plant diversity, plant species composition and structural features of the plant community.

AB Variation in diet breadth among organisms is a pervasive feature of the natural world that has resisted general explanation. In particular, trade-offs in the ability to use one resource at the expense of another have been expected but rarely detected. We explore a spatial model for the evolution of specialization, motivated by studies of plant-feeding insects. The model is neutral with respect to the causes and consequences of diet breadth: the number of hosts utilized is not constrained by trade-offs, and specialization or generalization does not confer a direct advantage with respect to the persistence of populations or the probability of diversification. We find that diet breadth evolves in ways that resemble reports from natural communities. Simulated communities are dominated by specialized species, with a predictable but less species-rich component of generalized taxa. These results raise the possibility that specialization might be a consequence of stochastic diversification dynamics acting on spatially segregated consumer-resource associations rather than a trait either favored or constrained directly by natural selection. Finally, our model generates hypotheses for global patterns of herbivore diet breadth, including a positive effect of host richness and a negative effect of evenness in host plant abundance on the number of specialized taxa.

AB Communities subject to stress, including those with low invasibility, may be dominated by exotic generalist species. African grasses are aggressive invasive species in Neotropical savannas, where their response to abiotic stress remains unknown. We assessed the role of waterlogging and canopy closure on the presence, abundance and reproductive tillering of African and native grasses in a Neotropical savanna in southeastern Brazil. We obtained abundance and reproductive tillering data of exotic (Melinis minutiflora, Melinis repens and Urochloa decumbens) and common native grasses in 20 sites. We also determined the groundwater depth, soil surface water potential and canopy cover at these sites. The grass species generally had a low frequency and performed poorly where soil remained waterlogged throughout the year, except for two native species. Most native species were exclusive to either well-drained savannas or better drained wet grasslands. However, two species (Loudetiopsis chrysothrix and Trachypogon spicatus) occurred in both vegetation types. Two exotic species (M.minutiflora and M.repens) were less common but demonstrated reasonable performance in wet grasslands, possibly due to their root system plasticity. Furthermore, U.decumbens had a lower occurrence, density and reproductive tillering at these sites, but was successful at sites where the groundwater level was slightly deeper. Although the favourable water regime in the savannas increases their invasibility in general, resistance to invasion by African grasses may be greater at microsites with high canopy closure, where these species showed lower performance and did not affect the abundance of co-occurring native grasses. In summary, the Brazilian savanna becomes more susceptible to the spread of African grasses when disturbances decrease canopy closure or lower rainfall associated with climate change reduces the average groundwater depth and consequently releases invasive species from soil waterlogging in grasslands.

AB The Brazilian Amazon in the past decades has been suffering severe landscape alteration, mainly due to anthropogenic activities, such as road building and land clearing for agriculture. Using a high-resolution time series of land cover maps (classified as mature forest, non-forest, secondary forest) spanning from 1984 through 2011, and four uncorrelated fragmentation metrics (edge density, clumpiness index, area-weighted mean patch size and shape index), we examined the temporal and spatial dynamics of forest fragmentation in three study areas across the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santar,m and Machadinho d'Oeste), inside and outside conservation units. Moreover, we compared the impacts on the landscape of: (1) different land uses (e.g. cattle ranching, crop production), (2) occupation processes (spontaneous vs. planned settlements) and (3) implementation of conservation units. By 2010/2011, municipalities located along the Arc of Deforestation had more than 55% of the remaining mature forest strictly confined to conservation units. Further, the planned settlement showed a higher rate of forest loss, a more persistent increase in deforested areas and a higher relative incidence of deforestation inside conservation units. Distinct agricultural activities did not lead to significantly different landscape structures; the accessibility of the municipality showed greater influence in the degree of degradation of the landscapes. Even with a high proportion of the landscapes covered by conservation units, which showed a strong inhibitory effect on forest fragmentation, we show that dynamic agriculturally driven economic activities, in municipalities with extensive road development, led to more regularly shaped, heavily fragmented landscapes, with higher densities of forest edge.

AB In seasonal plant communities, it is recognized that topography-related variation in water availability and solar radiation determine vegetation structure and community composition; however, the effects on functional structure, particularly through changes in resource use strategies of plants are still poorly understood. This study examines the effects of slope aspect and topographic position on functional trait dominance in a tropical dry forest landscape and explores whether strategies for coping with drought (avoidance vs. tolerance) segregate spatially along the water stress gradient created by the interaction of these two topographic factors. The study was conducted in the Balsas river basin in south-central Mexico. Functional traits were evaluated in 63 species of trees (>= 2.5 cm diameter at breast height) dominant in plots located at three topographic positions (low, medium and high) and on two slope aspects (north and south). Eight leaf and four stem functional traits, relating to the plants' ability to avoid or tolerate water and temperature stress, were measured. Community-level functional traits were strongly affected by topographic position while only a weak signal was detected by the slope aspect. Contrary to our expectations, attributes associated with drought tolerance predominated on the lower topographic positions of the slopes, (moister and warmer sites), while on the upper parts with drier soil, but cooler air, attributes associated with water stress avoidance dominated. In addition, variation in the dominance of leaf pulvini and trichomes along the topographic gradient suggests environmental filtering by elevated air temperatures and water stress, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the upper topographic positions that generate a shorter and more fluctuating water-availability window, favor readily-deciduous plants with high levels of water storage in their tissues, traits allowing for a rapid avoid of water stress, whereas on the lower topographic positions, where the soil remains moist for longer periods of time, tardily-deciduous species thrive with dense, low-water content tissues, attributes that are associated with physiological tolerance to drought.

AB Aim Partners in co-evolutionary interactions must be ecologically interdependent and at least at some stage have matching traits and more or less overlapping ranges. As co-evolution is a process, neither the mutual dependence nor the trait and range matching are expected to be static or perfect. Here we investigate the extent of evolutionary flexibility in tight pollination mutualisms between hummingbirds and plants, ranging from straight-billed species to sicklebills.
   Location The Americas.
   Methods The five considered pollination mutualisms are between the following hummingbird and plant species: Calypte anna and Ribes speciosum (Grossulariaceae); Basilinna xantusii and Arbutus peninsularis (Ericaceae); two species of Sephanoides and Tristerix aphyllus/corymbosus (Loranthaceae); two species of Eutoxeres and 34 species of curved-corolla Centropogon (Campanulaceae); and six species of Oreotrochilus and seven species of Chuquiraga (Asteraceae). While ecological interdependence and trait matching in these mutualisms are well established, geographic occurrence data and molecular clock-based ages for the 10 clades were newly compiled.
   Results We found matching bird and plant stem ages in two of the five systems and (much) older bird than plant ages in the other three. The implied adaptation of plant populations to already existing hummingbird species fits with the modelled distributions. In three of the systems, the ranges of the plants overlap those of their pollinators by >90%; conversely, the range overlap between the bird species and the plant species they pollinate is much less than that. Surprisingly, the age mismatch was greatest in the Eutoxeres/Centropogon system, in spite of the perfect morphological fit among bills and corollas, illustrating the evolutionary flexibility of these mutualisms and the apparently rapid addition' of further plant species.
   Main conclusions These findings illuminate the macroevolutionary assembly of hummingbird/plant mutualisms, which has been highly dynamic, even in specialized systems with perfect morphological trait fitting.

AB The species richness and density of lianas (woody vines) in tropical forests is determined by various abiotic and biotic factors. Factors such as altitude, forest patch size and the degree of forest disturbance are known to exert strong influences on liana species richness and density. We investigated how liana species richness and density were concurrently influenced by altitude (1700-2360 m), forest patch size, forest patch location (edge or interior) and disturbance intensity in the tropical montane evergreen forests, of the Nilgiri and Palni hills, Western Ghats, southern India. All woody lianas (>= 1 cm dbh) were enumerated in plots of 30 x 30 m in small, medium and large forest patches, which were located along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 1700 to 2360 m. A total of 1980 individual lianas were recorded, belonging to 45 species, 32 genera and 21 families, from a total sampling area of 13.86 ha (across 154 plots). Liana species richness and density decreased significantly with increasing altitude and increased with increasing forest patch size. Within forest patches, the proportion of forest edge or interior habitat influenced liana distribution and succession especially when compared across the patch size categories. Liana species richness and density also varied along the altitudinal gradient when examined using eco-physiological guilds (i.e. shade tolerance, dispersal mode and climbing mechanism). The species richness and density of lianas within these ecological guilds responded negatively to increasing altitude and positively to increasing patch size and additionally displayed differing sensitivities to forest disturbance. Importantly, the degree of forest disturbance significantly altered the relationship between liana species richness and density to increasing altitude and patches size, and as such is likely the primary influence on liana response to montane forest succession. Our findings suggest that managing forest disturbance in the examined montane forests would assist in conserving local liana diversity across the examined altitudinal range.

AB Land-use change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, especially in the tropics where secondary and plantation forests are expanding while primary forest is declining. Understanding how well these disturbed habitats maintain biodiversity is therefore important-specifically how the maturity of secondary forest and the management intensity of plantation forest affect levels of biodiversity. Previous studies have shown that the biotas of different continents respond differently to land use. Any continental differences in the response could be due to differences in land-use intensity and maturity of secondary vegetation or to differences among species in their sensitivity to disturbances. We tested these hypotheses using an extensive dataset collated from published biodiversity comparisons within four tropical regions-Asia, Africa, Central America and South America-and a wide range of animal and plant taxa. We analysed responses to land use of several aspects of biodiversity-species richness, species composition and endemicity-allowing a more detailed comparison than in previous syntheses. Within each continent, assemblages from secondary vegetation of all successional stages retained species richness comparable to those in primary vegetation, but community composition was distinct, especially in younger secondary vegetation. Plantation forests, particularly the most intensively managed, supported a smaller-and very distinct-set of species from sites in primary vegetation. Responses to land use did vary significantly among continents, with the biggest difference in richness between plantation and primary forests in Asia. Responses of individual taxonomic groups did not differ strongly among continents, giving little indication that species were inherently more sensitive in Asia than elsewhere. We show that oil palm plantations support particularly low species richness, indicating that continental differences in the response of biodiversity to land use are perhaps more likely explained by Asia's high prevalence of oil palm plantations.

AB The feeding behavior of the Scarabaeinae subfamily has positive implications on ecosystem functioning. We characterize the necrophagous and coprophagous dung beetle assemblages, and we quantify the removal of swine carrion and domestic dog dung in two areas with different degrees of environmental disturbance in an Atlantic Forest remnant located in Florianopolis, SC, Brazil. The experiment was setup at eight sampling points in each area, by installing one control and two collection and removal assessment arenas for collecting necrophagous dung beetles while simultaneously evaluating the removal of carrion (50 g of rotting pork for 48 h). We used the same sample design with 50 g of domestic dog dung for evaluating the coprophagous dung beetle assemblage and dung removal. Our results indicated that necrophagous dung beetles were more sensitive to environmental disturbance owing to a lower richness and changes in species dominance, which resulted in a lower removal in the areas with greater disturbance and lower environmental quality (39.6% carrion removal) in relation to less disturbed areas (75.1% carrion removal). The dung beetle assemblages were similar in structure and removal rates between areas (80% of dung was removed). In assessing the influence of richness, abundance, and biomass of dung beetles on resource removal both for the whole assemblage and for each separate functional guild, only the abundance and biomass of rollers contributed significantly to dung removal. These results highlight the implications of environmental disturbances on the functions of dung beetles, which respond differently according to the resource they use.

AB Although specialized interactions, including those involving plants and their pollinators, are often invoked to explain high species diversity, they are rarely explored at macroevolutionary scales. We investigate the dynamic evolution of hummingbird and bat pollination syndromes in the centropogonid clade (Lobelioideae: Campanulaceae), an Andean-centered group of approximate to 550 angiosperm species. We demonstrate that flowers hypothesized to be adapted to different pollinators based on flower color fall into distinct regions of morphospace, and this is validated by morphology of species with known pollinators. This supports the existence of pollination syndromes in the centropogonids, an idea corroborated by ecological studies. We further demonstrate that hummingbird pollination is ancestral, and that bat pollination has evolved approximate to 13 times independently, with approximate to 11 reversals. This convergence is associated with correlated evolution of floral traits within selective regimes corresponding to pollination syndrome. Collectively, our results suggest that floral morphological diversity is extremely labile, likely resulting from selection imposed by pollinators. Finally, even though this clade's rapid diversification is partially attributed to their association with vertebrate pollinators, we detect no difference in diversification rates between hummingbird- and bat-pollinated lineages. Our study demonstrates the utility of pollination syndromes as a proxy for ecological relationships in macroevolutionary studies of certain species-rich clades.

AB Aim Habitat loss and fragmentation are considered the main drivers of species population declines and extinctions in the world. The large-scale replacement of natural habitats with human-modified habitats, such as the replacement of forests with agricultural and livestock farming areas, creates a scenario where natural habitat patches are immersed in an inhospitable land use matrix. We sought to evaluate how forest fragments (FFs) are influenced by the different surrounding landscape components, where we assessed how agricultural matrices that differ in structure and seasonality affect the structure of FFs and their amphibian assemblages.
   Location Atlantic Forest, Brazil.
   Methods Using diverse methods including satellite imagery, historical land use and field data, we evaluated the effects of representative agricultural matrices on the structure of FFs and their amphibian composition, species richness and abundance.
   Results Our results suggest that the structure of FFs and amphibian composition, species richness and individual abundance are intimately linked to the type of matrix and its proportion around FFs. The nature of the matrix is more likely to affect species richness, individual abundance and composition of amphibian assemblages than FF size, reducing the species-area relationship in FFs. There is strong support for the hypothesis that certain agricultural matrices facilitate FF exposure to the elements and a decrease in forest integrity within the fragment, which is reflected in a loss of strict forest inhabitants. Those matrices that allow for a greater exposure of FFs also appear to favour their occupation by habitat generalists.
   Main conclusions Surrounding matrices affect the structure and dynamics of forest remnants and should therefore be considered in management plans of severely fragmented landscapes. The influence of the land matrix should be urgently assessed, as it has effects on species occurrences and distribution. This is especially relevant considering the increasing deforestation rates in biodiversity hotspots world-wide.

AB Denitrification plays a key role in converting reactive nitrogen species to dinitrogen gas back into the atmosphere to maintain the equilibrium of nitrogen cycling in ecosystems. In this study, functional genes of nirK and nosZ were used to detect the community structure and abundance of denitrifying microorganisms in acidic forest soils in southern China. Three sets of factors were considered for a comparison among 5 forests, including forest types (natural vs. re-vegetated), depths (surface layer vs. lower layer) and seasons (winter vs. summer). The community of nirK gene detected from these acidic forest soils was closely related to Proteobacteria especially alpha-Proteobacteria and uncultured soil sequences, while that of nosZ gene was affiliated with the alpha-, (beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria. Higher diversity of denitrifiers was observed in re-vegetated forest soils than natural ones. Not only the community but also the abundance showed significant differences between forest types as well as depths. The abundance of denitrifiers ranged from 10(5) to 10(7) gene copies g(-1) dry soil in this study. For nirK gene, the abundance was much higher in the lower layer than surface layer in both forest types, and the differences between winter and summer in natural forest soils were higher than those in re-vegetated forest soils. The abundance of nosZ and nirK genes showed a similar trend in natural forest, but the former was higher in matured forest than re vegetated forest. This study provided a direct comparison on community composition and abundance of denitrifying bacteria in natural and re-vegetated acidic forest soils to allow further assessment of the nitrogen cycling.

AB Context The biodiversity hotspot for conservation of New Caledonia has facing high levels of forest fragmentation. Remnant forests are critical for biodiversity conservation and can help in understanding how does forest fragmentation affect tree communities.
   Objective Determine the effect of habitat configuration and availability on tree communities.
   Methods We mapped forest in a 60 km 2 landscape and sampled 93 tree communities in 52 forest fragments following stratified random sampling. At each sampling point, we inventoried all trees with a diameter at breast height >= 10 cm within a radius of 10 m. We then analysed the response of the composition, the structure and the richness of tree communities to the fragment size and isolation, distance from the edge, as well as the topographical position.
   Results Our results showed that the distance from the forest edge was the variable that explained the greatest observed variance in tree assemblages. We observed a decrease in the abundance and richness of animaldispersed trees as well as a decrease in the abundance of large trees with increasing proximity to forest edges. Near forest edgeswe found a shift in species composition with a dominance of stress-tolerant pioneer species.
   Conclusions Edge-effects are likely to be the main processes that affect remnant forest tree communities after about a century of forest fragmentation. It results in retrogressive successions at the edges leading to a dominance of stress-tolerant species. The vegetation surrounding fragments should be protected to promote the long process of forest extension and subsequently reduce edge-effects.

AB Regional species diversity generally increases with primary productivity whereas local diversity-productivity relationships are highly variable. This scale-dependence of the biodiversity-productivity relationship highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that govern variation in species composition among local communities, which is known beta-diversity. Hypotheses to explain changes in beta-diversity with productivity invoke multiple mechanisms operating at local and regional scales, but the relative importance of these mechanisms is unknown. Here we show that changes in the strength of local density-dependent interactions within and among tree species explain changes in beta-diversity across a subcontinental-productivity gradient. Stronger conspecific relative to heterospecific negative density dependence in more productive regions was associated with higher local diversity, weaker habitat partitioning (less species sorting), and homogenization of community composition among sites (lower beta-diversity). Regional processes associated with changes in species pools had limited effects on beta-diversity. Our study suggests that systematic shifts in the strength of local interactions within and among species might generally contribute to some of the most prominent but poorly understood gradients in global biodiversity.

AB Phosphate (Pi) deficiency in soil system is a limiting factor for rice growth and yield. Majority of the soil phosphorus (P) is organic in nature, not readily available for root uptake. Low Pi-inducible purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are hypothesized to enhance the availability of Pi in soil and cellular system. However, information on molecular and physiological roles of rice PAPs is very limited. Here, we demonstrate the role of a novel rice PAP, OsPAP21b in improving plant utilization of organic-P. OsPAP21b was found to be under the transcriptional control of OsPHR2 and strictly regulated by plant Pi status at both transcript and protein levels. Biochemically, OsPAP21b showed hydrolysis of several organophosphates at acidic pH and possessed sufficient thermostability befitting for high-temperature rice ecosystems with acidic soils. Interestingly, OsPAP21b was revealed to be a secretory PAP and encodes a distinguishable major APase (acid phosphatase) isoform under low Pi in roots. Further, OsPAP21b-overexpressing transgenics showed increased biomass, APase activity and P content in both hydroponics supplemented with organic-P sources and soil containing organic manure as sole P source. Additionally, overexpression lines depicted increased root length, biomass and lateral roots under low Pi while RNAi lines showed reduced root length and biomass as compared to WT. In the light of these evidences, present study strongly proposes OsPAP21b as a useful candidate for improving Pi acquisition and utilization in rice.

AB Gap formation increases the light intensity in the forest understorey. The growth responses of seedlings to the increase in light availability show interspecific variation, which is considered to promote biodiversity in forests. At the leaf level, some species increase their photosynthetic capacity in response to gap formation, whereas others do not. Here we address the question of whether the interspecific difference in the photosynthetic response results in the interspecific variation in the growth response. If so, the interspecific difference in photosynthetic response would also contribute to species coexistence in forests. We also address the further relevant question of why some species do not increase their photosynthetic capacity. We assumed that some cost of photosynthetic plasticity may constrain acquisition of the plasticity in some species, and hypothesized that species with larger photosynthetic plasticity exhibit better growth after gap formation and lower survivorship in the shade understorey of a cool-temperate deciduous forest. We created gaps by felling canopy trees and studied the relationship between the photosynthetic response and the subsequent growth rate of seedlings. Naturally growing seedlings of six deciduous woody species were used and their mortality was examined for 8 years. The light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (P-max) and the relative growth rate (RGR) of the seedlings of all study species increased at gap plots. The extent of these increases varied among the species. The stimulation of RGR over 4 years after gap formation was strongly correlated with change in photosynthetic capacity of newly expanded leaves. The increase in RGR and Pmax correlated with the 8-year mortality at control plots. These results suggest a trade-off between photosynthetic plasticity and the understorey shade tolerance. Gap-demanding species may acquire photosynthetic plasticity, sacrificing shade tolerances, whereas gap-independent species may acquire shade tolerances, sacrificing photosynthetic plasticity. This strategic difference among species would contribute to species coexistence in cool-temperate deciduous forests.

AB Cloud forests (CF) are highly diverse and severely threatened by deforestation, degradation, and climate change. Seedling transplantation of threatened and valuable tree species is a strategic technique that contributes to CF restoration; however, there is limited basic information regarding tree species functional traits and the microhabitat requirements for their reintroduction. Analysis of seedling functional traits could provide useful information to define functional groups and determine the potential of tree species to restore CF. We carried out a preliminary characterization of tree seedling functional traits in ten valuable CF species under a controlled environment. Six to nine months after germination, 50 seedlings per species were exposed to two light regimes (80 and 30% shade) and their growth, biomass allocation, and morphological responses were evaluated. After 9 months, most of the growth and biomass allocation parameters showed no significant differences between light regimes within species. However, specific leaf area (SLA) displayed significant differences between light regimes and also explained most of the variation among species. Based on a Principal Components Analysis, two main groups were identified: (1) Low SLA: Quercus germana, Quercus sartorii, Sideroxylon contrerasii, Oreomunnea mexicana, and Ocotea disjuncta, and (2) high SLA: Ulmus mexicana, Liquidambar styraciflua, Meliosma alba, Magnolia dealbata, and Fraxinus uhdei. The suitability of functional groups and species in terms of the restoration of disturbed scenarios is discussed.

AB From an ecological perspective, urban green roofs can be viewed as green islands embedded in an urban matrix. Island biogeography theory suggests that species richness on an island is the outcome of dynamic equilibrium between immigration and extinction. Immigration is affected by the size of an island and distance of an island from a colonizing source. In the context of green roofs, building height and horizontal distance from green areas can potentially be a limiting factor for many species. Here, we considered two distance components of green roofs - vertical (building height) and horizontal (distance of building from open green areas). Based on island biogeography theory, we would expect species richness or community similarity to be negatively related to horizontal or vertical distances from colonizing sources. The green roof literature addressing such questions is currently sparse. In our review comprised of 10 studies, we were unable to identify consistent statistically significant richness-distance or community similarity-distance (vertical or horizontal) relationships. The absence of statistically significant relationships could be due in large part to low statistical power as a consequence of both the paucity of roofs and limited range of vertical distances in many of the existing studies. In addition, these roofs differ in numerous aspects (e.g. roof size, age, substrate type, plant composition and building height). The low number of replicates, combined with the lack of homogeneity among replicates combines to reduce statistical power and our ability to detect differences.

AB We adopt a theory-based approach to synthesize research on the effectiveness of payments for environmental services in achieving environmental objectives and socio-economic co-benefits in varying contexts. Our theory of change builds on established conceptual models of impact pathways and highlights the role of (1) contextual dimensions (e.g., political, institutional, and socio-economic conditions, spatial heterogeneity in environmental service values and provision costs, and interactions with pre-existing policies), and (2) scheme design (e.g., payment type and level, contract length, targeting, and differentiation of payments) in determining environmental and socio-economic outcomes. To shed light on the overall effectiveness of payment schemes, and its determinants, we review counterfactual-based empirical evaluations, comparative analyses of case-studies, and meta-analyses. Our review suggests that program effectiveness often lags behind the expectations of early theorists. However, we also find that theory has advanced sufficiently to identify common reasons for why payment schemes fail or succeed. Moreover, payment schemes are often rolled out along with other policy instruments in so-called policy mixes. Advances in theory and evaluation research are needed to improve our understanding of how such policy mixes interact with the targeted social-ecological systems. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Forest roads alter the biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems, modifying temperature, humidity, wind speed, and light availability that, in turn, cause changes in plant community composition and diversity. We aim at investigating and comparing the diversity of herbaceous species along main and secondary forest roads in a temperate-managed hornbeam-beech forest, north of Iran. Sixteen transects along main and secondary forest roads were established (eight transects along main roads and eight along secondary roads). To eliminate the effect of forest type, all transects were located in Carpinetum-Fagetum forests, the dominant forest type in the study area. The total length of each transect was 200 m (100 m toward up slope and 100 m toward down slope), and plots were established along it at different distances from road edge. The diversity of herbaceous plant species was calculated in each plot using Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and Pielou's index. The results showed that diversity index decreased when distance from road edge increases. This decreasing trend continued up to 60 m from forest road margin, and after this threshold, the index slightly increased. Depending on the type of road (main or secondary) as well as cut or fill slopes, the area showing a statistical different plant composition and diversity measured through Shannon-Wiener, species richness, and Pielou's index is up to 10 m. The length depth of the road edge effect found in main and secondary forest roads was small, but it could have cumulative effects on forest microclimate and forest-associated biota at the island scale. Forest managers should account for the effect of road buildings on plant communities.

AB The Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae), is one of the most important pests of citrus in Mexico. We report the results of an analysis of A. ludens populations that inhabit the semi-arid highlands of the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico. This study aimed to provide information on population fluctuation of A. ludens and how it relates to climate variables, as well as insights into habitat and native parasitoids. Population peaked in the period July-November when ripe fruits of the wild host, Casimiroa pubescens Ramirez, were available. No adults were captured the rest of the year, suggesting that high populations depend on the availability of wild host fruit. No significant relationships between population fluctuation and climatic variables were observed, except for minimum temperature. Fruit samples of citron (Citrus medica L.), pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), and C. pubescens were collected to determine degree of infestation. Infestation levels (pupae/g) ranged between 0.0006 for citron, 0.0047 for pomegranate, and 0.0240 for C. pubescens. A native parasitoid of Tephritidae, Doryctobracon crawfordii (Viereck) (Braconidae), was identified. Parasitism percentage was calculated at 12.5% on C. pubescens fruits. No parasitoids were observed on citron or pomegranate fruit samples. These results contribute to knowledge on behavior of A. ludens native to temperate environments where no commercial hosts are available. Further research on host expansion of this pest in light of scenarios of global climate change is suggested.

AB In agroforestry systems, shade trees strongly affect the physiology of the undergrown crop. However, a major paradigm is that the reduction in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation is, to a certain extent, compensated by an increase in light-use efficiency, thereby reducing the difference in net primary productivity between shaded and non-shaded plants. Due to the large spatial heterogeneity in agroforestry systems and the lack of appropriate tools, the combined effects of such variables have seldom been analysed, even though they may help understand physiological processes underlying yield dynamics.
   In this study, we monitored net primary productivity, during two years, on scales ranging from individual coffee plants to the entire plot. Absorbed radiation was mapped with a 3D model (MAESPA). Light-use efficiency and net assimilation rate were derived for each coffee plant individually. We found that although irradiance was reduced by 60% below crowns of shade trees, coffee light-use efficiency increased by 50%, leaving net primary productivity fairly stable across all shade levels.
   Variability of aboveground net primary productivity of coffee plants was caused primarily by the age of the plants and by intraspecific competition among them (drivers usually overlooked in the agroforestry literature) rather than by the presence of shade trees.

AB AimTo propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants.
   LocationThe Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil.
   MethodsWe used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent.
   ResultsCurrent forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%-34% of species' distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios.
   Main conclusionsProtection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

AB Validation of the long-term biomass predictions of forest landscape models (FLMs) has always been a challenging task. Using the space-for-time substitution method, forest biomass curves over stand age were generated from a forest survey dataset (FSD) in the Lesser Khingan Mountains area (LKM), Northeastern China and compared with long-term biomass predictions of LANDIS-II model. The results showed that mean forest age and mean biomass of the LKM in 2000 were 51.6 years and 84.2 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Significant linear correlations were found between FSD derived biomass and simulated biomass in the aggradation phase for the entire LKM and most subregions. However, a considerable difference in the mean maximum biomass (53.45 Mg ha(-1)) existed between from FSD and simulation during the post-aggradation phase. The space-for-time substitution method has potential in validating time series biomass predictions of FLMs in aggradation phase when only limited forest inventory data is available.

AB The substitution of natural ecosystems with agriculture has led to the establishment of human-modified landscapes globally. In some tropical regions, this process is decades-old, allowing for the study of the effect of such modifications on the remaining biodiversity. However, unlike forest fragments inside regions with extensive primary coverage, the conservation value of ecosystems embedded within intensive farming, i.e., the anthropogenic matrices, has long been ignored, as have the effects of the landscape on such disturbed forest communities. Since the degradation process is predicted to cause the collapse of these fragmented forests, we can choose either to neglect them or to attempt the reversal of the degradation process for biodiversity conservation. Here we investigated the possible influence of landscape predictors on numerous plant species and on the relative proportions of different functional groups. Our results revealed that the richness found in human-modified landscapes had significantly more species than the protected reserves (+90%). The distribution of species suggested that any forest patch is likely to harbour a rare species. Generalised linear models and quantile regressions showed that forest cover and connected area influences the persistence of pioneer species and non-pioneer species of the canopy and zoochorics, with the latter also depending on slope. Rarefaction analysis revealed that natural remnants retain many species, even in sites with less than 20% forest cover. The presence of many zoo-choric and non-pioneer canopy species may indicate a qualitative aspect to support conservation-restora tion efforts. These results indicate that the current strategy, which is limited to the preservation of biodiversity in public conservation reserves, should be reconsidered and should include smaller remnants of the natural ecosystem in a regional context and adopt large-scale restoration strategies to preserve the species pool.

AB How a changing energy matrix for electricity production affects air quality is considered for an urban region in a tropical, forested environment. Manaus, the largest city in the central Amazon Basin of Brazil, is in the process of changing its energy matrix for electricity production from fuel oil and diesel to natural gas over an approximately 10-year period, with a minor contribution by hydropower. Three scenarios of urban air quality, specifically afternoon ozone concentrations, were simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Chem) model. The first scenario used fuel oil and diesel for electricity production, which was the reality in 2008. The second scenario was based on the fuel mix from 2014, the most current year for which data were available. The third scenario considered nearly complete use of natural gas for electricity production, which is the anticipated future, possibly for 2018. For each case, inventories of anthropogenic emissions were based on electricity generation, refinery operations, and transportation. Transportation and refinery operations were held constant across the three scenarios to focus on effects of power plant fuel switching in a tropical context. The simulated NOx and CO emissions for the urban region decrease by 89 and 55 %, respectively, after the complete change in the energy matrix. The results of the simulations indicate that a change to natural gas significantly decreases maximum afternoon ozone concentrations over the population center, reducing ozone by > 70% for the most polluted days. The sensitivity of ozone concentrations to the fuel switchover is consistent with a NOx - limited regime, as expected for a tropical forest having high emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, high water vapor concentrations, and abundant solar radiation. There are key differences in a shifting energy matrix in a tropical, forested environment compared to other world environments. Policies favoring the burning of natural gas in place of fuel oil and diesel have great potential for ozone reduction and improved air quality for growing urban regions located in tropical, forested environments around the world.

AB Background
   Studies on plant communities in the Amazon have reported that different hydro-edaphic conditions can affect the richness and the species composition of different ecosystems. However, this aspect is poorly known in the different savanna habitats. Understanding how populations and plant communities are distributed in these open vegetation areas is important to improve the knowledge about which environmental variables influence the occurrence and diversity of plants in this type of regional ecosystem. Thus, this study investigated the richness and composition of plant species in two savanna areas of the northern Brazilian Amazonia, using the coverage (%) of the different life forms observed under different hydro-edaphic conditions as a structural reference.
   New information
   We report 128 plant species classified in 34 botanical families distributed in three savanna habitats with different levels of hydro-edaphic restrictions. In this study, the habitats are conceptually presented and they integrate environmental information (edaphic factors and drainage type), which determines differences between floristic composition, species richness and coverage (%) of plant life forms.

AB We evaluated a program of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The program was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the program for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this program benefit is 2.4 times as large as the program costs.

AB According with niche theory the species are specialized in different ecological niches, being able to coexist as result of a differential use of resources. In this context, the biogeochemical niche hypothesis proposes that species have an optimal elemental composition which results from the link between the chemical and morphological traits for the optimum plant functioning. Thus, and attending to the limiting similarity concept, different elemental composition and plant structure among co-occurring species may reduce competition, promoting different functional niches. Different functional habits associated with leaf life-span or growth forms are associated with different strategies for resource uptake, which could promote niche partitioning. In the present study, based on the biogeochemical niche concept and the use of resources in different proportions, we have focused on leaf traits (morphological and chemical) associated with resource uptake, and explored the niche partitioning among functional habits: leaf life-span (deciduous, evergreen, and semideciduous) and growth (tree, shrub, and arborescent-shrub). To this end, we have quantified the hypervolume of the leaf functional trait space (both structure and chemical composition) in a sample of 45 Mediterranean woody species from Sierra Morena Mountains (Spain) growing along a local soil resource gradient. Our results show consistent variation in functional space for woody communities distributed along the environmental gradient. Thus, communities dominated by deciduous trees with faster growth and a predominant acquisitive strategy were characteristic of bottom forests and showed highest leaf biogeochemical space. While semideciduous shrubs and evergreen (arborescent, trees) species, characterized by a conservative strategy, dominated ridge forests and showed smaller functional space. In addition, within each topographical zone or environment type, the foliar biogeochemical niche partitioning would underlie the species ability to coexist by diverging on leaf nutrient composition and resource uptake. Lower niche overlap among functional habits were found, which support that different growth forms and leaf lifehabits may facilitate the coexistence of the woody species and niche partitioning along and within the gradient.

AB We studied the putative effect of early life experience on the physiological flexibility of metabolic and osmoregulatory traits in the leaf-eared mouse, Phyllotis darwini, an altricial rodent inhabiting seasonal Mediterranean environments. Adult individuals were collected in central Chile and maintained in breeding pairs. Pups were isolated after weaning and acclimated to different temperatures (cold or warm) and water availability (unrestricted and restricted) until adulthood. Subsequently, individuals were re-acclimated to the opposite treatment. Rodents reared in the warm and subjected to water restriction had lower basal metabolic rate (BMR), total evaporative water loss (TEWL) and body mass (M-b) compared with those developing in the cold treatment; nevertheless, individuals subjected to warm temperatures had greater relative medullary thickness (RMT) and urine concentrating ability (UCA). Cold-reared rodents re-acclimated to warm conditions exhibited physiological flexibility of metabolic traits; however, their osmoregulatory attributes did not vary. Conversely, warm-reared rodents re-acclimated to cold had reduced RMT and UCA, but the metabolic traits of these individuals did not change. These results suggest a trade-off between metabolic performance and renal capabilities that might hinder physiological acclimation. Our results support the hypothesis of ontogenetic dependence of short-term acclimation in osmoregulatory and metabolic traits in P. darwini.

AB Across the globe, rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns have caused persistent regional droughts, lengthened fire seasons, and increased the number of weather-driven extreme fire events. Because wildfires currently impact an increasing proportion of the total area burned, land managers need to better understand reburns in which previously burned areas can modify the patterns and severity of subsequent fires. For example, knowing how long past fire boundaries can function as barriers to fire spread may empower decision-makers to manage some wildfires as large-scale fuel treatments, or alternatively, determine where prescribed burning or strategic wildfire management are required. Additionally, a clear understanding of how prior burn mosaics influence future fire spread and burn severity is critical knowledge for landscape and fire-dependent wildlife habitat planning under a rapidly changing climate. Here, we review published studies on reburns in fire-adapted ecosystems of the world, including temperate forests of North America, semi-arid forests and rangelands, tropical and subtropical forests, grasslands and savannas, and Mediterranean ecosystems. To date, research on reburns is unevenly distributed across the world with a relative abundance of literature in Australia, Europe and North America and a scarcity of studies in Africa, Asia and South America. This review highlights the complex role of repeated fires in modifying vegetation and fuels, and patterns of subsequent wildfires. In fire prone ecosystems, the return of fire is inevitable, and legacies of past fires, or their absence, often dictate the characteristics of subsequent fires. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Secondary succession on abandoned pastures in the Amazon is characterized by low diversity and slow turnover of plant species in the early decades. Here we present the results of a 6-year experiment in order to evaluate the effects of artificially created forest gaps established in 20-year old Vismia-dominated secondary forests in Central Amazonia. Plant diversity and composition of trees <= 5 cm DBH were assessed in 21,100-m(2) lightgaps evenly distributed in three topographic positions (plateau, slope, and bottomland). These empirical results were compared with four uncut, control plots nearby the experimental plots. There were no topographic effects on plant density and species richness for either the two size classes analyzed (seedlings <1 cm DBH and saplings 1-5 cm DBH). Irrespective of topographic level, tree density varied significantly before and six years after lightgap formation, for the both size classes. At six years after gap creation, the number of species increased by 30% for the seedlings, despite of the fact that the density declined significantly following creation of the lightgaps. As a result, there was a more rapid species accumulation than prior to lightgap creation. However, for the saplings the increase in species richness could be explained by the increase in the number of individuals over the six-year period. There were no significant changes in tree density and species richness for either size class for the control plots. Species composition diverged greatly from before to six years after cutting, for both size classes, as revealed by the NMDS ordinations. Moreover, for seedlings there was greater floristic similarity among plots before lightgap creation in comparison to evident divergence six years later. In contrast, for saplings floristic composition among plots was more similar after six years than prior to lightgap formation. There was little difference in floristic composition before lightgap formation and control plots. Lack of seed dispersal can be an important obstacle to natural regeneration of degraded pastures in the tropics. However, the lightgaps showed a marked increase in old-growth species originating from surrounding mature forests six years later. On intensely used sites where succession is slow, small-scale disturbance represent a feasible management tool to accelerate natural regeneration. Forest regeneration on abandoned pastures will depend on the regional pool of species and their successful establishment in secondary forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding and managing pollination service is hindered by taxonomic impediments and paucity of data, particularly in the tropics. Herein we apply integrative species delineation and taxonomy to test impacts of land use on the diversity of bee communities within Xishuangbanna (Yunnan, south China), a highly biodiverse tropical region which has undergone extensive land conversion to rubber plantation. 128 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) were inferred by an iterative and integrative approach. Bee activity differed significantly across land use samples, although community composition corresponded more to level of vegetation density, when accounting for spatial structure. Species diversity was high in young rubber plantations, although composition overlapped with other species-rich habitats (natural forest edge and river banks), and older plantations (> 8 years) showed very low diversity under all measures. Community structures were similar between the natural forest interior and edge, although analysis indicated contrasting drivers of diversity, with clustering in the interior and overdispersion in the forest edge. Further, phylogenetic diversity and derived indices were underestimated when reference data were omitted from analysis. The description of bee communities herein permits more informed choices in land management with respect to ensuring continuation of essential services by bees.

TI Stand dynamics of the drought-affected floodplain forests of Araguaia
   River, Brazilian Amazon
SO FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
LA English

AB Background: The floodplain forests of Araguaia River, a clear-water river in the southeastern Amazon (Tocantins State, Brazil), are characterized by seasonal flooding up to 3.5 m height, low nutrient levels in the water, and seasonal drought periods of 4-5 months.
   Methods: We studied the forest dynamics (tree diameter growth, tree mortality and recruitment) of this unique forest ecosystem over a 5-year period by repeated censuses in 12 permanent plots established along a flooding gradient.
   Results: The cumulative basal area in the plots increased by 0.84 (+/- 0.45) m(2).ha(-1).yr(-1) (mean +/- SD) in the annually-flooded (AF) plots in lower terrain and by 0.69 (+/- 1.00) m(2).ha(-1).yr(-1) in the higher non-annually flooded (NAF) plots, corresponding to an aboveground biomass increase of 0.81 (+/- 0.57) and 0.69 (+/- 1.58) Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) in the AF and NAF plots, indicating a recent carbon sink in the biomass. Mean diameter growth rate was 1.8 (+/- 0.44) mm.yr(-1) in the AF and 2.0 (+/- 0.56) mm.yr(-1) in the NAF plots (corresponding to a coarse wood production of 1.53 (+/- 1.29) and 2.02 (+/- 0.52) Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1)), indicating no flooding effect on radial growth. Mean mortality rates in the 5-year period were 1.9 (+/- 0.37)%.yr(-1) in the AF plots and 1.8 (+/- 0.87)%.yr(-1) in the NAF plots with no differences along the flooding gradient. Highest mortalities were registered in the AF plots for the 10-20 cm dbh class (2.4%.yr(-1)), likely as a consequence of flooding, and in the NAF plots for the 40-50 cm dbh class (3.0%.yr(-1)), probably mainly caused by ENSO-related droughts.
   Conclusions: We conclude that these drought-affected tropical floodplain forests have a lower standing biomass and aboveground productivity than central Amazonian floodplain forests in more humid climates, and the imprint of the flooding gradient on stand dynamics is relatively weak, which may result from the lower flooding height and the interaction of flooding with low nutrient supply and periodic drought.

AB Question: Does light limitation reduce tolerance to leaf damage in the annual herb Datura stramonium?
   Hypothesis: Tolerance to leaf damage should be lower under light limitation (shade) than under full sunlight, because a reduction in leaf area and less exposure to light will limit carbon photo-assimilation and plants' ability to maintain fitness.
   Organism: Jimsonweed, Datura stramonium L. (Solanaceae).
   Methods: Damaged and undamaged plants of ten full-sib families (N = 471 plants) were grown under two different light treatments, full sunlight (control) and 35% light reduction (shade). Total seed number produced per plant was used as an estimate of maternal plant fitness. To compare the effect of light reduction on tolerance, we used the index of tolerance (the difference in seed production between the damaged and undamaged treatment of each genetic family). We also evaluated the effect of defoliation and light limitation on photosynthetic activity (estimated as the chlorophyll content index) and leaf growth compensation (i.e. total leaf area, mean area per leaf, and leaf number), compensatory characters related to tolerance.
   Conclusions: Light limitation exacerbates the negative effect of leaf damage on plant fitness, producing a two-fold average reduction in tolerance. Moreover, compensatory growth was lower in the light-limited environment. Under high damage and light limitation, the evolution of higher tolerance to damage can be highly constrained.

AB A list of spider species is presented for the Belem Area of Endemism, the most threatened region in the Amazon Basin, comprising portions of eastern State of Para and western State of Maranhao, Brazil. The data are based both on records from the taxonomic and biodiversity survey literature and on scientific collection databases. A total of 319 identified species were recorded, with 318 occurring in Para and only 22 in Maranhao. About 80% of species are recorded at the vicinities of the city of Belem, indicating that sampling effort have been strongly biased. To identify potentially high- diversity areas, discounting the effect of variations in sampling effort, the residues of a linear regression between the number of records and number of species mapped in each 0.25 degrees grid cells were analyzed. One grid, representing the Alto Turia double dagger u Indigenous land, had the highest deviation from the expected from the linear regression, indicating high expected species richness. Several other grid cells showed intermediate values of the regression residuals, indicating species richness moderately above to the expected from the model.

AB Forest fragmentation and the use of landscape matrices by agricultural and forest cultures can change the species composition such that these will no longer reflect the structure of the native forests. Thus, fragments can lose their potential to provide propagules for restoration once they lose species, or when its structure is changed due to fragmentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a network of remnant forest fragments formed +/- 60 years ago on a farm to act as a propagule source for a natural regeneration process. The study area belongs to the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (FOM) formation and is used in the production of exotic forest species. The 798 ha area is located in the Ponte Alta (SC) municipality. Data from phytosociological surveys of this formation were used for comparison, using curves based on the individual rarefaction, distribution of the six most abundant species, proportion of species and zoochoric individual, and similarity analysis in between different areas. The forest fragment showed compatible species richness and at certain times higher than can be found in other FOM situations. Mimosa scabrella was the most abundant species differing from other surveys. The amount of species with zoochoric dispersion mechanisms was similar to what was expected of FOM formations, however, the quantity of zoochoric individuals was below expected. The results indicate that the fragments show potential to act as propagule sources in the restoration process within the farm areas. Nonetheless, the capacity can be rather limited once the fragments show some different characteristics of other Araucaria's forests.

AB For most Ivorian regions quantitative data on the exploitation of bushmeat by local communities are scarce. We studied hunting patterns around Dassioko Sud Forest Reserve, a remnant coastal forest in south-eastern Cote d'Ivoire, through a 6-month survey of nine restaurants, in three villages surrounding the Reserve. We collected quantitative and qualitative data on the bushmeat brought to restaurants, as well as the final price for which it was sold. We calculated mean prices over the study period and extrapolated to the whole year. A total of 376 mammals (98%) and eight reptiles (2%) were sold in the restaurants surveyed. Rodents and small antelopes represented 74% of the mammals sold, probably reflecting the fact that reproductive strategists persist more successfully in heavily hunted and/or agricultural landscapes, such as the area around the Reserve. Our conservative estimate of the total biomass of bushmeat harvested annually around the Reserve is c. 40,428.03 kg (c. 11,886 animals), with a monetary value of c. FCFA 47,728,516 (c. USD 93,485.75 ), yielding an annual income of c. USD10,387.31 per person, which exceeds the mean annual income of cocoa farmers (FCFA 466,032/USD 932) more than tenfold. Although the sustainability of the bushmeat trade in the surveyed area remains unknown, we showed that hunters predominantly used cable snares, the Reserve was significantly affected by hunting activities (c. 53% of the bushmeat originated there), and larger mammalian species had been extirpated. A lack of effective protection exposes the Reserve to multiple illegal activities, including hunting, a situation exacerbated by the political crisis in 2010.

AB This study aimed to determine seed dormancy, desiccation, low-temperature sensitivity and storage behavior of seeds of Garcinia gummi-gutta, a medicinally important tropical evergreen tree. These seed characteristics serve as important ecological traits to regulate the regeneration strategy of plants by synchronizing seed germination timing with the wet season. De-coated fresh seeds imbibed water and had > 90% germination within four weeks, but seeds with an intact seed coat required about 24 weeks of warm temperature to attain 90% germination. Desiccation of intact seeds with silica gel at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C revealed that the rate of desiccation varies with temperature. The critical moisture content (CMC), which is the moisture content below which there is a rapid fall in viability, for G. gummi-gutta seeds is similar to 34% and seeds completely lose viability at 24 and 17% moisture content (MC) at 25 and 35 degrees C, respectively. Based on these results, fresh seeds with MC of 43% and reduced MC of 34% were stored at six temperatures ranging from -10 to 35 degrees C for a period of 18 months. Rapid decline in germination was recorded at -10, 5 and 35 degrees C. However, at 15 degrees C, seeds with both 43% and 34% MC retained 90% viability for 18 months. The half viability period (P-50) indicated that an optimum condition for long-term seed storage is 15 degrees C with 34% MC. We conclude that seeds of G. gummi-gutta have non-deep physiological dormancy (PD) and are sensitive to desiccation and low temperature. Inspite of their recalcitrant nature, the seeds of G. gummi-gutta have PD, thus the species is classified as a tropical dormant recalcitrant.

AB I investigated whether the morphological traits of Neotropical ants can be used to infer food resource use by individual species and by entire communities, and whether these relationships are related to habitat type and/or by morphological differences between ant subfamilies. I attracted ants using food baits that represented different ecological processes (e.g. predation, granivory, detritivory, nectarivory) in five habitat types along a land-use gradient (from forests to gardens). I assessed ant activity at the baits and characterized 64 species from six subfamilies according to their food use and community-level resource exploitation intensity in the different habitats. Next, I performed a Mantel test to reveal the relationships between 13 morphological measures and resource use at the species level. I then used ant clades (i.e. subfamily) and habitat to rank the ants along three axes of variation in relation to their morphology and food resource use. Finally, I tested whether associations existed between the community-level exploitation intensity for such resources and the distribution of morphological trait values using the "4th-corner" analysis. Morphological traits were closely linked to the species' ability to exploit different resources. These relationships were affected by subfamily and, to a lesser extent, by habitat type. The characterization of trait sets for entire communities was not useful, however, in predicting the intensity of the exploitation of different types of resources in varying environmental conditions. I conclude that morphological traits are accurate predictors of the ecology of species, but they should be used with caution when trying to understand community-level patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fire is a natural disturbance in savannas, and defines vegetation physiognomy and structure, often influencing species diversity. Fire activity is determined by a wide range of factors, including long and short term climatic conditions, climate seasonality, wind speed and direction, topography, and fuel biomass. In Brazil, fire shapes the structure and composition of cerrado savannas, and the impact of fire on vegetation dynamics is well explored, but the drivers of variation in fire disturbance across landscapes and over time are still poorly understood. We reconstructed 31 years of fire occurrence history in the Serra do Cipo region, a highly-diverse cerrado landscape, located in the southern portion of the Espinhaco mountain range, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We mapped burn scars using a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2014. Our questions were 1) How does fire occurrence vary in time and space across the Serra do Cipo cerrado landscape? 2) Which climatic drivers may explain the spatial and inter-annual variation in fire occurrence on this landscape? 3) Is fire occurrence in this cerrado landscape moisture-limited or fuel-limited? We evaluated the inter-annual variation and distribution of burned areas, and used linear models to explain this variation in terms of rainfall amount (determinant of fuel load production), seasonal rainfall distribution (determinant of dry fuel availability), abnormality of precipitation (Standardized Precipitation Index - SPI), and vegetation type (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI). Contrary to our expectations, annual rainfall volume was weakly and negatively correlated with burned area, and the strongest predictor of burned area was drought during the ignition season. The length of the dry season and the distribution of rain along the season determined ignition probability, increasing fire occurrence during the driest periods. We conclude that the mountain cerrado vegetation at Serra do Cipo has a moisture-dependent fire regime, in contrast to the fuel-dependent fire regimes described for African savannas. These findings imply that savannas at different continents may have different recovery and resilience capabilities when subjected to changes in the fire regime, caused by direct anthropogenic activities or indirectly through climatic changes. The possible effects of these changes on cerrado landscapes are still unknown, and future studies should investigate if currently observed fire regimes have positive or negative impacts on vegetation diversity, recovery, resilience and phenology, thus helping managers to include fire management as conservation measure.

AB Tree species were assembled into forest communities by various processes, and it was found that trees are spatially arranged in a community by the abiotic and biotic conditions within that community. Here, we explore the abiotic processes and biotic interactions in the spatial patterning of tree species across six old-growth forest types in a tropical nature reserve. Four spatial point process models (the homogeneous Poisson process, inhomogeneous Poisson process, homogeneous Thomas process, and inhomogeneous Thomas process) were used to evaluate the potential contribution of the random processes, habitat heterogeneity, dispersal limitation, and the joint effects of dispersal and habitat heterogeneity to the formation of the spatial patterns of tree species. A combination of the null model and size-distance regression analysis was applied to assess the effect of competition and facilitation on the tree species assembly. We found that the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Thomas processes were the best models for describing the spatial patterns of more than 85% tree species across the six tropical forests. The combination of the null model and size-distance regression analysis showed that 3744% of tree species were affected by competition and 924% of tree species were affected by facilitation across the six tropical forest types. Competition was the dominant form of species interactions in forests with mild abiotic conditions such as the tropical montane rain forest and tropical lowland rain forest. Meanwhile, facilitation was the most important biotic interaction in the abiotically harsh tropical montane dwarf forest on mountaintops. Our study suggests that dispersal limitation and the joint effects of dispersal and habitat heterogeneity were the dominant abiotic processes in controlling the spatial patterning of trees in tropical forests. Moreover, the relative importance of competition and facilitation in the assembly of the tree species varied among the forest types with different abiotic conditions.

AB Accurate estimates of tree mortality are essential for the development of mechanistic forest dynamics models, and for estimating carbon storage and cycling. However, identifying agents of tree mortality is difficult and imprecise. Although lightning kills thousands of trees each year and is an important agent of mortality in some forests, the frequency and distribution of lightning-caused tree death remain unknown for most forests. Moreover, because all evidence regarding the effects of lightning on trees is necessarily anecdotal and post hoc, rigorous tests of hypotheses regarding the ecological effects of lightning are impossible. We developed a combined electronic sensor/camera-based system for the location and characterization of lightning strikes to the forest canopy in near real time and tested the system in the forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Cameras mounted on towers provided continuous video recordings of the forest canopy that were analyzed to determine the locations of lightning strikes. We used a preliminary version of this system to record and locate 18 lightning strikes to the forest over a 3-year period. Data from field surveys of known lightning strike locations (obtained from the camera system) enabled us to develop a protocol for reliable, ground-based identification of suspected lightning damage to tropical trees. In all cases, lightning damage was relatively inconspicuous; it would have been overlooked by ground-based observers having no knowledge of the event. We identified three types of evidence that can be used to consistently identify lightning strike damage in tropical forests: (1) localized and directionally biased branch mortality associated with flashover among tree and sapling crowns, (2) mortality of lianas or saplings near lianas, and (3) scorched or wilting epiphytic and hemiepiphytic plants. The longitudinal trunk scars that are typical of lightning-damaged temperate trees were never observed in this study. Given the prevalence of communications towers worldwide, the lightning detection system described here could be implemented in diverse forest types. Data from multiple systems would provide an outstanding opportunity for comparative research on the ecological effects of lightning. Such comparative data are increasingly important given expected increases in lightning frequency with climatic change.

AB This article draws attention to the problem of deforestation and systematically identifying its root causes, by incorporating the point of view of all stakeholders, forestry sector experts and policy makers from the Federal, provincial and local level. It provides a brief overview of the perspectives of different stakeholders in the forests and the degradation of forests in the country. The main causes of deforestation are growing demographic pressure, poor management of natural forests, rural and urban communities' household dependency on fuelwood, unscientific pastures beyond capacity, forest fires and storms, the lack of financial inputs and the lack of participation of stakeholders in the policy process. Due to poor governance and inappropriate policies, the forests decline since 2000 has led to negative impacts on the environment. Among the other devastating effects soil erosion and flooding are the main after effects of deforestation in the country. The analysis shows that irrespective of their interests, the participation of all stakeholders in the process of policy making should go a long way to arrest a sharp forest decline in Pakistan.

AB We assessed woody plant communities in two widely separated forests in the tropical dry forest (TDF) biome of Mexico for evidence of similar patterns of species commonness and rarity. We used belt transects laid out along contour lines (i.e., constant elevation) and stratified across elevation gradients at sites in Jalisco and Oaxaca to sample woody plant species diversity, abundance, relative frequency and basal area. We assembled a combined species list and compared species found in both sites (shared) to species found in only one site, assessing whether the most and least common species at a site tended to be shared or unshared. Of the 8242 individuals sampled, 370 species or morpho-species were identified, with 222 species recorded at the Jalisco site and 270 at the Oaxaca site-122 (33%) species were shared across sites. Abundance, frequency and basal area of shared species were greater on average than for unshared species, and were positively correlated across sites. A subset of 68 shared species (18%) accounted for over half of all individuals encountered at the two sites. Species in the most common quartile were more likely to be shared than expected by chance, while species in the least common quartile were less likely. A genus-level analysis found similar patterns. Our findings suggest that the TDF of Pacific coast Mexico shows evidence of widespread dominance by a small subset of species. These findings have potentially important implications for predicting species composition, understanding the role of oligarchic species in ecological processes, and conserving rare species.

AB A key element missing from many predictive models of the impacts of climate change on intertidal ectotherms is the role of individual behaviour. In this synthesis, using littorinid snails as a case study, we show how thermoregulatory behaviours may buffer changes in environmental temperatures. These behaviours include either a flight response, to escape the most extreme conditions and utilize warmer or cooler environments; or a fight response, where individuals modify their own environments to minimize thermal extremes. A conceptual model, generated from studies of littorinid snails, shows that various flight and fight thermoregulatory behaviours may allow an individual to widen its thermal safety margin (TSM) under warming or cooling environmental conditions and hence increase species' resilience to climate change. Thermoregulatory behaviours may also buffer sublethal fitness impacts associated with thermal stresses. Through this synthesis, we emphasize that future studies need to consider not only animals' physiological limits but also their capacities to buffer the impact of climate change through behavioural responses. Current generalizations, made largely on physiological limits of species, often neglect the buffering effects of behaviour and may, therefore, provide an over-estimation of vulnerability, and consequently poor prediction of the potential impacts of climate change on intertidal ectotherms.

AB The apparent prevalence of rare species (rarity) in the deep sea is a concern for environmental management and conservation of biodiversity. Rare species are often considered at risk of extinction and, in terrestrial and shallow water environments, have been shown to play key roles within an ecosystem. In the deep-sea environment, current research focuses primarily on abundant species and deep-sea stakeholders are questioning the importance of rare species in ecosystem functioning. This study asks whether deep-sea stakeholders (primarily scientists) view rare-species research as a priority in guiding environmental management. Delphi methodology (i.e., an iterative survey approach) was used to understand views about whether or not 'deep-sea scientists should allocate more resources to research on rare species in the deep sea, even if this means less resources might be available for abundant-species research.' Results suggest little consensus regarding the prioritization of resources for rare-species research. From Survey 1 to Survey 3, the average participant response shifted toward a view that rare-species research is not a priority if it comes at a cost to research on abundant species. Participants pointed to the need for a balanced approach and highlighted knowledge gaps about even the most fundamental questions, including whether rare species are truly 'rare' or simply under-sampled. Participants emphasized the lack of basic biological knowledge for rare and abundant species, particularly abundant meio- and microscopic species, as well as uncertainty in the roles rare and abundant species play in ecosystem processes. Approaches that jointly consider the role of rare and abundant species in ecosystem functioning (e.g., biological trait analysis) may help to clarify the extent to which rare species steed to be incorporated into deep-sea environment management in order to maintain ecosystem functioning.

AB The Atlantic forest of Brazil is extremely fragmented. This fragmentation has had a toll on the mammal's assemblages. Although different species are not equally susceptible to fragmentation, populations of some species have become locally extinct. Primate populations in these fragments are in decline or have gone locally extinct. However, there is a dearth of information on density of primates in the highly fragmented Atlantic forest of NE Brazil. We conducted a series of censuses to record primates and other mammals in the Pacatuba semi deciduous forest (similar to 267 ha). Most of the midsized and large mammals disappeared, even fragment-tolerant species such as sloths and coatis are missing in the area. Currently, marmosets (Callithrix jacchus Linnaeus, 1758) and red handed howlers (Alouatta belzebul Linnaeus, 1766) are the most abundant species. Howlers preferred areas with larger trees and marmosets were more common in edge habitat. Marmosets were the most abundant species (264 individual/km(2)). Howlers attained the highest densities recorded so far in the Atlantic forest (94.7 individual/km(2)), and the fragment is probably hyper abundant with howlers. The high availability of larger trees and fruit resources combined with the lack of natural predators, the reduced possibility of dispersal and the semi-deciduousness of the forest could explain these results.

AB Seedlings are vulnerable to many biotic and abiotic agents, and studying seedling dynamics helps understand mechanisms of species coexistence. In this study, the relative importance of biotic neighbors and habitat heterogeneity to seedling survival was examined by generalized linear mixed models for 33 species in a spruce-fir valley forest in northeastern China. The results showed that the relative importance of these factors varied with species and functional groups. Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) was important to the survival of Abies nephrolepis and Picea koraiensis seedling, whereas phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD) was critical to Pinus koraiensis and Betula platyphylla, as well as functional groups of tree, deciduous, and shade-intolerant seedlings. For shrubs and Acer ukurunduense, habitat heterogeneity was significant. Despite of the significance of CNDD, PNDD, and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival, large proportions of the total variance were not accounted for by the studied variables, suggesting the needs to examine the influences of other factors such as pests, diseases, herbivores, forest structure, species functional traits, and microclimatic conditions on seedling survival in the future.

AB Recent studies into community level dynamics are revealing processes and patterns that underpin the biodiversity and complexity of natural ecosystems. Theoretical food webs have suggested that species-rich and highly complex communities are inherently unstable, but incorporating certain characteristics of empirical communities, such as allometric body size scaling and non-random interaction distributions, have been shown to enhance stability and facilitate species coexistence. Incorporating individual level traits and variability into food web theory is seen as a future pathway for this research and our growing knowledge of individual behaviours, in the form of temperament (or personality) traits, can inform the direction of this research. Temperament traits are consistent differences in behaviour between individuals, which are repeatable across time and/or across ecological contexts, such as aggressive or boldness behaviours that commonly differ between individuals of the same species. These traits, under the framework of behavioural reaction norms, show both individual consistency as well as contextual and phenotypic plasticity. This is likely to contribute significantly to the effects of individual trait variability and adaptive trophic behaviour on the structure and dynamics of food webs, which are apparently stabilizing. Exploring the role of temperament in the context of community ecology is a unique opportunity for cross-pollination between ecological fields, and can provide new insights into community stability and biodiversity.

AB Despite the ecological and economic importance of Acacia senegal, little is known about the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on its natural regeneration patterns and population structure. We investigated the effects of these factors within the Lake Baringo woodland ecosystem. Data was collected from 60 plots of 20 m x 20 m systematically distributed in four A. senegal-dominated populations within the Lake Baringo woodland. Sample populations spanned a degradation gradient measured by a population disturbance index (PDI). Trees were measured for diameter at breast height (DBH) and categorized by growth stages: seedling, sapling and adult tree. Higher seedling and sapling densities were recorded in lightly than heavily disturbed populations, but only sapling density was significantly different between the two disturbance levels (P = 0.02). Lightly disturbed populations revealed a reversed J-shape size-class distribution (SCD) indicative of stable structure unlike the heavily disturbed populations. The quotient and permutation indices indicated unstable populations with episodic recruitment and mortality. Our study reveals that natural regeneration and population structure of A. senegal were affected majorly by selective harvesting and heavy browsing. Suitable management strategies to control livestock grazing and illegal tree harvesting within the woodland is required to promote conservation of the species genetic resources.

   TROPICS; ESTABLISHMENT; GROWTH; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; SIZE
AB AimsTo address whether seed and seedling functional traits have a significant effect on germination rates and seedling survival in direct-seeding restoration efforts. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) seed burial only favours the emergence of round seeds; and (2) straw mulching improves soil moisture and prevents the emergence of the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens, promoting the establishment of native tree seedlings.
   LocationExperimental field, Central Brazil. Savanna, recently dominated by exotic pasture.
   MethodsWe evaluated the effects of seed burial (surface and buried) and mulching (no-mulch, 5-cm straw mulch and 10-cm straw mulch) on the emergence, survival and growth of 16 species of native Cerrado tree species with variable seed sizes and shapes and seedling types. Thirty seeds of each species were sown per treatment combination in three blocks.
   ResultsSeed burial did not affect the emergence of species with round seeds, but negatively affected species with flat seeds and phanerocotylar-epigeal-foliaceous seedlings. Straw mulching reduced the emergence of flat seeds and phanerocotylar seedlings, but increased soil moisture and strongly reduced U.decumbens emergence, resulting in a higher growth rate of tree seedlings up to 1yr for five species.
   ConclusionDirect seeding is an effective technique to plant a mixture of Cerrado tree species for restoration, provided the soil is well prepared and there are mechanisms to control invasive species.

AB High shore intertidal ectotherms must withstand temperatures which are already close, at or beyond their upper physiological thermal tolerance. Their behaviour can provide a relief under heat stress, and increase their survival through thermoregulation. Here, we used infrared imaging to reveal the thermoregulatory behavioural strategies used by the snail Littorina saxatilis (Olivi) on different microhabitats of a high shore boulder field in Finistere (western France) in summer. On our study site, substrate temperature is frequently greater than L. saxatilis upper physiological thermal limits, especially on sun exposed microhabitats. To maintain body temperatures within their thermal tolerance window, withdrawn snails adopted a flat posture, or elevated their shells and kept appended to the rock on the outer lip of their aperture with dried mucous (standing posture). These thermal regulatory behaviours lowered snail body temperatures on average by 1-2 degrees C. Aggregation behaviour had no thermoregulatory effect on L. saxatilis in the present study. The occupation of biogenic microhabitats (barnacles) was associated with a 1 degrees C decrease in body temperatures. Barnacles and micro habitats that experienced low sun exposure, low thermal fluctuations and low thermal maxima, could buffer the heat extremes encountered at high shore level especially on sun exposed microhabitats.

AB The spatial distribution of tropical tree species can affect the consistency of the estimators in commercial forest inventories, therefore, appropriate sampling procedures are required to survey species with different spatial patterns in the Amazon Forest. For this, the present study aims to evaluate the conventional sampling procedures and introduce the adaptive cluster sampling for volumetric inventories of Amazonian tree species, considering the hypotheses that the density, the spatial distribution and the zero-plots affect the consistency of the estimators, and that the adaptive cluster sampling allows to obtain more accurate volumetric estimation. We use data from a census carried out in Jamari National Forest, Brazil, where trees with diameters equal to or higher than 40 cm were measured in 1,355 plots. Species with different spatial patterns were selected and sampled with simple random sampling, systematic sampling, linear cluster sampling and adaptive cluster sampling, whereby the accuracy of the volumetric estimation and presence of zero-plots were evaluated. The sampling procedures applied to species were affected by the low density of trees and the large number of zero-plots, wherein the adaptive clusters allowed concentrating the sampling effort in plots with trees and, thus, agglutinating more representative samples to estimate the commercial volume.

AB Background and Aims Natural enemies are known to be important in regulating plant populations and contributing to species coexistence (Janzen-Connell effects). The strength of Janzen-Connell effects (both distance-and density-effects) varies across species, but the life history traits that may mediate such a variation are not well understood. This study examined Janzen-Connell effects across the life stages (seed through adult stages) of two sympatric palm species with distinct phenologies and shade tolerances, two traits that may mediate the strength and timing of Janzen-Connell effects.
   Methods Populations of two common palm species, Attalea phalerata and Astrocaryum murumuru, were studied in Manu National Park, Peru. Seed predation experiments were conducted to assess Janzen-Connell effects at the seed stage. In the post-seed stages, spatial point pattern analyses of the distributions of individuals and biomass were used to infer the strength of distance-and density-effects.
   Key Results Seed predation was both negative distance-and density-dependent consistent with the Janzen-Connell effects. However, only seedling recruitment for asynchronously fruiting Attalea phalerata was depressed near adults while recruitment remained high for synchronously fruiting Astrocaryum murumuru, consistent with weak distance-effects. Negative density-effects were strong in the early stages for shade-intolerant Attalea phalerata but weak or absent in shade-tolerant Astrocaryum murumuru.
   Conclusions Distance-and density-effects varied among the life stages of the two palm species in a manner that corresponded to their contrasting phenology and shade tolerance. Generalizing such connections across many species would provide a route to understanding how trait-mediated Janzen-Connell effects scale up to whole communities of species.

AB Conservation relies heavily on protected areas (PAs) maintaining their key biodiversity features to meet global biodiversity conservation goals. However, PAs have had variable success, with many failing to fully maintain their biodiversity features. The current literature concerning what drives variability in PA performance is rapidly expanding but unclear, sometimes contradictory, and spread across multiple disciplines. A clear understanding of the drivers of successful biodiversity conservation in PAs is necessary to make them fully effective. Here, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge concerning the drivers of biological outcomes within PAs, focusing on those that can be addressed at local scales. We evaluate evidence in support of potential drivers to identify those that enable more successful outcomes and those that impede success and provide a synthetic review. Interactions are discussed where they are known, and we highlight gaps in understanding. We find that elements of PA design, management, and local and national governance challenges, species and system ecology, and sociopolitical context can all influence outcomes. Adjusting PA management to focus on actions and policies that influence the key drivers identified here could improve global biodiversity outcomes.

AB Hunting in the neotropics is a widespread form of resource extraction. However, there is increasing concern that current activities are leading to the decline and extirpation of vulnerable species; particulary ateline primates, large ungulates (such as tapirs and white-lipped peccaries) and large birds such as curassows. Hunting patterns are expected to be a product of two principal influences: the value of return for a given amount of effort invested into hunting, and cultural factors that determine the prestige and usefulness of prey. Previous work has suggested that hunting profiles change in a predictable way over time, becoming more diverse and more dependent on smaller bodied species as preferred, large-bodied prey become scarcer. In this paper, we evaluate the hunting profiles of 78 neotropical communities in Central and South America. We investigate the uniformity of species preferences, whether communities that are geographically closer have similar hunting profiles, and whether the age and size of settlements can be used to predict the type and diversity of species targeted. We found that there was only a weak correlation between the structure of communities' hunting profiles and their geographical proximity. Neither a community's size nor age was a good predictor of the shape and structure of its hunting profile. Our data suggest that either the availability of prey or the cultural influences dictating the value of different species can change rapidly over small distances, and that older and larger settlements do not impact prey species distributions in a predictable way.

AB Land use changes are one of the most important factors causing environmental transformations and species diversity alterations. The aim of the current study was to develop a geoinformatics-based framework to quantify alpha and beta diversity indices in two sites in Israel with different land uses, i.e., an agricultural system of fruit orchards, an afforestation system of planted groves, and an unmanaged system of groves. The framework comprises four scaling steps: (1) classification of a tree species distribution (SD) map using imaging spectroscopy (IS) at a pixel size of 1 m; (2) estimation of local species richness by calculating the alpha diversity index for 30-m grid cells; (3) calculation of beta diversity for different land use categories and sub-categories at different sizes; and (4) calculation of the beta diversity difference between the two sites. The SD was classified based on a hyperspectral image with 448 bands within the 380-2500 nm spectral range and a spatial resolution of 1 m. Twenty-three tree species were classified with high overall accuracy values of 82.57% and 86.93% for the two sites. Significantly high values of the alpha index characterize the unmanaged land use, and the lowest values were calculated for the agricultural land use. In addition, high values of alpha indices were found at the borders between the polygons related to the "edge-effect" phenomenon, whereas low alpha indices were found in areas with high invasion species rates. The beta index value, calculated for 58 polygons, was significantly lower in the agricultural land use. The suggested framework of this study succeeded in quantifying land use effects on tree species distribution, evenness, and richness. IS and spatial statistics techniques offer an opportunity to study woody plant species variation with a multiscale approach that is useful for managing land use, especially under increasing environmental changes.

AB Plant species within communities may overlap in pollinators' use and influence visitation patterns of shared pollinators, potentially engaging in indirect interactions (e.g., facilitation or competition). While several studies have explored the mechanisms regulating insect-pollination networks, there is a lack of studies on bird-pollination systems, particularly in species-rich tropical areas. Here, we evaluated if phenotypic similarity, resource availability (floral abundance), evolutionary relatedness and flowering phenology affect the potential for indirect effects via shared pollinators in hummingbird-pollinated plant species within four communities in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Among the evaluated factors, phenotypic similarity (corolla length and anther height) was the most important variable, while resource availability (floral abundance) had a secondary importance. On the other hand, evolutionary relatedness and flowering phenology were less important, which altogether highlights the relevance of convergent evolution and that the contribution of a plant to the diet of the pollinators of another plant is independent of the level of temporal overlap in flowering in this tropical system. Interestingly, our findings contrast with results from multiple insect-pollinated plant communities, mostly from temperate regions, in which floral abundance was the most important driver, followed by evolutionary relatedness and phenotypic similarity. We propose that these contrasting results are due to high level of specialization inherent to tropical hummingbird-pollination systems. Moreover, our results demonstrated that factors defining linkage rules of plant-hummingbird networks also determinate plant-plant potential indirect effects. Future studies are needed to test if these findings can be generalized to other highly specialized systems. Overall, our results have important implications for the understanding of ecological processes due resource sharing in mutualistic systems.

AB One of the world's most important and rapidly expanding crops, oil palm, is associated with low levels of biodiversity. Changes in predator communities might alter ecosystem services and subsequently sustainable management but these links have received little attention to date. Here, for the first time, we manipulated ant and flying vertebrate (birds and bats) access to oil palms in six smallholder plantations in Sumatra (Indonesia) and measured effects on arthropod communities, related ecosystem functions (herbivory, predation, decomposition and pollination) and crop yield. Arthropod predators increased in response to reductions in ant and bird access, but the overall effect of experimental manipulations on ecosystem functions was minimal. Similarly, effects on yield were not significant. We conclude that ecosystem functions and productivity in oil palm are, under current levels of low pest pressure and large pollinator populations, robust to large reductions of major predators.

AB Timber management directly influences the population dynamics of tree species, like Copaifera spp. (copaiba), which provide oil-resin with ecological and economic importance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the structure and population dynamics of Copaifera in unmanaged and managed stands by reduced-impact logging (RIL) in eastern Amazon in Para state, Brazil. Based on a stem map of the study area, 40 Copaifera trees were randomly selected, where an equal number of trees were selected in managed and unmanaged stands. A transect of 10 x 100 m was centered at each tree (50 m each side) to assess Copaifera regeneration. Transects were subdivided into ten plots, of which six were systematically chosen to assess the height, diameter and number of Copaifera seedlings and saplings. The field assessment occurred in 2011 and 2013. To estimate the amount of sunlight transmitted to the forest floor, we computed canopy cover from airborne LiDAR data. According to the results, the abundance of Copaifera seedlings/saplings was higher in managed than unmanaged stands. About 5% of Copaifera regeneration was found between 45-50 m from the Copaifera tree while -73% of regeneration was concentrated within a 10 m radius of the Copaifera tree. We verified that the diameter distribution of Copaifera regeneration was not a negative exponential distribution, as is typical of most tree species in natural forest. Rather, the Copaifera regeneration had a spatially aggregated distribution. In this short-term analysis, the impact of timber management is not negatively affecting the population structure or dynamics of Copaifera regeneration.

AB 1. Ants are recognized as one of the major sources of soil disturbance world-wide. However, this view is largely based on isolated studies and qualitative reviews. Here, for the first time, we quantitatively determined whether ant nests affect soil fertility and plant performance, and identified the possible sources of variation of these effects.
   2. Using Bayesian mixed-models meta-analysis, we tested the hypotheses that ant effects on soil fertility and plant performance depend on the substrate sampled, ant feeding type, latitude, habitat and the plant response variable measured.
   3. Ant nests showed higher nutrient and cation content than adjacent non-nest soil samples, but similar pH. Nutrient content was higher in ant refuse materials than in nest soils. The fertilizer effect of ant nests was also higher in dry habitats than in grasslands or savannas. Cation content was higher in nests of plant-feeding ants than in nests of omnivorous species, and lower in nests from agro-ecosystems than in nests from any other habitat.
   4. Plants showed higher green/root biomass and fitness on ant nests soils than in adjacent, non-nest sites; but plant density and diversity were unaffected by the presence of ant nests. Root growth was particularly higher in refuse materials than in ant nest soils, in leaf-cutting ant nests and in deserts habitats.
   5. Our results confirm the major role of ant nests in influencing soil fertility and vegetation patterns and provide information about the factors that mediate these effects. First, ant nests improve soil fertility mainly through the accumulation of refuse materials. Thus, different refuse dump locations (external or in underground nest chambers) could benefit different vegetation life-forms. Second, ant nests could increase plant diversity at larger spatial scales only if the identity of favoured plants changes along environmental gradients (i.e. enhancing beta-diversity). Third, ant species that feed on plants play a relevant role fertilizing soils, which may balance their known influence as primary consumers. Fourth, the effects of ant nests as fertility islands are larger in arid lands, possibly because fertility is intrinsically lower in these habitats. Overall, this study provide novel and quantitative evidence confirming that ant nests are key soil modifiers, emphasizing their role as ecological engineers.

AB Temperate ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi show segregation whereby some species dominate in organic layers and others favor mineral soils. Weak layering in tropical soils is hypothesized to decrease niche space and therefore reduce the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   The Neotropical ECM tree Dicymbe corymbosa forms monodominant stands and has a distinct physiognomy with vertical crown development, adventitious roots and massive root mounds, leading to multi-stemmed trees with spatially segregated rooting environments: aerial litter caches, aerial decayed wood, organic root mounds and mineral soil. We hypothesized that these microhabitats host distinct fungal assemblages and therefore promote diversity.
   To test our hypothesis, we sampled D.corymbosa ectomycorrhizal root tips from the four microhabitats and analyzed community composition based on pyrosequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcode markers.
   Several dominant fungi were ubiquitous but analyses nonetheless suggested that communities in mineral soil samples were statistically distinct from communities in organic microhabitats. These data indicate that distinctive rooting zones of D.corymbosa contribute to spatial segregation of the fungal community and likely enhance fungal diversity.

AB Soil hydrolysable P can be a main P source for biota in P-limited tropical rain forests. Soil hydrolysable P occurs in various chemical fractions, including, monoester P, diester P, pyrophosphate and phytate, which need enzymatic hydrolysis into orthophosphate before their assimilation into biota. We examined whether P-limited plants and microbes preferentially hydrolyzed specific fraction of soil hydrolysable P and whether those in different successional stages had different abilities to hydrolyze various soil hydrolysable P.
   We measured four classes of phosphatase (phosphomonoesterase, PME; phosphodiesterase, PDE; pyrophosphatase, PyP; and phytase, PhT) activities for fine-roots and soils in nitrogen (N) and P fertilized primary and secondary tropical rain forests in Sabah, Malaysia.
   P fertilization reduced PME, PyP and PhT activities for fine-roots and PME and PyP activities for soils. Fine-roots in primary forests had higher PME and PyP activities whereas those in secondary forests had higher PhT activities.
   We suggest that P-limited trees and microbes depend more on hydrolysable P degraded by one step of enzymatic reaction (monoester P, pyrophosphate, and phytate) as a P source. We also suggest that trees have different soil-organic-P acquisition strategies in association with their life history strategies.

AB As Earth's most influential naturally-recurring sea and atmospheric oscillation, ENSO results in widespread changes in the climate system not only over much of the tropics and subtropics, but also in high latitudes via atmospheric teleconnections. In the present study, the linkages between springtime vegetation greenness over Eurasia and El Nino are investigated based on two long-term normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets from 1982 to 2015, and possible physical mechanisms for the teleconnections are explored. Results from the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analyses consistently suggest that the spatial patterns of NDVI, with "negative-positive-negative" values, have closer connections to El Nino. In particular, East Russia is identified as the key region with the strongest negative influences from Eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino on spring vegetation growth. During EP El Nino years, suppressed convection over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) may excite a Rossby wave from the BoB to the Far East. East Russia is located in the west of a large cyclone anomaly accompanied by the strong North and Northwesterly wind anomalies and the transport of cold air from Siberia. As a result, surface air temperature decreases significantly over East Russia and thus inhibits the vegetation growth during spring in the EP El Nino years.

AB The role of interspecific competition in structuring of plant communities remains poorly understood. The aim of our study was to test the assumption that the relationship between degree of numerical dominance (DD) and local species richness in interactive and non-interactive plant communities may be different. As objects of the study, we used forest stands (presumably interactive communities) and river shoal communities (presumably non-interactive) of the Western Caucasus. We have pursued the answers to three questions: 1) how different is DD in interactive and non-interactive plant communities; 2) how different is correlation between the DD and local species richness in communities with different intensity of species interactions; 3) how different is the nature of this relationship in such communities. Our results show that, regardless of their type, in communities with approximately similar total individuals (shoots) number and the size of actual species pool average values of DD are also similar. In communities of both types there is a significant negative correlation between the DD and local species richness, which, to a large extent, is a result of available resources and/or space reduction by dominants. In areas with limited number of individuals (shoots), this mechanism does not require strong interactions between species. Presumably by this reason, and also due to non-equilibrium state of forest stands, our results turned out to be very close both for interactive and non-interactive plant communities. We found no evidence of any other mechanisms, that would be specific to the forest stands or shoal communities, behind the relationship between the DD and species richness. However, the results also suggest that difference between communities of these types may be more significant at a greater spatial scale.

AB The complexity of plant response to density in nature has been recognized, but seldom interpreted, especially in the context of various abiotic environments or plant ontogeny. Our objective was to investigate whether and how soil conditions and plant growth stage affected plant responses to density in a variety of traits under field conditions. Abutilon theophrasti (annual species) was planted at low, medium, and high densities (13.4, 36, and 121 plants m(-2), respectively) under good or poor soil conditions and harvested 30, 50, or 70 days after seedling emergence. Responses of many traits to density varied with soil conditions and growth stages. Initially, leaf size, petiole angle, and stem diameter were decreased by high density in good soil, but not in poor soil. After 50 days, high density induced extra stem elongation and stem mass increment in both soil conditions; this was at the cost of biomass allocated to other organs in good soil. In contrast, in poor soil, high density decreased more morphological traits, with less effects on allocation patterns. At 70 days, there were decreases in more traits in response to density in poor soil, whereas most traits remained stable in good soil. Results demonstrated that density-plasticity was inherently complex, including multiple responsive trends within and among traits, and revealed that the ability of the plants to adapt to variation in density via responses of various modular traits has been underestimated. Soil conditions and growth stage may affect these responses, either directly through effects on plant size and competition strength, or indirectly through effects on strength of stem response. Contrasting stage-dependent plasticity to density under two soil conditions also revealed different growth strategies of plants in dealing with biotic environmental challenges. These findings highlighted the importance of considering roles of abiotic environmental factors and growth stage in modulating plasticity to biotic environments.

AB Studies on tree communities have demonstrated that species diversity can enhance forest productivity, but the driving mechanisms at the local neighbourhood level remain poorly understood. Here, we use data from a large-scale biodiversity experiment with 24 subtropical tree species to show that neighbourhood tree species richness generally promotes individual tree productivity. We found that the underlying mechanisms depend on a focal tree's functional traits: For species with a conservative resource-use strategy diversity effects were brought about by facilitation, and for species with acquisitive traits by competitive reduction. Moreover, positive diversity effects were strongest under low competition intensity (quantified as the total basal area of neighbours) for acquisitive species, and under high competition intensity for conservative species. Our findings demonstrate that net biodiversity effects in tree communities can vary over small spatial scales, emphasising the need to consider variation in local neighbourhood interactions to better understand effects at the community level.

AB Forest management of tropical lowland and hill wet evergreen forests traditionally assumes that succession, species composition, and forest structure are largely driven by small, frequent disturbances. More recent ecological studies, archaeological findings, palynology and climate records demonstrate that tropical rainforests in general are not only subject to treefall disturbances but also to large-scale, infrequent disturbances driven by both past ancient and more recent human land use, and by natural forces of climate and geology. This paper reviews the case for the presence and extent of large-scale infrequent disturbances in Mesoamerica. We then use this knowledge to understand effects shaping species composition and structure. We evaluate current silvicultural regeneration systems for forest management based on the gap dynamics paradigm and propose potential alternative and complementary regeneration methods for forests and tree species that are driven by large-scale disturbances. We propose that the shade-intolerant timber species observed today are in large part a reflection of legacies of human land use and historical large-scale disturbances. Such species require larger, more dramatic disturbance regimes to regenerate and to attain the canopy in future managed forests. We suggest that such conditions are not provided for by current silvicultural systems within the region that require multiple entries to the stand every 15-30 years and should be coupled with liberation thinnings to promote shade tolerant, commercially valuable timber species. Alternative silvicultural systems, such as shelterwoods and seed-tree methods of regeneration and management, purposefully promote the regeneration of valuable, shade-intolerant timber species. We propose applications for reserve design, and the management of non-timber forest products in conjunction with timber products to compliment such activities. These systems differ in their goals, species promoted (shade-tolerant vs. -intolerant) and the ecological assumptions driving their operations. We conclude that shelterwoods and seed-tree systems are more appropriate to manage forests rich in shade -intolerant timber species. Such methods need to be included in the suite of silvicultural options available to managers of tropical wet evergreen forests in Mesoamerica. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Degraded and secondary forests comprise approximately 50% of remaining tropical forest. Bird community characteristics and population trends in secondary forests are infrequently studied, but secondary forest may serve as a "safety net" for tropical biodiversity. Less understood is the occurrence of time-delayed, community-level dynamics such as an extinction debt of specialist species or a species credit resulting from the recolonization of forest patches by extirpated species. We sought to elucidate patterns and magnitudes of temporal change in avian communities in secondary forest patches in Southern Costa Rica biannually over a 10 year period during the late breeding season and mid-winter. We classified birds caught in mist nets or recorded in point counts by residency status, and further grouped them based on preferred habitat, sensitivity to disturbance, conservation priority, foraging guild, and foraging strata. Using hierarchical, mixed-effects models we tested for trends among species that share traits. We found that permanent-resident species increased over time relative to migrants. In both seasons, primary forest species generally increased while species typical of secondary forest, scrub, or edge declined. Species relatively sensitive to habitat disturbance increased significantly over time, whereas birds less sensitive to disturbance decreased. Similarly, generalists with higher habitat breadth scores declined. Because, we found very few changes in vegetation characteristics in secondary forest patches, shifts in the avian community toward primary forest species represent a species credit and are likely related to vegetation changes in the broader landscape. We suggest that natural regeneration and maturation of secondary forests should be recognized as a positive conservation development of potential benefit even to species typical of primary forest.

AB Background: Ongoing conversion, disturbance and fragmentation of tropical forests stress this ecosystem and cause the decline or disappearance of many species. Particular traits have been identified which indicate an increasing extinction risk of a species, but traits facilitating survival in altered habitats have mostly been neglected. Here we search for traits that make a species tolerant to disturbances, thus independent of pristine forests. We identify the fauna that have an increasing effect on the ecosystem and its functioning in our human-dominated landscapes.
   Methods: We use a unique set of published data on the occurrences of 243 frog species in pristine and altered forests throughout the tropics. We established a forest dependency index with four levels, based on these occurrence data and applied Random Forest classification and binomial Generalized Linear Models to test whether species life history traits, ecological traits or range size influence the likelihood of a species to persist in disturbed habitats.
   Results: Our results revealed that indirect developing species exhibiting a large range size and wide elevational distribution, being independent of streams, and inhabiting the leaf litter, cope best with modifications of their natural habitats.
   Conclusion: The traits identified in our study will likely persist in altered tropical forest systems and are comparable to those generally recognized for a low species extinction risk. Hence our findings will help to predict future frog communities in our human-dominated world.

AB Hosts can counteract parasites through defences based on resistance and/or tolerance. The mechanistic basis of tolerance, which involve defensive mechanisms minimizing parasite damage after a successful parasitic attack, remains poorly explored in the study of cuckoo-host interactions. Here, we experimentally explore the possibility that the risk of great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius parasitism may induce tolerance defences in magpie Pica pica hosts through plasticity in life-history traits. We predict that magpies exposed to auditory cues indicating high parasitism risk will more likely exhibit resistance and/or modify their life-history traits to minimize parasitism costs (i.e. tolerance) compared to magpies under low parasitism risk. We found that manipulating the perceived parasitism risk did not affect host resistance (i.e. rejection of parasitic eggs) nor host life-history traits. Unexpectedly, host's egg volume increased over the season in nests exposed to auditory cues of control non-harmful hoopoes Upupa epops. Our results do not provide support for inducible defences (either based on resistance or tolerance) in response to risk of parasitism in magpie hosts. Even so, we encourage studying plastic expression of breeding strategies in response to risk of cuckoo parasitism to achieve a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of tolerance defences.

AB The continent ocean transfer of dissolved silica (DSi, formed as Sio(2)) via rivers constitutes an important part of the global silica cycle. The uptake of terrestrial vegetation and riverine phytoplankton are the key process controlling DSi migration within the drainage basin. Anthropogenic activities (including land use change and damming) have been altering DSi export by changing biological uptakes in the basin. A significant artificial lake effect of damming was exhibited on the spatial variations of chlorophyll-a (Chl.a) and DSi, which caused 15.39% of riverine DSi to be detained in the reservoir region of Changhuajiang River basin, Hainan Island, China. The biological uptake of terrestrial vegetation was behindhand responsible for seasonal fluctuations of DSi. The DSi uptake yields ranged from 19.44 t/km(2)/yr to 86.76 t/km(2)/yr during the different terrestrial vegetation types in the basin, in turn, tropical rainforest > crops > artificial economic forests > grassland. The try calculating of the DSi yield released by the silicates weathering was carried out taking biological processes in the basin into account. Taking into the plants uptake within the basin consideration, the corrected DSi yield from the silicates weathering was 18.6 t/km(2)/yr. Accordingly, the silicates weathering rate was up to 41.55 t/km(2)/yr, which was 1.36 times higher than that (30.39 t/km(2)/yr) without consideration of the biological uptake, and close to the fastest weathering rate of the granite basin (Puerto Rico) in the earth surface. Of the DSi released by the silicates weathering, 28.56% was absorbed by terrestrial vegetation, and 31.43% was consumed by riverine phytoplankton, and the rest was drainaged into the South China Sea.

AB Background: Within the highly bio-diverse 'Northern Vietnam Lowland Rain Forests Ecoregion' only small, and mostly highly modified forestlands persist within vast exotic-species plantations. The aim of this study was to elucidate vegetation patterns of a secondary hillside rainforest remnant (elevation 120-330 m, 76 ha) as an outcome of natural processes, and anthropogenic processes linked to changing forest values.
   Methods: In the rainforest remnant tree species and various bio-physical parameters (relating to soils and terrain) were surveyed on forty 20 m x 20 m sized plots. The forest's vegetation patterns and tree diversity were analysed using dendrograms, canonical correspondence analysis, and other statistical tools.
   Results: Forest tree species richness was high (172 in the survey, 94 per hectare), including many endemic species (> 16%; some recently described). Vegetation patterns and diversity were largely explained by topography, with colline/sub-montane species present mainly along hillside ridges, and lowland/humid-tropical species predominant on lower slopes. Scarcity of high-value timber species reflected past logging, whereas abundance of light-demanding species, and species valued for fruits, provided evidence of human-aided forest restoration and 'enrichment' in terms of useful trees. Exhaustion of sought-after forest products, and decreasing appreciation of non-wood products concurred with further encroachment of exotic plantations in between 2010 and 2015. Regeneration of rare tree species was reduced probably due to forest isolation.
   Conclusions: Despite long-term anthropogenic influences, remnant forests in the lowlands of Vietnam can harbor high plant biodiversity, including many endangered species. Various successive future changes (vanishing species, generalist dominance, and associated forest structural-qualitative changes) are, however, expected to occur in small forest fragments. Lowland forest biodiversity can only be maintained if forest fragments maintain a certain size and/or are connected via corridors to larger forest networks. Preservation of the forests may be fostered using new economic incentive schemes.

TI Development paradigms contributing to the transformation of the
   Brazilian Amazon: do people matter?
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Review
ID DEFORESTATION; TRANSITION
AB The Brazilian Amazon is being affected by the new worldwide geopolitical transformation that is tending towards an integrated global economy. In the region environmental considerations have not been adequately incorporated into long-term land use planning and this failure has partly been due to the complexities of the country's existing inter-sectorial institutional arrangements. In this paper, we briefly explore two distinct economic development phases that have been reshaping Amazonian landscapes since the 1990s. We first focus on the role of traditional populations in conservation and land use planning (socio-environmental model). We contrast this with the 'post-environmental' development model that currently dominates the land use dynamics of Amazonia and which is in stark contrasts with previous advances in environmental protection, whose basis was sustainable use of resources and social participation. The future of the socio-environmental model appears uncertain and its recovery and long-term maintenance to underpin sustainable development will depend on the strengthening the participation of the civil societal sectors that are able to reestablish balance to the sustainability agenda in the region.

AB Climate change is having profound influences on Arctic tundra plant composition, community dynamics, and ecosystem processes. Stoichiometric homeostasis (H), the degree to which a plant maintains its internal nutrient concentrations independent of nutrient variations in its environment, may be a useful approach to predict the impacts of these influences. In this case study, we used fertilization manipulation data to calculate homeostasis indices based on nitrogen (HN), phosphorus (HP), and nitrogen to phosphorus ratios (H-N:P) of aboveground tissues for seven common tundra vascular species belonging to three growth forms. We then analyzed species H relationships with dominance, spatial stability, and responsiveness to various experimental manipulations. Each of the H indices was correlated amongst tissue types within each species and was generally highest in ericoid mycorrhizal host species and lowest in the ectomycorrhizal birch. Species HP and H-N:P were consistently positively correlated with aboveground biomass within the controls and across all manipulations. Furthermore, these same species were spatially stable across experimentally warmed field plots. Stoichiometric homeostasis theory has been successful in predicting grassland community dynamics. This first test of its applicability across a variety of Arctic plant growth forms highlights its considerable potential in predicting tundra plant community structure and responses to environmental change.

AB With the increasing degradation and encroachment of natural landscape environmentalists are now highly concerned with declining forest cover as well as increasing forest fragmentation at different scales across the world for last several decades. Considering the major fourfold effect of forest fragmentation i. e., reduction in habitat area, increased number of fragmented habitats, decrease in area coverage of habitat patch and increased number of isolated patches forest fragmentation is recognized as a major threat to forest ecosystems. Indicators of forest fragmentation are thereby gaining gradual importance at national and international environmental programs. But Spatio-temporal change of forest cover using forest fragmentation along with incorporation of population growth and associated anthropogenic intervention, at a micro-spatial scale has become the major thrust area in the present study. Kanksa is one of the few forest dominated block in Barddhaman District mostly affected by the rapid population growth, land use change in terms of increase in irrigated area as well as agricultural land, rapid urbanization in the last three decades. Present study focuses on forest fragmentation and spatio-temporal dynamics of forest cover from the beginning of 1990s up to present using geospatial techniques.

AB The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity has been put forth to explain species coexistence in forests worldwide, but its assumption of species equivalence has been met with much debate. Theoretical advancements have reconciled the opposing concepts of neutral and niche theories as two ends of a continuum, improving our understanding of global patterns in diversity and community assembly. However, the relative importance of niche and neutral processes remains understudied in temperate forests. To determine the balance of niche and neutral processes in climatically limited subalpine temperate forests, we established the Utah Forest Dynamics Plot, a 13.64 - ha plot comprising 27,845 stems >= 1 cm diameter at breast height (1.37 m) representing 17 species at 3100 m elevation on the Colorado Plateau. We examined the fit of niche - and neutral - based models to the species abundance distribution (SAD), and tested three underlying assumptions of neutral theory. The neutral model was a poor fit to the SAD, but we did not find the alternative model to provide a better fit. Using spatial analyses, we tested the neutral assumptions of functional equivalence, ecological equivalence, and habitat generality. Half of species analyzed were characterized by non - neutral recruitment processes, and the two most abundant species exhibited asymmetric competitive and facilitative interactions with each other. The assumption of habitat generality was strongly contradicted, with all common species having habitat preferences. We conclude niche - based processes play the dominant role in structuring subalpine forest communities, and we suggest possible explanations for variation in the relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes along ecological gradients.

AB Pitcairnioideae is the second most diverse subfamily of bromeliads (Bromeliaceae), a group exclusive to tropical regions of the New World. Pitcairnioid bromeliads have floral traits assumed to promote outcrossing through biotic pollination systems; however, the reproductive biology of most of the species of this group has not been documented. Pitcairnia heterophylla is an epiphytic (seldom saxicolous) bromeliad occurring from Southern Mexico, into the Northern Andes. We studied the pollination and breeding system of P. heterophylla in an epiphytic population at a mountain forest in Costa Rica from January to April 2013. We performed hand pollination experiments (agamospermy, autonomous self-pollination, hand self-pollination and hand cross-pollination) on 89 flowers from 23 individuals (3-6 flowers per individual) in 2013 flowering season. Nectar production was measured on 18 unvisited flowers of six individuals with a hand-held refractometer. Simultaneously, floral visitors were recorded on eight individuals with trail cameras for a total of 918 hours (115 +/- 52 hours per individual, mean +/- SE). Under natural conditions, seed set (540.4 +/- 55.2) was similar to manually selfed flowers (516.3 +/- 41.5) and autonomously selfed flowers (521.1 +/- 29.0), but lower to manually outcrossed flowers (670.2 +/- 31.3). The flowers of P. heterophylla are self-compatible, capable of autonomous pollination, and non-agamospermous. Intrafloral self-pollination is facilitated by adichogamy and lack of floral herkogamy. The scentless red flowers of P. heterophylla with tubular corollas and nectar production suggested ornithophilic pollination which was confirmed by video recording of 46 hummingbird visits. The most common floral visitor was the short-billed hummingbird Lampornis calolaemus which accounted for 78 % of the visits. However, the visitation rate during the flowering season was low (0.6 visits per day per plant). Selfing in P. heterophylla might be explained as a mechanism of reproductive assurance and to reduce interspecific pollen flow with taxonomically unrelated plants.

AB Understanding the dynamics of natural ecosystems in highly transformed landscapes is key to the design of regional development plans that are more sustainable and otherwise enhance conservation initiatives. We analyzed secondary forest and shrubland dynamics over 30 years (1985-2015) in a densely populated area of the Colombian Andes using satellite and biophysical data. We performed a land-cover change analysis, assessed landscape fragmentation, and applied regression models to evaluate the effects of environmental and geographical correlates with the observed forest transitions. Forest cover area increased during the 30 year-span, due mostly to forest regrowth in areas marginal for agriculture, especially during the first half of the study period. However, a high dynamic of both forest regrowth and clearing near urban centers and roads was observed. Soil fertility turned out to be a key correlate of both forest recovery and deforestation. Secondary forests, < 30 years old represent the most fragmented component. Our findings reflect the complexity of the processes occurring in highly transformed and densely populated regions. Overall, this study provides elements for a better understanding of the factors driving land cover change near large urban areas, and raises new iideas for further research.

AB Empirical analyses of forest dynamics are important for understanding various ecological processes underlying particular forest communities, among which tree mortality is considered a key process driven by many local factors. To evaluate the effects of tree size, as well as biotic and abiotic factors on tree mortality, we compared species-specific mortality rates in a 21-ha temperate multi-species natural forest in northeastern China, where all trees had been mapped. Our study shows that the mortality rates are highly variable among the different tree species and the influence of habitat preference on the mortality rate of a species across habitats was insignificant. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we further found that among the drivers of tree survival, tree size had the strongest effect across different species. There are significant negative relationships between the basal area of conspecific neighbors and tree survival at the community level across almost all the guilds. Regarding abiotic factors, elevation had a greater effect on tree survival than other topographic variables did. Abiotic factors affected shrubs more than tall canopy species in terms of survival rate. Our study suggests that tree size, density-dependent effects and niche partitioning contribute to the regulation of survival pattern of temperate forest communities, but the relative importance of these factors varies greatly among guilds and species. This study has shown that it is essential to consider the relative importance of both, intrinsic (tree size) and extrinsic (biotic and abiotic) factors in analyzing tree mortality.

AB The response of tropical forests to anthropogenic climate change is critically important to future global carbon budgets, yet remains highly uncertain. Here, we investigate how precipitation, temperature, solar radiation and dry-and wet-season lengths are related to annual tree growth, flower production, and fruit production in three moist tropical forest tree species using long-term datasets from tree rings and litter traps in central Panama. We also evaluated how growth, flower, and fruit production were interrelated. We found that growth was positively correlated with wet-season precipitation in all three species: Jacaranda copaia (r = 0.63), Tetragastris panamensis (r = 0.39) and Trichilia tuberculata (r = 0.39). Flowering and fruiting in Jacaranda were negatively related to current-year dry-season rainfall and positively related to prior-year dry-season rainfall. Flowering in Tetragastris was negatively related to current-year annual mean temperature while Trichilia showed no significant relationships of reproduction with climate. Growth was significantly related to reproduction only in Tetragastris, where it was positively related to previous year fruiting. Our results suggest that tree growth in moist tropical forest tree species is generally reduced by drought events such as those associated with strong El Nino events. In contrast, interannual variation in reproduction is not generally associated with growth and has distinct and species-specific climate responses, with positive effects of El Nino events in some species. Understanding these contrasting climate effects on tree growth and reproduction is critical to predicting changes in tropical forest dynamics and species composition under climate change.

AB Understanding how human societies interacted with environmental changes is a major goal of archaeology and other socio-natural sciences. In this paper, we assess the human-environment interactions in the Pampa del Tamarugal (PDT) basin of the Atacama Desert over the last 13,000 years. By relying on a socioenvironmental model that integrates ecosystem services with adaptive strategies, we review past climate changes, shifting environmental conditions, and the continuities and discontinuities in the nature and intensity of the human occupation of the PDT. As a result we highlight the importance of certain key resources such as water, an essential factor in the long-term trajectory of eco-historical change. Without water the outcome of human societies becomes hazardous. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aggregations of organisms commonly benefit their members by mitigating the effects of predators and environmental stresses. Mussel aggregations also form important intertidal matrices that support associated infaunal communities, the structures of which are largely shaped by the conditions within the interstitial spaces. Intertidal mussels are frequently parasitized by phototrophic endoliths that infest the shell and have thermoregulatory effects on both solitary and aggregated mussels by changing shell albedo. A large-scale sampling was carried out May June 2016 along Portuguese and Moroccan shores to investigate a latitudinal gradient of endolithic infestation of the intertidal mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Endolithic infestation increased towards lower latitudes most likely as a response of greater light availability. Additionally, artificial beds of either 100% non-infested or infested biomimetic mussels were used to test whether infestation alters the temperature and humidity of the interstitial spaces within beds, and if mussels surrounded by infested mussels experience lower body temperatures than those surrounded by non-infested ones. Conditions within beds of infested mussels were significantly cooler and more humid than in non-infested beds and individuals in the centre of infested mussel beds experienced significantly lower body temperatures. Under a scenario of warming climate, endolithic infestation of mussel beds might thus represent an ecological advantage not only for M. galloprovincialis as a species but also for the associated communities.

AB African tropical forests are generally considered less diverse than their Neotropical and Asian counterparts. By contrast, the Detarioideae is much more diverse in Africa than in South America and Asia. To better understand the evolution of this contrasting diversity pattern, we investigated the biogeographical and ecological origin of this subfamily, testing whether they originated in dry biomes surrounding the Tethys Seaway as currently hypothesized for many groups of Leguminosae.
   We constructed the largest time-calibrated phylogeny for the subfamily to date, reconstructed ancestral states for geography and biome/habitat, estimated diversification and extinction rates, and evaluated biome/habitat and geographic shifts in Detarioideae.
   The ancestral habitat of Detarioideae is postulated to be a primary forest (terra firme) originated in Africa-South America, in the early Palaeocene, after which several biome/habitat and geographic shifts occurred.
   The origin of Detarioideae is older than previous estimates, which postulated a dry (succulent) biome origin according to the Tethys Seaway hypothesis, and instead we reveal a post Gondwana and terra firme origin for this early branching clade of legumes. Detarioideae include some of the most dominant trees in evergreen forests and have likely played a pivotal role in shaping continental African forest diversity.

AB 1. In tropical countries where little natural forest remains, such as the Philippines, smallholder monocultures and mixed-species plantations potentially provide conservation values by providing habitat for local fauna and recruiting diverse understorey species. However, little information exists as to whether monocultures offer a framework to kick-start understorey species recruitment and how this compares to mixtures.
   2. In this study, species and trait diversity were measured within the understories of three different forest types on the Island of Leyte, Philippines: mixed-species forests (known as 'Rainforestation Farming'), Swietenia macrophylla monocultures and regenerating selectively logged forests. All plants less than 2 m in height were identified, and dispersal type, fruit type, seed and fruit size were extracted from literature and online data bases.
   3. We found that overall seedling richness and diversity were lower within the monoculture forests compared with the regenerating selectively logged forests, with the Rainforestation forests showing intermediate seedling diversity, including trait diversity. Monoculture understories had a higher proportion of large fruited domesticated species that are likely dispersed by people and significantly lower wind-dispersed native seedlings than the other forest types. Higher understorey diversity was generally negatively correlated with soil nutrients and positively correlated with increased leaf area index, that is more canopy cover.
   4. Our results confirm that mixed-species plantations and regenerating selectively logged forests recruit higher species diversity, but we also found evidence that monocultures can recruit diverse species in the understorey. However, monoculture understories were depauperate of native wind-dispersed traits that are often important emergent species in tropical rain forests.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Overall, our results show that just having trees in a cleared landscape provides conservation value, but if monocultures are used as less costly and technically simpler solutions for initiating recruitment, then wind-dispersed native species (e.g. species from the Dipterocarpaceae family) in addition to other limited functional traits (e.g. large- seeded species) should be planted to enhance long-term survival of ecologically significant native tree populations.

AB Secondary forests play an important role in restoring carbon and biodiversity lost previously through deforestation and degradation and yet there is little information available on the extent of different successional stages. Such knowledge is particularly needed in tropical regions where past and current disturbance rates have been high but regeneration is rapid. Focusing on three areas in the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santarem, Machadinho d'Oeste), this study aimed to evaluate the use of single-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data in the 2007-2010 period for i) discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest, and ii) retrieving the age of secondary forests (ASF), with 100 to x 100 m training areas obtained by the analysis of an extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data over the three sites. A machine learning algorithm (random forests) was used in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity at HH and HV polarizations and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions. Overall accuracy when discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest is high (95-96%), with the highest errors in the secondary forest class (omission and commission errors in the range 4-6% and 12-20% respectively) because of misclassification as mature forest. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when retrieving ASF ranged between 4.3-4.7 years (relative RMSE = 25.5-32.0%) and 0.04-0.08 years respectively. On average, unbiased ASF estimates can be obtained using the method proposed here (Wilcoxon test, p-value > 0.05). However, the bias decomposition by 5-year interval ASF classes showed that most age estimates are biased, with consistent overestimation in secondary forests up to 10-15 years of age and underestimation in secondary forests of at least 20 years of age. Comparison with the classification results obtained from the analysis of extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data showed a good agreement, with Pearson's coefficient of correlation (R) of the proportion of mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest at 1-km grid cells ranging between 0.97-0.98, 0.96-0.98 and 0.84-0.90 in the 2007-2010 period, respectively. The agreement was lower (R = 0.82-0.85) when using the same dataset to compare the ability of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 5 TM data to retrieve ASF. This was also dependent on the study area, especially when considering mapping secondary forest and retrieving ASF, with Manaus displaying better agreement when compared to the results at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste.

AB Mountain systems are often recognised as biodiversity hotspots; however, most montane forests are human-modified. Understanding the conservation value of human-modified forests is essential to mountain biodiversity conservation. In this study, mist-nets and point-counts were used to compare the bird communities of primary forests on ridges in the Ailao Mountains of Yunnan, China, and secondary forests, firewood forests, and pine plantations in nearby lower elevation zones. We found that community turnover among habitats was very high using both methods. Although the percentage of forest interior species and insectivores in each habitat was higher in the primary forests than in the human-modified forests, relatively high percentages of forest interior species and insectivores were recorded in the human-modified forests. Moreover, many bird species, forest interior species, insectivores and babblers were only recorded in the human-modified forests. Our study indicated that the primary forests are important for sustaining mountain bird diversity. However, given that primary forests are restricted to ridges, secondary forests, firewood forests, and pine plantations at lower elevations also play important roles in bird conservation in mountainous regions by increasing landscape diversity and partially offsetting species loss from primary forests. Therefore, conservation efforts should also be concentrated on human-modified forests at lower elevations in mountainous regions in south-west China.

AB Land-acquisition strategies employed by conservation organizations vary in their flexibility. Conservation-planning theory largely fails to reflect this by presenting models that are either extremely inflexibleparcel acquisitions are irreversible and budgets are fixedor extremely flexiblepreviously acquired parcels can readily be sold. This latter approach, the selling of protected areas, is infeasible or problematic in many situations. We considered the value to conservation organizations of increasing the flexibility of their land-acquisition strategies through their approach to financing deals. Specifically, we modeled 2 acquisition-financing methods commonly used by conservation organizations: borrowing and budget carry-over. Using simulated data, we compared results from these models with those from an inflexible fixed-budget model and an extremely flexible selling model in which previous acquisitions could be sold to fund new acquisitions. We then examined 3 case studies of how conservation organizations use borrowing and budget carry-over in practice. Model comparisons showed that borrowing and budget carry-over always returned considerably higher rewards than the fixed-budget model. How they performed relative to the selling model depended on the relative conservation value of past acquisitions. Both the models and case studies showed that incorporating flexibility through borrowing or budget carry-over gives conservation organizations the ability to purchase parcels of higher conservation value than when budgets are fixed without the problems associated with the selling of protected areas.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate whether Pleistocene climatic instability influenced the phylogeographic structure and historical demography of an endemic Atlantic Forest (AF) orchid bee, Euglossa iopoecila Dressler, which shows two main patterns of integument colors over of its geographical distribution. We based our analysis on the concatenated sequence of four mtDNA segments belonging to genes 16S (357 bp), Cytb (651 bp) and COI (1206 bp), totaling 2234 bp. Samples of E. iopoecila populations were collected in 14 AF remnants along its geographic distribution. Median-Joining haplotype networks, SAMOVA and BAPS results indicated three lineages (southern, central and northern clusters) for E. iopoecila, with two important phylogeographic ruptures. We found higher genetic diversity among samples collected in the central region of the AF, which coincides with predicted areas of climatic stability, according to recent AF stability-extinction model. The demographic analysis suggests that only the southern cluster had undergone recent population expansion, which probably started after the last glacial maximum (LGM). Our data suggest that the differentiation observed in the three mitochondrial lineages of E. iopoecila is the result of past disconnections and multiple extinction/recolonization events involving climate fluctuations. In terms of conservation, we would emphasize the importance of considering: (1) the region of the central clade as the location of the highest genetic diversity of mtDNA of E. iopoecila populations; (2) the philopatric behavior of females that tends to restrict mtDNA gene flow in particular, with direct implications for the conservation of the total genetic diversity in euglossine populations.

AB Many studies regarding growth in diameter at breast height (D) in trees suffer from several problems, including heteroscedasticity, temporal autocorrelation and very low statistical adjustments. In growth ring studies, growth models are sometimes omitted, presenting only a mean curve or smoothings, while studies that use models often do not address the above mentioned problems. For these reasons, this paper proposes a new approach to the classical modeling of D = f(t), where t is age (years), using the logarithmic transformation of the relative growth rate ln(1/D)(dD/dt) = ln f(D, A), where A is the asymptote of D based on the differential growth rate model of von Bertalanffy. High statistically significant adjustments for Cedrela odorata (ME = 65%, model efficiency, ME, an analogous to R-2 but for non-linear regressions), and Juglans neotropica (ME = 78%) were obtained and met all regression assumptions. These equations were integrated to obtain D = f(t) for both species, followed by self and independent validation. Based on these equations, different life history and silviculture traits were calculated for both species. This procedure does not appear to have been previously used in the study of tree growth.

AB Fire is an important tool in tropical forest management, as it alters forest composition, structure, and the carbon budget. The United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) aims to sustainably manage forests, as well as to conserve and enhance their carbon stocks. Despite the crucial role of fire management, decision-making on REDD+ interventions fails to systematically include fires. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap in two ways. First, we review REDD+ projects and programs to assess the inclusion of fires in monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. Second, we model the relationship between fire and forest for a pilot site in Colombia using near-real-time (NRT) fire monitoring data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The literature review revealed fire remains to be incorporated as a key component of MRV systems. Spatially explicit modeling of land use change showed the probability of deforestation declined sharply with increasing distance to the nearest fire the preceding year (multi-year model area under the curve [AUC] 0.82). Deforestation predictions based on the model performed better than the official REDD earlY-warning system. The model AUC for 2013 and 2014 was 0.81, compared to 0.52 for the early-warning system in 2013 and 0.68 in 2014. This demonstrates NRT fire monitoring is a powerful tool to predict sites of forest deforestation. Applying new, publicly available, and open-access NRT fire data should be an essential element of early-warning systems to detect and prevent deforestation. Our results provide tools for improving both the current MRV systems, and the deforestation early-warning system in Colombia.

AB Secondary forests have reclaimed one sixth of deforested land worldwide, and much of this revegetated forest lies in agricultural and increasingly semi-urban landscapes. While, many studies have described faunal populations such as birds across forest-agricultural landscapes, they generally note minor changes in total species richness and more significant changes in species composition. Few studies, however, consider faunal diversity among secondary forests of different management history, such as manual restoration or natural revegetation. In this study, we surveyed bird communities in three forest sites of varying restoration and natural revegetation treatments in a tropical urban-agricultural landscape in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Our sites include manually restored and naturally revegetating forest of 20-40 years since clearing. We found that a diverse assemblage of birds visit and occupy forest fragments within the urban- agricultural landscape, including two IUCN-listed near-threatened species. Bird species richness was similar across sites of different management history; species composition varied only slightly, but differences existed in presence and occupancy for forest-dependent groups, such as large frugivores and forest insectivores. In the manually restored site, bird diversity may have been limited by under-developed forest structure, but we were unable to isolate the effects of patch size and landscape matrix. We suggest that future restoration activities consider forest structure in addition to plant species diversity when attempting to restore faunal populations, and that future studies take heed of landscape and matrix parameters when evaluating restoration projects.

AB Seasonality causes fluctuations in resource availability, affecting the presence and abundance of animal species. The impacts of these oscillations on wildlife populations can be exacerbated by habitat fragmentation. We assessed differences in bat species abundance between the wet and dry season in a fragmented landscape in the Central Amazon characterized by primary forest fragments embedded in a secondary forest matrix. We also evaluated whether the relative importance of local vegetation structure versus landscape characteristics (composition and configuration) in shaping bat abundance patterns varied between seasons. Our working hypotheses were that abundance responses are species as well as season specific, and that in the wet season, local vegetation structure is a stronger determinant of bat abundance than landscape-scale attributes. Generalized linear mixed-effects models in combination with hierarchical partitioning revealed that relationships between species abundances and local vegetation structure and landscape characteristics were both season specific and scale dependent. Overall, landscape characteristics were more important than local vegetation characteristics, suggesting that landscape structure is likely to play an even more important role in landscapes with higher fragment-matrix contrast. Responses varied between frugivores and animalivores. In the dry season, frugivores responded more to compositional metrics, whereas during the wet season, local and configurational metrics were more important. Animalivores showed similar patterns in both seasons, responding to the same group of metrics in both seasons. Differences in responses likely reflect seasonal differences in the phenology of flowering and fruiting between primary and secondary forests, which affected the foraging behavior and habitat use of bats. Management actions should encompass multiscale approaches to account for the idiosyncratic responses of species to seasonal variation in resource abundance and consequently to local and landscape scale attributes.

AB One of the major challenges in ecology is to understand how ecosystems respond to changes in environmental conditions, and how taxonomic and functional diversity mediate these changes. In this study, we use a trait-spectra and individual-based model, to analyse variation in forest primary productivity along a 3.3km elevation gradient in the Amazon-Andes. The model accurately predicted the magnitude and trends in forest productivity with elevation, with solar radiation and plant functional traits (leaf dry mass per area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, and wood density) collectively accounting for productivity variation. Remarkably, explicit representation of temperature variation with elevation was not required to achieve accurate predictions of forest productivity, as trait variation driven by species turnover appears to capture the effect of temperature. Our semi-mechanistic model suggests that spatial variation in traits can potentially be used to estimate spatial variation in productivity at the landscape scale.

AB 1. Anthropocene defaunation is the global phenomenon of human-induced animal biodiversity loss. Understanding the patterns and process of defaunation is critical to predict outcomes for wildlife populations and cascading consequences for ecosystem function and human welfare.
   2. We investigated a defaunation gradient in north-eastern Gabon by establishing 24 transects at varying distances (2-30 km) to rural villages and surveying the abundance and composition of vertebrate communities. Distance from village was positively correlated with observations of hunting (shotgun shells, campfires, hunters), making it a good proxy for hunting pressure.
   3. Species diversity declined significantly with proximity to village, with mammal richness increasing by roughly 1 similar to 5 species every 10 km travelled away from a village. Compared to forest far from villages, the wildlife community near villages consisted of higher abundances of large birds and rodents and lower abundances of large mammals like monkeys and ungulates.
   4. Distance to nearest village emerged as a key driver of the relative abundance of five of the six taxonomic guilds, indicating that the top-down force of hunting strongly influences large vertebrate community composition and structure. Several measures of vegetation structure also explained animal abundance, but these varied across taxonomic guilds. Forest elephants were the exception: no measured variable or combination of variables explained variation in elephant abundances.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Hunting is concentrated within 10 km around villages, creating a hunting halo characterized by heavily altered animal communities composed of relatively small-bodied species. Although the strongest anthropogenic effects are relatively distance-limited, the linear increase in species richness shown here even at distances 30 km from villages suggests that hunting may have altered vertebrate abundances across the entire landscape. Central African forests store > 25% of the carbon in tropical forests and are home to 3000 endemic species, but roughly 53% of the region lies within the village hunting halo. Resource management strategies should take into account this hunting-induced spatial variation in animal communities. Near villages, resource management should focus on sustainable community-led hunting programmes that provide long- term supplies of wild meat to rural people. Resource management far from villages should focus on law enforcement and promoting industry practices that maintain remote tracts of land to preserve ecosystem services like carbon storage and biodiversity.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances, such as conversion of forests to pastures, are considered one of the major causes of Amazonian biodiversity loss. Pastures are hostile environments for forest species that are not adapted to the adverse conditions of open areas. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of forest replacement by cattle pastures in the north-eastern part of the Amazonian rainforest using dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) as indicators. Therefore, we determined edge effects and differences in dung beetle species richness, composition, and abundance between forest and neighbouring cattle pastures. A total of 6723 individuals of 63 species of dung beetle were collected. In comparison to forests, adjacent pastures were sharply less rich and abundant in dung beetles. The forests had 6604 individuals and 59 species, while the pastures had 119 individuals and 12 species. The replacement of forests by pastures results in an increase of dung beetle species turnover. Only 12% of dung beetle species were shared by both forest and pasture environments. We highlight that most Amazonian dung beetles are forest species sensitive to abrupt human-driven modification of habitats and are only moderately affected by edge effects.

AB The tremendous diversity of species in ecological communities has motivated a century of research into the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity. However, much of this work examines the coexistence of just pairs of competitors. This approach ignores those mechanisms of coexistence that emerge only in diverse competitive networks. Despite the potential for these mechanisms to create conditions under which the loss of one competitor triggers the loss of others, we lack the knowledge needed to judge their importance for coexistence in nature. Progress requires borrowing insight from the study of multitrophic interaction networks, and coupling empirical data to models of competition.

AB We hypothesized that dinitrogen (N-2)- and non-N-2-fixing tropical trees would have distinct phosphorus (P) acquisition strategies allowing them to exploit different P sources, reducing competition.
   We measured root phosphatase activity and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization among two N-2- and two non-N-2-fixing seedlings, and grew them alone and in competition with different inorganic and organic P forms to assess potential P partitioning.
   We found an inverse relationship between root phosphatase activity and AM colonization in field-collected seedlings, indicative of a trade-off in P acquisition strategies. This correlated with the predominantly exploited P sources in the seedling experiment: the N-2 fixer with high N-2 fixation and root phosphatase activity grew best on organic P, whereas the poor N-2 fixer and the two non-N-2 fixers with high AM colonization grew best on inorganic P. When grown in competition, however, AM colonization, root phosphatase activity and N-2 fixation increased in the N-2 fixers, allowing them to outcompete the non-N-2 fixers regardless of P source.
   Our results indicate that some tropical trees have the capacity to partition soil P, but this does not eliminate interspecific competition. Rather, enhanced P and N acquisition strategies may increase the competitive ability of N-2 fixers relative to non-N-2 fixers.

AB Dauciform roots (DR) are formed by some Cyperaceae under phosphorus (P) deficiency. To advance our understanding of their physiological function, I ask: Is DR formation regulated by shoot P status or external P supply? How does it respond to nitrogen (N)? Do DR enhance root monoesterase, diesterase or phytase activities and ability to utilize organic P?
   Greenhouse experiments were carried out with two Carex species grown in sand with (1) different combinations of N and P supply, (2) local supply of N or P to root halves, and (3) different organic P forms.
   Carex flava produced DR in all treatments. The density of DR and phosphatase activities increased with N supply; they were regulated by shoot P status and external N (but not P) supply. All phosphatase activities increased with DR density. Carex muricata produced no DR and had lower diesterase activity than C. flava but both species grew equally well with diester-P.
   DR and phosphatase activities are regulated by both N and P supply. Similar growth responses to nutrients in both species suggest small costs and benefits of DR under experimental conditions but confirmation is needed for plants grown on natural soils.

AB In many tropical dry forests, information on radial-growth rates and phenology of wood formation is still lacking. However, such information is needed to better manage these forests, which have been severely disturbed by anthropogenic use and are also threatened by climate warming. To cover this research gap, we evaluated intra-annual variations in stem diameter and assessed cambial growth dynamics in five tree species of a Tumbesian tropical dry forest located in southern Ecuador. Using data from band dendrometers over a 5-year period, we modeled seasonal variations in stem increments through generalized additive mixed models. Monthly radial increments and annual growth rates were also correlated with monthly climatic variables (mean, maximum and minimum temperature, and total rainfall). Stem increments and xylem growth were clearly coupled with rainfall seasonality, although temperature effects were also detected. Interestingly, annual growth in all species did not respond similarly to climate, despite having similar growth rates and intra-annual growth patterns. At the inter-annual scale, climate effects were related to temperature and rainfall, emphasizing the relevance for tree growth of climatic conditions in standard years between "El Nino" events. Under a future scenario of climate warming, these contrasting growth responses to climate might imply changes in competitive dominance among coexisting species of tropical dry forests.

AB Tropical rain forests harbor a high diversity of tree species, a large portion of which are considered rare and threatened by anthropogenic factors such as land-use change. Addressing the global need for ex situ rescue populations of such species, we investigated whether certain methods of wild-source seed collection harvest greater amounts of genetic variation from the source population while minimizing the costs expended. We used an individual-based computer program (NEWGARDEN) to conduct simulation trials examining which aspects of seed procurement provided the most cost-effective methods for maximal rare allele capture for single isolated populations of rare tropical tree species. Aspects examined included the geometric pattern of harvesting, location of seed collections within the spatial distribution of the population (central vs. peripheral), geometric partitioning of sampling regions (contiguous vs. subdivided), gene dispersal distance, linear travelling costs, and ratio of seeds collected to plants sampled. Results demonstrated that ratio of seeds collected to plants sampled had the highest effect on genetic diversity harvested relative to sampling location or geometric pattern of collection, explaining 82 and 79% of the variance in alleles harvested, respectively. Collecting from subdivided peripheral sampling regions and populations having long distance gene dispersal led to increases of up to 39 and 51% in the amount of genetic variation conserved respectively. These results suggest that ex situ conservation efforts for rare tropical trees can benefit by collecting fewer seeds from each of a larger number of trees, sampling from peripheral subdivided regions of the population rather than in a contiguous centrally located one under the transect or nearest neighbor strategies, and adjusting harvesting based on the dispersal biology of the source population. This study underscores the need for more information regarding the dispersal characteristics of the target species and demonstrates the value of predictive modeling for planning seed collection projects.

AB It is debated whether slowing human population growth and intense urbanization may result in a slowdown of deforestation and an acceleration of natural forest regeneration. In a fragmented landscape the structure and composition of developing secondary forests will strongly depend on the local species pool. Thus, the understanding how organisms cope with biotic and abiotic challenges outside pristine habitats is pivotal. Structurally dependent, vascular epiphytes are an important biotic component of tropical forests. In human-modified tropical landscapes potential hosts are often still present. We aimed to assess if human-modified landscapes offer a refuge habitat in which epiphytes can form metacommunities that are ultimately viable. Eight years after an initial assessment we recensused the epiphytes in pasture trees in western Panama along a strong rainfall gradient. We document a threefold abundance increase (ca. 20,000 vs. > 60,000 individuals) and an increase in species-richness (66 vs. 86 mostly drought-tolerant species). This large net increase suggests a highly dynamic system. Although absolute abundances changed dramatically, the relative contribution of major taxonomic groups to overall diversity and abundance changed little. Neither rainfall nor tree growth had a significant effect on relative annual community growth rates. At the plot level (=metacommunities), abundance increase was mostly due to the species already present in the first census, at the tree level (=communities) the contribution of new and old species was comparable. The documented long-term trend in epiphyte metacommunities in a human-modified landscape suggests that a diverse set of species sustains viable metacommunities and is likely to provide structural diversity to developing secondary forest.

AB The knowledge on the geographical distribution of species is essential for building biogeographical and macroecological hypotheses. However, information on this regard is not distributed uniformly in space and usually come from biased sampling. The aim of this study is to quantify the influence of spatial distribution of sampling effort on the assessment of spider species richness in Brazil. We used a database of spider distribution records in Brazil, based on the taxonomic and biodiversity survey literature. The results show that the Atlantic Forest was better sampled and had the highest spider species richness among the Brazilian biomes. The Amazon, though having large collecting gaps and high concentration of records around major cities and rivers, showed the second highest number of species. The Pampa had a large number of records, but these are concentrated near a major city in the transition zone with the Atlantic Forest. The Cerrado, Caatinga and Pantanal had shown to be poorly sampled and, consequently, were among the lesser known biomes regarding the spider fauna. A linear regression analysis showed that the spider species richness in Brazil is strongly correlated to the number of records. However, we have identified areas potentially richest in species, which strongly deviate from the predicted by our analyses. Our results show that it is possible to access the spatial variation in species richness, as long as the variation in sampling effort is taken into account.

AB Habitat fragmentation and loss are important drivers of genetic differentiation, often leading to a decrease in genetic diversity. Yet, natural populations of tropical bees often show a lack of differentiation, even in fragmented landscapes, suggesting resilience to deal with unfavourable land use. It is not clear what leads to this lack of differentiation, but large population sizes, high rates of dispersal and stable demography likely play important roles. Here, we investigate the population genetic structure and infer the present and historic demography of the eusocial stingless bee Partamona bilineata from tropical montane cloud forests in Guatemala. We used microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA to test for genetic differentiation, to infer migration rates, and to evaluate the effects of landscape. We also used demographic modelling to trace population sizes over time. We found that six populations of P. bilineata exhibited only subtle differentiation, with the exception of one site at the edge of the cloud forest, which was clearly distinct from all others. Effective population sizes (number of colonies) appeared to be rather small (18 +/- 6 colonies) compared to the original sample size (N = 51 +/- 9), but stable over time, and inferred rates of gene flow were low; yet, no genetic bottleneck was detected. A statistical model including elevation was the best in explaining the observed pattern of differentiation. We find that P. bilineata does not exhibit strong genetic structure, making it a resilient species for provision of pollination services. But, at the same time, our data point to the potential vulnerability of this and similar species, as effective population sizes appear to be low and hence populations may be easily affected by future environmental change. As such, P. bilineata may be representative of many other tropical stingless bees, for which lack of differentiation has been invoked.

AB Research on PES programs in agro-ecosystems is recent and limited in developing countries. The authors use a multi-method, quasi-experimental impact evaluation approach to examine direct and indirect livelihood impacts of the Equitable Payments for Watershed Services (EPWS) program piloted in the Morogoro region in Tanzania. The evaluation is based on a survey of 116 program participants and 117 non-participants, 32 semi-structured interviews and 16 focus group discussions to complement the survey data. They find that, while the EPWS program incentives resulted in direct benefits, indirect benefits such as increased crop yields, higher land values, new employment opportunities, more knowledgeable farmers, improved leadership skills as well as increased trust, expanded internal and external networks and strengthened institutions were more important. The results clearly indicate the potential of PES schemes to generate win-win outcomes in agro-ecosystems, but they also call for attention to equity in the design of PES programs implemented on agro-ecosystems.

AB Ecuador, a country with nearly unparalleled levels of biodiversity and endemism, has one of the highest deforestation rates of South America. I examined whether governmentally protected areas in Ecuador have been effective at reducing deforestation. After estimating deforestation rates from existing land cover change data for 2000 to 2008, I used a matching approach to compare the rates of forest loss inside and outside protected areas, which corrected for geographic biases in the locations of protected areas. I tested for the effects of protected area age, size and level of protection on the rate of deforestation using generalized linear models. Governmentally protected areas still experienced deforestation - with no apparent effect of age, size and level of protection - of nearly 10,000 ha per year, but deforestation rates were lower inside compared to outside protected areas. Governmental protection led to the avoidance of additional deforestation of 2600-7800 ha of natural forest per year. Actions to mitigate deforestation in Ecuador are of global importance and as such it is promising that protected areas can help diminish deforestation, although the effectiveness of Ecuador's protected areas can still be improved upon.

AB The sedentary, suspension-feeding gastropods Crepidula fornicata and Crepipatella peruviana can be found in large numbers both subtidally and intertidally. Although intertidal animals often show reduced reproductive output compared with that of subtidal animals, we know little about how the reproductive output of marine gastropods is affected by exposure to intertidal stresses. We documented reproductive characteristics for intertidal and subtidal Crepidula fornicata in Rhode Island, USA (2012, 2013), and Crepipatella peruviana from Pelluco Beach, Chile (2010-2012). Females of both species brood encapsulated embryos for at least several weeks before releasing offspring, facilitating determinations of individual fecundity (embryos per egg mass). As expected from the environmental stresses experienced uniquely by intertidal individuals while emersed, including an inability to feed, intertidal females of C. peruviana had lower fecundities, producing significantly fewer egg capsules per brood; the mean number of eggs per capsule did not differ significantly by habitat. In marked contrast, the size-adjusted fecundity of Crepidula fornicata was significantly higher for intertidal females than for subtidal females; however, rather than brooding more egg capsules per individual or making larger egg capsules, intertidal females crowded each capsule with significantly more eggs. This study adds to previous work showing how exceptionally well-adapted C. fornicata is to intertidal life, and may help to explain why this species has been so unusually successful as an invasive among calyptraeid gastropods. Future studies will be required to identify the specific conditions that have provoked these adaptations in C. fornicata, and to understand the mechanisms through which this species achieves them.

AB Habitat heterogeneity is increased in natural systems via habitat loss and fragmentation, which decreases the patch size and alters the amount of edge relative to interior. However, our understanding of how increased habitat heterogeneity influences population dynamics, particularly set within a large scale marine landscape, is relatively incomplete. Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica populations have drastically declined resulting in fragmentation within and among reefs, thus altering reef size and distances from edge to interior. Over 2 yr (2011 to 2012), we evaluated oyster populations relative to varying distances from the reef edge to interior locations, habitat patch size, and reef type on naturally occurring intertidal fringing and patch reefs in southeastern North Carolina. Additionally, the influences of distance from edge to interior locations and habitat patch size were examined for oyster populations on 3 size classes of created intertidal reefs at 2 locations. The habitat characteristics examined significantly influenced oyster populations, with increased densities towards interior locations on a reef, a trend of overall higher densities on intermediate sized reefs, significantly greater densities on natural patch reefs compared to natural fringing reefs. Density and recruitment patterns suggested differences between edge and interior locations. However, other population characteristics, such as oyster condition and shell height, indicated there may be ecological trade-offs among the habitat characteristics examined. These results suggest intertidal reefs cannot be considered a uniform whole and may have substantially different habitat characteristics, which should be taken into account when further examining habitat fragmentation and restoration success.

AB Biogeographic distributions are driven by cumulative effects of smaller scale processes. Thus, vulnerability of animals to thermal stress is the result of physiological sensitivities to body temperature (T-b), microclimatic conditions, and behavioural thermoregulation. To understand interactions among these variables, we analysed the thermal tolerances of three species of intertidal snails from different latitudes along the Chinese coast, and estimated potential T-b in different microhabitats at each site. We then empirically determined the temperatures at which heart rate decreased sharply with rising temperature (Arrhenius breakpoint temperature, ABT) and at which it fell to zero (flat line temperature, FLT) to calculate thermal safety margins (TSM). Regular exceedance of FLT in sun-exposed microhabitats, a lethal effect, was predicted for only one mid-latitude site. However, ABTs of some individuals were exceeded at sun-exposed microhabitats in most sites, suggesting physiological impairment for snails with poor behavioural thermoregulation and revealing inter-individual variations (physiological polymorphism) of thermal limits. An autocorrelation analysis of T-b showed that predictability of extreme temperatures was lowest at the hottest sites, indicating that the effectiveness of behavioural thermoregulation is potentially lowest at these sites. These results illustrate the critical roles of mechanistic studies at small spatial scales when predicting effects of climate change.

AB A transition zone shows the overlap between two or more regions and represents an event of biotic hybridisation, where different cenocrons assembled as a result of historical and ecological processes. The Mexican transition zone, the area where the Nearctic and Neotropical regions overlap, includes the following five biogeographical provinces: Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre del Sur, Transmexican Volcanic Belt and Chiapas Highlands. Within this transition zone, the following five cenocrons have already been recognised: Paleoamerican, Mexican Plateau, Mountain Mesoamerican, Nearctic and Typical Neotropical. We undertook three cladistic biogeographic analyses on the basis of 49 cladograms of terrestrial taxa, partitioning them into three time-slices, namely, Miocene (Mountain Mesoamerican cenocron), Pliocene (Mountain Mesoamerican plus Nearctic cenocrons) and Pleistocene (Mountain Mesoamerican, Nearctic and Typical Neotropical cenocrons). For the Miocene time-slice, we observed a close relationship of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt with the Neotropical region, whereas, for the Pliocene and Pleistocene time-slices, the closest relationship of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt was with the Nearctic region. We conclude that the Transmexican Volcanic Belt may have played a different role according to the cenocron analysed, and that the Mexican transition zone differs in its delimitation depending on the taxa analysed, strengthening the idea that it is a complex area.

AB Fishing is a major source of human impact, reducing density and size of a wide range of exploited species in comparison to areas exhibiting strong regulations (no-take and partially protected areas, including Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries, TURFs). Since size and density might have important consequences on reproduction, and therefore natural re-seeding, we monitored adult size, density and potential fecundity of the keyhole limpet (Fissurella latimarginata) and the red sea urchin (Loxechinus albus) in areas under two fishing regimes (TURFs and Open Access Areas, OAAs). Analyzing the distribution of suitable habitats, we predict spatial patterns of potential egg production, to identify reproductive hotspots along the central coast of Chile. The current system of TURFs in central Chile showed higher potential egg production of F. latimarginata and of L. albus than expected under a complete OAAs scenario (67 and 52% respectively). Potential egg production showed more than a twofold reduction when the complete TURFs scenario was compared against complete OAAs condition in both species. Individual size and density explained between 60% and 100% of the variability in potential egg production, suggesting the importance of the enhancement of both biological variables in TURFs in Chile. Potential egg production for both species in the northern part of the studied domain was higher due to the combined effect of (a) suitable habitat and (b) concentration of TURFs. Our results suggest that partially protected areas, such as TURFs can significantly enhance the production of propagules that could seed exploited areas.

AB Changes in species richness along climatological gradients have been instrumental in developing theories about the general drivers of biodiversity. Previous studies on microbial communities along climate gradients on mountainsides have revealed positive, negative and neutral richness trends. We examined changes in richness and composition of Fungi, Bacteria and Archaea in soil along a 50-1000 m elevation, 280-3280 mm/yr precipitation gradient in Hawai'i. Soil properties and their drivers are exceptionally well understood along this gradient. All three microbial groups responded strongly to the gradient, with community ordinations being similar along axes of environmental conditions (pH, rainfall) and resource availability (nitrogen, phosphorus). However, the form of the richness-climate relationship varied between Fungi (positive linear), Bacteria (unimodal) and Archaea (negative linear). These differences were related to resource-ecology and limiting conditions for each group, with fungal richness increasing most strongly with soil carbon, ammonia-oxidizing Archaea increasing with nitrogen mineralization rate, and Bacteria increasing with both carbon and pH. Reponses to the gradient became increasingly variable at finer taxonomic scales and within any taxonomic group most individual OTUs occurred in narrow climate-elevation ranges. These results show that microbial responses to climate gradients are heterogeneous due to complexity of underlying environmental changes and the diverse ecologies of microbial taxa.

AB Desert greening through planting or irrigation is a potential approach to mitigate desertification and climate warming, but its influence on regional climate is unclear due to scarcity of observations. "Desert blooms," which are natural phenomena usually associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, regularly occur in the world's driest desert, the Atacama Desert. This sudden conversion of land cover likely has a large impact on regional climate through alteration of local energy budgets and provides a unique opportunity to study the potential climatic and environmental consequences of desert greening. Here we evaluated the land surface effects of blooms in the Atacama Desert using vegetation and climate data acquired from remote sensing. The rapid vegetation growth during blooms led to an increase in evapotranspiration and a decrease in albedo. These two processes caused a 0.31 degrees C +/- 0.05 degrees C decrease in daytime land surface temperature. During nighttime, we observed a 0.02 degrees C +/- 0.02 degrees C increase in land surface temperature due to enhanced heat capacity associated with blooms. This asymmetric diurnal variation in land surface temperature produced a net decrease in daily land surface temperature of 0.29 degrees C +/- 0.07 degrees C. Our observations demonstrate the potential benefits of desert blooms on local climate. Results from this study also provide new evidence for plausible climate consequences expected from local "desert greening" strategies.
   Plain Language Summary Desert areas have expanded globally over the past century and are projected to increase continually throughout the current century owing to global warming. " Desert greening" by plantation or irrigation has been proposed as a method to decrease desertification, mitigate climate warming through increased carbon sequestration, and produce food and biofuel. However, the actual impact of desert greening on regional climate is still poorly understood due to scarcity of observational studies. "Desert bloom" is a natural phenomenon that happened in the world's driest Atacama Desert. Relying on remote sensing observations, we find that this desert bloom-caused natural greening has obvious cooling effect on land surface. This finding has important implications for the design of desert greening strategies.

AB Brazil confirmed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2008, including an 80% reduction in deforestation in the Amazon by 2020. With this in mind, we investigated the trade-off between environmental conservation and economic growth in the Amazon. The aim of this study is to project the economic losses and land-use changes resulting from a policy to control deforestation and the rise in land productivity that is necessary to offset those losses. We developed a Dynamic Interregional Computable General Equilibrium Model for 30 Amazon regions with a land module allowing conversion between types of land. The results have shown that the most affected regions would be soybeans and cattle producers as well as regions dominated by family farms. To offset these impacts, it was estimated that an annual gain of land productivity of approximately 1.4% would be required. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE diet diversity; index of diet similarity; rodent community
AB Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the feeding of rodent species coexisting in woodland associations in the foothill zone of the Republic of Daghestan were studied. The food species composition, the shares of food items and the index of diet similarity in the model rodent community were revealed per season. Various rodent species consumed different plant species. The diet of Sylvaemus fulvipectus, Apodemus agrarius, Cricetulus migratorius, Microtus socialis and Dryomys nitedula consisted of 22, 18, 19, 21 and 17 plant species, respectively. The number and percentage of exclusively consumed plant species, the total share of which in the diet did not exceed 30%, were estimated. The index of interspecies diet similarity varied within a wide range. This index in different rodent species was shown to correlate with the structure of herbaceous vegetation in the environment. Thus, a growth in overground phytomass and in the share of grasses in a plant community determined a significant increase in diet similarities.

AB Species targeted by fishing often recover in abundance and size within marine protected areas (MPAs) resulting in increased reproductive potential. However, in some situations, concomitant changes in the abundance of predators, competitors, or prey within MPAs, or strong gradients in the surrounding environmental seascape may counteract the purported benefits making it more difficult to predict how species will respond to protection. We used a network of MPAs in California, spanning a large temperature gradient, to investigate the drivers of demographic variability in the commercially important red sea urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus. We investigated how demographic metrics varied geographically in response to protection, temperature, and the main sea urchin resource, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. We found significant conservation benefits to this fished sea urchin within MPAs designated six years prior to the beginning of this study. Within MPAs, red sea urchins were generally larger resulting in greater adult biomass density and reproductive biomass density. In addition, kelp density was an important explanatory variable of all red sea urchin demographic traits examined (adult size, gonadosomatic index [GSI], density, adult biomass density, and reproductive biomass density). Kelp density was positively correlated with red sea urchin GSI and adult size, but the relationships with density, adult biomass density, and reproductive biomass density were complex and the directionality changed depending on the region (or environmental setting) examined. Our results demonstrate that kelp, red sea urchin reproduction, and the effects of spatial management on demographic processes are tightly coupled with the oceanographic regime.

AB Models that accurately predict forest interception are essential both for water balance studies and for assessing watershed responses to changes in land use and the long-term climate variability. This paper compares the performance of four rainfall interception models-the sparse Gash (1995), Rutter et al. (1975), Liu (1997) and two new models (NvMxa and NvMxb)-using data from four spatially extensive, structurally diverse forest ecosystems in Mexico. Ninety-eight case studies measuring interception in tropical dry (25), arid/semi-arid (29), temperate (26), and tropical montane cloud forests (18) were compiled and analyzed. Coefficients derived from raw data or published statistical relationships were used as model input to evaluate multi-storm forest interception at the case study scale. On average empirical data showed that, tropical montane cloud, temperate, arid/semi-arid and tropical dry forests intercepted 14%, 18%, 22% and 26% of total precipitation, respectively. The models performed well in predicting interception, with mean deviations between measured and modeled interception as a function of total precipitation (ME) generally <5.8% and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency E estimators >0.66. Model fitting precision was dependent on the forest ecosystem. Arid/semi-arid forests exhibited the smallest, while tropical montane cloud forest displayed the largest ME deviations. Improved agreement between measured and modeled data requires modification of in-storm evaporation rate in the Liu; the canopy storage in the sparse Gash model; and the throughfall coefficient in the Rutter and the NvMx models. This research concludes on recommending the wide application of rainfall interception models with some caution as they provide mixed results. The extensive forest interception data source, the fitting and testing of four models, the introduction of a new model, and the availability of coefficient values for all four forest ecosystems are an important source of information and a benchmark for future investigations in this area of hydrology.

AB Exploitation of organisms can prompt the reduction in the number and size of target populations consequently affecting reproductive output and replenishment. Here, we investigated the effects of exploitation on the population structure of a protandrous patellid limpet, Patella aspera, an over exploited Macaronesian endemic. Timed dives were used to collect animals across eleven islands of Macaronesia. Individuals were inspected for sex, size, and gonad stage. Using catch effort (n time per person) per island coastal perimeter as a surrogate for exploitation intensity, we found that limpet abundance (CPUE) and mean size tended to decrease with exploitation intensity. When considering the sex of animals separately, the size of the largest male, but not females, decreased with exploitation. In contrast, the size of the smallest male remained relatively consistent, whereas the size of the smallest female decreased significantly with exploitation. As exploitation is mostly targeting larger individuals, results suggest that males are compensating the removal of larger females, by undergoing sex change at smaller and presumably earlier sizes. These results have wider implications for the conservation of P. aspera, as a reduction in female size will likely affect the numbers of oocytes produced, hence fecundity. Regulations promoting the protection of the larger-sized animals should be enforced to safeguard the replenishment of the population.

AB Biotic homogenization-the erosion of biological differences between ecosystems owing to human perturbation-is a trait of the global biodiversity crisis that can affect tropical dry forest biodiversity. We tested whether biotic homogenization was occurring in resident forest bird communities in west-central Mexico. We conducted point-count surveys to assess biotic dissimilarity between resident bird communities in tropical deciduous and oak forests in the upper Balsas River basin across 3 levels of anthropogenic perturbation: primary forest, second-growth forest, and human settlements. We detected a reduction in species richness and taxonomic dissimilarity with increasing anthropogenic effects, due to a directional pattern in which lowland species expanded their elevational distributions up into oak forests. These results point to a need to change agricultural strategies to mitigate impacts on natural vegetation cover and biodiversity.

AB We compared how abiotic factors affect the regional distributions of four insect groups (Dermaptera, Formicidae, Orthoptera and Diptera). Insects were collected using a pitfall trap from 36 agricultural field sites, and 31933 individuals encompassing 139 species were observed. The distribution pattern of dominant species was not obviously different among the four groups. Species richness (H) of Orthoptera showed a negative and positive correlation with precipitation and sunlight duration, respectively. Longitudinal zonation was the main distribution pattern of many dominant species. Overall, canonical correspondence analysis showed that temperature and precipitation were closely associated with the distribution of Orthoptera, but not that of Formicidae, implying that Formicidae may be affected less by abiotic factors compared to other taxonomic groups. Some orthopteran species such as Dianemobius nigrofasciatus and Polionemobius mikado showed a negative correlation with temperature. We suggest that these species can be categorized as susceptible to climate change. Our results also implied that the association between climate variables and distribution of insects should be evaluated at a species level.

AB Environmental conditions developing at the boundary of windfall- and fire-damaged forest biocenoses at different stages of progressive succession have a positive effect on the total abundance of rodents, but the role of ecotone in forming the structure of their microhabitats is ambiguous. The complex of biotic and abiotic conditions in the ecotone has a positive influence on the size of shrub coverage area and the abundance of saplings, whereas the influence of the edge effect on other microhabitat parameters (namely, herbaceous and moss coverage) is negative or neutral.

AB High seedling mortality can limit tropical forest regeneration after disturbance, such as selective logging. However, causes of seedling mortality are often poorly understood although this information is critical for designing appropriate restoration methods. We studied seedling mortality in a rainforest in Uganda where natural recovery has failed after selective logging carried out 40 years earlier and the sites are dominated by herbaceous vegetation. We established an experiment where seeds of 12 indigenous tree species were sown into different-sized logging gaps in order to capture factors that cause early seedling mortality. We examined whether seedling mortality was influenced by vegetation cover (VC), vertebrate herbivores (VHs), gap size, or forest compartment and recorded causes of mortality. We found that seedling mortality was in general high but showed high tree species-specific variation (ranging from 19 to 92% six months after emergence). VHs, particularly rodents, were the most important cause of mortality. Rotting caused mortality particularly in smaller gaps, but elephant trampling, drying, being washed away by rain and falling debris were only minor mortality causes. Dense VC was not a considerable barrier to seedling survival, but by providing shelter for rodents, it indirectly increased seedling herbivory. Our results show that high seedling mortality on logged sites can limit forest regeneration and rodents in particular can be a significant factor causing high seedling mortality.

AB 1. How species respond to temperature change depends in large part on their physiology. Physiological traits, such as critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin), provide estimates of thermal performance but may not capture the full impacts of temperature on fitness. Rather, thermal performance likely depends on a combination of traitsincluding thermal limitsthat vary among species.
   2. Here, we examine how thermal limits correlate with the main components that influence fitness in ants. First, we compare how temperature affected colony survival and growth in two ant species that differ in their responses to warming in the fieldAphaenogaster rudis (heat-intolerant) and Temnothorax curvispinosus (heat-tolerant). We then extended our study to compare CTmax, thermal requirements of brood and yearly activity season among a broader set of ant species.
   3. While thermal limits were higher for workers of T.curvispinosus than A.rudis, T.curvispinosus colonies also required higher temperatures for survival and colony growth. This pattern generalized across 17 ant species, such that species whose foragers had a high CTmax also required higher temperatures for brood development. Finally, species whose foragers had a high CTmax had relatively short activity seasons compared with less heat-tolerant species.
   4. The relationships between CTmax, thermal requirements of brood and seasonal activity suggest two main strategies for growth and development in changing thermal environments: one where ants forage at higher temperatures over a short activity season and another where ants forage at lower temperatures for an extended activity season. Where species fall on this spectrum may influence a broad range of life-history characteristics and aid in explaining the current distributions of ants as well as their responses to future climate change.

AB Primate responses to habitat alteration vary depending on the species' dietary guild and forest type. Leaves from secondary vegetation can provide nutritious resources to folivorous primates, whereas frugivores, burdened with a scattered spatial and temporal distribution of fruiting resources, require larger home ranges, potentially limiting their ability to cope with altered landscapes. Within coastal southeastern Madagascar, we sought to determine whether two lemur species occupying contrasting ecological niches respond differently to the changing features of their degraded and fragmented habitat. We conducted behavioral observations between 2011 and 2013 on frugivorous collared brown lemurs (Eulemur collaris) and folivorous southern bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur meridionalis). To estimate the ability of lemurs to use pioneer species, we categorized all plants used for feeding and resting as fast growing, mid-growing, or slow growing. We fitted general linear mixed-effects models, one for each plant growth category with monthly proportional use rates as the dependent variable, and included species (E. collaris and H. meridionalis), activity (feeding and resting), and season (dry and wet) as fixed effects. Our results show that E. collaris used both slow- and mid-growing plant species most often, while H. meridionalis were more likely to use fast-growing plants, which indicated an ability to use secondary/disturbed vegetation. Frugivorous E. collaris appear more limited by climax plants, while folivorous H. meridionalis appear to be slightly more adaptable, a finding that is consistent with that for other primate folivores.

AB Agricultural producer participation and spatial coordination of land use decisions are key components for enhancing the effective delivery of ecosystem services from private land. However, inducing participation in Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes for coordinating land management choices is challenging from a policy design perspective owing to transaction costs associated with participation. This paper employs a laboratory experiment to investigate the impact of such costs on participation and land use in the context of an Agglomeration Bonus (AB) scheme. The AB creates a coordination game with multiple Nash equilibria related to alternative spatially-coordinated land use patterns. The experiment varies transaction costs between two levels (high and low), which affects the risks and payoffs of coordinating on the different equilibria. Additionally, an option to communicate is implemented between neighbors arranged on a local network to facilitate spatial coordination. Results indicate a significant difference in participation and performance under high and low transaction costs, with lower uptake and performance when transaction costs are high. These effects are, however, impacted by transaction costs faced in the past Communication improves both AB participation rates and performance with the effect being greater for participants facing high transaction costs.

AB QuestionsIs there any theoretical model enabling predictions of the optimal tree size distribution in tropical communities? Can we use such a theoretical framework for quantifying the degree of disturbance?
   LocationReserve of Yangambi, northeast region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
   MethodsWe applied an allometric model based on the assumption that a virtually undisturbed forest uses all available resources. In this condition, the forest structure (e.g. the tree size distribution) is theoretically predictable from the scaling of the tree crown with tree height at an individual level. The degree of disturbance can be assessed through comparing the slopes of the tree size distribution curves in the observed and predicted conditions. We tested this tool in forest stands subjected to different degrees of disturbance. We inventoried trees > 1.3m in height by measuring the DBH in three plots of 1ha each, and measured tree height, crown radius and crown length in a sub-sample of trees.
   ResultsAll tree species, independently of the site, shared the same exponents of allometric relationships: tree height vs tree diameter, crown radius vs tree height, crown length vs tree height and consequently crown volume vs tree height, suggesting that similar trajectories of biomass allocation have evolved irrespective of species. The observed tree size distributions appeared to be power laws (excluding the finite size effect) and, as predicted, the slope was steeper in the less disturbed forest (-2.34) compared to the most disturbed (-1.99). The difference in the slope compared to the theoretical fully functional forest (-2.65) represents the metric for assessing the degree of disturbance.
   ConclusionsWe developed a simple tool for operationalizing the concept of disturbance' in tropical forests. This approach is species-independent, needs minimal theoretical assumptions, the measurement of only a few structural traits and requires a low investment in equipment, time and computer skills. Itssimple implementation opens new perspectives for effectively addressing initiatives of forest protection and/or restoration.

AB The native vegetation of the Sabana de Bogota's flat area has been replaced by agricultural lands, pastures and urbanizations over the years. The last relict of this native vegetation is a small forest (ca 10 ha) at Hacienda Las Mercedes, in the northern border of Bogota. The forest's small size and isolation from other areas of natural vegetation have resulted in the loss of many species. The problem was exacerbated by uncontrolled growth of invasive vegetation (vines and wild blackberry). However, in recent years restorative action including control of these vegetation has been undertaken and the forest is now immerse in a natural reserve where more restorative actions are being planned. Using point count stations the authors recorded all the birds seen and heard in 2001-2002 and in 2014 in order to evaluate the changes in the bird community and estimate the effects of the restorative actions. We recorded 27 forest species in the first census and 30 in the second. The relative abundance of at least 1/3 of the species also increased indicating a positive result in the forest restoration. The results highlight the capacity of degraded ecosystems to recover and the importance of continuing the restorative actions in the reserve area.

AB The extent to which interspecific niche differences structure plant communities is highly debated, with extreme viewpoints ranging from fine-scaled niche partitioning, where every species in the community is specialized to a distinct niche, to neutrality, where species have no niche or fitness differences. However, there exists a default position wherein niches of species in a community are determined by their evolutionary and biogeographic histories, irrespective of other species within the community. According to this viewpoint, a broad range of pair-wise niche overlaps-from completely overlapping to completely distinct-are expected in any community without the need to invoke interspecific interactions. We develop a method that can test for both habitat associations and niche differences along an arbitrary number of spatial and temporal niche dimensions and apply it to a 24-yr data set of the eight dominant woody-plant species (representing 84% and 76% of total community abundance and basal area, respectively) from a 50-ha permanent plot in a southern Indian tropical dry forest, using edaphic, topographic, and precipitation variables as niche axes. Species separated into two broad groups in niche space-one consisting of three canopy species and the other of a canopy species and four understory species-along axes that corresponded mainly to variation in soil P, Al and a topographic index of wetness. Species within groups tended to have significantly greater niche overlap than expected by chance. Community-wide niche overlap in spatial and temporal niche axes was never smaller than expected by chance. Species-habitat associations were neither necessary nor sufficient preconditions for niche differences to be present. Our results suggest that this tropical dry-forest community consists of several tree species with broadly overlapping niches, and where significant niche differences do exist, they are not readily interpretable as evidence for niche differentiation. We argue, based on a survey of the literature, that many of the observed niche differences in tropical forests are more parsimoniously viewed as autecological differences between species that exist independently of interspecific interactions.

AB 1. Differences in seedling survival in trees have a lasting imprint on seedling, juvenile and adult community structure. Identifying the drivers of these differences, therefore, is a critical research objective that ultimately requires knowledge regarding how organismal function interacts with the local environment to influence survival rates.
   2. In tree communities, differences in light use strategies are frequently invoked to explain differences in seedling demographic performance through growth and survival trade-offs. For example, shade-tolerant species grow slowly and have higher survival rates, whereas shade-intolerant species grow quickly but have lower survival rates. Thus, functional traits related to photosynthesis should be strong predictors of demographic rates, but results in the literature are mixed indicating that additional or alternative information regarding organismal function should be considered.
   3. Here, we provide a community-wide inventory of transcriptomes in a subtropical tree community. This information is utilized to determine the degree to which species share homologous genes related to gene ontologies for light use and harvesting. These species similarities are used in neighbourhood generalized linear mixed-effects models of seedling survival that evaluated seedling survival as a function of the transcriptomic, functional trait and phylogenetic composition of the local neighbourhood. The results show neighbourhood similarity in three of the 15 gene ontologies evaluated are significantly related to survival rates based on neighbourhood composition. For two of these ontologies, survival rates increase when neighbours are similar in their gene tree composition indicating the importance of abiotic filtering and performance hierarchies.
   4. Synthesis. The present work takes a novel approach by sequencing the transcriptomes of naturally co-occurring tree species in a subtropical forest in China. The results show that the transcriptomic similarity of species is a significant predictor of differential survival. The study demonstrates that exploring the functional genomic similarity of non-model species in nature has the potential to increase the breadth and depth of our understanding of how gene function influences species co-occurrence and population dynamics in communities.

AB In semi-arid climates, plant population dynamics are strongly influenced by the amount and temporal distribution of rainfall. We monitored a population of the tree species Cordia oncocalyx (Boraginaceae) for 24months in the dry thorny woodland of semi-arid northeastern Brazil, to investigate which life-history traits allow this tree to be locally dominant. We used horizontal life tables and a Lefkovitch matrix and tested for relationships among demographic parameters of seedling, infant, juvenile, immature, virginile and reproductive ontogenetic stages with rainfall and canopy openness. Germination and recruitment occurred in the rainy months, and dry-season mortality occurred only in seedlings (76% and 100%, first and second years, respectively) and infants (3% and 6%). Juveniles showed greater height growth under more open canopies (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.24), suggesting that light availability influences growth. The population growth rate was =1.0336, and the highest sensitivity occurred in the infant-juvenile transition. Our results show light as a restrictive growth factor for plants in the juvenile stage and confirm the strong influence of rainfall on the dynamics of trees in a seasonally dry environment. The formation of a persistent seed bank with germination concentrated at the rainfall onset but spreading over the rainy season are strategies that hedge bets before establishment. The formation of a bank of infants, which can resume growth as soon as there is water, hedges bets after establishment. We attribute the positive population growth rate of Cordia oncocalyx to survival strategies allowing bet-hedging both before and after establishment.

AB Context Increasing human populations in urban areas pose a threat to species' persistence through habitat loss and fragmentation. It is therefore essential that we develop methods to investigate critical habitat loss thresholds and least detrimental landscape configurations.
   Objectives We develop a framework to assess how the pattern of habitat loss impacts the ecological and social characteristics of a landscape and how this varies depending on the species and criteria by which it is judged.
   Methods We use a scenario-based approach to test six propositions in which habitat is lost preferentially based on patch characteristics. We use eight bird and two amphibian species as indicator species. To compare scenarios, we present a method combining the output from a metapopulation model with measures of social impacts of land-cover change in a multiple criteria decision analysis. We also determine whether a habitat loss threshold exists, below which small loss of habitat can lead to large loss of species' occupancy.
   Results We found that, of the scenarios presented, preferentially losing common habitats and smaller patches was least detrimental for both ecological and social factors. Threshold effects were found for all but the generalist bird species.
   Conclusions We have outlined a workflow which allows for transparent, repeatable comparison between landscapes. This workflow can be used to compare urban landscape plans, or to develop general understanding of the impacts of different forms of habitat loss. Reassuringly, the recommendations based on the scenarios presented are in keeping with received conservation wisdom: to prioritise larger and/or rarer patches.

AB Here, we used the maximum entropy (MAXENT) method to predict habitat distribution of the Persian squirrel in oak forests of Kurdistan Province, western Iran. We used 70 points with known occurrence of the species and 17 environmental variables (climatic variables represented annual trends in temperature and precipitation, seasonality and extreme or limiting environmental factors) to map the species distribution. The MAXENT model showed high performance. Using a 0.5 logistic probability threshold, the models suggested about 16,783.5 ha of the study area to have high suitability for the Persian squirrel. These areas were thus estimated as "good" habitats. Amongst the environmental variables, land cover had the greatest role in the Persian squirrel's distribution. Precipitation and temperature were the two major climatic factors that affected the Persian squirrel's distribution. Gap analysis showed that many parts of the species habitat have remained unprotected what can threaten the survival of the studied species in the region. These findings can be used to develop conservation management plans and boost the network of protected areas in the region.

AB Recent evidence suggests that plant performance can be influenced by the phylogenetic diversity of neighboring plants. However, no study to date has examined the effect of such phylogenetic density dependence on the transition from seed to seedling. Using 6 years of data on seedling recruitment and seed rain of 13 species from 130 stations (one 0.5 m(2) seed trap and three adjacent 1 m(2) seedling plots) in a subtropical evergreen forest, we asked: (1) Does negative density dependence act across seed to seedling stages? (2) Is there evidence for phylogenetic density dependence during the seed to seedling transition? (3) Does the strength of density dependence vary among years? Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to model seed to seedling transition as a function of conspecific seed and seedling densities, heterospecific seed and seedling densities, and mean phylogenetic distance of heterospecific seeds and seedling. Conspecific seed density had a significant negative effect on seedling transition rates for 12 of 13 focal species. In contrast, conspecific seedling density had a positive effect for 7 species, suggesting species-specific habitat preferences. Few species were significantly affected by the density or phylogenetic relatedness of heterospecific seeds and seedlings. Only conspecific seed density effects varied among years for most focal species. Overall, our results reveal that conspecific seed and seedling densities play a more important role than the density or relatedness of heterospecific seeds and seedlings during the seed to seedling stage, suggesting that species-specific seed predators, along with habitat preferences, may contribute to diversity maintenance in this forest.

AB Rare plant species often suffer stronger conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) in studies that assess the impact of local conspecific density on individual survival. All else equal, this causes a relative disadvantage among rare species that appears inconsistent with the role of CNDD in coexistence. The resolution to this apparent paradox is for lower species abundance to decrease the frequency of conspecific interactions sufficiently to outweigh the disadvantage of stronger CNDD. Whether this occurs in natural systems is untested because existing metrics do not isolate demographic impacts of CNDD, and it is also uncertain for tropical forest trees because the greater spatial aggregation observed in rare species could cause higher frequency of conspecific interactions despite lower abundance on the landscape. We develop a new metric, effective density-dependent mortality (EDDM), to quantify the proportion of individuals that are killed by density-dependent effects. We apply EDDM to a long-term study of seed fall and recruitment at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Rare species had stronger CNDD but lower conspecific densities, and EDDM increased with abundance. Lower abundance, thus, reduces the frequency of conspecific interaction and, consequently, mortality associated with CNDD. This mechanism allows rare species to avoid a disadvantage-when-rare that would, all else equal, result from stronger CNDD in rare species. Our work provides empirical support for a resolution to the apparently paradoxical findings that rare species experience stronger CNDD and may help reconcile contrasting findings for the relationship between the CNDD strength and abundance.

AB Conifer encroachment has reduced the extent and habitat quality of mountain meadows throughout western North America. Past studies in the Cascade Range of Oregon reveal surprising variation in the pace at which meadow species are lost to encroachment. We hypothesized that this variation relates to intraspecific variability in plant functional traits that are adaptive as light levels decline during the transition from open meadow to closed forest. For 13 meadow species with varying sensitivities to encroachment, we compared how the rate of decline in abundance relates to intraspecific variation in three morphological traits (specific leaf area, shoot/root ratio, and shoot height) and to clonal ability (no, limited, or strong potential for vegetative spread). For each species, we computed an index of sensitivity to encroachment, ISE, the coefficient of variation in cover across the light gradient. For each trait of each species, we computed an index of variation, the linear slope of the relationship between trait values and available light. For most traits, the correlation between ISE and trait variation (or clonality) was weak. Although specific leaf area increased in the shade for all species, the magnitude of increase did not correlate with ISE. Only variability in leaf area was positively correlated with ISE, increasing in the shade for less sensitive species and decreasing for more sensitive species. Responses to encroachment may reflect differences in species' physiological rather than morphological variability, or species may be responding to changes in resources other than, or in addition to, light.

AB Pollinator behaviour has profound effects on plant mating. Pollinators are predicted to minimise energetic costs during foraging bouts by moving between nearby flowers. However, a review of plant mating system studies reveals a mismatch between behavioural predictions and pollen-mediated gene dispersal in bird-pollinated plants. Paternal diversity of these plants is twice that of plants pollinated solely by insects. Comparison with the behaviour of other pollinator groups suggests that birds promote pollen dispersal through a combination of high mobility, limited grooming, and intra-and interspecies aggression. Future opportunities to test these predictions include seed paternity assignment following pollinator exclusion experiments, single pollen grain genotyping, new tracking technologies for small pollinators, and motion-triggered cameras and ethological experimentation for quantifying pollinator behaviour.

AB Trait-based studies in community ecology have generally focused on the community as a unit where all species occur due to stochasticity, determinism or some mixture of the two. However, the processes governing population dynamics may vary greatly among species. We propose a core-transient framework for trait-based community studies where a core group of species has a strong link to the local environment while transient species have weaker responses to the environment. Consistent with the expectations of the framework, we found that common species exhibit clear linkages between performance and their environment and traits while rare species tend to have weaker or non-significant relationships. Ultimately, trait-based ecology should move beyond applying a set of processes to a community as a whole and towards quantifying inter-specific variation in the drivers of population dynamics that ultimately scale up to determine community structure.

AB Relative growth rate (RGR) plays an important role in plant adaptation to the light environment through the growth potential/survival trade-off. RGR is a complex trait with physiological and biomass allocation components. It has been argued that herbivory may influence the evolution of plant strategies to cope with the light environment, but little is known about the relation between susceptibility to herbivores and growth-related functional traits.
   Here, we examined in 11 evergreen tree species from a temperate rainforest the association between growth-related functional traits and (i) species' shade-tolerance, and (ii) herbivory rate in the field. We aimed at elucidating the differential linkage of shade and herbivory with RGR via growth-related functional traits.
   We found that RGR was associated negatively with shade-tolerance and positively with herbivory rate. However, herbivory rate and shade-tolerance were not significantly related. RGR was determined mainly by photosynthetic rate (A(max)) and specific leaf area (SLA). Results suggest that shade tolerance and herbivore resistance do not covary with the same functional traits. Whereas shade-tolerance was strongly related to A(max) and to a lesser extent to leaf mass ratio (LMR) and dark respiration (R-d), herbivory rate was closely related to allocation traits (SLA and LMR) and slightly associated with protein content.
   The effects of low light on RGR would be mediated by A(max), while the effects of herbivory on RGR would be mediated by SLA. Our findings suggest that shade and herbivores may differentially contribute to shape RGR of tree species through their effects on different resource-uptake functional traits.

AB Fleshy-fruited plants rely on animal frugivores to disperse their seeds, and seed removal by frugivores may leave an imprint on seedling recruitment. However, to what extent plantfrugivore interactions are related to seedling recruitment has rarely been quantified at the community level, especially in species-rich tropical forests. In this study, we tested the effect of different plant traits on fruit removal by frugivores and tested the relative importance of fruit removal, plant traits and abiotic factors for seedling recruitment. We quantified plantfrugivore interactions of 22 fleshy-fruited plant species consumed by 56 diurnal frugivore species, and counted the number of seedlings that emerged along an elevational gradient in the Colombian Andes. We measured a set of plant traits (i.e., crop size; fruit size; seed load and mass; fruit nutritional contents), estimated the density of adult plants and recorded relevant abiotic factors (light, temperature and humidity). We found that fruit removal by frugivores was positively associated with crop size, but negatively associated with fruit length and unrelated to seed load and fruit nutritional content. Seedling densities were positively related to the density of adult plants, seed mass and fruit removal by animals. We found no relationship between abiotic factors and seedling recruitment. Our results indicate that fruit abundance and morphology are important determinants of fruit removal and that fruit removal is positively associated with seedling recruitment accounting for effects of species abundance and plant traits. We conclude that plant traits shape fruit removal and seedling recruitment at the community level, while these two crucial processes of forest regeneration are directly linked by seed dispersal of animals.

AB According to the habitat amount hypothesis the species richness in a sample site should increase with the habitat amount in the local landscape around the sample site. On the other hand, size and isolation of the patch containing the sample site should have no effect on species richness if the habitat amount in the local landscape remains constant. We tested these predictions using a small mammal dataset recorded in 100 transects in a savanna region of Brazil. We used generalized linear models considering the predictors - habitat amount, patch size, and patch isolation - together and singly, using subsets of data to control for correlations between them. We measured the habitat amount in 10 nested circles ranging in radius from 250 m to 6000 m around each transect. The scale of effect was the radius with the strongest estimated correlation between habitat amount and species richness. Our results indicate that habitat amount is the most important single predictor of species richness. The habitat amount effect was always positive and large. In general, patch size and patch isolation had no effect on species richness after controlling for the effect of habitat amount. The results are consistent with the habitat amount hypothesis, and suggest that habitat amount can be used in place of patch size and isolation in predicting small mammal species richness. This simplifies information needs by landscape managers as it replaces two predictors with one. Our results also support the use of estimated dispersal distance as a way of determining the appropriate landscape scale of effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The resource availability hypothesis (RAH), the most successful theory explaining plant defence patterns, predicts that defence investment is related to the relative growth rate (RGR) of plant species, which is associated with habitat quality. Thus, fast-growing species should show lower resistance than slow-growing species, which would lead fast growers to sustain higher herbivory rates, but the fitness consequences of herbivory would be greater for slow growers. The latter is often assumed but rarely tested. In a temperate rainforest, we tested the expected pattern of tolerance to herbivory derived from the RAH: that fast-growing species should be more tolerant than slow growing species. We also evaluated whether other plant features covary with RGR (leaf lifespan, shade tolerance and leaf toughness) and thus could also contribute to the patterns of tolerance to herbivory. As expected, seedlings from tree species with higher RGR showed greater tolerance to herbivory. Among the three plant features included, only leaf lifespan showed a significant association with RGR, but RGR was the best predictor of tolerance. We argue that plant tolerance to herbivory must be evaluated to properly verify the assumptions of the RAH.

AB Large frugivores play an important role as seed dispersers and their extinction may affect plant regeneration. The consequences of such extinctions depend on the likelihood of other species being functionally redundant and on how post-dispersal events are affected. We assess the functional redundancy of two seed dispersers of the Atlantic Forest, the muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides) and the tapir (Tapirus terrestris) through the comparison of their seed dispersal quality, taking into account post-dispersal events. We compare tapirs and muriquis for: (1) the dung beetle community associated with their feces; (2) the seed burial probability and burial depth by dung beetles; and (3) the seed mortality due to predators or other causes according to burial depth. We determine how seed burial affects seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) and compare the dispersal quality of four plant species dispersed by these frugivores. Muriqui feces attract 16-fold more dung beetles per gram of fecal matter and seeds experience 10.5-fold more burial than seeds in tapir feces. In both feces types, seed mortality due to predation decreases with burial depth but seed mortality due to other causes increases. Total seed mortality differ within plant species according to the primary disperser. Therefore, the effect of seed burial on SDE varies according to the plant species, burial depth, and primary disperser. As tapirs and muriquis differently affect the seed fate, they are not functionally redundant. Since the effect of the primary disperser persists into the post-dispersal events, we should consider the cascading effects of these processes when assessing functional redundancy.

AB Generalized linear models are often used to identify covariates of landscape processes and to model land-use change. Generalized linear models however, overlook the spatial component of land-use data, and its effects on statistical inference. Spatial autocorrelation may artificially reduce variance in observations, and inflate the effect size of covariates. To uncover the consequences of overlooking this spatial component, we tested both spatially explicit and non-spatial models of deforestation for Colombia. Parameter estimates, analyses of residual spatial autocorrelation, and Bayesian posterior predictive checks were used to compare model performance. Significant residual correlation showed that non-spatial models failed to adequately explain the spatial structure of the data. Posterior predictive checks revealed that spatially explicit models had strong predictive power for the entire range of the response variable and only failed to predict outliers, in contrast with non-spatial models, which lacked predictive power for all response values. The predictive power of non-spatial models was especially low in regions away from Colombia's center, where about half the observations were clustered. While all analyses consistently identified a core of important covariates of deforestation rates, predictive modeling requires parameter estimates informed by the spatial structure of the data. To inform increasingly important forest and carbon sequestration policy, land-use models must account for spatial autocorrelation.

AB Natural and anthropogenic disturbances alter canopy structure, understory vegetation, amount of woody debris, and the litter and soil layers in forest ecosystems. These environmental changes impact forest communities, including ground-dwelling invertebrates that are key regulators of ecosystem processes. Variation in frequency, intensity, duration, and spatial scale of disturbances affect the magnitude of these environmental changes and how forest communities and ecosystems are impacted over time. We propose conceptual models that describe the dynamic temporal effects of disturbance caused by invasive insects, wind, and salvage logging on canopy gap formation and accumulation of coarse woody debris (CWD), and their impacts on ground-dwelling invertebrate communities. In the context of this framework, predictions are generated and their implications for ground-dwelling invertebrate communities are discussed.

AB AimOverall species richness in habitat remnants is seldom explained by the island biogeography theory (IBT). In this study, we tested the effectiveness of the IBT in explaining species richness of forest birds with or without considering the effect of the different forest specialization of species (generalist, edge and interior; community analysis). We also identified single species and groups of species that could serve as indicators of different fragmentation degrees (indicator species analysis).
   LocationBroadleaved forests in western Lombardy (northern Italy).
   MethodsWe evaluated bird species richness in 344 forest fragments. Fragment area (FA), distance from the nearest source area (>1000ha) (DSA) and number of neighbouring fragments (NF) were calculated for each fragment. Using Poisson generalized linear models, we compared a model that evaluated the relationships between fragment covariates and species richness to a model that also considered the effect of forest species specialization on each relationship. Moreover, we investigated the association between each species and particular fragmentation conditions by calculating the IndVal index.
   ResultsThe application of the IBT to species richness performed significantly better if we took into account forest species specialization when evaluating the effect of fragment covariates. In particular, the positive effects of FA and NF and the negative effect of DSA were significantly stronger on interior species rather than on generalist and edge species. Using the IndVal index we identified six species in three groups strongly associated with specific fragmentation degrees.
   Main conclusionsThe results showed the strong influence of the specialization of species on their distribution in fragmented landscapes. Interior species were the best candidates as a proxy of fragmentation effects. However, the indicator species analyses revealed that not all interior species showed the same sensitivity to fragment covariates.

AB 1. Fungi play critical roles in ecosystem processes and interact with plant communities in mutualistic, pathogenic, and commensal ways. Fungal communities are thought to depend on both associated tree communities and soil properties. However, the relative importance of the biotic and abiotic drivers of soil fungal community structure and diversity in lowland tropical forests remains poorly understood.
   2. We examined the community structure of trees and fungi at different levels of phosphorus (0.17-16.3 mg kg(-1)) in moist tropical forests in Panama. We predicted that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal composition would be more strongly associated with soil properties than with local tree communities while the composition of other fungal clades would be more strongly correlated with local tree communities than soil properties. We also predicted that fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness would be negatively correlated with soil fertility and positively correlated with tree species diversity within and among forests.
   3. We characterized soil chemistry, fine root biomass, and sequenced the ITS1 barcode region to describe fungal community composition from 70 soil cores across three 1-ha tropical rainforest sites in Panama. The sites vary in soil chemistry, including P, and in tree species community composition, but experience similar annual rainfall.
   4. AM fungal community composition was partially correlated with soil chemistry (r = 0.32, P = 0.001), but not with local tree communities, while non-AM fungal communities were nearly equally correlated with soil chemistry (Partial Mantel test, r = 0.38, P = 0.001) as with tree communities (r = 0.36, P = 0.001). Linear models showed that AM OTU richness was not explained by any independent variable. For non-AM fungi, phosphorus, pH, and soil moisture better predicted OTU richness across all cores than other biotic and abiotic factors.
   5. Synthesis. Our results show that AM fungal structure is driven primarily by soil chemistry. For non-AM fungi, soil properties and the local tree community can play a joint role in structuring communities. Furthermore, we found that more diverse local tree communities did not harbour more fungal species. Our results suggest that soil properties act as an environmental filter for both trees and fungi, setting the stage for interactions between the two.

AB We present evidence that populations of an invasive plant species that have become re-associated with a specialist herbivore in the exotic range through biological control have rapidly evolved increased antiherbivore defences compared to populations not exposed to biocontrol. We grew half-sib families of the invasive plant Lythrum salicaria sourced from 17 populations near Ottawa, Canada, that differed in their history of exposure to a biocontrol agent, the specialist beetle Neogalerucella calmariensis. In a glasshouse experiment, we manipulated larval and adult herbivory to examine whether a population's history of biocontrol influenced plant defence and growth. Plants sourced from populations with a history of biocontrol suffered lower defoliation than naive, previously unexposed populations, strongly suggesting they had evolved higher resistance. Plants from biocontrol-exposed populations were also larger and produced more branches in response to herbivory, regrew faster even in the absence of herbivory and were better at compensating for the impacts of herbivory on growth (i.e. they exhibited increased tolerance). Furthermore, resistance and tolerance were positively correlated among genotypes with a history of biocontrol but not among naive genotypes. Our findings suggest that biocontrol can rapidly select for increased defences in an invasive plant and may favour a mixed defence strategy of resistance and tolerance without an obvious cost to plant vigour. Although rarely studied, such evolutionary responses in the target species have important implications for the long-term efficacy of biocontrol programmes.

AB There is evidence for the existence of varying degrees of host preference in vascular epiphytes; certain tree species can be positively, neutrally, or negatively associated with epiphytes. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether tree species of the cloud forest differ in their suitability as a substrate for epiphytic bromeliads. To evaluate the association between epiphytic bromeliad cover and host tree species, we sampled 62 plots (each of 200 m(2)) in four cloud forest fragments in Veracruz, Mexico. For all trees ae<yen>10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH), we recorded species name, DBH, and percentage cover of bromeliads in categories of tree coverage. In total, 587 trees belonging to 52 species were recorded. All of the 10 tree species used to assess differences in epiphyte cover (each with a minimum of nine individuals) supported bromeliads, but mean bromeliad cover differed significantly among the tree species. The tree species that concentrated the highest bromeliad cover were Quercus sartorii (29.86%) and Liquidambar styraciflua (21.72%). Our results indicate that, while none of the tree species analyzed was a limiting host for epiphytic bromeliads in general, varying levels of bromeliad cover occur depending on the host species in tropical montane cloud forest fragments suggesting that certain tree species are better hosts than others. The implications for conservation efforts of differential tree species suitability as epiphyte hosts are discussed.

AB Understanding the processes that influence species diversity is still a challenge in ecological studies. However, there are two main theories to discuss this topic, the niche theory and the neutral theory. Our objective was to understand the importance of environmental and spatial processes in structuring bird communities within the hydrological seasons in dry forest areas in northeastern Brazil. The study was conducted in two National Parks, the Serra da Capivara and Serra das Confusoes National Parks, where 36 areas were sampled in different seasons (dry, dry/rainy transition, rainy, rainy/dry transition), in 2012 and 2013. We found with our results that bird species richness is higher in the rainy season and lower during the dry season, indicating a strong influence of seasonality, a pattern also found for environmental heterogeneity. Richness was explained by local environmental factors, while species composition was explained by environmental and spatial factors. The environmental factors were more important in explaining variations in composition. Climate change predictions have currently pointed out frequent drought events and a rise in global temperature by 2050, which would lead to changes in species behavior and to increasing desertification in some regions, including the Caatinga. In addition, the high deforestation rates and the low level of representativeness of the Caatinga in the conservation units negatively affects bird communities. This scenario has demonstrated how climatic factors affect individuals, and, therefore, should be the starting point for conservation initiatives to be developed in xeric environments.

AB Functional traits, properties of organisms correlated with ecological performance, play a central role in plant community assembly and functioning. To some extents, functional traits vary in concert, reflecting fundamental ecological strategies. While "trait syndromes" characteristic of e. g. fast-growing, early-successional vs. competitive, late-successional species are recognized in principle, less is known about the environmental and genetic factors at the source of trait variation and covariation within plant communities. We studied the three leaf traits leaf half-life (LHL), leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen concentration in green leaves (Ngreen) and the wood trait wood density (WD) in 294 individuals belonging to 45 tree or shrub species in a Chinese subtropical forest from September 2006 to January 2009. Using multilevel ANOVA and decomposition of sums of products, we estimated the amount of trait variation and covariation among species (mainly genetic causes), i. e. plant functional type (deciduous vs. evergreen species), growth form (tree vs. shrub species), family/genus/species differences, and within species (mainly environmental causes), i. e. individual and season. For single traits, the variation between functional types and among species within functional types was large, but only LMA and Ngreen varied significantly among families and thus showed phylogenetic signal. Trait variation among individuals within species was small, but large temporal variation due to seasonal effects was found within individuals. We did not find any trait variation related to soil conditions underneath the measured individuals. For pairs of traits, variation between functional types and among species within functional types was large, reflecting a strong evolutionary coordination of the traits, with LMA, LHL and WD being positively correlated among each other and negatively with Ngreen. This integration of traits was consistent with a putative stem-leaf economics spectrum ranging from deciduous species with thin, highnitrogen leaves and low-density wood to evergreen species with thick, low-nitrogen leaves and dense wood and was not influenced by phylogenetic history. Trait coordination within species was weak, allowing individual trees to deviate from the interspecific trait coordination and thus respond flexibly to environmental heterogeneity. Our findings suggest that within a single woody plant community variation and covariation in functional traits allows a large number of species to co-exist and cover a broad spectrum of multivariate niche space, which in turn may increase total resource extraction by the community and community functioning.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E

ID PLANT DIVERSITY; NEUTRAL THEORY; COEXISTENCE; ECOLOGY
AB The limiting similarity of competitive species and its relationship with the competitive exclusion principle is still one of the most important concepts in ecology. In the 1970s, May [R.M. May, Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 1973)] developed a concise theoretical framework to investigate the limiting similarity of competitive species. His theoretical results show that no limiting similarity threshold of competitive species can be identified in the deterministic model system whereby species more similar than this threshold never coexist. Theoretically, for competitive species coexisting in an unvarying environment, deterministic interspecific interactions and demographic stochasticity can be considered two sides of a coin. To investigate how the "tension" between these two forces affects the coexistence of competing species, a simple two-species competitive system based only on May's model system is transformed into an equivalent replicator equation. The effect of demographic stochasticity on the system stability is measured by the expected drift of the Lyapunov function. Our main results show that the limiting similarity of competitive species should not be considered to be an absolute measure. Specifically, very similar competitive species should be able to coexist in an environment with a high productivity level but big differences between competitive species should be necessary in an ecosystem with a low productivity level.

AB Conservation of degraded forests is a challenging issue in the tropics, since the maintenance of environmental services and economic demands must be conciliated. Environmental services must be conserved while degraded tropical forests are demanded to be competitive against more financially profitable land uses as crop fields and pastures. The objective of this study was to evaluate productivity and financial profitability of enrichment planting in degraded forests. Seeds of Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum were planted in logging gaps of a 108-ha degraded forest in southeast Para (Brazil) in February 1995 (average = 91.7 seeds ha(-1) and 15.3 seeds gap(-1)). After 13 years (2008), S. parahyba presented a volume increase of 3.1 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) for individuals >= 25 cm in DBH. More than 30% of the planted seeds were able to germinate, establish, and grow up to sizes >= 25 cm in DBH. A cost-benefit analysis through Net Present Value (NPV) and a sensitivity analysis with different interest rates were performed to compare financial profitability of the treated and control area under roundwood and laminated plus sawnwood production. Enrichment planting using S. parahyba seeds presented higher NPVs in the treated than in control area for all simulations, except roundwood under interest rate of 9% per year. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest is extremely biodiverse but is threatened by anthropogenic land-use change. In South Africa, remnant forest patches are divided into highly restricted but protected indigenous forest (IF) and abundant but unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush (DB), which likely represents secondary/regenerating IF. We tested the hypothesis that DB had value for conserving forest dependent avian taxonomic and functional diversity, as (a) DB is situated with in the forestanthropogenic land-use mosaic and (b) birds maintain diverse ecosystem functions and are sensitive to environmental change given their varied biological traits. We conducted 149 and 112 fixed-radius point-count surveys of avian communities in 99, and 24, patches of DB and IF, respectively, at each location recording microhabitat vegetation structure. We compared vegetation characteristics and taxonomic species richness between vegetation classes, and tested the breadth of functional trait-space and for significant associations with vegetation structures at each survey location, using RLQ analysis. Vegetation classes differed significantly, but floral species overlap and vegetation structures in DB closely resembled regenerating IF habitat. Specialist ground-nesting and insect-gleaning species corresponded to taller, more diverse IF structures. Other biological traits and total species richness overlapped broadly across both classes, but IF had significantly higher mean species richness. Given the relatively high taxonomic and functional diversity of the avian community in the abundant DB, the scarcity of IF, and the proximity of DB to the anthropogenic land-use mosaic, we recommend allocating suitable DB patches to the Protected Area Network, which may simultaneously help preserve avian taxonomic and functional diversity, facilitate colonisation throughout the fragmented landscape and provide ecosystem services to anthropogenic land uses.

AB Effects of plantation forestry on biodiversity are controversially discussed in literature. While some authors stress positive effects, others tend to attribute a largely negative influence to plantations. One important factor steering the influence on biodiversity are management practices. A second important factor is the environmental matrix. Chile offers the option to analyse both factors jointly. The coastal range of central Chile has experienced rapid and widespread replacement of native Nothofagus spp. forests in favour of Pinus radiata plantations. Here, native forests remain limited to small patches surrounded by an environmental matrix of plantations. Management is rather intensive and not designed to maintain biodiversity. While in the coastal range of central Chile the transformation from native forests to non-native tree plantations has almost come to an end, spatial extension of P. contorta and P. ponderosa plantations has just recently begun in Chilean Patagonia. While the management is similar to central Chile, plantations rather exist as small patches surrounded by an environmental matrix of native plant formations (e.g. Nothofagus spp. forests and Nothofagus spp. scrublands). In the framework of this work, effects of the two diametric land usages on biodiversity are assessed and compared. Biodiversity is assessed at the alpha-, beta- and gamma-scale. At the alpha-scale, biodiversity impacts are inferred statistically, using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's PostHoc test. Biodiversity of plants at both sites is significantly reduced in plantations when compared to native forests or scrublands. Plantation forestry lowers alpha-biodiversity and does not provide additional habitats for specialists. At the beta-scale, weak edge effects due to the presence of native forests are observed. In total, plantation forestry tends to promote plant invasions and impairs the survival of endemics. At the gamma-scale, plant species communities where predominantly native and endemic in forests, predominantly introduced in plantations. Positive effects of the more native environmental matrix in Patagonia are not found to be stronger than in central Chile, therefore it is concluded that management imposes a much stronger influence. Results show, that the biodiversity impacts in Central Chile are transferable to Chilean Patagonia, where plantation forestry is increasingly established. (C) 2017 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

AB Soil granulometric composition can impose constraints on ant species living in ground habitats, being an important factor in defining the habitat templet, which describes how certain animal life histories, including the trait of body size, can be selected. The ant fauna plays a central role in soil formation, and a vast literature describes such influence, but not the converse. Along with termites, worms and other invertebrates, these organisms promote the formation of channels, pores, and aggregates that influence gases and water moving through the soil profile. On the other hand, it is important to understand whether soil traits constrain insect colonization, so we here ask how soil traits can influence niche specificities, which seems to be a neglected ecological issue. A literature search using the key words 'ants or Formicidae' and 'soil structure or pedogenesis' revealed numerous references dealing with the influence of ants on soil, but not conversely. We here present a novel geomorphologic approach to habitat templets for two distinct riparian Neotropical ecosystems, based on the amalgamation of soil/sediment analysis with ecological processes and ant species biology. We found that predominance of fine grains favoured the preponderance of small ant species at a threshold of < 5 mm in body length. Based on this, we propose the use of a quantitative, theoretically sound, statistical approach to bioindication. (C) 2017 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.) is a light-demanding species, because in natural forest, the species depending of formation of clearings for reach reproduction size and in forest plantation, showing fast initial growth when exposed to high levels of irradiance. However, the ecophysiological traits of this species under contrasting conditions of irradiance were not investigated. In this study, in addition to growth traits, we investigated for first time the degree of plasticity of ecophysiological response of Bertholletia excelsa when subjected to contrasting irradiance environments. Young plants of Bertholletia excelsa were cultivated under three conditions of irradiance: low (20-300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), moderate (800-1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and high (1900-2100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). We analyzed the growth traits, gas exchange, chloroplastid pigment contents and, the end of experiment, the accumulation and partitioning of biomass. Young plants of Bertholletia excelsa showed the highest values of biomass, growth and photosynthesis when exposed to environments of moderate and high irradiance. Low irradiance condition stimulated more biomass partitioning for shoot and chloroplastid pigment contents. Bertholletia excelsa showed physiological plasticity under contrasting conditions of irradiance, the largest growth and biomass accumulation in environments of moderate and high irradiance were promoted by better photosynthetic performance, whereas the positive carbon balance under low irradiance is ensured by investment in structures of interception and energy harvesting.

AB Background: Human impact over natural ecosystems located in Southern Mexico is increasingly evident. We generated a spatially explicit land use and cover change (LUCC) model to assess current and potential impact of human activities and to identify the influence of variables such as: distance to paved and unpaved roads, human settlements, rivers, slope and protected areas.
   Study site: Mesoamerican Biological Corridor located in the state of Chiapas (MBC-Ch), Mexico.
   Methods: We calibrated a model for the period 1993-2002 and ran a simulation for 2007 which we compared against the real 2007 land use and cover map to evaluate model's performance. We then projected LUCC to 2030 under three different scenarios: 1) Agriculture and Livestock (AGL), 2) Business As Usual (BAU) and, 3) Conservation (CON).natural protected areas had the opposite effect. The AGL scenario predicted a reduction of 43 and 41 % in the extent of closed tropical and temperate forests, respectively. In comparison, the BAU scenario predicted a reduction of 19.5 % in the area covered by closed tropical forest and of 30.1 % in temperate forests. The extent of land destined to agriculture and livestock activities increased by 22 and 15 % in the AGL and BAU scenarios, respectively. In contrast, the CON scenario predicted slight changes in the landscape.
   Conclusiones: Los modelos de simulacion indican queues altamente probable observar una reduccion en la extension de los ecosistemas presentes en el CBM-Ch de no implementarse una serie de medidas urgentes para mitigar el impacto del CCUS en la regien.

AB The study of treefall and its after-effects is a common theme in studies of forest structure and local dynamics, yet its value as descriptor of broader-scale ecological dynamics is rarely explored. Here we synthesize the most highly cited literature on treefalls, from 1985 to 2016 (in three-year blocks), highlighting the importance of the causes, characteristics and consequences of such events. We then ask how this knowledge might contribute to the broader conceptual model of forest dynamics, and develop two conceptual models, which we use to illustrate both the classic and alternative views of how forests 'work'. Treefalls are one of the few 'integrating' attributes of forests, because of their ubiquity and longevity, and therefore can inform a variety of processes (e.g., tree mortality, turnover rates, structural impacts, recruitment, and fire frequency) due to their impacts occurring simultaneously over space (patterns), and time (legacy effects). The substantial knowledge that already exists on localized treefall dynamics should be combined with more integrative approaches to studying forest ecosystems, to investigate landscape-scale patterns of treefall and reconstruct past disturbance events.

AB The influence of edge proximity on woodland plants is a well-established research area, yet the influence of dual edge exposure has rarely been investigated. This novel research aims to establish whether proximity to two edges has any additive influence on Ancient Woodland Indicator (AWI) species presence relative to proximity to a single edge. Several AWI species are threatened and thus specific conservation priorities, while Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW) itself is often highly fragmented: almost half of remnant patches are less than 5 ha, which increases the potential for dual edge effects. Here, systematic mapping of herbaceous AWI species was conducted in 310 vegetation plots in two formerly-connected ASNW fragments in South-West England. Linear regression modelling revealed that distance to nearest edge and distance to second nearest edge were both univariately positively correlated with AWI species richness. After distance from nearest edge was entered into a multivariate model first, distance from second edge was entered in a second optional step after meeting stepwise criteria. The resultant multivariate model was more significant, and explained more variance, than either variable in isolation, indicating an additive effect of dual edge exposure. Likewise, binary logistic regression modelling showed presence of individual AWI species (Anemone nemorosa, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Lamiastrum galaeobdolon and Paris quadrifolia) was significantly related not only to distance from the nearest and second nearest edges in isolation, but significantly more strongly by the additive effect of distance from both edges in a single model. We discuss the implications of these findings from community ecology and conservation perspectives.

AB We surveyed two savanna sites, one on flat terrain with deep soil (DS), and the other on hilly terrain with rocky outcrops and shallow soil (RS), before and after an accidental fire. We found that the fire did not cause any significant changes in the species composition or diversity of either community, and did not result in floristic homogenization. However, we did record a reduction in the density of plants and in basal area in the DS savanna in comparison with the RS savanna, as well as a higher rate of basal sprouting, which indicates a trade-off between mortality and sprouting. We conclude that, whereas post-fire changes in vegetation structure were more pronounced in the DS savanna than in the RS, the difference in the underlying substrate did not have a direct influence on the post-fire composition of woody species. The greater grass biomass found in the DS savanna in comparison with the RS savanna appears to have been the principal modulator of the severity of the fires in the two phytophysionogmies, and accounts for the distinct responses to fire we observed in the two woody communities.

AB Two species with similar resource requirements respond in a characteristic way to variations in their habitat-their abundances rise and fall in concert. We use this idea to learn how bacterial populations in the microbiota respond to habitat conditions that vary from person-to-person across the human population. Our mathematical framework shows that habitat fluctuations are sufficient for explaining intra-bodysite correlations in relative species abundances from the Human Microbiome Project. We explicitly show that the relative abundances of closely related species are positively correlated and can be predicted from taxonomic relationships. We identify a small set of functional pathways related to metabolism and maintenance of the cell wall that form the basis of a common resource sharing niche space of the human microbiota.

AB A new genus and species of gall midge, Haplopappusmyia gregaria, is described and illustrated (larva, pupa, male, and female). This species induces apical galls on Haplopappus foliosus (Asteraceae), an endemic shrub from central Chile. The specimens were collected at La Ligua Municipality, Petorca Province, Valparaiso region, Chile, during spring of 2011-2014. This area corresponds to one of the fifth Mediterranean Matorral biome, considered among Earth's biodiversity hotspots. The new genus is characterized by presenting lateral margin of antennal scape with a mesal reentrance; four-segmented palpus, one-toothed tarsal claws, R5 straight, reaching C anterior to wing apex; male seventh and eighth tergites lacking sclerotization mesally, beyond proximal margin; presence of trichoid sensilla on the abdominal terga and sterna of both sexes, protrusible ovipositor with elongate fused cerci, and larva with 4 pairs of setose terminal papillae.

AB Costa Rica established the National Biological Corridor Program in 2006. Under the National Biological Corridor Program, the long-running Payment for Environmental Services Program was newly prioritized into biological corridors throughout the country. The National Biological Corridor Program caused a nationwide spatial shift in placement of payments for environmental services throughout Costa Rica. We classified ASTER 15-m resolution imagery in a central Costa Rica corridor connecting the eastern and western protected areas networks to analyze the change in forests during the National Biological Corridor Program with its targeted payments for environmental services effort. We used object-based classification methods, and compared land cover changes over an initial four-year period of corridor policy enactment. We calculated the changes within PES properties and outside of PES regions, and we also calculated forest patch metrics during the same time period. Results indicate a decline in forest cover over the study period, along with an increase in urban and pasture land. covers, with higher change and loss of forest centered inside of the biological corridor, near the construction area for the new San Carlos highway, and within eastern pasture areas. We also saw a higher percentage of forest loss inside of the biological corridor area as compared to areas outside of the biological corridor. Forest loss was drastically less within current and historic PES properties, as compared to the overall study region. Across the entire study region, patch metrics show a decrease in the number of patches and a slight decrease in average patch size. These results suggest that current and past designation of PES prevents forest loss within PES properties while the current designation of priority conservation status via the National Biological Corridor Program is not increasing connectivity and forest conservation. This is shown by increased land use change and a decrease in forest associated with biological corridor designation. These results are antithetical to the goals of the National Biological Corridor Program. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auctions appeal to analysts and policy designers because of their potential efficiency in recruiting new areas for nature conservation. The failure to develop genuine auctions and competitive tender processes is typically blamed on the design and the attractiveness of the instrument. However, the institutional constraints that a new competitive mechanism faces when placed in a real-world ecological-institutional setting are only partly anticipated by the theoretical and analytical approaches. This paper explores the theory-based principles of cost-effectiveness against a real-world auction instrument designed for forest biodiversity conservation in Finland. The instrument, called "Natural Values Trading", specified that the tenders should be invited and compared on an annual basis but the competitive procedure was not operationalized. Instead, sites were evaluated on a first come - first serve basis, applying ecological criteria and pricing based on opportunity costs. The institutional constraints of the auction mechanism centred on the difficulty that public authorities geared toward implementing law and treating citizens equally faced with a competitive arrangement. The pressure to generate instant impact overrode experimenting with new mechanisms and exiting an administrative comfort zone. The findings conform to the institutional theories that identify challenges with matching organizational mandate, reallocating and developing organizational competencies as well as changing informal organizational and professional practices. The design of biodiversity conservation mechanisms will not go far by focusing solely on cost-effectiveness; instead, the institutional friction should be taken seriously and organizational mandates, competencies and practices should be addressed explicitly.

AB Tropical forests are carbon rich ecosystems and small changes in tropical forest tree growth substantially influence the global carbon cycle. Forest monitoring studies report inconsistent growth changes in tropical forest trees over the past decades. Most of the studies highlighted changes in the forest level carbon gain, neglecting the species-specific growth changes which ultimately determine community-level responses. Tree-ring analysis can provide historical data on species-specific tree growth with annual resolution. Such studies are inadequate in Bangladesh, which is one of the most climate sensitive regions in the tropics. In this study, we investigated long-term growth rates of Toona ciliata in a moist tropical forest of Bangladesh by using tree-ring analysis. We sampled 50 trees of varying size, obtained increment cores from these trees and measured tree-ring width. Analyses of growth patterns revealed size-dependent growth increments. After correcting for the effect of tree size on tree growth (ontogenetic changes) by two different methods we found declining growth rates in T ciliata from 1960 to 2013. Standardized ring-width index (RWI) was strongly negatively correlated with annual mean and maximum temperatures suggesting that rising temperature might cause the observed growth decline in T ciliata. Assuming that global temperatures will rise at the current rate, the observed growth decline is assumed to continue. The analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes may reveal more insight on the physiological response of this species to future climatic changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In tropical rainforests, gaps created by fallen canopy trees are the primary colonization sites for pioneer species. Selective logging mimics these natural disturbances in that only a single tree is felled, creating a gap of comparable size. Rates of tree felling greatly exceed natural mortality rates, however, changing disturbance regime by increasing the number of gaps in logged areas compared to intact forest. Little is known about whether gaps in logged forests are qualitatively different as well. At Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, a period of selective logging in areas adjacent to the research station created a natural experiment permitting comparison of populations of the invasive pioneer tree Bellucia pentamera in selectively logged and undisturbed forest. We sought to first establish whether canopy gaps are necessary for invasion by B. pentamera. We then examined whether the type of gap (logging vs. natural treefall) had an effect on recruitment. Finally, we compared populations in natural treefall gaps in logged and undisturbed forest to estimate the effect of logging on population size. Bellucia pentamera was limited to gaps, regardless of canopy tree density. Furthermore, gaps created by selective logging supported significantly more B. pentamera individuals than natural gaps. Finally, natural treefall gaps in the disturbed area contained significantly more individuals than gaps in the undisturbed forest. Therefore, it appears that selective logging not only created more gaps for B. pentamera, these gaps in particular promoted greater abundance of this invader and led to a population increase throughout the disturbed habitat.

AB The Amazon basin has been subjected to unprecedented rates of land-use change over the past several decades, primarily as a result of the expansion of agriculture. Enhanced rain forest conservation efforts toward the end of the twentieth century slowed deforestation of the Amazon but, in turn, increased demand for land repurposing in the adjacent Cerrado (savanna) region, where conservation regulations are less strict. To maintain or increase yields while minimizing the need for additional land, agricultural producers adopted a form of intensification in which two rain-fed crops are planted within a single growing season (double cropping). Using 10 years (August 2002 to July 2012) of MODIS and TRMM data, it is demonstrated that there exists a threshold growing season rainfall amount (1759 mm) for double cropping. But more nuanced is the relationship between observable precipitation information available to farmers at the time of planting decision and the choice to "double crop'' in a given year. An evaluation of decision-available precipitation characteristics provides strong evidence for the importance of high rainfall frequency during a critical period prior to, and including, the rainy season onset.

AB Nearly all of our understanding of rocky inter-tidal ecology comes from studies conducted at low tide. To study inter-tidal organisms at high tide, we anchored waterproof digital GoPro (R) video cameras in wave-exposed tidepools and recorded the daytime movements of the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis, over the tidal cycle between May and August 2012 near Bodega Bay, California. Overall, snails moved more quickly and presumably foraged more during low tides and on days with warmer air and perhaps water temperatures. This is similar to other ectotherms that exhibit increased metabolic rates, movement and foraging in warmer conditions. Snails also moved less during flood and high tides, may have moved downward in tidepools at flood tides, and showed evidence of reduced activity on days with larger waves. This inactivity and refuge seeking may have been a strategy to avoid dislodgment by waves. Analysis of snail trajectories showed foraging bouts indicated by alternating zig-zagging and straight movement. There was no effect of temperature, wave height, or tidal phase on distribution of snail turning angles, suggesting that they may have foraged consistently but moved faster during warm conditions and low tides, thereby grazing a larger area. This is one of few direct recordings of inter-tidal organisms on wave-exposed rocky shores during high tide. The methods used here are easily transferable to other studies, which are needed to increase our understanding of behaviors that structure rocky shore communities during high tide.

AB Secondary forests now make up more than one-half of all tropical forests, and constraints on their biomass accumulation will influence the strength of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink in the coming decades. However the variance in secondary tropical forest biomass for a given stand age and climate is high and our understanding of why is limited. We constructed a model of terrestrial C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling to examine the influence of disturbance and management practices on nutrient limitation and biomass recovery in secondary tropical forests. The model predicted that N limited the rate of forest recovery in the first few decades following harvest, but that this limitation switched to P approximately 30-40 yr after abandonment, consistent with field data on N and P cycling from secondary tropical forest chronosequences. Simulated biomass recovery agreed well with field data of biomass accumulation following harvest (R-2 = 0.80). Model results showed that if all biomass remained on site following a severe disturbance such as blowdown, regrowth approached pre-disturbance biomass in 80-90 yr, and recovery was faster following smaller disturbances such as selective logging. Field data from regrowth on abandoned pastures were consistent with simulated losses of nutrients in soil organic matter, particularly P. Following any forest disturbance that involved the removal of nutrients (i.e., except blowdown), forest regrowth produced reduced biomass relative to the initial state as a result of nutrient loss through harvest, leaching and/or sequestration by secondary minerals. Differences in nutrient availability accounted for 49-94% of the variance in secondary forest biomass C at a given stand age. Management lessons from this study are the importance of strategies that help retain nutrients on site, recognizing the role of coarse woody debris in immobilization and subsequent release of nutrients, and the potential for nutrient additions to enhance biomass growth and recovery in secondary tropical forests.

AB Deforestation and forest degradation are widespread in Indonesia and pose serious threats to biodiversity and other ecosystem services. The Indonesian government is implementing several Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiatives to help support the conservation of tropical forests, but the eastern part of Indonesia has yet to be included in this effort. Tropical forests growing on limestone are a prominent feature of that region, but little is known about their ecology and management, and only limited research has been conducted on biomass and the associated carbon storage capacity of these secondary forests. Here, we estimate the aboveground tree biomass (AGB) in an old secondary forest on limestone in Seram, the Moluccas, East Indonesia. We destructively sampled all aboveground vegetation in 0.04 ha forest and developed a local allometric model (n = 25; diameter-range of 10.4-41.7 cm). We tested and compared the performance of our locally developed model with existing local models and a recent pantropical model (Chave et al., 2014) at our site. Total AGB in the 1-ha forest plot was estimated at 177 Mg ha(-1), of which 141 Mg ha(-1) (80%) was allocated in trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), 33 Mg ha(-1) (19%) in trees <10 cm dbh and 2 Mg ha(-1) (1%) in lianas and non-woody vegetation. Both our locally developed and the pantropical model estimated the biomass of harvested trees accurately (local model: bias = 0.1%, CV = 15.5%; pantropical model: bias = -7.7%, CV = 17.7%), while other local models had much lower performance (bias = -57.1 to -7.3%, CV = 59.2 to 75.8%). At plot-level, the AGB estimate of the pantropical model approached the estimate of our local model, while other local models considerably underestimated actual AGB. Together, our findings confirm that trees <10 cm dbh can store a large fraction of total AGB in secondary forests, and highlight the robustness of generic models. These results provide further guidance for accurate assessments of forest carbon stocks in Indonesia and more generally for REDD+ initiatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The conservation of tropical forests has become an important mechanism for the mitigation of the negative effects of climate change. Countries located in the Neotropical region, Central and South America, are aiming to understand the drivers of carbon stocks of their forests to build a better capacity for forest management. In this study, we calculated Above Ground Biomass - AGB stocks for 32 (1 ha) vegetation plots of forests classified as terra finite and seasonally flooded, and evaluated the effect of basin location, structural and environmental variables on the magnitude of AGB stocks. We report that variation among river basins results from the effects of fragmentation and soil fertility. The most important variable, determining the magnitude of AGB stocks in lowland forests in the region is the number of large trees per hectare. Seasonally flooded forests should be studied and managed separately from terra firme forests as these behave differently in the relationship between tree species diversity and AGB stocks. We found that the proportions of endozoochoric and synzoochoric tree species are important variables for the magnitude of AGB stocks in these forests. We present the first account on the drivers of AGB stocks in Northwestern South America and show that environmental characteristics of forests, such as flooding and fragmentation should be taken into account to determine the variation on AGB stocks among forests in this region.

AB Standard procedures to assess P availability in soils are based on batch experiments with various extractants. However, in most soils P nutrition is less limited by bulk stocks but by strong adsorption and transport limitation. The basic principle of root-phosphate uptake is to strip phosphate locally from the solid phase by forming a radial depletion zone in the soil solution, optionally enhanced by release of mobilizing substances. Microdialysis (MD), a well-established method in pharmacokinetics, is capable to mimic important characteristics of P root uptake. The sampling is by diffusional exchange through a semipermeable membrane covering the probes with their sub-mm tubular structure. Additionally, the direct environment of the probe can be chemically modified by adding, e.g., carboxylates to the perfusate. This study is the first approach to test the applicability of MD in assessing plant available phosphate in soils and to develop a framework for its appropriate use.We used MD in stirred solutions to quantify the effect of pumping rate, concomitant ions, and pH value on phosphate recovery. Furthermore, we measured phosphate yield of top-soil material from a beech forest, a non-fertilized grassland, and from a fertilized corn field. Three perfusates have been used based on a 1 mM KNO3 solution: pure (1), with 0.1 mM citric acid (2), and with 1 mM citric acid(3). Additionally, a radial diffusion model has been parametrized for the stirred solutions and the beech forest soil.Results from the tests in stirred solutions were in good agreement with reported observations obtained for other ionic species. This shows the principal suitability of the experimental setup for phosphate tests. We observed a significant dependency of phosphate uptake into the MD probes on dialysate pumping rate and on ionic strength of the outside solution. In the soils, we observed uptake rates of the probes between 1.5x 10(-15) and 6.7 x 10(-14) mol s(-1) cm(-1) in case of no citrate addition. Surprisingly, median uptake rates were mostly independent of the bulk soil stocks, but the P-fertilized soil revealed a strong tailing towards higher values. This indicates the occurrence of hot P spots in soils. Citrate addition increased P yields only in the higher concentration but not in the forest soil. The order of magnitude of MD uptake rates from the soil samples matched root-length related uptake rates from other studies. The micro-radial citrate release in MD reflects the processes controlling phosphate mobilization in the rhizosphere better than measurements based on flooding of soil samples with citric acid in batch experiments. Important challenges in MD with phosphate are small volumes of dialysate with extremely low concentrations and a high variability of results due to soil heterogeneity and between-probe variability. We conclude that MD is a promising tool to complement existing P-analytical procedures, especially when spatial aspects or the release of mobilizing substances are in focus.

AB The fan mussel Pinna nobilis is threatened by several anthropogenic disturbances that are only partially mitigated by current conservation measures. In the Faro Lake Natural Reserve, the fan mussel population suffers from insufficient recruitment while, due to periodic dredging, a high larval supply within the canals does not support a stable population. In the present study, a robust number of fan mussel specimens were transplanted from a high-impact site to a guarded area to test the effects of transplantation on future conservation efforts. Over a 12-mo period, high survival and elevated growth were observed in the test population in comparison with the local population, demonstrating transplantation as a feasible and efficient method to prevent P. nobilis population decline. Such small-scale experiments provide useful indications for better management approaches for both of the threatened species and the natural hosting environment.

AB Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone are isolated pockets of moist habitat in the Blue Mountains region of Australia. Although endangered, few detailed studies have been conducted on their distinctive habitats and wildlife. We surveyed 10 swamps annually for 3 years to characterise conditions within swamps, surrounding woodland, and the transitional zone in between. Swamps were distinguished by waterlogged soil, a dense sedge understorey of live vegetation, and a virtual absence of trees, logs and rocks. In contrast, woodland had dry soil, a sparse understorey, many trees and logs, and much dead vegetation. The transitional zone was intermediate in these respects. Faunal species included 5 mammals (29 records), 17 reptiles (452 records) and 1 amphibian (13 records), with lizards comprising > 90% of all faunal records. Paradoxically, the sole endangered vertebrate, the Blue Mountains Water Skink (Eulamprus leuraensis) was the most abundant taxon we recorded: a habitat specialist found primarily within swamps (95% of records) and absent from woodland. Other Eulamprus species in the transitional zone (E. heatwolei) and woodland (E. quoyii) occurred at much lower densities. Because E. leuraensis is abundant within montane swamps but absent from surrounding habitats, any disturbance to swamps is likely to imperil populations of this endangered reptile.

AB The domestic and wild carnivore interface is complex, yet understudied. Interactions between carnivore species have important implications for direct interference competition, cross-species transmission of shared pathogens and conservation threats to wild carnivores. However, carnivore intraguild interactions are hard to quantify. In this study, we asked 512 villagers residing around a conservation area in the Serengeti Ecosystem, Tanzania, to report on the presence of wild carnivores in their village, the number of domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis catus in their household and interactions between domestic and wild carnivores. Wild carnivores are abundant near households surrounding the Serengeti National Park, villagers have many free-ranging domestic dogs (and would like to have more) and direct and indirect contacts between wild and domestic carnivores are common. Large carnivores, such as spotted hyenas and leopards, often killed or wounded domestic dogs. Small carnivores, such as mongoose, bat-eared fox, serval and wildcat, are locally abundant and frequently interact with domestic dogs. We demonstrate that interspecific carnivore behavior, human culture and local and regional geography play a complex role in domestic and wild carnivore interaction risk around conservation areas. Through the use of household surveys, we were able to efficiently obtain data on a wide scope of carnivore interactions over a large area, which may provide a direction for future targeted and in-depth research to reduce interspecific conflict. Improving the health and husbandry of domestic animals and reducing the unintentional feeding of wild carnivores could reduce dog-wildlife interactions and the potential for pathogen transmission at the domestic-wild animal interface.

AB The fluxes of energy, matter, and organisms are important structuring forces of metaecosystems. Such ecosystem fluxes likely interact with environmental heterogeneity and differentially affect the diversity of multiple communities. In an aquatic mesocosm experiment, we tested how ecosystem flux and patch heterogeneity affected the diversity of bacteria, phytoplankton, and zooplankton metacommunities, and the structure and functioning of metaecosystems. We built metaecosystems consisting of three mesocosms that were either connected by flux of living organisms, organic material, and nutrients (alive ecosystem flux) or only by flux of organic material and nutrients (dead ecosystem flux). The three patches of each metaecosystem were either homogeneous or heterogeneous in nutrient loading. We found that the three groups of organisms responded differently to our treatments: flux of living organisms increased bacterial diversity irrespective of nutrient heterogeneity, while flux effects on phytoplankton diversity depended on nutrient heterogeneity, potentially indicating source-sink effects. Although zooplankton diversity was largely unaffected by our manipulations, subtle changes of community composition in response to ecosystem flux had strong effects on lower trophic levels, highlighting the importance of indirect flux effects via -alterations in trophic interactions. Furthermore, differential effects of communities on the mean and spatial variability of local abiotic environments influenced the development of metaecosystem heterogeneity through time. Despite identical nutrient loading at the scale of the metaecosystem, abiotic conditions diverged between homogeneous and heterogeneous metaecosystems. For example, concentrations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher in homogeneous than heterogeneous metaecosystems, possibly because of differential responses of the algal community to local environmental conditions. Similarly, we found that flux effects on organisms translated into effects on DOC concentrations at the patch level, suggesting that flux-mediated changes in abundances of species can alter abiotic conditions. Our study shows that the dynamics of biotic and abiotic compartments of spatially structured ecosystems are intricately linked, highlighting the importance of integrating metacommunity and metaecosystem perspectives.

AB Generally, environments with a great habitat complexity (HC) can support a great number of species and large abundances of organisms. However, the mechanisms behind this effect are not entirely clear and some studies did not observe positive effects of complexity on diversity and abundance of biological assemblages. Here, HC was considered as an integrative perspective, specifically as different characteristics of physical structure and; it was tested whether abundance and diversity of macrobenthic assemblages of soft bottom are influenced by variation of two characteristics of habitat complexity, the number and evenness of sediment fractions. The hypothesized positive relationships between HC and richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and abundance of benthic macrofauna were not observed. The different response variables (richness, Shannon-Wiener, abundance) which consider different dimensions of biodiversity, can show distinct results when the same habitat is compared. For both structural characteristics of the sediment, a large amount of specimens of Bispira sp. (Polychaeta: Sabellidae) and Terebellides sp. (Polychaeta: Trichobranchidae) were observed in the most complex treatments. These taxa were favored by the presence of gravels where their larvae, likely originated from adult populations at nearby habitats, can settle. The multidimensional structure of the benthic macrofauna was significantly influenced by habitat complexity; and considering high taxonomical and functional diversity, multivariate analyses were more appropriated to investigate such complex effects. In this context, it is clear that careful thought must be given to choose appropriated habitat complexity characteristics and biological measurements. Therefore, studies addressing different combinations of structural characteristics of habitat and mechanisms behind the effects on biological communities are still of great need in ecological science.

AB Context Native vegetation extent is often a proxy for habitat area in studies of human-modified landscapes. However, the loss and retention of native vegetation is rarely random among landscapes. Instead, the extent of native vegetation in landscapes may be correlated with abiotic factors, thereby obscuring or distorting relationships between ecological phenomena and area.
   Objectives We asked: (1) how has the potential for non-random vegetation loss to confound area effects been addressed in the landscape ecology literature? (2) Are consistent patterns of non-random vegetation loss and retention evident from modified regions of two countries?
   Methods We reviewed 118 papers that related area to an ecological response, to determine whether potential biases associated with non-random vegetation loss and retention were considered. We then analysed similar to 18,000 100 km(2) landscape units in Australia and South Africa to identify how different abiotic factors correlate with the extent of native vegetation retained in those landscapes.
   Results Only 21% of the studies we reviewed explicitly or implicitly considered spatial biases in vegetation clearing. Yet, across modified regions of Australia and South Africa, landscape-scale native vegetation extent was consistently and often strongly related to abiotic factors, particularly soil properties and topographic variability.
   Conclusion Patterns of vegetation clearing and retention commonly reflect underlying abiotic heterogeneity. These biases, which are infrequently highlighted in studies focussing on area effects, have implications for how we assess the importance of vegetation extent for species and assemblages. Failure to account for correlates of vegetation extent risks erroneous area-based conservation prescriptions in human-modified environments.

AB Zoonotic pathogens comprise a significant and increasing fraction of all emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that plague humans. Identifying host species is one of the keys to controlling emerging infectious diseases. From March 2007 until April 2012, we collected a total of 131 wild rodents in eight municipalities of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We investigated these rodents for infection with Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. In total, 22.1% (29/131) of the rodents were infected by at least one pathogen; co-infection was detected in 1.5% (2/131) of rodents. Coxiella burnetii was detected in 4.6% (6/131) of the wild animals, 17.6% of the rodents harbored Bartonella spp. No cases of Rickettsia were identified. Bartonella doshiae and Bartonella vinsonii were the species found on the wild mammals. This report is the first to note C. burnetii, B. doshiae and B. vinsonii natural infections in Atlantic Forest wild rodents in Brazil. Our work highlights the potential risk of transmission to humans, since most of the infected specimens belong to generalist species that live near human dwellings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Terrestrial herbs are a significant floristic element of tropical forests; however, there is a lack of research focused on this plant group.
   Question: Which are the patterns of species distribution of herbaceous angiosperms along gradients of elevation and forest disturbance at Cofre de Perote, central Veracruz, Mexico?
   Studied species: Terrestrial herbaceous angiosperms.
   Study site and years of study: Eastern slopes of Cofre de Perote, central Veracruz, Mexico; from 2012 until 2014. Methods: We established an elevational transect (40 to 3,520 m), where floristic sampling in eight study sites within elevational belts of about 500 m each were realized. We recorded the occurrence of terrestrial angiosperm herbs within 135 20 x 20 m plots, distributed in old-growth, degraded forest, secondary vegetation, as well as azonal vegetation. Species richness and floristic composition was compared between the different elevational belts and forest disturbance.
   Results: We recorded a total of 264 herb species, 31 endemic to Mexico and three classified as threatened. This number of species represents 5.7 % of Veracruz's herbaceous angiosperm flora. The highest species richness was recorded at 2,500 m (76) and 1,500 m (52). In most of the cases, secondary forests showed the highest species richness independently of the elevational gradient, whereas old-growth forests had fewer species.
   Conclusions: The observed species richness, including endemic elements, highlights the importance for plant conservation of the area which is threatened by land use changes. Additionally, we suggest that vegetation variations formed by mature, disturbed and secondary forests is acceptable (and unavoidable) and can even increase species richness.

AB Despite decades of study, the relative importance of niche-based versus neutral processes in community assembly remains largely ambiguous. Recent work suggests niche-based processes are more easily detectable at coarser spatial scales, while neutrality dominates at finer scales. Analyses of functional traits with multi-year multi-site biodiversity inventories may provide deeper insights into assembly processes and the effects of spatial scale. We examined associations between community composition, species functional traits, and environmental conditions for plant communities in the Kouga-Baviaanskloof region, an area within South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR) containing high a and p diversity. This region contains strong climatic gradients and topographic heterogeneity, and is comprised of distinct vegetation classes with varying fire histories, making it an ideal location to assess the role of niche-based environmental filtering on community composition by examining how traits vary with environment. We combined functional trait measurements for over 300 species with observations from vegetation surveys carried out in 1991/1992 and repeated in 2011/2012. We applied redundancy analysis, quantile regression, and null model tests to examine trends in species turnover and functional traits along environmental gradients in space and through time. Functional trait values were weakly associated with most spatial environmental gradients and only showed trends with respect to vegetation class and time since fire. However, survey plots showed greater compositional and functional stability through time than expected based on null models. Taken together, we found clear evidence for functional distinctions between vegetation classes, suggesting strong environmental filtering at this scale, most likely driven by fire dynamics. In contrast, there was little evidence of filtering effects along environmental gradients within vegetation classes, suggesting that assembly processes are largely neutral at this scale, likely the result of very high functional redundancy among species in the regional species pool.

AB Unplanned selective logging for charcoal and firewood is a common practice in tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF), a high priority ecosystem for biodiversity conservation at the global scale. However, limited information is available regarding the impact of such logging on forest regeneration. We evaluated the abundance and composition of tree regeneration in four TMCF sites subject to traditional selective logging in southern Mexico. At each site, we calculated a tree extraction index based on the number of stumps, logs and charcoal kilns and established six 200 m(2) plots where the abundance of adult, sapling and seedling trees were recorded and canopy cover estimated. Based on the extraction index and estimated basal area values, two sites each were classified as being of low (L) and high (H) logging intensity; the extraction index was three times lower in L (7.5 and 9.2) than in H (35 and 35) sites, while basal area was significantly higher in L than in H sites (80.2 +/- 10.2 vs. 41.9 +/- 4.96 m(2) ha(-1), respectively). No significant differences were found among sites in terms of canopy cover, diameter and density of adult trees or in the density of saplings and seedlings (0.72 individuals m(-2)). In all sites, species of intermediate shade-tolerance dominated the regeneration (76%), followed by the shade-tolerant (23%) and pioneer (1%) species. Regeneration of Quercus spp. (four species) dominated at all sites (50.5%); this is a group of particular interest to the local communities because of its utility for firewood and charcoal. The similarity in composition between adult and regenerating tree species was relatively high in all of the sites (Morisita-Horn Index L1=0.86, L2=0.64, H1=0.69 and H2=0.71). These results indicate that, under the evaluated selective logging intensities, TMCF can sustain sufficient regeneration of Quercus spp. and thus presents an opportunity for sustainable management. The legacy effects of traditional selective logging on TMCF tree regeneration are discussed.

AB 1. Density dependence regulates populations of many species across all taxonomic groups. Understanding density dependence is vital for predicting the effects of climate, habitat loss and/or management actions on wild populations. Migratory species likely experience seasonal changes in the relative influence of density dependence on population processes such as survival and recruitment throughout the annual cycle. These effects must be accounted for when characterizing migratory populations via population models.
   2. To evaluate effects of density on seasonal survival and recruitment of a migratory species, we used an existing full annual cycle model framework for American black ducks Anas rubripes, and tested different density effects (including no effects) on survival and recruitment. We then used a Bayesian model weight updating routine to determine which population model best fit observed breeding population survey data between 1990 and 2014.
   3. The models that best fit the survey data suggested that survival and recruitment were affected by density dependence and that density effects were stronger on adult survival during the breeding season than during the non-breeding season.
   4. Analysis also suggests that regulation of survival and recruitment by density varied over time. Our results showed that different characterizations of density regulations changed every 8-12 years (three times in the 25-year period) for our population.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Using a full annual cycle, modelling framework and model weighting routine will be helpful in evaluating density dependence for migratory species in both the short and long term. We used this method to disentangle the seasonal effects of density on the continental American black duck population which will allow managers to better evaluate the effects of habitat loss and potential habitat management actions throughout the annual cycle. The method here may allow researchers to hone in on the proper form and/or strength of density dependence for use in models for conservation recommendations.

AB Plant biomass consumers (mammalian herbivory and fire) are increasingly seen as major drivers of ecosystem structure and function but the prevailing paradigm in temperate forest ecology is still that their dynamics are mainly bottom-up resource-controlled. Using conceptual advances from savanna ecology, particularly the demographic bottleneck model, we present a novel view on temperate forest dynamics that integrates consumer and resource control.
   We used a fully factorial experiment, with varying levels of ungulate herbivory and resource (light) availability, to investigate how these factors shape recruitment of five temperate tree species. We ran simulations to project how inter-and intraspecific differences in height increment under the different experimental scenarios influence long-term recruitment of tree species.
   Strong herbivore-driven demographic bottlenecks occurred in our temperate forest system, and bottlenecks were as strong under resource-rich as under resource-poor conditions. Increased browsing by herbivores in resource-rich patches strongly counteracted the increased escape strength of saplings in these patches.
   This finding is a crucial extension of the demographic bottleneck model which assumes that increased resource availability allows plants to more easily escape consumer-driven bottlenecks. Our study demonstrates that a more dynamic understanding of consumer-resource interactions is necessary, where consumers and plants both respond to resource availability.

AB Drylands account globally for 30% of terrestrial net primary production and 20% of soil organic carbon. Present ecosystem models under predict litter decay in drylands, limiting assessments of biogeochemical cycling at multiple scales. Overlooked decomposition drivers, such as soil-litter mixing (SLM), may account for part of this model-measurement disconnect. We documented SLM and decomposition in relation to the formation of soil-microbial films and microbial extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) in the North American Chihuahuan Desert by placing mesh bags containing shrub (Prosopis glandulosa) foliar litter on the soil surface within contrasting vegetation microsites. Mass loss (in terms of k, the decay constant) was best described by the degree of SLM and soil-microbial film cover. EEA was greatest during periods of rapid litter decomposition and associated SLM. Soil-microbial film cover on litter surfaces increased over time and was greater in bare ground microsites (50% litter surface area covered) compared to shrub and grass microsites (37 and 33% covered, respectively). Soil aggregates that formed in association with decomposing leaf material had organic C and N concentrations 1.5-2x that of local surface soils. Micrographs of soil aggregates revealed a strong biotic component in their structure, suggesting that microbial decomposition facilitates aggregate formation and their C and N content. Decomposition drivers in arid lands fall into two major categories, abiotic and biotic, and it is challenging to ascertain their relative importance. The temporal synchrony between surface litter mass loss, EEA, biotic film development, and aggregate formation observed in this study supports the hypothesis that SLM enhances decomposition on detached litter by promoting conditions favorable for microbial processes. Inclusion of interactions between SLM and biological drivers will improve the ability of ecosystem models to predict decomposition rates and dynamics in drylands.

AB Foundation species are crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying faunal community structure. The present study aimed to clarify the habitat function of empty shells from dead oysters Saccostrea kegaki for the benthic faunal community of an intertidal rocky shore. We evaluated whether macroinvertebrates used the shells as a habitat. Results demonstrated that limpets (the dominant macroinvertebrates at the study site) did so more frequently than they inhabited live oysters, other sessile organisms, or rock surfaces. The dead oyster shells successfully functioned as a refuge from predation and as a nursery for limpets, because of their structural complexity (the presence of a depression on the inner side of the shell). Therefore, our study demonstrates the importance of dead S. kegaki, a shell-forming foundation species, and illustrates that the structural complexity of such species might result in habitat functions upon their death.

AB To explain diversity in forests, niche theory must show how multiple plant species coexist while competing for the same resources. Although successional processes are widespread in forests, theoretical work has suggested that differentiation in successional strategy allows only a few species stably to coexist, including only a single shade tolerant. However, this conclusion is based on current niche models, which encode a very simplified view of plant communities, suggesting that the potential for niche differentiation has remained unexplored. Here, we show how extending successional niche models to include features common to all vegetation-height-structured competition for light under a prevailing disturbance regime and two trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function-enhances the diversity of species that can be maintained, including a diversity of shade tolerants. We identify two distinct axes of potential niche differentiation, corresponding to the traits leaf mass per unit leaf area and height at maturation. The first axis allows for coexistence of different shade tolerances and the second axis for coexistence among species with the same shade tolerance. Addition of this second axis leads to communities with a high diversity of shade tolerants. Niche differentiation along the second axis also generates regions of trait space wherein fitness is almost equalized, an outcome we term "evolutionarily emergent near-neutrality." For different environmental conditions, our model predicts diverse vegetation types and trait mixtures, akin to observations. These results indicate that the outcomes of successional niche differentiation are richer than previously thought and potentially account for mixtures of traits and species observed in forests worldwide.

AB Deforestation in the tropics is not only responsible for direct carbon emissions but also extends the forest edge wherein trees suffer increased mortality. Here we combine high-resolution (30 m) satellite maps of forest cover with estimates of the edge effect and show that 19% of the remaining area of tropical forests lies within 100m of a forest edge. The tropics house around 50 million forest fragments and the length of the world's tropical forest edges sums to nearly 50 million km. Edge effects in tropical forests have caused an additional 10.3 Gt (2.1-14.4 Gt) of carbon emissions, which translates into 0.34 Gt per year and represents 31% of the currently estimated annual carbon releases due to tropical deforestation. Fragmentation substantially augments carbon emissions from tropical forests and must be taken into account when analysing the role of vegetation in the global carbon cycle.

   ANALYSIS
AB Reductions of zooplankton biomasses and grazing pressures were observed during overfishing-induced trophic cascades and concurrent oil spills at global scales. Recent phytoplankton increments followed, once Fe-, P-, and N-nutrient limitations of commensal diazotrophs and dinoflagellates were also eliminated by respective human desertification, deforestation, and eutrophication during climate changes. Si-limitation of diatoms instead ensued during these last anthropogenic perturbations of agricultural effluents and sewage loadings. Consequently, similar to 15% of total world-wide annual asthma trigger responses, i.e. amounting to similar to 45 million adjacent humans during 2004, resulted from brevetoxin and palytoxin poisons in aerosol forms of western boundary current origins. They were denoted by greater global harmful algal bloom[HAB] abundances and breathing attacks among sea-side children during prior decadal surveys of asthma prevalence, compiled here in ten paired shelf ecosystems of western and eutrophied boundary currents. Since 1965, such inferred onshore fluxes of aerosolized DOC poisons of HABs may have served as additional wind-borne organic carriers of toxic marine MeHg, phthalate, and DDT/DDE vectors, traced by radio-iodine isotopes to potentially elicit carcinomas. During these exchanges, as much as 40% of mercury poisonings may instead have been effected by inhalation of collateral HAB-carried marine neurotoxic aerosols of MeHg, not just from eating marine fish. Health impacts in some areas were additional asthma and pneumonia episodes, as well as endocrine disruptions among the same adjacent humans, with known large local rates of thyroid cancers, physician-diagnosed pulmonary problems, and ubiquitous high indices of mercury in hair, pesticides in breast milk, and phthalates in urine.

AB Growth and development of plants frequently are limited by multiple abiotic stresses that occur simultaneously in the environment. 'Cabruca' an agroforestry system is a main cropping system invariably adapted for cultivation of cacao in southern Bahia, Brazil. In this system of management, cacao is grown under the shade of native species of the Atlantic Forest. However, growing cacao under the shade of trees is still questionable due to higher incidence of pests and diseases and difficulty of evaporation of excess soil water in high rainfall periods that often causes flooding. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the performance of two clonal genotypes of cacao, contrasting for tolerance to soil flooding (TSA 792 - tolerant and TSH 774 - intolerant), subjected to four levels of light intensity and two water regimes, control and Hooded, in order to elucidate the mechanisms of tolerance to these stresses under 'Cabruca' environment. All the plants survived the period of flooding, however, with flooding stress visual symptoms like leaf chlorosis, lenticels hypertrophied on the stem base, and decomposition of roots were observed. Obtained results demonstrated morpho-physiological and molecular changes in response to low light intensity and low light intensity x soil flooding interaction. Significant effects (p < 0.05) of isolated factors, double interaction and inter- and intra-genotypic differences (p < 0.05) were observed for leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and growth parameters. Differences among light intensities, water regime, plant organ (p< 0.001), and for the interactions low light intensity x water regime and water regime x plant organ (p < 0.01) were observed with respect to total soluble sugar content. Isolated factors and double and triple interactions (p < 0.01) had significant effects on the starch accumulation. Triple interaction was also observed in the expression of genes coding for ADH, LDH and PDC enzymes and for aquaporin PIP1:2. Low light intensity interacts with soil flooding, limiting the damages caused by flooding in cacao plants under lowest light intensity. Flooding was the dominant factor for the most physiological responses observed during the interaction between light intensity and soil flooding whose physiological adjustments were different amoung the clonal cocoa genotypes assessed.

AB Food webs as representations of who eats whom are at the core of community ecology. Incorporation of tools from network theory enables assessment of how complex systems respond to natural and human-induced stressors, revealing how harvesting may degrade the properties and resilience of food webs. We present a comprehensive, coastal marine food web that includes 147 taxa cooccurring on shallow subtidal reefs along the highly productive and exploited Humboldt Current System of central Chile. This food web has connectance of 0.06, link density of 1204 and mean chain length of 4.3. The fractions of intermediate (76%), omnivorous (49%) and cannibalistic (8%) nodes are slightly lower than those observed in other marine food webs. Of the 147 nodes, 34 are harvested. Links to harvested nodes represented 50 to 100% of all trophic links of non-harvested nodes, illustrating the great impact that fishery pressure can have on the food web. The food web was compartmentalized into 5 sub-webs with high representation of harvested taxa. This structure changes if the fishery node is removed. Similarity analyses identified groups of harvested species with non-harvested nodes, suggesting that these tropho-equivalents could be sentinel species for the community-wide impacts of coastal fisheries. We conclude that fishing effects can be transmitted throughout the food web, with no compartments completely unaffected by harvesting. It is urgent to establish monitoring programs for community-wide effects of fisheries and assess whether resilience of these highly productive subtidal food webs has al ready been compromised, thereby identifying essential nodes that require stronger fisheries regulation.

AB Environmental filtering consistently shapes the functional and phylogenetic structure of species across space within diverse forests. However, poor descriptions of community functional and lineage distributions across space hamper the accurate understanding of coexistence mechanisms. We combined environmental variables and geographic space to explore how traits and lineages are filtered by environmental factors using extended RLQ and fourth-corner analyses across different spatial scales. The dispersion patterns of traits and lineages were also examined in a 20-ha tropical rainforest dynamics plot in southwest China. We found that environmental filtering was detected across all spatial scales except the largest scale (100 x 100 m). Generally, the associations between functional traits and environmental variables were more or less consistent across spatial scales. Species with high resource acquisition-related traits were associated with the resource-rich part of the plot across the different spatial scales, whereas resource-conserving functional traits were distributed in limited-resource environments. Furthermore, we found phylogenetic and functional clustering at all spatial scales. Similar functional strategies were also detected among distantly related species, suggesting that phylogenetic distance is not necessarily a proxy for functional distance. In summary, environmental filtering considerably structured the trait and lineage assemblages in this species-rich tropical rainforest.

TI Impacts of future deforestation and climate change on the hydrology of
   the Amazon Basin: a multi-model analysis with a new set of land-cover
   change scenarios

AB Deforestation in Amazon is expected to decrease evapotranspiration (ET) and to increase soil moisture and river discharge under prevailing energy-limited conditions. The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depend both on the magnitude and regional patterns of land-cover change (LCC), as well as on climate change and CO2 levels. On the one hand, elevated CO2 decreases leaf-scale transpiration, but this effect could be offset by increased foliar area density. Using three regional LCC scenarios specifically established for the Brazilian and Boli-vian Amazon, we investigate the impacts of climate change and deforestation on the surface hydrology of the Amazon Basin for this century, taking 2009 as a reference. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmLDGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three general circulation models (GCMs) of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). On average, over the Amazon Basin with no deforestation, the GCM results indicate a temperature increase of 3.3 degrees C by 2100 which drives up the evaporative demand, whereby precipitation increases by 8.5%, with a large uncertainty across GCMs. In the case of no deforestation, we found that ET and runoff increase by 5.0 and 14 %, respectively. However, in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10% at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs produce a 6% decrease of ET, which is less than precipitation, so that runoff decreases by 22%. For instance, the minimum river discharge of the Rio Tapajos is reduced by 31% in 2100. To study the additional effect of deforestation, we prescribed to the LSMs three contrasted LCC scenarios, with a forest decline going from 7 to 34% over this century. All three scenarios partly offset the climate-induced increase of ET, and runoff increases over the entire Amazon. In the southeast, however, deforestation amplifies the decrease of ET at the end of dry season, leading to a large increase of runoff (up to + 27% in the extreme deforestation case), offsetting the negative effect of climate change, thus balancing the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapajos. These projections are associated with large uncertainties, which we attribute separately to the differences in LSMs, GCMs and to the uncertain range of deforestation. At the subcatchment scale, the uncertainty range on ET changes is shown to first depend on GCMs, while the uncertainty of runoff projections is predominantly induced by LSM structural differences. By contrast, we found that the uncertainty in both ET and runoff changes attributable to uncertain future deforestation is low.

AB Nitrogen (N) cycling in drylands under changing climate is not well understood. Our understanding of N cycling over larger scales to date relies heavily on the measurement of bulk soil N, and the information about internal soil N transformations remains limited. The N-15 natural abundance (delta N-15) of ammonium and nitrate can serve as a proxy record for the N processes in soils. To better understand the patterns and mechanisms of N cycling in drylands, we collected soils along a 3200 km transect at about 100 km intervals in northern China, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranging from 36 to 436 mm. We analyzed N pools and delta N-15 of ammonium, dual isotopes (N-15 and O-18) of nitrate, and the microbial gene abundance associated with soil N transformations. We found that N status and its driving factors were different above and below a MAP threshold of 100 mm. In the arid zone with MAP below 100 mm, soil inorganic N accumulated, with a large fraction being of atmospheric origin, and ammonia volatilization was strong in soils with high pH. In addition, the abundance of microbial genes associated with soil N transformations was low. In the semiarid zone with MAP above 100 mm, soil inorganic N concentrations were low and were controlled mainly by biological processes (e.g., plant uptake and denitrification). The preference for soil ammonium over nitrate by the dominant plant species may enhance the possibility of soil nitrate losses via denitrification. Overall, our study suggests that a shift from abiotic to biotic controls on soil N biogeochemistry under global climate changes would greatly affect N losses, soil N availability, and other N transformation processes in these drylands in China.

AB Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are ecosystems with long drought periods, a mean temperature of 25 degrees C, a mean annual precipitation that ranges from 900 to 2000 mm, and that possess a high abundance of deciduous species (trees and lianas). What remains of the original extent of TDFs in the Americas remains highly fragmented and at different levels of ecological succession. It is estimated that one of the main fingerprints left by global environmental and climate change in tropical environments is an increase in liana coverage. Lianas are non-structural elements of the forest canopy that eventually kill their host trees. In this paper we evaluate the use of a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) in combination with hemispherical photographs (HPs) to characterize changes in forest structure as a function of ecological succession and liana abundance. We deployed a TLS and HP system in 28 plots throughout secondary forests of different ages and with different levels of liana abundance. Using a canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we addressed how the VEGNET, a terrestrial laser scanner, and HPs could predict TDF structure. Likewise, using univariate analyses of correlations, we show how the liana abundance could affect the prediction of the forest structure. Our results suggest that TLSs and HPs can predict the differences in the forest structure at different successional stages but that these differences disappear as liana abundance increases. Therefore, in well known ecosystems such as the tropical dry forest of Costa Rica, these biases of prediction could be considered as structural effects of liana presence. This research contributes to the understanding of the potential effects of lianas in secondary dry forests and highlights the role of TLSs combined with HPs in monitoring structural changes in secondary TDFs.

AB Dams are important to human wellbeing; however, they can cause various environmental changes. In the cerrado stricto sensu, waters from the reservoir modify water supply in the soil and can affect species establishment. It is argued that species adapted to high water availability can establish close to river banks and water reservoirs and their characteristics are different from those of species from the cerrado stricto sensu. These characteristics could be more similar to those of species from riparian forests, with higher values of height and basal area. Thus, we aim to analyze changes in an area of the cerrado stricto sensu, 35 years after the construction of a hydroelectric dam. We tested different parameters to determine these changes, including richness, diversity, individual height and basal area (using the square-point method), with individuals <1 m, individuals >1 m, and Bromeliaceae (using the plot method) in three sectors close to the artificial lakeshore (0 m - 20 m, 40 m - 60 m, and 80 m - 100 m away from the water). Using species diversity, we also compared the species functional group within these sectors. Sectors closer to the dam acted as an edge, presenting lower basal area and individual's height, but species with different traits compared to those of a cerrado stricto sensu area.

AB Studies of the dynamics in vegetal communities are essential to understand the cerrado ecology's behavior, especially considering its wide geographical distribution and heterogeneity. This kind of study helps to comprehend the mechanisms that maintain the community, generating subsidies for its conservation. This study aimed to analyze the tree community's dynamics over five years in a cerrado sensu stricto swath of 87ha. It wass protected from fire for about 30 years and is located in the municipality of Olhos-d'Agua, North of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The assumed hypothesis was that the period of protection from fire was sufficient for the community to stabilize its dynamics and thus, to compose a mature structure. The data obtained refer to 24 permanent plots of 1.000 m(2) ( total of 2.4 ha), where all trees with diameter at breast high 1.30 above the soil (DBH) >= 5 cm were marked, measured and sampled in the years 2005 and 2010. The changes in the phytosociological structure were analyzed and the mortality and recruitment rates were estimated basing on the density, gain and loss in basal area, stability and turnover times, and the periodic annual increment of the community and populations. This cerrado area presented a dynamic balance, with little variation in floristic composition and phytosociological and the structuring of the woody component had increased relatively. The populations' growth that is sensitive to fire suggests an ecological succession influenced by the absence of fire.

AB Mulch on the soil surface is an effective practice for conserving soil moisture. In this study, we assessed the effects of aggregate mulches created by burrowing ants (Camponotus japonicus) on soil evaporation and temperature. A series of simulation experiments were conducted using buckets (20 cm diameter x 20 cm height) filled with loess soil (7.3 kg). Seven ant populations (0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, and 200) and four mulch thicknesses (0 [bare soil], 3, 6, and 9 mm) were used to evaluate the effects of ant abundance and mulch thickness on soil evaporation rates and temperature. The evaporation rate and temperature were measured with an electronic scale (with 1 g precision) and electronic thermometers (with 0.1 degrees C precision). The number of aggregates was linearly correlated with the number of introduced ants (R-2 = 0.8927). A negative relationship existed between the soil evaporation rate and a mulch thickness of 0 to 9 mm when the soil moisture was higher than 8.4%. Furthermore, the function of aggregate mulches on restraining evaporation was highest between 1130 and 1330 h on sunny days. When the solar radiation and the soil moisture were at a low level, minimal difference was observed in the evaporation rates among the treatments. For the soil temperature, aggregate mulches were more sensitive to the intercepted heat, resulting in higher temperatures on the mulch surface than on the bare soil. Moreover, the effects of the aggregate mulches on soil evaporation and temperature were weakened when the aggregates disintegrated. The findings in this research are helpful for understanding the evaporation process in loess soils with burrowing ants. Maintaining a large number of burrowing ants or a relative constant cover of ant-derived aggregates on the soil surface could restrict soil evaporation.

AB Information on the taxonomic composition and conservation status of the semi-evergreen tropical forest in the state of Hidalgo is limited and descriptive, and disturbances caused by human activities are drastically affecting its structure and original physiognomy. For these reasons, the objectives of this study were: 1) to conduct an inventory of the tree flora, and 2) to provide quantitative data on the structure of the different semi-evergreen tropical forest successional stages. The floristic inventory and structural characterization were conducted in 9 localities of Huautla municipality, in the "Huasteca hidalguense". In each locality, the basal area, frequency, density of individuals (normal diameter > 10 cm) and relative importance value of each species were calculated. A total of 92 species, 76 genera and 31 families of trees were identified. The families Fabaceae, Malvaceae and Moraceae were the most representative for their species richness. The species with highest relative importance value were Adelia barbinervis and Cedrela odorata in early stages of succession, Bursera simaruba and Guazuma ulmifolia in intermediate stages and Brosimum alicastrum in mature stages. In few localities, mature vegetation was observed, and total tree species richness was comparable with that recorded in the same type of vegetation in other entities of Mexico.

AB Through different policies and measures reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation and enhancing conservation (REDD+) has grown into a way to induce behavior change of forest managers and landowners in tropical countries. We argue that debates around REDD+ in Brazil have typically highlighted rewards and punishments, obscuring other core interventions and strategies that are also critically important to reach the goal of reducing deforestation, supporting livelihoods, and promoting conservation (i.e., technology transfer and capacity building). We adopt Foucault's concepts of governmentality and technologies of governance to provide a reading of the REDD+ discourse in Brazil and to offer an historical genealogy of the rewards and punishments approach. By analyzing practical elements from REDD+ implementation in the Brazilian Amazon, our research provides insights on the different dimensions in which smallholders react to rewards and punishments. In doing so, we add to the debate on governmentality, supplementing its focus on rationalities of governance with attention to the social practices in which such rationalities are embedded. Our research also suggests that the techniques of remuneration and coercion on which a rewards and punishments approach relies are only supporting limited behavioral changes on the ground, generating negative adaptations of deforestation practices, reducing positive feedbacks and, perhaps as importantly, producing only short-term outcomes at the expense of positive long-term land use changes. Furthermore, the approach ignores local heterogeneities and the differences between the agents engaging in forest clearing in the Amazon. The practical elements of the REDD+ discourse in Brazil suggest the rewards and punishments approach profoundly limits our understanding of human behavior by reducing the complex and multi-dimensional to a linear and rational simplicity. Such simplification leads to an underestimation of smallholders' capacity to play a key role in climate mitigation and adaptation. We conclude by highlighting the importance of looking at local heterogeneities and capacities and the need to promote trust, altruism and responsibility towards others and future generations.

AB Inter-tree competition is considered one of the most important ecological processes of forest development. However, its importance in structuring the spatial patterns of plant communities remains controversial. We collected observational data from two plots in a natural Mongolian Scots pine forest to study the contribution of competition to tree growth, mortality, and size inequality. We used the nearest neighbour method to determine the presence of competition, and unmarked and marked spatial point pattern analyses to test the density-dependent mortality effects and the spatial autocorrelation of tree size. We identified significant positive correlations between tree canopy diameter and nearest neighbour distance in both plots, which were more evident in the denser plot. The pair correlation functions of both plots indicated regular distribution patterns of living trees, and trees living in more crowded environments were more likely to die. However, the mark differentiation characteristics showed weak evidence of a negative spatial autocorrelation in tree size, particularly in the high-density plot. The high mortality rate of suppressed trees and weak asymmetric competition may have accounted for the lack of dissimilarity in tree size. This study showed that inter-tree competition is an important determinant of the development of Mongolian Scots pine forests.

AB This article provides a first rough sketch of how to conceptualize countries' present and historical contributions to the loss of global ecosystem services, i.e., ecosystem services of which the delivery is global and omnidirectional, and discusses the implications of questions concerning the international distribution of responsibilities. On the basis of limited empirical data about past and present land conversion, some first calculations suggest that keeping converted land in a converted state, thus preventing ecosystems recovery, may contribute more to current loss of global ecosystem services than new conversion of ecosystems. Moreover, many developing countries in the tropics may contribute more to the loss of global ecosystem services, in both absolute terms and per capita, than many developed countries in temperate zones. This would make finding an equitable arrangement for international allocation of responsibilities for biological conservation far more complex than for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, raising new and challenging questions for normative theorists.

AB Deforestation in Amazon forests is one of the main causes for biodiversity loss worldwide. Ants are key into the ecosystem because act like engineers; hence, the loss of ants' biodiversity may be a guide to measure the loss of essential functions into the ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate soil ant's richness and to estimate whether higher taxa levels (Subfamily and Genus) can be used as surrogates of species richness in different vegetation types (fallows, old -growth forests and agroforestry systems) in Eastern Amazon. The samples were taken in 65 areas in the Maranhao and Para States in the period 2011-2014. The sampling scheme followed the procedure of Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF). Initially, the vegetation types were characterized according to their age and estimated species richness. Linear and exponential functions were applied to evaluate if higher taxa can be used as surrogates and correlated with the Pearson coefficient. In total, 180 species distributed in 60 genera were identified. The results showed that ant species richness was higher in intermediate fallows (88) and old secondary forest (76), and was lower in agroforestry systems (38) and mature riparian forest (35). The genus level was the best surrogate to estimate the ant's species richness across the different vegetation types, and explained 72-97 % (P < 0.001) of the total species variability. The results confirmed that the genus level is an excellent surrogate to estimate the ant's species richness in the region and that both fallows and agroforestry systems may contribute in the conservation of Eastem Amazon ant community.

AB About 30 plant species occur at high latitudes in both hemispheres, thus achieving a so-called bipolar distribution. Six of these species belong to Carex, of which just one, Carex canescens, occurs on two different landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere (South America and Oceania). The goals of this study are (1) to test the various hypotheses accounting for the bipolar disjunction of C. canescens and (2) to elucidate if C. canescens migrated twice from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere or if it dispersed from South America to Oceania (or vice versa). We obtained and analysed DNA sequences from the nuclear internal and external transcribed spacers (ITS and ETS) and from the plastid 5' trnK and rps16 introns from 57 populations of C. canescens spanning its bipolar range. We characterized the species distribution climatically by adding 1995 presence data points from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Our results suggest a Northern Hemisphere origin of C. canescens during the Pleistocene and two independent long distance-dispersal events to South America and Australia, by either direct dispersal or mountain-hopping. Long-distance dispersal appears to be the most widespread process resulting in the bipolar distribution of Carex spp.

AB There is accumulating evidence of the significant role of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) for ecosystem structure and functioning in coastal areas of the Baltic Sea, but little is known about the role of the species in the pelagic foodwebs of the Baltic and its interaction with other planktivorous fish species. In this study, we assess the feeding niche, diet overlap, and prey selectivity of sticklebacks, herring (Clupea harengus), and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) in an area of the southwest Baltic Sea (Kalmar Sound) in relation to the seasonal abundance of zooplanktonic prey during 2009-2011. The main prey items for all fish species studied were the calanoid copepods Eurytemora affinis, Temora longicornis, and Acartia spp. during spring and summer, and the cladoceran Bosmina spp in autumn. The diet of all the three fish species overlapped considerably, especially during summer and autumn. A substantial diet overlap was even present between sticklebacks and larger (> 10 cm) herring and sprat. We also found evidence for an overlap in feeding preferences, i.e. certain zooplankton species were selected by all the three fish species in each given season. Overall, these results indicate potential resource competition between sticklebacks and clupeids. With an increasing abundance of sticklebacks in the Baltic Sea, their role should not be neglected when investigating pelagic foodweb dynamics, and management of herring and sprat may have to account for sticklebacks by considering that sticklebacks, via food competition, might affect clupeid stocks.

AB While natural resource exploration and extraction activity is expanding in the Neotropics, our understanding of wildlife response to such activity is almost non-existent. Primates, which fulfill important ecological roles and face numerous anthropogenic threats, are of particular concern. We studied primate group distribution before, during, and after natural gas pipeline construction in the Peruvian Amazon to investigate whether primates spatially avoid areas of disturbance. We monitored primates on eight transects 20 times per annual sampling period in three consecutive years and analyzed changes in group observations relative to the pipeline right-of-way in a multi-season occupancy modeling framework. Overall primate group encounter rates were low (<half) compared to a nearby protected area. Contrary to expectations, we did not see clear evidence of spatial avoidance of the pipeline area. Although higher overall encounter rates before construction suggested lower primate use of the area during and following construction, this pattern could not be confirmed statistically, and probability of colonization and extinction of transect sections in the occupancy analysis could not be differentiated from zero. These results are probably attributable to a combination of low numbers of primate encounters and high spatial variability in primate use of different transects. This study provides valuable preliminary data and a methodological framework for understanding the response of an ecologically important group of mammals to anthropogenic activity. We encourage other researchers to continue exploring the impacts of natural resource exploration- and extraction-related activities in the tropics, as such activities are likely to have a growing effect on ecosystems.
   Resumen Mientras que las actividades de exploracion y extraccion de recursos naturales se expanden en el Neotropico, nuestro entendimiento de las respuestas de la vida silvestre a dicho tipo de actividades es casi inexistente. Los primates, que cumplen importantes roles ecologicos y enfrentan numerosas amenazas antropogenicas, son un grupo de especial preocupacion. Estudiamos la distribucion de grupos de primates antes, durante y despues de la construccion de un gaseoducto en la Amazonia peruana para investigar si los primates evitan espacialmente las areas de mayor perturbacion, ya sea en el corto o largo plazo. Monitoreamos especies de primates en ocho transectos, 20 veces por ano, durante tres anos consecutivos y analizamos los cambios en las observaciones de los grupos en relacion al derecho de via del gaseoducto bajo un marco teorico de modelos de ocupacion multi-estacional. En general, la tasas de encuentro de los grupos de primates fueron bajas (menos de la mitad) en comparacion a las reportadas para un area protegida cercana, y contrario a lo esperado, no encontramos evidencia clara de evasion espacial del area de impacto a lo largo de los transectos de estudio. A pesar que las altas tasas de encuentro antes de la construccion sugirieron menor uso del area por parte de los primates durante y despues de la construccion, este patron no pudo ser confirmado estadisticamente. Asimismo, la probabilidad de colonizacion y extincion de las secciones de los transectos en el analisis de ocupacion no pudo ser diferenciada de cero. Esto es, probablemente debido a la combinacion de un bajo numero de encuentros de grupos de primates y una alta variabilidad espacial de los primates en el uso de los diferentes transectos. Este estudio provee valiosos datos preliminares y un marco metodologico para comprender las respuestas de un grupo ecologicamente importante de mamiferos Neotropicales a actividades antropogenicas. Invitamos a otros investigadores a continuar explorando los impactos de la construccion de gaseoductos y de otras actividades de exploracion y extraccion de recursos naturales en la flora y fauna tropical ya que dichas actividades pueden incrementar su efecto en los ecosistemas tropicales.

AB Specialist herbivores and pathogens could induce negative conspecific density dependence among their hosts and thereby contribute to the diversity of plant communities. A small number of hyperdiverse genera comprise a large portion of tree diversity in tropical forests. These closely related congeners are likely to share natural enemies. Diverse defenses could still allow congeners to partition niche space defined by natural enemies, but interspecific differences in defenses would have to exceed intraspecific variation in defenses. We ask whether interspecific variation in secondary chemistry exceeds intraspecific variation for species from four hyperdiverse tropical tree genera. We used novel methods to quantify chemical structural similarity for all compounds present in methanol extracts of leaf tissue. We sought to maximize intraspecific variation by selecting conspecific leaves from different ontogenetic stages (expanding immature vs. fully hardened mature), different light environments (deep under-story shade vs. large forest gaps), and different seasons (dry vs. wet). Chemical structural similarity differed with ontogeny, light environment, and season, but interspecific differences including those among congeneric species were much larger. Our results suggest that species differences in secondary chemistry are large relative to within-species variation, perhaps sufficiently large to permit niche segregation among congeneric tree species based on chemical defenses.

AB Seed dispersal is a key ecological process in tropical forests, with effects on various levels ranging from plant reproductive success to the carbon storage potential of tropical rainforests. On a local and landscape scale, spatial patterns of seed dispersal create the template for the recruitment process and thus influence the population dynamics of plant species. The strength of this influence will depend on the long-term consistency of spatial patterns of seed dispersal. We examined the long-term consistency of spatial patterns of seed dispersal with spatially explicit data on seed dispersal by two neotropical primate species, Leontocebus nigrifrons and Saguinus mystax (Callitrichidae), collected during four independent studies between 1994 and 2013. Using distributions of dispersal probability over distances independent of plant species, cumulative dispersal distances, and kernel density estimates, we show that spatial patterns of seed dispersal are highly consistent over time. For a specific plant species, the legume Parkia panurensis, the convergence of cumulative distributions at a distance of 300 m, and the high probability of dispersal within 100 m from source trees coincide with the dimension of the spatial-genetic structure on the embryo/juvenile (300 m) and adult stage (100 m), respectively, of this plant species. Our results are the first demonstration of long-term consistency of spatial patterns of seed dispersal created by tropical frugivores. Such consistency may translate into idiosyncratic patterns of regeneration.

AB Some species-rich secondary forests in New Caledonia have a monodominant canopy. Here we investigate growth and biomass allocation traits that might explain single-species' dominance of these post-disturbance stands, and their later decline in the absence of large-scale disturbance. Seedlings of 20 rain-forest trees were grown in two light treatments in a nursery house. In the sun treatment, monodominants grew faster (56.7 +/- 1.4 mg g(-1) wk(-1)) than subordinates (40.2 +/- 2.6 mg g(-1) wk(-1)). However, some episodically regenerating (ER) subordinates had high growth rates similar to those of monodominants. In the shade treatment, monodominants and subordinates had similar growth rates (33.7 +/- 2.6 and 34.0 +/- 1.9 mg g(-1) wk(-1) respectively). Notably, monodominants in both sun and shade treatments had lower root mass fraction (0.29 +/- 0.02 and 0.27 +/- 0.02 g g(-1) respectively) than subordinates (0.39 +/- 0.02 and 0.37 +/- 0.02 g g(-1)). Fast growth in sunny conditions is probably imperative for these relatively shade-intolerant ER monodominants. In field conditions, high shoot mass fraction combined with efficient root performance may facilitate faster growth in monodominants competing with other ER species in sunlit sites. Slower growth in shade may contribute to loss of dominance over time in undisturbed forests.

AB We studied lianas in a subtropical wet forest in Puerto Rico to understand how hurricane impacts and past human land-uses interact to affect liana dynamics over a 14-year period. We compared a high-intensity land-use area, where the forest that had been cleared, and used for subsistence agriculture before being abandoned in 1934 then regrew to a low-intensity land-use area, in which there had been only some selective experimental logging by the USDA Forest Service in the 1940s. Prior to our study, both areas were strongly affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and again damaged to a lesser degree by Hurricane Georges in 1998, increasing canopy openness and subsequently increasing tree stem densities. Between 2001 and 2015, changes in the light environment and the recovery of forest structure resulted in roughly a 50% reduction in tree stem densities in the high-intensity land-use area, as recruited saplings naturally thinned. In this area, liana abundance increased by 103%, liana biomass tripled, and occupancy of trees by lianas grew by nearly 50%. In the low-intensity land-use area, juvenile stem densities were stable, and resultantly liana abundance only increased by 33%, liana biomass rose 39%, and the occupancy of trees was constant. Liana flower and fruit production increased over the 14-year interval, and these increases were much greater in the high-intensity land-use quadrats. Results of this study do show how rapid forest tree successional dynamics coincide with liana increases, but the confounding of hurricane effects of disturbance at our site, prevent us from asserting that the increases in liana density and biomass can be attributed to the same causes as those in forests elsewhere in the Neotropics.

AB Plant tolerance to herbivory is contingent on multiple traits and adaptive mechanisms, which makes it a complex response with ecological implications. In plants with longterm belowground storage, allocation of biomass to inaccessible parts belowground in response to folivory is a wellrecognized tolerance mechanism. In temperate regions, spring growth from buried rootstock is common among winter deciduous plants and is often followed by regrowth after defoliation, both of which draws resources from the stored reserves. We developed a mathematical model to analyze this tolerance response in a winter deciduous plant with long-term belowground biomass when it is defoliated by a specialist insect folivore. The model explores how three closely associated traits-(1) belowground biomass allocation to roots, (2) spring utilization of stored reserves, and (3) post-defoliation regrowth capacity-modulate the persistence and dynamics of the plant and herbivore populations. Model results show that allocation to belowground storage is not only a critical component of tolerance but also influences the herbivore population dynamics in ways that depend on how and when plant biomass is allocated and used. Low belowground biomass allocation and high storage utilization combined with poor photosynthetic growth caused extirpation of the plant population by the defoliating insects. Stable coexistence of the plant at low biomass along with its specialist insect required a moderate amount of post-herbivory belowground allocation. High values of belowground biomass allocation, storage utilization, and photosynthetic growth resulted in sustained cycles of the herbivore and plant populations. Interestingly, utilization of stored reserves had conflicting influence on above and belowground biomass, and strongly affected herbivore population dynamics. Our model thus highlights the complexity of tolerance response when it involves multiple traits and mechanisms as evinced by winter deciduous plants. We close by discussing the implications of our findings for the contributions of defoliating insects to biocontrol programs.

AB Understanding the dynamics of multi-type microbial ecosystems remains a challenge, despite advancing molecular technologies for diversity resolution within and between hosts. Analytical progress becomes difficult when modelling realistic levels of community richness, relying on computationally- intensive simulations and detailed parametrisation. Simplification of dynamics in polymorphic pathogen systems is possible using aggregationmethods and the slow-fast dynamics approach. Here, we develop one new such framework, tailored to the epidemiology of an endemic multi-strain pathogen. We apply Goldstone's idea of slow dynamics resulting from spontaneously broken symmetries to study direct interactions in co-colonization, ranging from competition to facilitation between strains. The slow-fast dynamics approach interpolates between a neutral and nonneutral model for multi-strain coexistence, and quantifies the asymmetries that are important for the maintenance and stabilisation of diversity.

AB Bidens frondosa is a new invasive species in China. However, the mechanisms underlying its invasiveness are still not understood. This study compared the new invader with its invasive congener, Bidens pilosa, and two native congeners, Bidens biternata and Bidens tripartita, in terms of their morphology, growth, biomass allocation and photosynthetic parameters across variant light and water conditions, aiming to explore the traits that are associated with the invasiveness of the invasive species. All these species are annual herbs. The results showed that the four congeners had a similar tendency of plasticity in their morphological and growth traits to varying light and water, but their response was quantitatively different. Most of the morphological and growing variables, as well as the photosynthetic parameters, were affected more strongly by manipulated light levels. Although B. frondosa had a lower total biomass and relative growth rate than the invasive congener, B. pilosa, the trait values related to growth (e.g. plant height, total biomass, relative growth rate and specific leaf area) and the mean value of the plasticity index were higher for the invasive B. frondosa than for the native B. tripartita. These could contribute to the invasiveness of the invasive species. In addition, the native species, B. biternata, is a vigorous weed with a strong adaptive capacity across various light and water gradients, suggesting that it has the potential to be invasive if introduced into areas with suitable conditions for growth.

AB Agri-environmental incentive programmes encourage conversion of marginal agricultural land to grasslands to reduce soil erosion and support biodiversity of native flora and fauna. Most grassland animals colonise these constructed habitats as propagules from the surrounding landscape. Ants are slow to colonise and rely on resources within the patch, making them valuable as indicators of disturbance and recovery. We studied how ant species diversity and composition are structured by patch and landscape variation of grasslands in Ohio, USA. Ant communities were collected from 23 constructed grasslands differing in area, age, vegetation, soils, management and surrounding land cover. We analysed trap frequency for 14 species that varied in habitat specialisation to identify species responses to patch- and landscape-level predictors. Grassland age and soil texture determined ant species richness and community composition. Trap frequency analysis showed contrasting species responses to patch and landscape characteristics: habitat specialists were more abundant in older, larger patches with more surrounding grassland, while disturbance-tolerant species were more frequent in younger patches surrounded by intensive agriculture. Habitat generalists and open habitat species included a variety of patch- and landscape-level factors in best models. Ant community assembly in constructed grasslands is shaped by time and physical characteristics at the patch-level, but the surrounding landscape acts as a filter for the colonising community. Our findings support the use of ants as ecosystem recovery indicators following disturbance in agricultural landscapes, but show that shifts in species composition are better indicators of grassland habitat variation than ant richness.

AB The distributional data of mammalian fauna are important to reach a comprehensive overview of biogeographic patterns and to highlight regional conservation status, especially in a poorly known region such as the Chiquitano dry forest in western Brazil. Our aims were to survey the mammal species occurring in the Urucum Mountains, located in the southeast end of the Chiquitano forest, compare its species composition to areas elsewhere in different ecoregions, and discuss their conservation statuses. Small mammals were sampled using pitfall and live traps, and medium and large mammals were sampled by direct observation, indirect evidence (e.g. faeces and tracks), and camera traps. Patterns of species composition were compared to other surrounding areas of different ecoregions in South America using multivariate analyses. The results indicated that both faunas have similar biogeographical influences. The Urucum Mountains have an influence on the faunas from the Cerrado, Chaco and Pantanal ecoregions, and only secondarily from forested ecoregions (e.g. Amazon forest). The Urucum harbours a rich non-volant mammalian fauna with species that are widely and restrictedly distributed. The conservation of Urucum Mountains is important because these mountains harbour threatened plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate (mammals) species, which could be suffering due to the mining activity carried out in the region. We stress that the Chiquitano dry forest is unique to western Brazil, situated in a complex biogeographical region, and harbouring a rich and diversified mammal fauna.

AB Most ecological theories that aim to explain coexistence in megadiverse communities employ a set of three rules to describe the stochastic geometry of biodiversity: (i) individuals exhibit intraspecific clustering; (ii) species abundances vary according to a log-normal distribution and (iii) the spatial arrangement between species is independent. The first two rules have received strong empirical support, but the third remains largely unexplored.
   To address this deficiency, we evaluated the independent species arrangement rule in a species-rich shrubland and its potential drivers, that is, the levels of species richness and intraspecific clustering exhibited by a given species at different scales, and the relative abundance of such species in the community.
   We found that interspecific associations were rare and that independence was positively related to species richness and intraspecific clustering, but negatively related to relative species abundances.
   Synthesis. Our results agree with the independent species arrangement rule and they provide empirical support for the stochastic geometry of biodiversity. In the context of species-rich plant communities, the likelihood of two species encountering is very small. However, our study demonstrated a novel feature of this context, where both intraspecific clustering (due limitations on dispersal) and relative species abundances play fundamental roles in determining the probability of two species encountering and interacting, especially at very fine spatial scales.

AB There is a profound absence of knowledge of infestation prevalence and host-use by mistletoes of mature South American tropical rainforests. In this study, we fill this gap using information gathered from felled trees at a logging concession area in Amazonian Brazil. We sampled individuals of 18 tree species, which occurred in two forest physiognomies; open forest with canopy interrupted by palm trees and closed, denser forest, with emergent trees. We hypothesized that infection incidence would be higher in open than in closed forest, irrespective of the mistletoe species involved. In addition, we expected that mistletoe parasitism would be higher on host species that were more abundant, taller, deciduous, and had less dense wood. We sampled 870 individual trees in both sites combined. All but one host species was infected by at least one species of mistletoe. We found 13 mistletoe species/morphospecies, Loranthaceae (7) and Viscaceae (6), parasitizing very different hosts. Mistletoe infection incidence was higher in the closed forest (10.3%) than in the open forest (5.4%). In the closed forest, host height influenced incidence positively, while deciduousness had a negative influence. Our results show that mistletoes are common in the canopy of pristine tropical forests and, contrary to expectations, that infection incidence was higher in the closed forest. The positive relation between infection incidence and host height in this forest type suggests that emergent trees have higher chances of being infected than individuals of correspondent species in the lower forest layers.

AB Macroevolutionary theory posits three processes leading to lineage diversification and the formation of regional biotas: dispersal (species geographic range expansion), speciation (species lineage splitting), and extinction (species lineage termination). The Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) predicts species richness values using just two of these processes; dispersal and extinction. Yetmost species on Earth live on continents or continental shelves, and the dynamics of evolutionary diversification at regional and continental scales are qualitatively different from those that govern the formation of species richness on biogeographic islands. Certain geomorphological processes operating perennially on continental platforms displace barriers to gene flow and organismal dispersal, and affect all three terms of macroevolutionary diversification. For example, uplift of a dissected landscape and river capture both merge and separate portions of adjacent areas, allowing dispersal and larger geographic ranges, vicariant speciation and smaller geographic ranges, and extinction when range sizes are subdivided below a minimum persistence threshold. The TIB also does not predict many biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns widely observed in continentally distributed taxa, including: (i) power function-like species-area relationships; (ii) log-normal distribution of species geographic range sizes, in which most species have restricted ranges (are endemic) and few species have broad ranges (are cosmopolitan); (iii) mid-domain effects withmore species toward the geographic center, and more early-branching, species-poor clades toward the geographic periphery; (iv) exponential rates of net diversification with log-linear accumulation of lineages through geological time; and (v) power function-like relationships between species-richness and clade diversity, in which most clades are species-poor and few clades are species-rich. Current theory does not provide a robust mechanistic framework to connect these seemingly disparate patterns. Here we present SEAMLESS (Spatially Explicit Area Model of Landscape Evolution by SimulationS) that generates clade diversification by moving geographic barriers on a continuous, neutral landscape. SEAMLESS is a neutral Landscape Evolution Model (LEM) that treats species and barriers as functionally equivalent with respect to model parameters. SEAMLESS differs from other model based biogeographic methods (e.g., Lagrange, GeoSSE, BayArea, and BioGeoBEARS) by modeling properties of dispersal barriers rather than areas, and by modeling the evolution of species lineages on a continuous landscape, rather than the evolution of geographic ranges along branches of a phylogeny. SEAMLESS shows how dispersal is required to maintain species richness and avoid clade-wide extinction, demonstrates that ancestral range size does not predict species richness, and provides a unified explanation for the suite of commonly observed biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns listed above. SEAMLESS explains how a simple barrier-displacement mechanism affects lineage diversification under neutral conditions, and is advanced here toward the formulation of a general theory of continental biogeography.

AB To investigate the woody species composition, diversity and structure of Kuandisha Afromontane forest, vegetation and environmental data were collected from 53 plots of 10 m x 50 m for trees and shrubs and 265 subplots of 2 m x 4 m for seedlings were laid along eight transect lines. The local name, scientific name, abundance, DBH, height and percentage foliage cover of species were recorded. Environmental variables, namely altitude, latitude and longitude as well as disturbance levels were also recorded in each plot. Structure, basal area, importance value index (IVI) and species prioritization were analyzed using spreadsheet programs. Correlation coefficients, frequency, relative frequency, Shannon diversity index, Shannon evenness and vegetation classification were analyzed using an R package. Sixty-six species belonging to 40 families were recorded. Fabaceae was the most diverse family consisting of seven species, followed by Euphorbiaceae and Asteraceae. In terms of habit, 29 species were trees, 28 were shrubs, and 9 were lianas. The overall Shannon diversity index was 2.5. The frequency and relative frequency of woody species with DBH >= 2.5 cm ranged from 1.9 to 92.5 and 0.1 to 5, respectively. Seedling density varied among species ranging from five to 9938 individuals ha(-1). The total basal area of woody species having DBH >= 2.5 cm is 15.3 m(2) ha(-1). The IVI of species ranged from 0.13 for Solanum giganteum Jacq. to 28.4 for Croton macrostachyus Del. The woody vegetation was classified into five community types. Species richness, diversity and evenness of communities were strongly positively correlated. On the other hand, the correlation between disturbance and seedling density, and species richness was strongly negative. Thus, among the recorded woody species, a significant portion was either lacking regeneration or selectively removed for various purposes. The lack of seedlings of those species is mainly attributed to anthropogenic disturbances particularly free grazing. As a result, 14 tree, seven shrub and one liana species were prioritized for conservation and management interventions.

AB The accurate reproduction of the spatial and temporal dynamics of marine benthic biodiversity requires the development of mechanistic models, based on the processes that shape macroinvertebrate communities. The modelled entities should, accordingly, be able to adequately represent the many functional roles that are performed by benthic organisms. With this goal in mind, we applied the emergent group hypothesis (EGH), which assumes functional equivalence Within and functional divergence between groups of species. The first step of the grouping involved the selection of 14 biological traits that describe the role of benthic macroinverte-brates in 7 important community assembly mechanisms. A matrix of trait values for the 240 species that occurred in the Rance estuary (Brittany, France) in 1995 formed the basis for a hierarchical classification that generated 20 functional groups, each with its own trait values. The functional groups were first evaluated based on their ability to represent observed patterns of biodiversity. The two main assumptions of the EGH were then tested, by assessing the preservation of niche attributes among the groups and the neutrality of functional differences within them. The generally positive results give us confidence in the ability of the grouping to recreate functional diversity in the Rance estuary. A first look at the emergent groups provides insights into the potential role of community assembly mechanisms in shaping biodiversity patterns. Our next steps include the derivation of general rules of interaction and their incorporation, along with the functional groups, into mechanistic models of benthic biodiversity.

AB By specialising on specific resources, species evolve advantageous morphologies to increase the efficiency of nutrient acquisition. However, many specialists face variation in resource availability and composition. Whether specialists respond to these changes depends on the composition of the resource pulses, the cost of foraging on poorly matched resources, and the strength of interspecific competition. We studied hummingbird bill and plant corolla matching during seasonal variation in flower availability and morphology. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we accounted for the detectability and spatial overlap of hummingbird-plant interactions. We found that despite seasonal pulses of flowers with short-corollas, hummingbirds consistently foraged on well-matched flowers, leading to low niche overlap. This behaviour suggests that the costs of searching for rare and more specialised resources are lower than the benefit of switching to super-abundant resources. Our results highlight the trade-off between foraging efficiency and interspecific competition, and underline niche partitioning in maintaining tropical diversity.

AB Cocoa agroforests like the cabrucas of Brazil's Atlantic forest are among the agro-ecosystems with greatest potential for biodiversity conservation. Despite a global trend for their intensification, cocoa agroforests are also being abandoned for socioeconomic reasons especially on marginal sites, because they are incorporated in public or private protected areas, or are part of mandatory set-asides under Brazilian environmental legislation. However, little is known about phylogenetic structure, the processes of forest regeneration after abandonment and the conservation value of former cabruca sites. Here we compare the vegetation structure and composition of a former cabruca 30-40 years after abandonment with a managed cabruca and mature forest in the Atlantic forest region of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The forest in the abandoned cabruca had recovered a substantial part of its original structure. Abandoned cabruca have a higher density (mean +/- CI95 %: 525.0 +/- 40.3 stems per ha), basal area (34.0 +/- 6.5 m(2) per ha) and species richness (148 +/- 11.5 species) than managed cabruca (96.0 +/- 17.7; 24.15 +/- 3.9 and 114.5 +/- 16.0, respectively) but no significant differences to mature forest in density (581.0 +/- 42.2), basal area (29.9.0 +/- 3.3) and species richness (162.6 +/- 15.5 species). Thinning (understory removal) changes phylogenetic structure from evenness in mature forest to clustering in managed cabruca, but after 30-40 years abandoned cabruca had a random phylogenetic structure, probably due to a balance between biotic and abiotic filters at this age. We conclude that abandoned cocoa agroforests present highly favorable conditions for the regeneration of Atlantic forest and could contribute to the formation of an interconnected network of forest habitat in this biodiversity hotspot.

TI Effects of soil type and light on height growth, biomass partitioning,

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The seedling stage is particularly vulnerable to resource limitation, with potential consequences for community composition. We investigated how light and soil variation affected early growth, biomass partitioning, morphology, and physiology of 22 tree species common in tropical dry forest, including eight legumes. Our hypothesis was that legume seedlings are better at taking advantage of increased resource availability, which contributes to their successful regeneration in tropical dry forests.
   METHODS: We grew seedlings in a full-factorial design under two light levels in two soil types that differed in nutrient concentrations and soil moisture. We measured height biweekly and, at final harvest, biomass partitioning, internode segments, leaf carbon, nitrogen, delta C-13, and delta N-15.
   KEY RESULTS: Legumes initially grew taller and maintained that height advantage over time under all experimental conditions. Legumes also had the highest final total biomass and water-use efficiency in the high-light and high-resource soil. For nitrogen-fixing legumes, the amount of nitrogen derived from fixation was highest in the richer soil. Although seed mass tended to be larger in legumes, seed size alone did not account for all the differences between legumes and nonlegumes. Both belowground and aboveground resources were limiting to early seedling growth and function.
   CONCLUSIONS: Legumes may have a different regeneration niche, in that they germinate rapidly and grow taller than other species immediately after germination, maximizing their performance when light and belowground resources are readily available, and potentially permitting them to take advantage of high light, nutrient, and water availability at the beginning of the wet season.

AB Many species of Dipterocarpaceae and other plant families reproduce synchronously at irregular, multi-year intervals in Southeast Asian forests. These community-wide general flowering events are thought to facilitate seed survival through satiation of generalist seed predators. During a general flowering event, closely related Shorea species (Dipterocarpaceae) stagger their flowering times by several weeks, which may minimize cross pollination and interspecific competition for pollinators. Generalist, pre-dispersal seed predators might also track flowering hosts and influence predator satiation. We addressed the question of whether pre-dispersal seed predation differed between early and late flowering Shorea species by monitoring flowering, fruiting and seed predation intensity over two general flowering events at the Pasoh Research Forest, Malaysia. Pre-dispersal insect seed predators killed up to 63 percent of developing seeds, with Nanophyes shoreae, a weevil that feeds on immature seeds being the most important predator for all Shorea species. This weevil caused significantly greater pre-dispersal seed predation in earlier flowering species. Long larval development time precluded oviposition by adults that emerged from the earliest flowering Shorea on the final flowering Shorea. In contrast, larvae of weevils that feed on mature seeds before seed dispersal (Alcidodes spp.), appeared in seeds of all Shorea species almost simultaneously. We conclude that general flowering events have the potential to satiate post-dispersal seed predators and pre-dispersal seed predators of mature fruit, but are less effective at satiating pre-dispersal predators of immature fruit attacking early flowering species.
   Abstrak Pelbagai spesies Dipterocarpaceae serta keluarga tumbuhan lain berbunga serentak di hutan Asia Tenggara dalam jangka masa yang tidak dapat dijangka. Pembungaan umum ini dianggap memudahkan kemandirian biji benih melalui lambakan biji benih yang memenuhi keperluan pemangsa biji benih. Semasa pembungaan besar-besaran ini spesies-spesies Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) yang bertalian rapat mengeluarkan bunga secara berperingkat dalam beberapa minggu. Hal ini dapat mengurangkan pendebungaan serentak serta persaingan interspesifik untuk pendebunga. Pemangsa umum bagi biji benih yang belum gugur (prapenyebaran) mungkin juga mengesan pokok-pokok yang berbunga dan mempengaruhi keperluan pemangsa. Persoalan kami adalah sama ada pemangsa biji benih berbeza semasa awal atau akhir waktu pembungaan spesies Shorea berdasarkan hasil pemeriksaan intensiti pembungaan, pembuahan serta pemangsa biji benih semasa dua musim pembungaan besar-besaran di hutan penyelidikan Pasoh. Serangga pemangsa biji benih merosakkan sehingga 63% daripada biji benih yang sedang membesar dengan Nanophyes shoreae sebagai kumbang yang paling banyak memakan biji benih yang belum matang bagi semua spesies Shorea. Kumbang ini memberi kesan paling signifikan terhadap biji benih yang belum matang bagi spesies yang berbunga awal. Masa perkembangan larva yang panjang menghalang oviposisi kumbang dewasa yang muncul dari awal pembungaan Shorea hingga akhir pembungaan Shorea. Sebaliknya, larva kumbang yang memakan biji benih matang sebelum penyebaran biji benih (Alcidodes spp.) terdapat dalam setiap biji benih spesies Shorea hampir serentak. Kami simpulkan bahawa kejadian pembungaan besar-besaran berpotensi dalam memenuhi keperluan pemangsa biji benih selepas penyebaran serta prapenyebaran untuk buah-buahan matang, tetapi kurang efektif dalam memenuhi keperluan pemangsa prapenyebaran buah-buahan tidak matang yang menyerang spesies berbunga awal.

AB The savanna formations of the Brazilian ''Cerrado'' present a high degree of resistance and resilience to the impacts of fire, although little is known of its forest formations. Given this, the present study evaluated the resistance and resilience of the ''Cerradao'' to fire impacts over a 7-year period. In March 2008, we established 50 permanent plots of 10 m X 10 m and measured all the woody individuals with a base diameter >= 5 cm. Six months later, all plots were burned by an accidental fire. In March 2012 and March 2015, we re-measured all surviving individuals, and measured the recruits. Species richness, the density of individuals, and the basal area were all significantly greater ( P < 0.05) in 2008, prior to the fire, in comparison with 2012 and 2015, after the fire. Species richness and the density of individuals were also higher ( P < 0.05) in 2015, about 7 years post-fire, in comparison with 2012. During the interval in which the fire occurred ( 2008-2012), the mortality and reposition time, and the stability were all higher ( P < 0.05) than during the subsequent interval, post-fire ( 2012-2015). The recruitment rate was also lower between 2008 and 2012 ( P < 0.05). Our results indicate that the ''Cerradao'' has reduced resistance and resilience to the disturbances caused by fire relative to savanna formations. Given this, frequent burn-off may cause drastic alterations to this phytophysiognomy, emphasizing the need for special care for the preservation of its biodiversity.

AB In tropical forest, landscape fragmentation and the consequent degradation of disturbed forests increase the incidence of light and dry hot winds, causing a disturbance on natural regeneration. Under these conditions, lianas (woody vines) development is stimulated instead of other species, which are more suited to mature forest and under less influence of the edge effect. For this, lianas colonization is an important variable for assessing the disturbance level of a forest. In this context, it becomes important to understand the nature of the competitive relationships between hyper-abundant lianas and ring growth of the host trees. Here, we selected trees with occupation or absence of lianas from two tropical species Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis (Caribbean pine) and Tectona grandis (teak) -localized in a semideciduous forest fragment in southeastern Brazil, aiming to compare growth, climatic response, anatomy (vessels and intra-annual density fluctuations), wood density and carbon, by tree-ring analysis. The results showed that the lianas caused a change in tree-ring anatomy of host trees in last 10 years, mainly. We observed that trees occupied by lianas had a decrease the radial growth and carbon in the two species, an increase of the vessels size in teak and a decrease of the IADF frequency in Caribbean pine. In teak, the climatetree relationship indicated that trees with lianas had lower response to rainfall and higher response to temperature in the summer (rainy and hottest period); in Caribbean pine, we observed that trees with lianas had a 2-month delay in the radial growth response to rainfall in the dry season. In the teak group, we observed that host trees had higher wood density values than liana-free tree in the outer rings, and the opposite was showed for pine. These findings show that tree-ring growth of host trees are a strong bioindicator of forest disturbance caused by aggressive colonization of lianas. We believe that these methods are applicable to future studies relating to the effects of habitat fragmentation and forest degradation on biodiversity and ecosystem services, particularly in the context of global climate change.

AB Forest management has potential to detrimentally impact long-term plantation productivity. Establishment of mixed plantations and fertilization are two important management approaches When trying to maintain soil qualities and productivity. In this study, two types of experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of soil qualities on intra- and interspecific competition dynamics in two larch species. Experiment 1: We transplanted two deciduous larch species, Larix kaempferi and L. olgensis, to study intra- and interspecific competition dynamics in two different types of soil: one from a c. twenty years old L kaempferi plantation (named larch soil) and another from a secondary natural forest (named mixed-forest soil). Experiment 2: Effects of N fertilization on the competition dynamics of the two larch species were tested in the larch soil. In the experiment 1, we hypothesized that the growth of L. kaempferi in the larch soil under no fertilization is inhibited when competing with L olgensis, and their competition relationships may be different in the mixed-forest soil. In both species, the starch and TNC (total nonstructural carbohydrate) concentrations of roots and shoots were significantly higher in the mixed-forest soil when compared to the concentrations in the larch soil without N fertilization (N). The relative competition intensity (RCI) was affected by the soil type. RCI of L. olgensis Was higher than that of L kaempferi in the larch soil N- condition, and RCI of L. kaempferi was higher than that of L. olgensis in the mixed-forest soil in 2015. However, the RCI values did not show significant differences in 2014. In the experiment 2, L. kaempferi showed superior competitiveness in the larch soil N+ condition, with the highest RCI value in 2014, but the RCI value of L kaempferi declined while the RCI value of L. olgensis increased from 2014 to 2015. Both experiments indicated that the benefiting species had higher element (C, N and P) and non-structural carbohydrate (starch and soluble sugar) content accumulation ratios from 2014 to 2015. We found that competition relationships changed between years and depending on conditions. We suggest that mixed plantations and N fertilization together could effectively promote the productivity of Larix. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the responses of individual plant species along different edaphic gradients is a key question in ecology, with implications to community assembly, functioning of forest ecosystems, niche theory and conservation planning. In tropical rain forests, responses to soil nutrients have been described only for a handful of species. Even abundant and conspicuous components of the forest, such as the palms (Arecaceae), remain largely unknown in this respect.
   We inventoried all palm species and analysed soil chemistry in 96 sites across western Amazonia to (i) assess the relative importance of some micronutrients vs. macronutrients as drivers of patterns in palm species composition, (ii) model the response shapes of 61 palm taxa and of canopy vs. understorey palms along gradients of selected soil nutrients, (iii) determine if the response shapes of conspecific palm varieties differ in relation to the most important observed soil nutrient and (iv) assess if the rank order of the most abundant canopy species changes along edaphic gradients.
   Patterns in palm species composition were best explained by Mehlich-III extractable exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg) and phosphorus (P), with the different palm species clearly separating along the soil cation concentration gradient. All 61 palm taxa exhibited statistical responses along soil nutrient gradients. Response shapes in relation to exchangeable bases varied among bimodal skewed (51% of species), unimodal skewed (47%) and monotonic (2%).
   There were no significant differences between canopy vs. understorey species in their mean response shapes to the exchangeable bases, but canopy species had significantly higher mean optimum value for soil P and greater mean niche width along the Ca, K, Mg, P and boron (B) gradients. Varieties of the same species of Bactris, Desmoncus and Geonoma generally had different response shapes and different optima for the exchangeable bases.
   Synthesis. Among the soil variables we studied, macronutrients (especially exchangeable bases and P) emerged as more important than micronutrients in predicting species abundances in palm communities of western Amazonian non-inundated forests. Non-Gaussian responses were predominant, conspecific palm varieties exhibited different response types, and the rank order of dominance of canopy palms varied along the gradients of exchangeable bases and P. Together, these findings advance niche theory about palms and may be used for generating better predictive models of palm species distributions and for experimental studies that search for the physiological mechanisms underlying inter- and infra-specific trade-offs along edaphic gradients.

AB Due to our intensive subsistence and habitat-modification strategies-including broad-spectrum harvesting and predation, widespread landscape burning, settlement construction, and translocation of other species-humans have major roles as ecological actors who influence fundamental trophic interactions. Here we review how the long-term history of human-environment interaction has shaped the evolutionary biology of diverse non-human, non-domesticated species. Clear examples of anthropogenic effects on non-human morphological evolution have been documented in modern studies of substantial changes to body size or other major traits in terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants in response to selective human harvesting, urbanized habitats, and human-mediated translocation. Meanwhile, archaeological records of harvested marine invertebrates and terrestrial vertebrates suggest that similar processes extend considerably into prehistory, perhaps to 50,000 yr BP or earlier. These results are consistent with palaeoenvironmental and other records that demonstrate long-term human habitat modification and intensive harvesting practices. Thus, while considerable attention has been focused on recent human impacts on 'natural' habitats, integrated evidence from modern biology and archaeology suggests a deep history of human entanglement with our ecosystems including substantial effects on the evolutionary biology of non-human taxa. The number and magnitude of such effects will probably increase given the continued intensification of anthropogenic activities and ecosystem impacts, including climate change and direct genetic modification.

AB Stemflow (Sf) measurements in tropical rain and montane forests dominated by large trees rarely include the understory and small trees. In this study, contributions of lower (1- to 2-m height) and upper (>2-m height and <5-cm diameter at breast height [DBH]) woody understory, small trees (5 < DBH < 10 cm), and canopy trees (>10-cm DBH) to Sf per unit ground area (Sf(a)) of a Mexican lower montane cloud forest were quantified for 32 days with rainfall (P) during the 2014 wet season. Rainfall, stemflow yield (Sf(y)), vegetation height, density, and basal area were measured. Subsequently, stemflow funneling ratios (SFRs) were calculated, and three common methods to scale up Sf(y) from individual trees to the stand level (tree-Sf(y) correlation, P-Sf(y) correlation, and mean-Sf(y) extrapolation) were used to calculate Sf(a). Understory woody plants, small trees, and upper canopy trees represented 96%, 2%, and 2%, respectively, of the total density. Upper canopy trees had the lowest SFRs (1.6 +/- 0.5 Standard Error (SE) on average), although the lower understory had the highest (36.1 +/- 6.4). Small trees and upper understory presented similar SFRs (22.9 +/- 5.4 and 20.2 +/- 3.9, respectively). Different Sf scaling methods generally yielded similar results. Overall Sf(a) during the study period was 22.7 mm (4.5% of rainfall), to which the understory contributed 70.1% (15.9 mm), small trees 10.6%(2.4mm), and upper canopy trees 19.3%(4.4mm). Our results strongly suggest that for humid tropical forests with dense understory of woody plants and small trees, Sf of these groups should be measured to avoid an underestimation of overall Sf at the stand level.

AB Changes in land-use systems in tropical regions, including deforestation, are a key challenge for global sustainability because of their huge impacts on green-house gas emissions, local climate and biodiversity. However, the dynamics of land-use and land-cover change in regions of frontier expansion such as the Brazilian Amazon are not yet well understood because of the complex interplay of ecological and socioeconomic drivers. In this paper, we combine Markov chain analysis and complex network methods to identify regimes of land-cover dynamics from land-cover maps (TerraClass) derived from high-resolution (30 m) satellite imagery. We estimate regional transition probabilities between different land-cover types and use clustering analysis and community detection algorithms on similarity networks to explore patterns of dominant land- cover transitions. We find that land- cover transition probabilities in the Brazilian Amazon are heterogeneous in space, and adjacent subregions tend to be assigned to the same clusters. When focusing on transitions from single land- cover types, we uncover patterns that reflect major regional differences in land-cover dynamics. Our method is able to summarize regional patterns and thus complements studies performed at the local scale.

AB Disentangling the mechanisms that shape community assembly across diversity gradients is a central matter in ecology. While many studies have explored community assembly through species average trait values, there is a growing understanding that intraspecific trait variation (ITV) can also play a critical role in species coexistence. Classic biodiversity theory hypothesizes that higher diversity at species-rich sites can arise from narrower niches relative to species-poor sites, which would be reflected in reduced ITV as species richness increases. To explore how ITV in woody plant communities changes with species richness, we compiled leaf trait data (leaf size and specific leaf area) in a total of 521 woody plant species from 21 forest communities that differed dramatically in species richness, ranging from boreal to tropical rainforests. At each forest, we assessed ITV as an estimate of species niche breadth and we quantified the degree of trait overlap among co-occurring species as a measure of species functional similarity. We found ITV was relatively invariant across the species richness gradient. In addition, we found that species functional similarity increased with diversity. Contrary to the expectation from classic biodiversity theory, our results rather suggest that neutral processes or equalizing mechanisms can be acting as potential drivers shaping community assembly in hyperdiverse forests.

AB Facilitation cascades generated by co-occurring foundation species can enhance the abundance and diversity of associated organisms. However, it remains poorly understood how differences among native and invasive species in their ability to exploit these positive interactions contribute to emergent patterns of community structure and biotic acceptance. On intertidal shorelines in New England, we examined the patterns of coexistence between the native mud crabs and the invasive Asian shore crab in and out of a facilitation cascade habitat generated by mid intertidal cordgrass and ribbed mussels. These crab species co-occurred in low intertidal cobbles adjacent to the cordgrass-mussel beds, despite experimental findings that the dominant mud crabs can kill and displace Asian shore crabs and thereby limit their successful recruitment to their shared habitat. A difference between the native and invasive species in their utilization of the facilitation cascade likely contributes to this pattern. Only the Asian shore crabs inhabit the cordgrass-mussel beds, despite experimental evidence that both species can similarly benefit from stress amelioration in the beds. Moreover, only Asian shore crabs settle in the beds, which function as a nursery habitat free of lethal mud crabs, and where their recruitment rates are particularly high (nearly an order of magnitude higher than outside beds). Persistence of invasive adult Asian shore crabs among the dominant native mud crabs in the low cobble zone is likely enhanced by a spillover effect of the facilitation cascade in which recruitment-limited Asian shore crabs settle in the mid intertidal cordgrass-mussel beds and subsidize their vulnerable populations in the adjacent low cobble zone. This would explain why the abundances of Asian shore crabs in cobbles are doubled when adjacent to facilitation cascade habitats. The propensity for this exotic species to utilize habitats created by facilitation cascades, despite the lack of a shared evolutionary history, contributes to species coexistence and the acceptance of invasives into a diverse community.

AB Recent work has shown that the behaviour of marine organisms can be affected by elevated P-CO2, although little is known about the effect of multiple stressors. We therefore investigated the effect of elevated P-CO2 and temperature on locomotion and behaviour during prey searching in the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, a predator characteristic of the southeastern Pacific coast. Movement duration, decision time, route finding and lateralization were measured using a T-maze tank with a prey positioned behind a barrier. Four treatments, representing present day and near-future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming were used in rearing the individuals for 6 months. Regardless of the treatment, no significant differences were found in relative and absolute lateralization before and after exposure for 6 months. However, relative lateralization was not repeatable for animals tested after 6 months at elevated P-CO2 at both experimental temperatures, whereas it was repeatable in individuals kept at the present day level of P-CO2. We suggest that these effects may be related to a behavioural malfunction caused by elevated P-CO2. Movement duration, decision time and route finding were not repeatable. However, movement duration and decision time increased and route finding decreased in elevated P-CO2 (at 15 degrees C), suggesting that elevated P-CO2 has negative effects on the locomotor and sensory performance of C. concholepas in the presence of a prey odour, thereby decreasing their ability to forage efficiently.

AB The north coast of Bahia comprises a 220 km long region within the Atlantic rainforest ecoregion. Studies focusing on snake communities are still scarce in this part of the state of Bahia. In this study, we assess snake diversity at nine locations, including habitat use and activity patterns. The sites were surveyed for three years, and four museum collections were visited to compile additional data. We obtained information on 50 species from 774 specimens. While the snake fauna at Instituto da Mata contained the greatest richness with 15 observed species, the snake fauna at Imbassai exhibited the greatest snake diversity due to a lower dominance. The estimated species richness of the region might be as many as 55 species. Snakes occurred mainly in the restinga ecosystem (N = 27), followed by ombrophilous forest (N = 25), and consisted mainly of terrestrial species. The restinga dry forest is home to most species, however some are restricted to habitats in other vegetation types related to their biology. The snake assemblage on the north coast of Bahia is similar to others in the Atlantic rainforest and Caatinga domain in northeastern Brazil.

AB Previous analysis of the vegetation cover from remote sensing revealed the existence of three alternative modes in the frequency distribution of boreal tree cover: a sparsely vegetated treeless state, an open woodland state, and a forest state. Identifying which are the regions subject to multimodality, and assessing which are the main factors underlying their existence, is important to project future change of natural vegetation cover and its effect on climate.
   We study the link between the tree-cover fraction distribution and eight globally observed environmental factors: mean annual rainfall, mean minimum temperature, growing degree days above 0 degrees C, permafrost distribution, mean spring soil moisture, wildfire occurrence frequency, soil texture, and mean thawing depth. Through the use of generalised additive models, conditional histograms, and phase-space analysis, we find that environmental conditions exert a strong control over the tree-cover distribution, uniquely determining its state among the three dominant modes in similar to 95% of the cases. Additionally, we find that the link between individual environmental variables and tree cover is different within the four boreal regions considered here, namely eastern North Eurasia, western North Eurasia, eastern North America, and western North America. Furthermore, using a classification based on rainfall, minimum temperatures, permafrost distribution, soil moisture, wildfire frequency, and soil texture, we show the location of areas with potentially alternative tree-cover states under the same environmental conditions in the boreal region. These areas, although encompassing a minor fraction of the boreal area (similar to 5 %), correspond to possible transition zones with a reduced resilience to disturbances. Hence, they are of interest for a more detailed analysis of land-atmosphere interactions.

AB According to the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, seedling mortality is greater close to conspecific (or closely related) adult trees because of higher enemy pressure, ultimately increasing local tree-species diversity. However, this pattern (i.e. a decline of seedling performance close to conspecific or closely related adults) could also result from other processes: (1) heterospecific adults might positively affect seedlings; (2) conspecific (or closely related) adults might negatively affect seedlings by causing a deterioration of the microenvironment. We tested these hypotheses, accounting also for sizes of adults. We planted oak-seedlings in a temperate forest, characterized their adult neighbourhoods, measured 26 microenvironmental conditions, seedling mortality during one year, budburst and leaf herbivory. We detected Janzen-Connell-like patterns (frequent lack of budburst close to conspecific adults; high seedling mortality close to closely related adults) that were consistent with the Janzen-Connell process. However, these patterns were either counteracted by non-Janzen-Connell processes such as a favourable microenvironment or were weak with little explained variance. We detected Janzen-Connell-like patterns that were not consistent with the Janzen-Connell process: proximity to heterospecific adults per se decreased leaf herbivory partly due to microenvironmental effects, such that a lower leaf herbivory decreased seedling mortality. Overall, the spatial pattern of tree recruitment may resemble that predicted byJanzen-Connell but result from different processes: notably heterospecific adults creating refuges from enemies, facilitating the establishment of oaks below non-oaks without hindering their establishment below oaks.

AB Wooded biomes converted to human-modified landscapes (HML) are common throughout the tropics, yielding small and isolated forest patches surrounded by an agricultural matrix. Diverse anthropogenic interventions in HMLs influence patches in complex ways, altering natural dynamics. Assessing current condition or ecological integrity in these patches is a challenging task for ecologists. Taking the Brazilian Atlantic Forest as a case study, we used the conceptual framework of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), a multimetric approach, to assess the ecological integrity of eight small forest patches in a highly disturbed HML with different configurations and histories. The IBI was developed using bird assemblages found in these patches, and its performance was compared with analytical approaches commonly used in environmental assessment, such as general richness and Shannon's diversity index. As a first step, the IBI procedure identifies an existing gradient of human disturbance in the study region and checks which biotic characteristics (candidate metrics) vary systematically across the gradient. A metric is considered valid when its' relationship with the gradient provides an ecological interpretation of the environment. Then, the final IBI is elaborated using each valid metric, obtaining a score for each site. Over one year of sampling, 168 bird species were observed, providing 74 different bird candidate metrics to be tested against the disturbance gradient. Seven of them were considered valid:richness of threatened species; richness of species that use both "forest and non-forest" habitats; abundance of endemics, abundance of small understory-midstory insectivores, abundance of exclusively forest species; abundance of non forest species, and abundance of species that forage exclusively in the midstory stratum. Each metric provided complementary information about the patch's ecological integrity. The resulting IBI showed a significant linear relationship with the gradient of human disturbance, while total species richness and Shannonis diversity index did not. Application of numerical approaches, such as total species richness and Shannon's diversity, did not distinguish ecological traits among species. The IBI proved better for assessing and interpreting ecological and environmental condition of small patches in highly disturbed HML. The IBI framework, its multimetric character, and the ease with which it can be adapted to diverse situations, make it an effective approach for assessing environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest region, and also for many other small forest patches in the tropics.

AB Ants play important ecological roles, such as predation on other arthropods, seed dispersal, and soil structure maintenance. In citrus agroecosystems, ants are considered a secondary pest. The damage they cause is indirect through the disruption of the biological control of pests, especially honeydew producers. In integrated pest management programs, adequate and precise sampling methods are required to accurately determine the need for chemical ant control to minimize the economic and environmental costs of unnecessary chemical treatments and to reduce the risk of crop loss by pests. In Mediterranean citrus groves, eight ant species that differed in abundance and frequency have been found foraging on citrus trees: Lasius grandis Forel, Pheidole pallidula (Nylander), Plagiolepis pygmaea (Latreille), Formica gerardi Bondroit, Formica rufibarbis Fabricius, Camponotus sylvaticus (Olivier), Linepithema humile (Mayr), and Tapinoma erraticum (Latreille) (all Hymenoptera: Formicidae). The trunk was selected as the most efficient sampling unit to establish the monitoring method. Aggregation indices on the trunk of these species were calculated, and enumerative and binomial sampling methods were developed for the most frequent species, L.grandis and Ph.pallidula. Ant species differed in spatial distributions within citrus orchards, and required different sample sizes to estimate population abundance. The minimum sample size required, taking into account the maximum average abundance found - 44.1 L.humile, 17.3 L.grandis, and 3.5 Ph.pallidula per trunk per min -, would be 28, 25, and 54 trees, respectively.

AB This paper uses household survey data to examine factors associated with smallholder households that enroll in Costa Rica's longstanding payments for ecosystem services (PES) program. To date, most evaluations of this sort have focused on larger landowners. Results from this study show that smallholders enrolled in PES tend to be older, wealthier, and have access to non-farm salaried income. These features match enrollment patterns of larger landowners in that enrollees tend to be relatively wealthy and only marginally engaged in agriculture. In addition, smallholders on state agrarian reform lands are significantly less likely to enroll in PES. These results indicate that targeting PES toward smaller landowners does not necessarily equate to a policy that reaches the rural poor, and suggests that further work is needed to address the access barriers to this program for economically marginal landowners.

AB Ontogenetic niche shifts (ONS) are important drivers of population and community dynamics, but they can be difficult to identify for species with prolonged larval or juvenile stages, or for species that inhabit continuous habitats. Most studies of ONS focus on single transitions among discrete habitat patches at local scales. However, for species with long larval or juvenile periods, affinity for particular locations within connected habitat networks may differ among cohorts. The resulting spatial patterns of distribution can result from a combination of landscape-scale habitat structure, position of a habitat patch within a network, and local habitat characteristics-all of which may interact and change as individuals grow. We estimated such spatial ONS for spring salamanders (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus), which have a larval period that can last 4 years or more. Using mixture models to identify larval cohorts from size frequency data, we fit occupancy models for each age class using two measures of the branching structure of stream networks and three measures of stream network position. Larval salamander cohorts showed different preferences for the position of a site within the stream network, and the strength of these responses depended on the basin-wide spatial structure of the stream network. The isolation of a site had a stronger effect on occupancy in watersheds with more isolated headwater streams, while the catchment area, which is associated with gradients in stream habitat, had a stronger effect on occupancy in watersheds with more paired headwater streams. Our results show that considering the spatial structure of habitat networks can provide new insights on ONS in long-lived species.

AB In salt marshes, disturbance by wrack (floating mats of dead vegetation) is common and affects plant productivity and species composition, but little is known about how the timing of disturbance mediates these effects, nor how it interacts with herbivory. Using a field experiment on the Georgia coast, we simulated the effects of wrack disturbance at different times of the year on the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora and its stem-boring herbivorous insects. The timing of disturbance throughout the growing season strongly affected fall biomass, stem height, the proportion of stems flowering, and the proportion of stems colonized by stem-boring herbivorous insects. End-of-season biomass in plots disturbed in March did not differ from undisturbed controls, but biomass was reduced by 50% in plots disturbed in May, and by over 90% in plots disturbed in September. Disturbance in March and May stimulated flowering, but disturbance later in the growing season suppressed it. Plots disturbed late in the growing season had a low frequency of stem-boring herbivores. Stems containing stem borers rarely flowered. These results indicate that the timing of disturbance matters in coastal salt marshes. Late-season disturbances had the strongest effects on S. alterniflora and its herbivores. Disturbances early in the growing season did not affect endof-season biomass, and stimulated flowering, suggesting parallels between fire disturbance in grasslands and wrack disturbance in salt marshes. Late-season disturbance did reduce herbivory by stem-boring insects, but not enough to compensate for the direct effects of disturbance on the plants. Future studies of disturbance in salt marshes should consider how the timing of experimental disturbance treatments relates to the timing of natural disturbances.

AB The Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) concept is mainly based on Coasean economics theory that emphasizes the creation of a voluntary or market-based transaction for ecosystem services. Alternatively, many PES practiced in developing countries are based on Pigouvian economic theory allowing government intervention such as through regulation, tax or subsidy. A hybrid PES approach that compound Coasean and Pigouvian theory was developed in West Lombok Indonesia leading to a new policy paradigm that combines elements of both a voluntary market-based and mandatory policy-based system. This study aims to assess how the hybrid PES program contributes to poverty alleviation. By employing a participatory econometrics approach, this study found that the hybrid PES system does not contribute to poverty alleviation in shortterm. It is possible that this PES program contributes to poverty alleviation in long-term.

AB In many sugarcane plantations in Brazil, the straw is left on the soil after harvesting, and vinasse, a by- product of the production of sugar and ethanol, is used for fertigation. Our goal was to compare ant community composition and species richness in the straw mulch of sugarcane crops with the leaf litter of neighboring forests. We tested the hypothesis that ant communities in the straw mulch of vinasse- irrigated sugarcane crops and in the forest leaf litter were similar, because the combination of straw mulching and vinasse irrigation has a positive effect on soil fauna. Straw mulch and leaf litter were collected from 21 sites and placed in Berlese funnels. In total, 61 species were found in the forest leaf litter, whereas 34 and 28 species were found in the straw mulch of sugarcane fields with and without vinasse, respectively. Ant communities differed between forest and crop fields, but the species in the sugarcane straw mulch were a subset of the species found in the forest leaf litter. Although vinasse is rich in organic matter, it did not increase ant diversity. Seven feeding and/ or foraging types were identified and, among the different types, surface-foraging omnivorous ants were the most prevalent in all habitats. Vinasse-irrigated sugarcane straw mulch had more predatory species than mulch from vinasse- free fields, but fewer than forest leaf litter. However, this positive effect of vinasse irrigation should be carefully evaluated because vinasse has negative effects on the environment.

AB Defoliation may initiate physiological recovery and chemical defence mechanisms that allow a plant to improve fitness after damage. Such responses may result in changes in plant resource allocation that influence growth and foliar chemistry. In this study, we investigated the nature and stability of the defoliation response of juvenile plants from three divergent populations of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. A partial defoliation treatment that removed all upper crown leaves and the apical buds was applied to plants sourced from eight families from each of three populations representing contrasting chemical resistance to mammalian herbivory. Growth, photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were assessed pre-defoliation and periodically up to 12 weeks post-defoliation. The content of key plant primary and secondary metabolites was assessed pre-defoliation, at 12 weeks post-defoliation in the old foliage (positioned below the point of defoliation) and in the new foliage of the control plants and regrowth (from axillary buds) on the defoliated plants. There were clear treatment impacts on physiological responses, growth and foliar chemical traits, but despite significant constitutive differences in physiology, growth and chemistry the three E. globulus populations did not vary in their response to foliage loss. Distinct physiological responses to defoliation were observed with treatment plants showing significant up-regulation of photosynthetic rate and increased chlorophyll content in the old foliage remaining in the lower crown. There was a significant increase in the concentrations of a number of foliar chemical compounds in the regrowth arising from previously dormant axillary buds compared with new growth derived from apical meristems. There were changes in biomass allocation; defoliated plants had increased branching and leaf biomass, with changes in regrowth morphology to increase light capture. This study argues for multiple responses of E. globulus juveniles to defoliation involving apical bud loss, including elevated chemical defences matched with increased growth. From a chemical defence perspective, these responses create an enhanced chemical mosaic to the herbivore, with leaves remaining after partial browsing potentially being more palatable than the regrowth. This study demonstrates the multiple independent strategies plants may use to respond to partial defoliation and emphasizes the dynamic interplay between growth and defence in the recovery response.

AB Brazil's riparian forests are continuously threatened by conversion into agricultural areas, causing not only degradation and loss of vegetation but also negative changes in soil properties and ecosystem services. In order to select vegetation and soil variables that are affected by degradation and to evaluate whether forest structure can be used as a proxy for soil ecosystem services, two watersheds in eastern Amazon were chosen as a study area in which four degradation levels were identified (very high, high, moderate and low), based on forest canopy openness and height. Vegetation structural characteristics, water infiltration rates, and soil properties were evaluated in 24, 1,000m(2) permanent plots. Results indicated that forest degradation significantly reduced soil carbon, phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, silt proportion, total porosity, and water content as well as water infiltration rate. Vegetation structure was a good proxy for monitoring soil ecosystem services (i.e. regulation of water flow, erosion control and life-supporting). Tree height and basal area, as well as herb biomass, were identified as the best vegetation indicators for changes in soil properties that underlie ecosystem services. Application of this strategy may facilitate the monitoring and modeling of riparian forest ecosystem services across broader spatial scales, to help guide efficient restoration efforts and conservation policies.

AB The aim in this study was detect changes in landscape-fragmentation patterns resulting from the expansion of agriculture in the Cerrado region (Brazilian Savanna) during the period 1988-2011. The study area covers 7,559,783.69 ha and is restricted to the limits of the Urucuia Group (Upper Cretaceous), a geological unit formed by sedimentary rocks of continental deposits where there has been intense agricultural expansion due to favorable conditions for the use of mechanized farming. The temporal analysis considered land-use/land-cover data from Landsat TM image classification for the years 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2011. Fragmentation quantification was performed from the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and traditional landscape metrics analysis. The calculation of MSPA attributes considered 10 edge widths, between 30 and 300 m. Traditional landscape metrics were obtained from Path Analyst and V-Late software. Change detection in MSPA classes was obtained through cross-tabulation. Cerrado deforestation in the study area increased from 795,502.61 ha in 1988 to 2804,679.75 ha in 2011. The spatial pattern of Cerrado deforestation and fragmentation has a spatial concentration in the western region of the study area that gradually progresses toward the east. Our results emphasize the fragmentation process with a reduction in the following fragmentation indicators over the past two decades: area, number of patches, core, and edge. In addition, the indicators increased in: complexity, size variation, and coreless fragments. Change detection enabled the description of spatial evolution of fragmentation indicators. The results can help define strategies for landscape planning and decision making for conservation priorities.

AB Higher interannual precipitation variability is predicted for Southern California's shrub-dominated systems, promoting soil moisture variation and changing community composition. We asked if soil microbial responses to rainfall regime will depend on litter inputs; showing direct effects of altered precipitation through soil moisture and indirect effects resulting from shifting litter inputs.
   Soils were collected from a 2-year field rainfall manipulation experiment. Under lab conditions soils were subjected to high or low moisture pulses with litter amendments from native and exotic species in all combinations.
   Soil respiration was higher with larger water pulses, but rose over time in low pulse treatments (direct response). Litter additions from exotic species promoted greater respiration, and results were stronger under higher soil moisture (indirect response). Extracellular enzyme activities generally were higher with exotic litter and under high moisture pulses. Those involved in N-cycling had much larger increases activity for the exotic litter addition - high moisture pulse scenarios compared to other treatments.
   Our results indicate the potential for microbial acclimation to drought conditions over short timescales and that below-ground processes are sensitive to direct and indirect effects of shifting rainfall regimes, especially where invasion is promoted by future climate change.

AB The initial photoinhibition observed when Cedrela fissilis was transferred from shade to full sunlight was not severe enough to affect their biomass accumulation.
   We investigated the growth and, morphological and physiological changes in Cedrela fissilis, a tropical tree species known for its high-quality wood, when subjected to changes in natural light conditions. We assessed the magnitude of photoinhibition when plants that were acclimated to shade were transferred into full sunlight and also assessed the impact of probable photoinhibition on the leaf morphology and growth of C. fissilis. We cultivated plants under three conditions: beneath the canopy (shade), under full sunlight, and transferring shade plants to full sunlight. During the period of the experiment (7 months), C. fissilis had 100 % survival in all treatments including shade conditions which corresponded to 1 % of light available compared to full sunlight. The growth was reduced under the shade, but the specific leaf area and biomass allocated to leaves were higher. After the change from shade to full sunlight conditions, reductions in potential photochemical yield (F (v)/F (m)) were detected in both predawn and midday measurements, characterizing the occurrence of photoinhibition. However, 30 days after the transfer, the mean value of F (v)/F (m) for those plants was 0.79, similar to that reached by plants permanently under full sunlight or shade conditions. The recovery of photoinhibition was followed by increases in the electron transport rates. Among the transferred plants, alterations in leaf structure and a shift in biomass partitioning patterns were observed. The photoinhibition that was detected early in the experiment was not severe enough to impact the relative growth rate and biomass accumulation. Our results show that C. fissilis can grow under the shade or full sunlight. However, when shade plants were transferred to full sunlight, they reached an efficient acclimation to the new environment through physiological alterations in their leaves and morphological modifications in the whole plant.

AB This study has assessed forest cover changes, rate of deforestation, levels of fragmentation and modeled the spatial dynamics of deforestation and forest fragmentation in Assam, India. The analysis of the forest change shows that between 1975 and 2015, the area coverage of forest has reduced from 23749 km(2) (30.3% of the state geographical area) to 21145 km(2) (27% of the state geographical area). The total predicted forest area of Assam is 20189 km(2) (25.7%) for 2030. Forest and non-forest classes were evaluated in order to assess changes and to study influence of five physical factors distance from road and settlement areas, elevation, slope and distance from the water bodies on the deforestation. The Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network modeling was used for predicting the spatial distribution of deforestation. According to the Cramer coefficients, the elevation was strongly associated with deforestation in Assam followed by the slope, distance to water bodies and the distance to roads. The forest areas undergoing high concentration of negative changes have been modelled in the form of deforestation hotspots by using optimised hotspot tool. The results of fragmentation analysis have indicated the reduction of core forests throughout the study period. The spatial database generated in the study is a useful input for understanding of the impact of deforestation and fragmentation on biodiversity and land use change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB We show how land-use change can affect fisher-harvesting behavior. We test whether fisher harvesting behavior can be predicted by landscape change patterns at local (similar to 200 km) and regional (similar to 1200 km) levels. Our data suggest that fishers harvesting in areas near tree plantations reduced benthic-invertebrate harvests in favor of demersal and pelagic finfish that are usually located further offshore. Fishers' management areas, which were near tree plantations, had higher chlorophyll-a values, and contained shellfish with more endobionts. Technology (owning a boat) and experience (age, years fishing, and alternative livelihoods) explained little in fisher-harvesting behavior. The flagship Chilean fisheries management program and seafood companies sourcing from these areas will need to respond to these new challenges. Despite complexities in designing cross-scale, social-ecological studies, we can no longer ignore the interconnectedness of commodities in the biosphere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extensive 1970-2010 deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has generated a similar to 1.5 Mha fragmented region known as the 'arc of deforestation'. Farmers and cattle ranchers throughout Brazil are legally required to set-aside riparian forest strips within their landholdings, but recent legislative changes have relaxed the minimum mandatory conditions of these riparian forests. In this context, we assessed the functional role of riparian forest remnants as landscape connectors for medium to large-bodied terrestrial mammals in a vast fragmented landscape of southern Amazonia. We selected 38 riparian forest strips and five riparian sites within continuous forest, installed four to five camera-traps along each riparian zone (199 camera-trap stations), and sampled the terrestrial mammal assemblage for 60 days per station during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. We compared mammal use of riparian forests within both continuous and highly fragmented forests, and examined the effects of corridor width, corridor habitat structure, and landscape context on mammal species richness, composition, and functional diversity, all of which were higher in continuous forests than in riparian remnants. Functional diversity differences between corridor type was trait-independent and mediated by differences in species richness. Forest habitat degradation was associated with overall lower species richness, whereas forest specialists were more species-rich in increasingly wider corridors. Compositional shifts indicate that deforestation and forest degradation favours matrix-tolerant species with lower levels of forest habitat specificity. We show the potential landscape connectivity role for forest mammals of riparian Corridors, whose width and forest degradation status are key predictors of community-wide responses. We provide evidence on the importance of these relict riparian strips to forest vertebrates, strengthening the scientific arguments that help justify the recently embattled legal requirements to maintain effective riparian corridors in Brazil.

AB Primary biogeographic homology implies that different taxa are spatiotemporally integrated in a biota with a common biogeographic history, namely naturalness. Primary spatial homology includes the identification of areas of endemism. Therefore, the first step to approach a natural regionalization is to identify the patterns of endemism. In order to achieve this, I obtained the areas of endemism of terrestrial mammals of the world at two different spatial scales of analysis using a Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE): 8 degrees latitude-longitude (families and genera) and 4 degrees latitude-longitude (species). Fourteen general patterns, summarized from 54 areas of endemism, were recovered for the 8 degrees scale, whereas 44 general patterns, from 176 areas of endemism, were recovered for the 4 degrees scale. At both scales, there were patterns of successively nested endemism. In general, I found evidence for maintaining the regionalization proposed by Wallace in 1876 (Australian, Ethiopian, Neotropical, and Oriental regions), and I also found evidence supporting the addition of new regions, such as the Andean region. Other Wallace's regions were not recovered completely, such as the Nearctic and Palearctic regions, probably due to several biotic interchanges between them. Some transition zones were recovered (South American Transition Zone and Mediterranean). I also identified endemic species for small areas of endemism that may represent provinces. The results of this work can be used to propose hypotheses of secondary spatial homology and for making better inferences about the history of the biotas. (C) 2016 The Linnean Society of London,

AB Old-growth tropical forests are being extensively deforested and fragmented worldwide. Yet forest recovery through succession has led to an expansion of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes (HMTLs). Secondary forests thus emerge as a potential repository for tropical biodiversity, and also as a source of essential ecosystem functions and services in HMTLs. Such critical roles are controversial, however, as they depend on successional, landscape and socio-economic dynamics, which can vary widely within and across landscapes and regions. Understanding the main drivers of successional pathways of disturbed tropical forests is critically needed for improving management, conservation, and restoration strategies. Here, we combine emerging knowledge from tropical forest succession, forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research to identify the main driving forces shaping successional pathways at different spatial scales. We also explore causal connections between land-use dynamics and the level of predictability of successional pathways, and examine potential implications of such connections to determine the importance of secondary forests for biodiversity conservation in HMTLs. We show that secondary succession (SS) in tropical landscapes is a multifactorial phenomenon affected by a myriad of forces operating at multiple spatio-temporal scales. SS is relatively fast and more predictable in recently modified landscapes and where well-preserved biodiversity-rich native forests are still present in the landscape. Yet the increasing variation in landscape spatial configuration and matrix heterogeneity in landscapes with intermediate levels of disturbance increases the uncertainty of successional pathways. In landscapes that have suffered extensive and intensive human disturbances, however, succession can be slow or arrested, with impoverished assemblages and reduced potential to deliver ecosystem functions and services. We conclude that: (i) succession must be examined using more comprehensive explanatory models, providing information about the forces affecting not only the presence but also the persistence of species and ecological groups, particularly of those taxa expected to be extirpated from HMTLs; (ii) SS research should integrate new aspects from forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research to address accurately the potential of secondary forests to serve as biodiversity repositories; and (iii) secondary forest stands, as a dynamic component of HMTLs, must be incorporated as key elements of conservation planning; i.e. secondary forest stands must be actively managed (e.g. using assisted forest restoration) according to conservation goals at broad spatial scales.

AB Payments for Environmental Services (PES) has become a popular means to neoliberalize biodiversity conservation throughout the world. Yet research on PES is increasingly focused on debating exactly how neoliberal programmes really are, documenting complexities in PES implementation and concluding that few programmes are very market-based in practice. While we agree that ideal neoliberal implementation of PES does not and cannot exist, we argue that focusing (only) on micro-politics misunderstands the importance of analysing PES as a form of neoliberal conservation. The question is not just whether PES is innately neoliberal but how it functions within a broader neoliberal political economy. By focusing on the overarching governance and power structures that gave rise to PES in the first place, we more clearly see what we call 'the PES conceit', namely that the approach implicitly accepts neoliberal capitalism as both the problem and the solution to the ecological crisis. This strategy is not only contradictory but also commonly fails to achieve intended outcomes, falling far short of conservation objectives while also often exacerbating socioeconomic inequality. This problematic conceit, we conclude, cannot be addressed through only micro-oriented studies; it demands connecting micro- and macro political economic analyses to confront broader neoliberal power structures.

AB 1. Plants have evolved inducible resistance and tolerance mechanisms against insect herbivores. Resistance mechanisms that affect herbivorous insects directly can be effective against generalist herbivores, but will not deter specialist herbivores from attacking the plant. Tolerance mechanisms and indirect plant resistance are more likely effective strategies used by plants when dealing with specialist herbivores. However, inducible indirect resistance and tolerance mechanisms have rarely been investigated within the same study system.
   2. We studied multiple tolerance mechanisms and the role of natural enemies in reducing fitness loss of Brassica nigra plants incurred by feeding by the specialist herbivore Pieris brassicae. For this, we measured the changes in carbon and nitrogen triggered by herbivore attack and quantified plant biomass and seed production under field conditions, in the presence or absence of natural enemies of the herbivores. We also assessed whether B. nigra increased selfing rates when exposed to herbivore infestation, and investigated whether infestation by P. brassicae rendered B. nigra plants more attractive to night-active pollinators than control plants.
   3. We found that B. nigra flowers are rarely visited by insects during the night, and exposure to herbivores did not influence selfing rates. Brassica nigra plants compensated for herbivory in terms of vegetative biomass. Seed set was negatively affected by herbivory in the absence of natural enemies, but not in the presence of natural enemies. Plants responded to herbivory with drastic changes in nitrogen contents of leaves and flowers, whereas no changes in carbon concentrations were detected.
   4. The investment in reproduction or re-growth of vegetative tissues is not sufficient to sustain plant fitness. Reproductive output of flowering mustard plants is only sustained when interactions with the natural enemies of the herbivores are preserved. We conclude that natural enemies of herbivorous insects play an important role as component of the plant's defence strategy. This study reveals that both tolerance and indirect resistance are strategies of this plant species to sustain fitness.

AB Aims
   Most biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research has been carried out in grassland ecosystems, and little is known about whether forest ecosystems, in particular outside the temperate zone, respond similarly. Here, we tested whether productivity, assessed as leaf area index (LAI), increases with species richness in young experimental stands of subtropical trees, whether this response is similar for early-season leaf area (which is dominated by evergreens) and seasonal leaf area increase (which is dominated by deciduous species), and whether responses saturate at high species richness.
   Methods
   We used a planted tree biodiversity experiment in south-east China to test our hypotheses. LAI was determined three times by digital hemispheric photography in 144 plots that had been planted with 400 trees each, forming communities with 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 tree species.
   Important Findings
   LAI increased significantly with tree species richness in the fifth year of stand establishment. Similar, but weaker, statistically non-significant trends were observed 1 year before. We did not observe leaf area over-yielding and the presence of particularly productive and unproductive species explained large amounts of variation in leaf area, suggesting that selection-type effects contributed substantially to the biodiversity effects we found in this early phase of stand establishment. Effects sizes were moderate to large and comparable in magnitude to the ones reported for grassland ecosystems. Subtropical (and tropical) forests harbor substantial parts of global net primary production and are critical for the Earth's carbon and hydrological cycle, and our results suggest that tree diversity critically supports these ecosystem services.

AB Aims
   Growth rates of plants are driven by factors that influence the amount of resources captured and the efficiency of resource use. In trees, the amount of light captured and the efficiency of light use strongly depends on crown characteristics and leaf traits. Although theory predicts that both crown and leaf traits affect tree growth, few studies have yet to integrate these two types of traits to explain species-specific growth rates. Using 37 broad-leaved tree species of subtropical forests in SE China, we investigated how interspecific differences in wood volume growth rates were affected by crown and leaf traits. We tested the hypotheses that (i) larger crown dimensions promote growth rates, (ii) species-specific growth rates are positively related to leaf stomatal conductance, leaf water potential and leaf chemical components, and negatively related to leaf C/N and leaf toughness and (iii) the two sets of traits better explain growth rates in combination than either alone.
   Methods
   Our study was conducted in a large-scale forest Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning experiment in China (BEF-China), located in a mountainous region in Jiangxi Province. We related 17 functional traits (two crown dimension and three crown structure traits; six physiological and six morphological leaf traits) to the mean annual growth rate of wood volume of young trees of the studied species. Interrelationships between crown and leaf traits were analyzed using principal component analysis. Simple linear regression analysis was used to test the effect of each trait separately. We used multiple regression analysis to establish the relationship of growth rate to each set of traits (crown traits, physiological and morphological leaf traits) and to the combination of all types of traits. The coefficients of determination (R-adj(2)) of the best multiple regression models were compared to determine the relative explanatory power of crown and leaf traits and a combination of both.
   Important Findings
   The species-specific growth rates were not related to any of the single crown traits, but were related positively to leaf stomatal conductance and leaf water potential individually, and negatively to leaf toughness, with approximately 13% variance explained by each of the traits. Combinations of different crown traits did not significantly explain the species-specific growth rates, whereas combinations of either physiological or morphological leaf traits explained 24% and 31%, respectively. A combination of both crown and leaf traits explained 42% of variance in species-specific growth rates. We concluded that sets of traits related to carbon assimilation at the leaf-level and to overall amount of leaves exposed at the crown-level jointly explained species-specific growth rates better than either set of traits alone.

AB The southwestern Ethiopian montane forests are one of the most species-rich ecosystems and are recognised globally as a priority area for the conservation of biodiversity. Particularly, in contrast to the drier central and northern Ethiopian highlands, they have received little attention by researchers. Here, we review changes to agricultural systems in and around these forests that are known as the genetic home of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) and that are important to the livelihoods of many rural people who have developed traditional management practices based on agro-ecological knowledge, religious taboos and customary tenure rights. We explored the impacts of conversions to agroforestry and cereal-based cropping systems on biodiversity, soil fertility, soil loss and the socio-economic conditions and culture. The increasing trend of cereal cropping, resettlement and commercial agriculture causes the deterioration of natural forest cover in the region and threatens biodiversity, land quality, sustainable, traditional farming practices and the livelihood of the local community. Large-scale plantations of tea, coffee, soapberry locally known as endod (Phytolacca dodecandra L'Her.) and cereals have resulted in biodiversity loss. Following the conversion of forests, cultivated fields exhibit a significant decline in soil fertility and an increase in soil loss as compared with the traditional agroforestry system. The establishment of a sustainable agricultural system will require a change in paradigm, whereby the intrinsic values of the traditional forest-based agricultural system are recognised, rather than the ongoing mimicking of agricultural policies that were developed for the open fields of central Ethiopia.

AB The study of habitat fragmentation is complex because multiple, potentially synergistic, ecological processes may be acting simultaneously. Further, edge effects themselves may be complex in that additivity from multiple edges can give rise to heterogeneous nearest-edge gradients.
   We used heat diffusion as a proxy for additive edge effects in two study landscapes in order to test whether two key observations recently attributed to synergy between edge and area effects could be more simply explained by additivity; namely, steeper edge gradients in larger fragments and variation in slopes of species-area relationships as a function of distances to fragment edges.
   We sampled forest structure in northwestern Madagascar at various distances from the edge in fragments and continuous forest and used an inverse modelling approach to parameterize the model. In addition, we applied the model to data from a published study of beetle communities in fragmented forests in New Zealand.
   With increasing proximity to edges, woody stem densities decreased and, as predicted, smaller fragments had lower stem densities and less steep edge gradients than larger ones. The model successfully predicted shifts in species-area relationships as a function of nearest-edge distances for beetle species, although observed richness for forest specialists in the smallest fragments was lower than predicted.
   Two key observations attributed to synergy between edge and area effects were explained by edge additivity. The model is particularly useful in that it can help to disentangle the complex sets of processes acting in fragmented landscapes.

TI Phosphorus resource partitioning shapes phosphorus acquisition and plant

AB Species diversity is commonly hypothesized to result from trade-offs for different limiting resources, providing separate niches for coexisting species(1-4). As soil nutrients occur in multiple chemical forms, plant differences in acquisition of the same element derived from different compounds may represent unique niche dimensions(5,6). Because plant productivity of ecosystems is often limited by phosphorus(7), and because plants have evolved diverse adaptations to acquire soil phosphorus(6,8), a promising yet untested hypothesis is phosphorus resource partitioning(6,9,10). Here, we provided two different chemical forms of phosphorus to sown grassland mesocosms to investigate phosphorus acquisition of eight plant species that are common in European grasslands, and to identify subsequent patterns of plant abundance. For the first time, we show that the relative abundance of grassland plant species can be influenced by soil phosphorus forms, as higher abundance was linked to higher acquisition of a specific form of phosphorus. These results were supported by a subsequent isotope dilution experiment using intact grassland sods that were treated with different inorganic or organic phosphorus forms. Here, 5 out of 14 species showed greater phosphorus acquisition in the inorganic phosphorus treatment, and 4 in the organic phosphorus treatments. Furthermore, for the species used in both experiments we found similar acquisition patterns. Our results support the hypothesis of phosphorus resource partitioning and may provide a new mechanistic framework to explain high plant diversity in phosphorus-poor ecosystems(6,11-13). As world biodiversity hotspots are almost invariably related to phosphorus limitation(8,11,12), our results may thus also be key to understanding biodiversity loss in an era of ever-increasing nutrient enrichment(14).

AB Biotic factors such as the presence of invasive animal and/or plant species are well known as major causes of ecological degradation and as limiting either natural or assisted (human-induced) ecological restoration. However, abiotic aspects of the landscape, such as water availability and soil physical/chemical conditions can also potentially limit restoration and should be considered. Dryland ecosystems are amongst the world's most threatened and least protected. New Zealand's drylands have been drastically changed, initially through burning, agricultural and grazing practices and the impacts of introduced herbivores and plants. This research aimed at identifying some of the key environmental factors preventing the reestablishment of native woody species in a New Zealand dryland ecosystem. The experiments involved a combination of shading, irrigation and grazing exclusion. The results showed that supplemental water was not beneficial for the survival and growth of the native seedlings, unless combined with shade. Fencing proved important for establishment, even though the species used are regarded in the literature as unpalatable to herbivores. The results indicated that the presence of shade was fundamental for the establishment and growth of the native seedlings likely due to improvements in the microclimate, soil aeration, and water availability to seedlings.

AB The plant economics spectrum that integrates the combination of leaf and wood syndromes provides a useful framework for the examination of species strategies at the whole-plant level. However, it remains unclear how species that differ in leaf habits and growth forms are integrated within the plant economics spectrum in subtropical forests. We measured five leaf and six wood traits across 58 subtropical plant species, which represented two leaf habits (evergreen vs deciduous) and two growth forms (tree vs shrub) in eastern China. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed separately to construct the leaf (LES), wood (WES) and whole-plant (WPES) economics spectra. Leaf and wood traits are highly intra- and intercorrelated, thus defining not only the LES and WES, but also a WPES. Multi-trait variations in PCAs revealed that the traits which were representative of the acquisitive strategy, i.e., cheap tissue investment and rapid returns on that investment, were clustered at one end, while traits that represented the conservative strategy, i. e., expensive tissue investment and slower returns, were clustered at other end in each of the axes of the leaf and wood syndromes (PC1-axis) and the plant height strategy (PC2-axis). The local WPES, LES and WES were tightly correlated with each other. Evergreens shaped the conservative side, while deciduous species structured the acquisitive side of the WPES and LES. With respect to plant height strategies, trees formulated the acquisitive side and shrub species made up the conservative side of the WPES, LES and WES. In conclusion, our results suggested that the LES and WES were coordinated to a WPES for subtropical species. The finding of this local spectrum of plant form and function would be beneficial for modeling nutrient fluxes and species compositions in the changing climate, but also for understanding species strategies in an evolutionary context.

AB We present data on Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) collected in South America together with results on the mitochondrial DNA diversity within selected megadiverse genera. This work is part of an on-going project on the ancient origin of South American biodiversity using non-biting midges. Collections were made at 42 localities, in March 2014 and February 2015, in a diverse array of habitats, including small streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and bays. In total, 3196 representatives of six subfamilies were collected. Sixty-one genera were identified, containing at least 211 species. The subfamilies Chironominae and Orthocladiinae predominated in all samples. Tanypodinae were often present, but rarely in large numbers. Except for Podonomus pepinellii, reported from Brazil, Podonominae were collected in a few localities in Argentina (Arroyo Lopez, and Arroyo Gutierrez and Gutierrez Lake) and Chile (Llanquihue Lake). Prodiamesinae were only recorded in Chile. Analysis of DNA barcode sequences using neighbor-joining estimation supported 66 species within the selected genera. The chironomid fauna of South America includes multiple genera with worldwide distributions, with Australian, Nearctic and Neotropical components.

AB Sugarcane is an important crop within the Brazilian socioeconomic landscape. There is a constant need for approaches to increase sustainability at all steps of the production chain. Irrigating sugarcane crops with vinasse is one of these approaches, because vinasse is a residue of sugarcane processing that can be used to fertilize these same crops. However, due to its chemical properties, vinasse may be harmful to soil fauna. Analyzing the structure and functional organization of ant communities is a fast and practical way to monitor sites affected by the addition of chemicals. This study compared the structure of soil ant communities in vinasse-irrigated sugarcane crops to those in secondary forests adjacent to the crops. In total, 32 genera and 107 species of ants were observed; of these, 30 species foraged in crop fields and 102 foraged in forests. Twenty-five percent of the species were present in both crops and forests. Ant communities in crop soil had poorer taxonomic composition and lower richness in each functional group compared to communities in forest remnants. However, regardless of vegetation type, epigeic ants were more diverse, and Dorymyrmex brunneus (crop) and Pachycondyla striata (forest) were very frequent. Vinasse did not increase the diversity of epigeic and hypogeic ants, but it may affect the community composition.

AB The Mexican transition zone (MTZ) is the complex area where the Neotropical and Nearctic biotas overlap, including south-western United States, Mexico and a large part of Central America extending to the Nicaraguan lowlands. In a strict sense, it corresponds to the mountain highlands of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. We review Halffter's theory explaining the biotic evolution of the MTZ, including the description and discussion of the distributional patterns and cenocrons recognized within it. Distributional patterns are generalizations that help analyse and compare distributions of different taxa. Cenocrons correspond to sets of taxa that share the same biogeographic history, constituting identifiable subsets within the transitional biota by their common biotic origin and evolutionary history. The heuristic value of distributional patterns and cenocrons lies in their application to formulate hypotheses on biotic assembly in the geographical-ecological space, to analyse the ecological response to anthropic impact, to analyse altitudinal patterns and to undertake time-slicing in cladistic biogeography. Three case studies are analysed with some detail: the Neotropical genus Canthon and the tribe Phanaeini and the Holarctic/Nearctic subfamily Geotrupinae. The Paleoamerican and Mexican Plateau cenocrons define the approximate boundaries of the MTZ, whereas the Mountain Mesoamerican, Nearctic and Typical Neotropical cenocrons correspond to the more conventional boundaries of the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. The biotic assembly of the MTZ is summarized into five stages: in the Jurassic-Cretaceous, the Paleoamerican cenocron (later diversified into five varieties) extended in Mexico; in the Late Cretaceous-Palaeocene, the Mexican Plateau cenocron dispersed from South America; in the Oligocene-Miocene, the Mountain Mesoamerican cenocron dispersed from the Central American Nucleus; in the Miocene-Pliocene, the Nearctic cenocron dispersed from northern North America; and in the Pleistocene, the Typical Neotropical cenocron dispersed from South America. Finally, we review the impact of Halffter's MTZ, with particular reference to dispersal, track, cladistic biogeographic, endemicity and phylogeographic analyses, as well as biogeographic regionalization.

AB Natural disturbances are the dominant form of forest regeneration and dynamics in unmanaged tropical forests. Monitoring the size distribution of treefall gaps is important to better understand and predict the carbon budget in response to land use and other global changes. In this study, we model the size frequency distribution of natural canopy gaps with a discrete power law distribution. We use a Bayesian framework to introduce and test, using Monte Carlo Markov chain and Kuo-Mallick algorithms, the effect of local physical environment on gap size distribution. We apply our methodological framework to an original light detecting and ranging dataset in which natural forest gaps were delineated over 30 000 ha of unmanaged forest. We highlight strong links between gap size distribution and environment, primarily hydrological conditions and topography, with large gaps being more frequent on floodplains and in wind-exposed areas. In the future, we plan to apply our methodological framework on a larger scale using satellite data. Additionally, although gap size distribution variation is clearly under environmental control, variation in gap size distribution in time should be tested against climate variability.

AB The success of sustainable crop production depends on our ability to select or create varieties that can allocate resources to both growth and defence. However, breeding efforts have emphasized increases in yields but have partially neglected defence traits against pests. Estimating the costs of multiple defences against tuber herbivores and the tradeoffs among them, as well as understanding the relationship between yield and multiple defences is still unknown but relevant to both basic and applied ecology. Using twenty commercial potato varieties available in Colombia and the tuber herbivore Tecia solanivora, we tested whether high yielding varieties show a reduction in three types of defence: constitutive and induced resistance, as well as tolerance. Specifically, we determined (1) the costs in terms of yield of all three defences, (2) the possible tradeoffs among them, and (3) if oviposition preference was related to the expression of these defences. We detected no costs in terms of yield of constitutive and induced resistance to tuber damage. We did, however, find evidence of costs of being able to tolerate tuber herbivory. While we found no tradeoffs among any of the estimated defences, there was a positive correlation between aboveground compensatory growth and tolerance in terms of tuber production, suggesting that after damage there are no shifts in the allocation of resources from aboveground to belowground biomass. Finally, we found that females laid more eggs on those varieties with the lowest level of constitutive resistance. In conclusion our findings suggest that in potatoes, breeding for higher yields has not caused any reduction in constitutive or induced resistance to tuber damage. This is not the case for tolerance where those varieties with higher yields are also less likely to tolerate tuber damage. Given the high incidence of tuber pests in Colombia, selecting for higher tolerance could allow for high productivity in the presence of herbivores. Finding mechanisms to decouple the tolerance response from yield should be a new priority in potato breeding in Colombia to guarantee a higher yield in both the presence and absence of herbivores.

AB Although the Amazon rainforest houses much of Earth's biodiversity and plays a major role in the global carbon budget, estimates of tree biodiversity originate from fewer than 1,000 forest inventory plots, and estimates of carbon dynamics are derived from fewer than 200 recensus plots. It is well documented that the pre-European inhabitants of Amazonia actively transformed and modified the forest in many regions before their population collapse around 1491 AD; however, the impacts of these ancient disturbances remain entirely unaccounted for in the many highly influential studies using Amazonian forest plots. Here we examine whether Amazonian forest inventory plot locations are spatially biased toward areas with high probability of ancient human impacts. Our analyses reveal that forest inventory plots, and especially forest recensus plots, in all regions of Amazonia are located disproportionately near archaeological evidence and in areas likely to have ancient human impacts. Furthermore, regions of the Amazon that are relatively oversampled with inventory plots also contain the highest values of predicted ancient human impacts. Given the long lifespan of Amazonian trees, many forest inventory and recensus sites may still be recovering from past disturbances, potentially skewing our interpretations of forest dynamics and our understanding of how these forests are responding to global change. Empirical data on the human history of forest inventory sites are crucial for determining how past disturbances affect modern patterns of forest composition and carbon flux in Amazonian forests.

AB Disposal of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent into sea, a typical anthropogenic disturbance, may influence many environmental factors and change the coastal microbial community structure. In this study, by setting up coastal sediment microcosms perturbed by WWTP effluent, the changes of microbial community structure under different degree of disturbances were investigated. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) were used to analyzed the biomass and biodiversity. High throughput sequencing analysis was used to identify the classification of the microorganisms. Our study suggested that low ratio of WWTP effluent may stimulate dominant species, which increase the biomass but decrease the biodiversity; while high ratio of WWTP effluent may depress all species, which decrease the biomass but increase the biodiversity. In other words, the impact was dose-dependent. The changes of microbial community structure may provide a metric for water environmental assessment and pollution control. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Stem radius measurements can vary over the short and medium-term in relation to changes in certain environmental parameters, providing useful information about the impacts of climate variation on tree physiology and growth processes. Here, use a variety of approaches to identify the main environmental variables that influence annual stem water dynamics in the tree Vochysia divergens in a seasonally flooded forest in Northwest Pantanal, Brazil. The circadian stem cycle and diel phases of stem radius (contraction, recovery and increment) was quantified over two growth seasons (2013-2015) using high resolution dendrometer measurements. Our results demonstrate that stem radial variation is strongly linked to water availability which, in turn, is significantly associated with soil water content (SWC) and actual vapor pressure (e(a)). Our data suggest that the duration of contraction and recovery phases are related to SWC, whereas the increment phase is more influenced by the phenological cycle of the tree. The contraction phase has a limiting association with high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) (decoupled from SWC), indicating stomatal regulation. The circadian stem cycle was characterized by monthly fluctuations reflecting atmospheric water demand status. Monthly mean actual vapor pressure (ea(mean)) was strongly associated with annual variation in the amplitude of the circadian stem cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil biota influence plant performance through plant-soil feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on plant traits and whether plant-soil feedback drives local plant diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring plant species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other plant species. Plant responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different plant responses to soil biota promote local plant diversity.

AB To evaluate the population variation, individual plasticity, and local adaptability of Solidago canadensis in response to shade treatment, we conducted a common pots experiment with a total of 150 ramets (5 genets, 15 populations, and 2 treatments) subjected to both control (natural light) and shady treatment (10% of natural light). Shade treatment significantly reduced growth and content of defense metabolites in S. canadensis. Compared to control, shading led to increased height, decreased basal diameter, increased leaf width, increased leaf length, increased chlorophyll content, stronger photosynthetic rate (P-n), stronger stomatal conductance (g(s)), and lower root to shoot ratio. Three-way analysis of variance revealed geographical origin to significantly affect the basal diameter of S. canadensis, while genotype significantly affected plant height, intercelluar CO2 concentration (C-1), transpiration rate (T-r), and proline content. Significant interactive effects between shade and geographic origin were prevalent for most traits. The phenotypic differentiation coefficient of the plasticity of all traits was below 0.4, indicating that most of all variations can be found among individuals within populations. Phenotypic selection analysis revealed that fitness was significantly positively related to plant height, basal diameter, C-1, total flavonoid content, as well as the plasticity of plant height, leaf length, leaf width, g(s), C-1, total flavonoid content, and malondialdehyde content under the control condition. However, subjected to shade, fitness was only significantly positively related to plant height, basal diameter, and the plasticity of basal diameter. Rather than local adaption, these results suggest that individual plasticity played a more prominent role in the shade response of the invasive S. canadensis.

AB Several authors have highlighted the difficulties in disentangling human from natural effects when studying shellfish foraging strategies and archeo-malacogical records. In coastal settings, one of the reasons for this difficulty is the lack of understanding of small-scale oceanographic conditions and their influence on coastal and marine species used by people in the past. The present study evaluated the influence of environmental conditions on shellfish harvesting during the Late Holocene around Santa Cruz Island (Southern California) considering small-scale nearshore oceanographic variability around the Island and its effect on M. californianus (main shellfish species exploited through prehistory along the coast of California). Fluctuations in size and abundance of M. californianus shells through time and local past sea surface temperature (SST) values from oxygen isotope analysis of mussel shells are correlated throughout the stratigraphy of two shell midden sites (2200-500 cal B.P.) nearby coasts with different paleo-oceanographic characteristics.
   Despite the fact that human harvesting seems to have been the main force shaping length and availability of M. californianus, no clear evidence of human pressure was found on archaeological mussel assemblages. Results also show that fluctuations in regional SST records (Santa Barbara Basin marine core) do not represent local SST variations (oxygen isotope analyses on mussel shells), especially if the archaeological site is located on a coast exposed to strong and consistent upwelling activity.
   By re-evaluating human impact on mussel beds during the Late Holocene around Santa Cruz Island, the research presented here demonstrates the importance of considering small-scale nearshore oceanography for understanding the archaeological evidence of prehistoric human foraging on important intertidal shellfish species.

AB Over the past few decades there has been a growing realization that a large share of apparently virgin or old-growth tropical forests carries a legacy of past natural or anthropogenic disturbances that have a substantial effect on present-day forest composition, structure and dynamics. Yet, direct evidence of such disturbances is scarce and comparisons of disturbance dynamics across regions even more so. Here we present a tree-ring based reconstruction of disturbance histories from three tropical forest sites in Bolivia, Cameroon, and Thailand. We studied temporal patterns in tree regeneration of shade-intolerant tree species, because establishment of these trees is indicative for canopy disturbance. In three large areas (140-300 ha), stem disks and increment cores were collected for a total of 1154 trees (>5 cm diameter) from 12 tree species to estimate the age of every tree. Using these age estimates we produced population age distributions, which were analyzed for evidence of past disturbance. Our approach allowed us to reconstruct patterns of tree establishment over a period of around 250 years. In Bolivia, we found continuous regeneration rates of three species and a peaked age distribution of a long-lived pioneer species. In both Cameroon and Thailand we found irregular age distributions, indicating strongly reduced regeneration rates over a period of 10-60 years. Past fires, windthrow events or anthropogenic disturbances all provide plausible explanations for the reported variation in tree age across the three sites. Our results support the recent idea that the long-term dynamics of tropical forests are impacted by large-scale disturbance-recovery cycles, similar to those driving temperate forest dynamics.

AB Aggressive interactions among closely related species are common, and can play an important role as a selective pressure shaping species traits and assemblages. The nature of this selective pressure depends on whether the outcomes of aggressive contests are asymmetric between species (i.e., one species is consistently dominant), yet few studies have estimated the prevalence of asymmetric versus symmetric outcomes to aggressive contests. Here we use previously published data involving 26,212 interactions between 270 species pairs of birds from 26 taxonomic families to address the question: How often are aggressive interactions among closely related bird species asymmetric? We define asymmetry using (i) the proportion of contests won by one species, and (ii) statistical tests for asymmetric outcomes of aggressive contests. We calculate these asymmetries using data summed across different sites for each species pair, and compare results to asymmetries calculated using, data separated by location. We find that 80% of species pairs had aggressive outcomes where one species won 80% or more of aggressive contests. We also find that the majority of aggressive interactions among closely related species show statistically significant asymmetries, and above a sample size of 52 interactions, all outcomes are asymmetric following binomial tests. Species pairs with dominance data from multiple sites showed the same dominance relationship across locations in 93% of the species pairs. Overall, our results suggest that the outcome of aggressive interactions among closely related species are usually consistent and asymmetric, and should thus favor ecological and evolutionary strategies specific to the position of a species within a dominance hierarchy.

AB Spatial processes underlie major species coexistence mechanisms. A range of spatial analysis techniques are increasingly applied to data of fully mapped communities to quantify spatial structures in species and phylogenetic and functional diversity at some given spatial scale with the goal of gaining insights into processes of community assembly and dynamics. We review these techniques, including spatial point pattern analysis, quadrat-based analyses, and individual-based neighborhood models, and provide a practical roadmap for ecologists in the analysis of local spatial structures in species and phylogenetic and functional diversity. We show how scale-dependent metrics of spatial diversity can be used in concert with ecological null models, statistical models, and dynamic community simulation models to detect spatial patterns, reveal the influence of the biotic neighborhood on plant performance, and quantify the relative contribution of species interactions, habitat heterogeneity, and stochastic processes to community assembly across scale. Future works should integrate these approaches into a dynamic spatiotemporal framework.

AB Plant communities have undergone dramatic changes in recent centuries, although not all such changes fit with the dominant biodiversity-crisis narrative used to describe them. At the global scale, future declines in plant species diversity are highly likely given habitat conversion in the tropics, although few extinctions have been documented for the Anthropocene to date (<0.1%). Nonnative species introductions have greatly increased plant species richness in many regions of the world at the same time that they have led to the creation of new hybrid polyploid species by bringing previously isolated congeners into close contact. At the local scale, conversion of primary vegetation to agriculture has decreased plant diversity, whereas other drivers of change-e.g., climate warming, habitat fragmentation, and nitrogen deposition-have highly context-dependent effects, resulting in a distribution of temporal trends with a mean close to zero. These results prompt a reassessment of how conservation goals are defined and justified.

In this study, we present the first evidence of the influence of these larvae on the pollination ecology of Heliconia plants. We provide experimental evidence that the flowers of Heliconia spathocircinata infested by flies have less nectar for pollinators and received fewer visits by hummingbird pollinators, in comparison with uninfested flowers.

AB We review a vast literature of Neotropical forest science and wood anatomical research that identifies 220 tree species from 46 botanical families with confirmed annual tree-ring formation. External factors that trigger annual growth rhythms include rainfall seasonality, annual long-term flooding (flood-pulse), soil water salinity (mangroves), and, with increasing latitude and altitude, photoperiod and temperature. Maximum ages for tropical angiosperms derived from tree-ring analyses generally do not exceed 400-600 years; however, at marginal sites characterized by extremely limited growth conditions individual trees might get older. Dendroecological applications provide insights into tree species' ecology and forest dynamics. Analyses of growth trajectories and age-size relationships of trees highlight considerable variability among individual trees, species, and environments. In recent decades tree-ring studies in neotropical forests have contributed new methods to project timber harvests and to evaluate and adjust management practices to increase the sustainability of forest management. The better understanding of individual- and species-level growth patterns in the Neotropics provides necessary empirical information to conserve and manage tropical forests and the many ecosystem functions and services that they maintain.

AB This paper aims to advance our understanding of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) as 'political projects' by offering an analytical tool for investigating power relations, political decisions, place specific ideas and social norms in the construction and operation of PES schemes. This proposed analytic tool is based on a revised version of the 'ecosystem service cascade', which we propose to transform into an ecosystem service stairway model as a device to analyse political processes in ecosystem service construction and provision. We show that the key to understanding the politics of PES lies in the antagonistic processes between the different steps of the stairway. In particular, we show that the definition and mobilisation of the ecosystem service potential (ESP) is the stage where the most fundamental political decisions are made. Here, the role of intermediaries is particularly significant as they introduce their own conceptions of society-nature relations, which function as 'epistemic selectivities' in further defining and mobilising the ESP and in generating the resulting Ecosystem Services (ESS). We illustrate our main conceptual insights and evaluate the usefulness of our political ecosystem stairway model by applying it to two Latin American cases, one in Brazil and the other in Bolivia.

AB This study explores the use of the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the shortwave infrared ratio (SWIR32) vegetation indices (VI) to retrieve fractional cover over the structurally complex natural vegetation of the Cerrado of Brazil using a time series of imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Data from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor with 30 m pixel resolution is used to sample geographic and seasonal variation in NDVI, SWIR32, and the hyperspectral cellulose absorption index (CAI), and to derive end-member values for photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare soil (BS) from a suite of protected and/or natural vegetation sites across the Cerrado. The end-members derived from relatively pure 30 m pixels are then applied to a 500 m pixel resolution MODIS time series using linear spectral unmixing to retrieve PV, NPV, and BS fractional cover (F-PV, F-NPV, and F-BS). The two-way interaction response of MODIS-equivalent NDVI and SWIR32 was examined for regions of interest (ROI) collected within protected areas and nearby converted lands. The MODIS NDVI, SWIR32 and retrieved FPV, FNPV, and FBS are then compared to detailed cover and structural composition data from field sites, and the influence of the structural and compositional variation on the VIs and cover fractions is explored. The hyperion ROI analysis indicated that the twoway NDVI-SWIR32 response behaved as an effective surrogate for the two-way NDVI-CAI response for the campo limpo/grazed pasture to cerrado sensu stricto woody gradient. The SWIR32 sensitivity to the NPV and BS variation increased as the dry season progressed, but Cerrado savannah exhibited limited dynamic range in the NDVI-CAI and NDVI-SWIR32 two-way responses compared to the entire landscape, which also comprises fallow croplands and forests. Validation analysis of MODIS retrievals with Quickbird-2 images produced an RMSE value of 0.13 for FPV. However, the RMSE values of 0.16 and 0.18 for FBS and FNPV, respectively, were large relative to the seasonal and inter-annual variation. Analysis of site composition and structural data in relation to the MODIS-derived NDVI, SWIR32 and F-PV, F-NPV, and F-BS, indicated that the VI signal and derived cover fractions were influenced by a complex mix of structure and cover but included a strong year-to-year seasonal effect. Therefore, although the MODIS NDVI-SWIR32 response could be used to retrieve cover fractions across all Cerrado land covers including bare cropland, pastures and forests, sensitivity may be limited within the natural Cerrado due to sub-pixel heterogeneity and limited BS and NPV sensitivity.

AB Fire has played an important role in the plant dynamics and diversity of the Cerrado for millions of years. We evaluated fire behaviour in different fire seasons in areas of an open savanna, providing information for fire management plans. It has been hypothesised that early fires (May - end of the rainy season) will be less intense than those conducted in the middle and end of the dry season (July and October) owing to the amount of dead biomass accumulated. Therefore, we compared fire behaviour in early, mid- and late dry season, evaluating the main fire and environmental variables. Fire intensity was mainly influenced by the combination of dead fuel percentage and fuel load. Even though this combination was the best model to explain fire intensity variability, fire parameters (including fire intensity) did not differ between fire seasons. Flame height was best explained by dead fuel percentage+fuel moisture content, dead fuel percentage+fuel load and also by dead fuel percentage. Our study showed that, in areas with fire exclusion for 2 years, fire season did not influence fire parameters and fire behaviour and the main factors influencing fire intensity were the proportion of dead biomass and total fuel load.

AB Sites containing anthropogenic waste products or dumps are currently treated as refugia by a lot of animal groups, including ants. In this study the population structure of Myrmica rubra (L.) ants was compared between habitats containing and lacking anthropogenic waste products. The density of colonies and individual nests, number of queens and of workers both per colony and per nest, and queen size were analyzed. Twenty plots with waste products and 20 control (natural) plots (paired, each 10x10m in size) were established and compared. Results show a significant increase in colony and nest density on the plots with waste compare to the control plots. However, the number of workers, queens and queen size did not differ significantly between plot types. Overall number, as well as proportion of polycalic colonies was higher on plots with waste products. These results suggest that when M. rubra has more potential nest site opportunities created by human activity, the density of its colonies increases. Moreover, the anthropogenic waste product are strongly preferred nest sites for this species on the human-disturbed plots, as only them were used as nest loci there in contrast to control plots.

AB Twelve benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, including pavine and phenanthroindolizidine types, were isolated from a MeOH/CH2Cl2 extract of Cryptocarya laevigata (stem bark) through bioactivity-guided fractionation for antitumor effects. Selected compounds were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against five human tumor cell lines, including a multidrug-resistant subline. Since more common 2,3,8,9-tetrasubstituted pavine alkaloids, such as crychine (3), exhibit very mild or no cytotoxicity, this compound type has not been well investigated for antitumor activity. Thus, this report is the first discovery of a 7-hydroxylated pavine alkaloid, (-)-neocaryachine (1), to demonstrate strong antiproliferative activity, with IC50 values of 0.06 to 0.41 mu M against five tested tumor cell lines, including an MDR subline. Further mechanism of action studies revealed that 1 impacts the cellular S-phase by inducing DNA double-strand breaks.

AB A major gap in our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships concerns the role of intra-and interspecific diversity of mycorrhizal fungi, which are critical for plant fitness, biogeochemical cycling and other processes. Here, we test the hypothesis that the identity and richness of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi at the intra-and interspecific levels affect ecosystem multifunctionality by regulating plant and fungal productivity, soil CO2 efflux and nutrient retention.
   Microcosms containing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings colonized by different ECM fungal isolates, in monocultures and mixtures, enabled us to test for both intra-and interspecific identity and richness effects, and transgressive overyielding.
   Intra-and interspecific identity had modest but significant effects on plant and fungal productivity and nutrient retention, but no effect on CO2 efflux. Intraspecific richness increased plant root productivity and ECM root tips but decreased hyphal length, whereas interspecific richness had no effects. Interspecific mixtures outperformed the most productive monocultures in only 10% of the cases, compared with 42% for the intraspecific mixtures.
   Both intra-and interspecific identity and richness of ECM fungi regulate ecosystem multifunctionality, but their effects on the direction and magnitude of individual variables differ. Transgressive overyielding suggests that positive niche complementarity effects are driving some of the responses to intraspecific richness.

AB Epiphytic bryophytes are an important component of many forest ecosystems. Several studies have reported vertical distribution patterns for this species, finding many taxa growing along the entire vertical profile of host trees, some in the most exposed upper areas of the canopies. Many studies in Chilean forests have focused on epiphytes, but most of them were located in lowland and coastal forests. This study is the first scientific exploration of the epiphytic communities that occupy the entire vertical profile of large Nothofagus dombeyi (Mirb.) Oerst. trees in a montane Nothofagus forest in the Chilean Andes (39 degrees 25'S). Our goals were (i) to describe the richness of the epiphytic species inhabiting large N. dombeyi trees, (ii) to evaluate differences in composition related to the height, azimuth and diameter of each host tree, and (iii) to explore the distribution of epiphytic species within the vertical profile of trees. We climbed 10 large N. dombeyi trees located between 940 and 1190 m in altitude. All epiphytes were sampled every meter, from the base up to the highest climbable branch. The epiphytic community was dominated by non-vascular epiphytes, with 17 taxa, all of which were bryophytes. Frullania rostrata, Gackstroemia aff. magellanica, Hypnum skottsbergii and Zygodon penstastichus were the most frequently observed taxa. Species composition varied with height on the tree, but no differences between trees were observed. The vertical distribution showed that three taxa were restricted to the crown, five were abundant throughout the whole vertical profile and four were restricted to the trunk close to the ground. The information here could be relevant due to the pressure to manage these Nothofagus forests, where the associated biodiversity is not even recorded in forestry inventories.

   DOMINANCE
AB The role of dominant species is of central importance in ecology. Such species play a key role in ecosystem structure, stability and function, regulating resource allocation across trophic levels and overall ecosystem productivity. Although ecological interactions between dominant and subordinate species are often considered to influence the latter negatively, the presence of dominant species can also be beneficial. These species commonly act as ecosystem engineers and enhance biodiversity by creating habitat for other species. Along rocky coastlines, dominant species are often sessile suspension-feeding organisms that can monopolize all available substrata. This is particularly noticeable in intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats where the number of species that achieve ecological dominance is limited. Here, we review the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that facilitate dominance along rocky coastlines. We then focus on a prominent example, the members of the Pyura stolonifera species complex (Tunicata), which are an emerging model system for studying ecological dominance. These ascidians achieve the highest biomass levels ever reported in rocky intertidal habitats and, when invasive, can fundamentally transform entire ecosystems. Finally, we discuss conservation implications and conclude with directions for future research.

AB Invasive populations often shift phenotypically during introduction. Moreover, they are postulated to show an increased phenotypic plasticity compared with their native counterparts, which could be advantageous. However, less is known about trait selection across populations along the invasion gradient in response to environmental factors, such as increasing drought caused by climate change. In this study, we investigated the impacts of drought on growth, regrowth, and various leaf traits in plants of different origin. Therefore, seeds of 18 populations of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare were collected along the invasion gradient (North America, invasive; West Europe, archaeophyte; East Europe, native) and grown in competition with the grass Poa pratensis under control or dry conditions in a common garden. Above-ground biomass was cut once and the regrowth was measured as an indicator for tolerance over a second growth period. Initially, drought had little effects on growth of T. vulgare, but after cutting, plants grew more vigorously. Against expectations, phenotypic plasticity was not higher in invasive populations, but even reduced in one trait, which may be attributable to ecological constraints imposed by multiple stress conditions. Trait responses reflected the range expansion and invasion gradient and were influenced by the latitudinal origin of populations. Populations of invaded ranges may be subject to faster and more extensive genetic mixing or had less time to undergo and reflect selective processes.

The study was carried out at Canchim Farm, CPPSE - Embrapa (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Soil samples were collected from the fragment in both the wet and dry seasons. An average of 307.8 seedlings/m(2) was found in the dry season and an average of 144 seedlings/m2 was found in the dry station. Twenty six species of trees with viable seeds were found in the soil, mostly pioneer species; among them, Cecropia glaziovi Snethlage was the most abundant pioneer species. The soil seed bank can be considered of great potential for regeneration due to the presence of pioneers, secondary and later species.

AB The increase in industrial forest plantations in southern Chile and the alteration of the landscape have been an ongoing concern of researchers. In this paper, spatial statistical techniques were used to describe the composition of the territorial patterns of forest plantations, in an area with a pulp mill and with high demand for exotic species such as Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus. GeoDa software was used to calculate global and local Moran indexes. Land-use cover data and the area of the forest plantation polygons updated in the period 20062013 were used. The global Moran index indicates that plantation distribution occurs as a random phenomenon throughout the territory. In its interior there are different structures, represented by enclaves of large areas, small polygons surrounded by others of great size and large polygons surrounded by small ones, as well as a fragmentation throughout the territory, composed of polygons of various sizes and neighborless. The dynamics of change in the period 2006-2013 indicates that plantation cover presented the largest increase (6,578 ha) due to the reduction in native forest and grassland-shrubland covers.

AB Dietary studies allow us to understand important ecological patterns such as intra- and interpopulation variation and interspecific differences regarding the use of food sources. Stable isotopes have been successfully employed to detect dietary differences between species and feeding shifts within a species, as a response to age, habitat use, and resource availability. Here we investigated the stable isotope compositions of carbon and nitrogen of young and adult specimens of Euryoryzomys russatus and Sooretamys angouya and their stomach contents, in a complex mosaic of vegetation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Isotopes indicated a pronounced inter- and intraspecific plasticity in resource use for E. russatus and S. angouya. Plant sources were the prevalent feeding itens for E. russatus, with low to intermediate consumption of arthropods. For S. angouya, plants were dominant in the stomach content, but arthropod arose as an important source. E. russatus showed more variation in isotopic signature between grids than S. angouya, suggesting that the former was more affected by habitat changes. These results allow us to better understand the ontogeny, diet and the behavioral responses to environmental variations of both species. Finally, our study contributes to reduce the lack of knowledge about sympatric species ecology and aggregates information for their conservation.

AB This paper presents the first comprehensive description of the ant fauna of Cambodia, most of which has not yet been extensively surveyed. The aim was to investigate ground-dwelling and arboreal ant fauna in three types of lowland forest in Cambodia and assess the bioindicator value of ant communities along forest disturbance gradient. The ground ant fauna was sampled by Winkler extraction, and the arboreal ant fauna by time unit sampling. A total of 101 ant species belonging to 40 genera in nine subfamilies was collected. Of these species, 41 were collected in the community forest (CF; habitat with high disturbance), 52 in regrowth forest (RF), and 61 in natural (undisturbed) forest (NF). Although the total species richness hence declined with the level of disturbance, it did not differ significantly among the three forest types. A comparison between ground and arboreal fauna showed an overlap of nine species (22%) in CF, 4 spp. (8%) in RF, and 7 spp. (11%) in NF. Non-metric multi dimensional scaling revealed that the ground ant fauna in CF greatly differed from the ground ant fauna in both RF and NF, which were rather similar in their species composition. Conversely, the arboreal ant fauna in the CF differed less from the arboreal ant fauna in RF and NF sites. However, there was much a higher occurrence of invasive ant species in CF than in the other forest types. The results suggest that higher level of disturbance due to logging and inundation common in community forests affects more the ground than arboreal ant fauna. The high number of ant species collected, well-defined vertical stratification of their communities, and the relatively high species turnover along the forest disturbance gradient confirm the importance of Cambodian lowland forests for biodiversity conservation programs and of the ants as usable indicator animal group of the disturbance.

AB Antarctic silverfish, Pleuragramma antarctica Boulenger 1902 are the most abundant pelagic fish over the high-Antarctic shelf and one of the main ecosystem links in Southern Ocean shelf ecosystems, where they are a key prey item for fish marine mammals and birds. Consequently, information on the feeding ecology of silverfish forms an important component of research to understand the structure of Antarctic shelf ecosystems.
   This chapter reviews what is known about the feeding of adult silverfish, what prey items make up the diet of adult silverfish and how the diet varies by fish size, geographic location and season. By "adult silverfish" we mean silverfish that are of a size where they are likely to have reached sexual maturity (greater than about 120 mm standard length).

Biodiversity being an important component of the mother earth renders valuable ecological services to all the compartments of the environment including coastal zone which is the interface of the land and sea and represents an eco-potential ecosystem along with its different geo-morphological components like estuaries, mangroves, dunes, deltas, lagoons, intertidal zones, etc. The present article focuses on the functional contribution of benthic biodiversity towards sustenance of a short but geo-morphologically diversified intertidal zones of coastal Midnapore (East) District, West Bengal, India which is in continuation of Sundarbans mangrove estuarine complex of India These benthic fauna, both macrobenthos (brachyuran crabs, molluscs, polycaetes, actiniarians etc.) and meiobenthos(nematodes, foraminifera, copepods, polychaetes etc.) render valuable ecological services by making sediments loaded with living organisms by bioturbation, releasing millions of benthic larvae (meroplankton) to the aquatic system as the food of fishes, converting mangrove leaves into detritus, releasing nutrients, ploughing sediments to maintain textural composition, acting as food for demerseal fishes, bioaccumulating pollutants, serving as bioindicator, and providing aesthetics.

AB Background: The combined analysis of species ranges allows the detection of overall species richness patterns. As such, the reliability of richness maps is directly related to the accuracy of individual range estimates.Aims: We compared how species ranges and richness patterns are influenced according to the use of different methods (convex hull and alpha hull) and evaluated if differences in range estimates are related to the Wallacean shortfall.Methods: We used occurrence records of 386 species from the tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) to build richness maps by stacking species ranges, using the convex hull and alpha hull methods. We evaluated the behaviour of the richness estimates in relation to other variables (i.e., other richness measures, environmental and spatial variables). We correlated the differences in range estimates to proxies of Wallacean shortfall (i.e., species description date and variation of pseudo-ranges generated by jack-knife).Results: Convex hull estimated larger ranges than alpha hull. The Wallacean shortfall affected range estimates equally regardless of the hull method used. Both hull methods generated similar richness maps. Richness estimates showed similar correlation patterns in relation to other variables regardless of the hull method used.Conclusions: Despite the slight differences in range estimates, both hull methods can be used in equivalence to map species richness.

AB Background: Natural disturbance is an important factor that contributes to structuring plant communities. In tropical mountain areas, landslides are frequent and could enhance the diversity in mountain forests. However, the spatial scale in which landslide affect diversity is not known.Aims: To investigate whether landslides affect taxonomic and functional diversity at different spatial scales. We tested if: (1) taxonomic and functional -diversity were lower in areas with landslide history; (2) the taxonomic -diversity was high while the functional -diversity was low in landslide-affected areas; and (3) plants in areas with landslide history would have, on average, smaller and thicker leaves, with greater pubescence, lower specific leaf area and higher dry matter content.Methods: At five sites in the Atlantic Forest, we sampled five 5mx5m plots in areas with recent landslide history (from 2 to 39years) and in adjacent control areas. We identified all juvenile trees (30-100 cm in height) and measured their leaf traits.Results: Taxonomic -diversity and functional -diversity and the occurrence of leaves with trichomes were greater in areas affected by landslide.Conclusion: The habitat heterogeneity in areas subject to recurrent landslides influenced the functional dispersion and the structuring of plant communities.

AB One of the major questions in ecology is how plant species coexist and thus how diversity is maintained. While there are many theories to explain the maintenance of plant species diversity, compelling empirical support exists for very few of them. Here we summarize four major putative theories to explain the maintenance of forest plant species diversity, each of which has ample empirical support. These theories are: 1) niche differentiation; 2) negative density dependence; 3) disturbance; and 4) neutral dynamics with respect to competition. We also present a literature review comprising 51 studies that explicitly examined the maintenance of plant species diversity, published between 2000 and 2015. In the literature review, we include only studies that stated, either as part of their introduction or in clearly stated objectives, that the hypothesis was the maintenance of diversity mechanism. We found that there has been a huge amount of progress in the research on the maintenance of species diversity. An overwhelming majority (all but three) found significant evidence for the mechanism that they tested. The large majority (64%) of the studies were conducted in tropical regions (27% in Panama alone). Trees were the main focal group, comprising 75% of the studies, 14% focused on shrubs, and 7% on lianas. Only 4% of the studies focused on non-woody plants. Seedlings were also a main focus, and 61% of the studies focused explicitly on the seedling life stage.
   Our findings lead us to conclude that the study of the maintenance of species diversity has progressed rapidly over the past 15 years. However, there is still a substantial amount of additional research to be done. Future studies may benefit from explicitly examining key theoretical requirements of the mechanism that they are investigating. The use of spatial and temporal heterogeneity may be critical and, in many cases, would improve the precision of the study. Most tests have focused on single plant groups and single mechanisms for the maintenance of species diversity, but moving into the future, a focus on multi-mechanism models for the maintenance of diversity using plant groups that differ in multiple axes of life-history strategy will be crucial to understanding how species coexist.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the ecological and successional aspects of a subtropical forest fragment by projection of the diameter distribution of different ecological groups, using transition matrix model. Based on measurements of 2009 and 2012 of all trees above 10 cm of DBH, projection of the diameter distribution as well as analysis of forest dynamic were made for three species groups: Pioneer; Non Pioneers, and the whole forest. Simulations of the dynamics of the groups were made until 2027 after method validation. The projection method was adherent in all cases, with higher precision when using the 5cm class interval. The analysis made indicated a gradual substitution tendency of the pioneer species, suggesting a successional advance in the forest fragment under study, as well as an efficiency of the projection method for dynamics analysis of the ecological groups studied.

AB Disturbance regimes and gap characteristics of the forest stands are the conceptual foundations for the core of silviculture. The gap characteristics and disturbance regime were investigated in an intact old-growth oriental beech stand in a forest reserve of Hyrcanian region, north of Iran. Seventy six canopy gaps were sampled at 5 transects 625 to 2000 m. The gap area was estimated using two field methods of measurement: elliptical (ELLIP) and non-convex polygonal (NOPO). The mean canopy gap fraction was 8.4% and 10.8% based on NOPO and ELLIP, respectively. The mean expanded gap fraction calculated by ELLIP (22.0%) was greater than that by NOPO (18.1%). Mean canopy gap size was 159 m(2) and 208.7 m(2) for NOPO and ELLIP methods, respectively. Mean expanded gap size was 515.7 m(2) and 626 m(2) for NOPO and ELLIP methods, respectively. Most of canopy gaps (68.4%) were smaller than 200 m(2), whereas only 1.4% was bigger than 500 m(2). Nearly 90% of number and area of whole expanded gaps belonged to classes of 200-1000 m(2). As canopy gap size increased the gap area-perimeter relationship was obviously differed from circular shape, indicating that gap geometry became more complex with gap size. The expanded gaps also followed this pattern, but in expanded gaps (< 450 m(2)) complexity was less than that in canopy gaps. The maximum of gap-makers was 6 trees per gap but 53% of gaps were formed by the death of two trees or more. Near 43% of gaps were expanded after initial gap formation, due to recurrence of disturbance events. The species composition of gap-makers was similar to those of gap border and forest canopy. We could not identify the mode of mortality of 12.3% gap-makers; however, 60.4% and 19.3% of them were snapped-alive and uprooted, respectively. Exogenous agents such as chronic winds could have a prominent role in initial formation and expansion of gaps.

AB The composition and quality of the seed bank are some of the factors responsible for the structure and floristic composition of forest environments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seed bank of a semideciduous forest patch, taking into account the influence of the landscape's topographical features. Two adjacent landforms, of convex and concave shapes, were selected. They were divided into mini sites (MS) I, II, and III in the convex landform and IV, V and VI in the concave one. Ten sample points on each MS were randomly distributed with a surface area of 0.0625 m(2) and 3 cm deep. A total of 4,862 germinated seeds. m(-1) was registered in 90 days, with the convex landform presenting the highest frequency of germinated seeds. m(-1). A total of 35 families and 88 species were identified in both landforms, of which 37% were of herbaceous habit, 24% arboreal, 18% shrubs, 12% lianas and 2% epiphytic. Regarding the landform's shape, 44% of the species were found in both convex and concave ones, 31% were found exclusively on the convex landform and 25% exclusively on the concave one. Regarding floristic and phytosociological parameters, the convex landform accounted for a higher number of seeds, families, and species richness, while the concave landform accounted for higher diversity. Topography was a determinant factor for the floristic and phytosociological composition of the seed bank. The highest species richness was recorded in the convex landform and highest diversity in the concave landform, with Asteraceae, Melastomataceae and Urticaceae families presenting the highest importance indexes of value.

AB The article presents generalized data on the variability of reproductive parameters of leguminous plants (Fabaceae Lind., 1836), growing in the gradient of habitat transformation in Kazan. The range of variability of potential productivity indicators, the actual productivity of six main kinds of leguminous plants are shown. The features of variability of seeds failure at different stages of development are given. It was shown, that the greatest rate of mortality at the early stages of development (seed bud) was characteristic for populations, growing under conditions of intense anthropogenic press. Failure at later stages of development (underdeveloped seeds) was more typical for populations, growing in less transformed habitats. On the basis of long-term data, it was shown, that there was the common pattern of decreasing the actual fecundity rate with increasing the gradient of life environment urbanization. It was concluded, that monitoring of the reproductive parameters of leguminous plants should be used to indicate the state of the environment under the conditions of large city.

AB The different microhabitats provided by seagrasses and the habit of the species determinate the vertical distribution of crustaceans. This study verified the influence of the seasonality on the spatial distribution of the crustacean community associated with a Halodule wrightii meadow. From April 2006 to July 2007, we performed fifteen samplings in Goiabeiras Beach, Ceara State, each with five sectioned replicates in belowground and aboveground. Cumaceans and the amphipod Hyale media (Dana, 1853) had a higher frequency, density, and dominance than the other taxa, in both strata. The community exhibited gradual changes along the study, in both the belowground and aboveground strata, but the seagrass structure was not sufficient to explain the vertical distribution of the crustacean fauna along the time.

AB There are many patterns of coexistence in communities, including partitioning based on spatial, temporal, or food niches. This study considered the partitioning of food between two ecologically similar and sympatric species, the tamarisk gerbil and the midday gerbil, in the Terek-Kuma Lowland of the Republic of Daghestan. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the diets of both gerbils were revealed. The species have relatively wide diets; the tamarisk gerbil's diet consisted of forty-six plant species, and the midday gerbil's diet consisted of fifty plant species within the study areas. Thirty plant species were present in the diets of the two gerbils. The dietary breadths of both gerbils were similar. The dietary overlap of the two gerbils ranged from low to moderate (average Pianka's dietary overlap index, 0.476 +/- 0.08). Finally, under conditions in which food resources are sufficient, the moderate abundance of gerbils and the high diversity of habitats and microhabitats in the study areas allow these two species of gerbils to coexist in a common location.

AB Remnant forest fragments provide an opportunity for conservation in fragmented landscapes but some patches are more useful than others. Forest fragments around Budongo Forest Reserve, an Important Bird Area in western Uganda, were surveyed to explore the effects of different aspects of habitat fragmentation on bird guild composition. We recorded 1 128 individuals of 75 bird species over 7 056 net hours. The greatest number of birds and species were recorded in the forest fragments that were large, near to the continuous forest and surrounded by subsistence farmland. However, rarefied species richness was not affected by distance, size or matrix type; instead, forest specialist species were replaced by generalists and visitors with increasing fragmentation. The proportion of forest specialists and of terrestrial insectivores decreased with distance from the main forest, canopy openness and matrix intensity but not with fragment area. The findings show that bird assemblages vary in their response to habitat fragmentation but within guilds the response to fragmentation can be consistent, and can make ecological sense. Forest bird conservation can therefore benefit from information on species ecology when deciding which bird species and which parts of the landscape are to be prioritised for conservation or monitoring purposes.

AB Temporal, spatial, and trophic niche differentiation usually occurs among species living in similar habitats which can reduce interspecific competition under limited resources. Eucryptorrhynchus scrobiculatus and Eucryptorrhynchus brandti are sympatric and closely related species and are host-specific to Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle in China. However, the possibility of niche differentiation between the two species is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the density of the two weevils temporally, spatially, and trophically (plant parts of A. altissima) at Lingwu farm and Haojiaqiao town, Lingwu city, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. No differences were found in temporal Levin's niche breath index values ranging from 3.74 to 3.95 and temporal Pianka's niche overlap values (0.98-0.99). There was little differentiation in the vertical spatial niche. The vertical distribution of E. scrobiculatus was mainly located from 0cm (ground) to over 250cm on tree-of-heaven. Eucryptorrhynchus brandti was found predominantly from 0.1 to 50cm to over 250cm on tree-of-heaven. The overlap of the cardinal direction spatial niche was 0.90-0.98, indicating no significant overlap in the cardinal direction at Lingwu farm and Haojiaqiao town. Significant differentiation of trophic niche occurred with E. scrobiculatus feeding on 1-year-old branches, perennial branches, and petioles, while E. brandti feed on the stem.

AB Cloud forests are amongst the world's most impacted and endangered forest types, with Mexican cloud forests amongst the most degraded. These species rich forests are characterized by a diversity of congeneric oak species which dominate the canopy of mature forests. An improved understanding of the establishment requirements of oak seedlings in cloud forests is needed for conservation and restoration purposes. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of light conditions during early establishment of three endangered Quercus species. Seedling growth and biomass allocation in Quercus insignis M. Martens & Galeotti, Q. sartorii Liebm. and Q. xalapensis Bonpl. was determined under two light levels: light gap (1338 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and closed canopy (118 mu mol m(-2) S-1) in a cloud forest in Veracruz, Mexico. Growth and development were evaluated over the first 13 months. Results suggest there was a significant effect of light conditions on growth rate and biomass allocation. Although survival rate was similar among both environments, the three species showed lower growth rates under the closed canopy during the first nine months, while elongation rate was higher during the last three months under this environment compared to the light gap. Across all species, fresh biomass and dry biomass of roots, stem and leaves were almost 50% higher in light gap than under closed canopy. Q. insignis produced more biomass in shoots and roots than Q. sartorii and Q. xalapensis, which may increase its establishment success in shaded conditions. Results suggest that these three oak species are suited to planting in small gaps, but also in shaded understory conditions, as high early survival (>90%) may allow enrichment planting in advance of gap creation.

AB Ipanema National Forest, southeastern Brazil, once contained 340 bird species. Forest cover suffered for centuries from log exploitation and, as a result, most of the remaining forests are now an impoverished subset of the original vegetation. We show how the bird community changed over time by comparing historical and recent records. Currently, 228 species can be recorded, for a compilation of 410 species, of which 359 are documented. Some 89 forest species with historical records failed to be detected in recent surveys. Of the 72 Atlantic Forest or Cerrado endemic species, no more than 29 (40%) are still found. The bird community changed from one which used to be related to coastline rain forests to another, which relates more to drier semideciduous forests of the interior.

AB In central Amazonia, annual rainfall distribution is characterized by a short mild dry season which is associated with a slight increase in irradiance and decline in relative humidity, but the effect of variations in these variables on tree growth is still unclear. The objective of this study was to determine how tree growth responds to monthly variations in some climate variables in central Amazonia. Trees of Protium hebetatum Daly (18-20 m tall) and Eschweilera collina Eyma (19-27 m tall) were used in the study and monthly growth rates were measured during 36 months (2010-2012). We also measured irradiance, temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity (RH). Eschweilera and Protium grew at similar rates (0.0557 mm month-1). Temperature and irradiance had no effect on tree growth of these species, but there was a trend for tree growth to increase with increasing both monthly rainfall and minimum relative humidity. If the dry season becomes longer and dryer in response to climate change one can expect that trees currently sensitive to mild drought stress will be the more affected.

AB Forest fragmentation threatens bird species throughout the world. Previous studies suggest that the sensitivity of bird species to forest fragmentation is related to food abundance, and that this could be a key factor in understanding demographic changes. We assessed the relationship between forest fragment size, isolation and food abundance and the abundance of seven common species of birds in southern Chaco forests of Argentina, which use different food items, and are involved in different ecosystem processes. The relative abundance of Turdus amaurochalinus (Creamy-bellied Thrush) and Saltator aurantiirostris (Golden-billed Saltator) significantly decreased with patch size reduction, whereas the relative abundance of Taraba major (Great Antshrike) decreased with patch isolation and increased with arthropod abundance. Chlorostilbon lucidus (Glittering-bellied Emerald), Elaenia parvirostris (Small-billed Elaenia), Polioptila dumicola (Masked Gnatcatcher) and Zonotrichia capensis (Rufous-collared Sparrow) appeared to be resilient to forest fragmentation. Body size was a good predictor of bird sensitivity, as only the largest species were negatively correlated with forest fragmentation. Previous work suggests that birds inhabiting Chaco forests may be resilient to forest fragmentation. This needs to be reconsidered in the light of our results since the abundance of three out of seven common bird species was negatively related to forest fragmentation.

AB Fire is frequently used in the management of pastures in southern Brazil, but its effects on ground-dwelling ant communities in Brazilian subtropical grasslands is still poorly understood. Here, we compared ant species richness and composition between periodically burned and unburned areas in native grasslands of the Atlantic Forest biome. In total, we found 35 epigeic ant species in burned and unburned areas. There was slightly higher species richness in burned than in unburned areas, independent of the sampling period (season). There was a significant difference in richness over the sampling period (season effect). Species composition varied significantly between the areas, in which nine species (26%) occurred only in burned areas, eight (23%) occurred only in unburned areas, and 18 (51%) occurred in both. Four species showed a significant preference for burned sites (Camponotus crassus, Linepithema humile and two undetermined species of Pheidole and Solenopsis). Although this study did not separate fire effects on ground-dwelling ant communities (due to sampling design), it provides new information regarding subtropical native grasslands that can be used as a baseline for future studies.

AB Aim of study: Incentivising landowners to supply ecosystem services remains challenging, especially when this requires long-term investments such as reforestation. We investigated how landowners perceive, and would respond to, distinct types of incentives for planting diverse native trees on private lands in Lebanon. Our aim was to understand landowners' attitudes towards hypothetical Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) contracts options; their likely participation; and the potential additionality they would provide.
   Area of study: Highland villages situated within eight of Lebanon's 20 Important Plant Areas.
   Material and methods: Mixed-methods surveys were conducted with 34 landowners to determine past, present and future land-use strategies. Study participants were presented with three differently structured reforestation contract options (or schemes). The three schemes (results-based loan, action-based grant, and results-based payments) differed in their expected risks and benefits to landowners. Qualitative debriefing questions followed each of the schemes presented.
   Main results: Although the results-based loan did deter uptake relative to the lower risk action-based grant, results-based payments did not significantly increase uptake or planting area, suggesting asymmetric attitudes to risk. Qualitative probing revealed economic, social (e.g. trust) and institutional factors (e.g. legal implications of planting forest trees on private land) that limited willingness to participate in the results-based contract option.
   Research highlights: This study demonstrates the importance of combining qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand landowner perceptions of incentives and risks, particularly in challenging socio-political contexts.

AB Knowledge of bird diets is important to understand population fluctuations and the persistence of bird communities in changing landscapes. However, there is a general lack of quantitative information about the composition of bird diets at the community level in the Neotropics. Although consumption of fruits and seeds by birds has been well documented for forest ecosystems in southern South America, consumption of arthropods has received less attention, despite their relevance in bird diets. Here we describe and evaluate the presence and diversity of arthropods consumed by members of different dietary guilds of the avian community from temperate forests and rural landscapes in northern Chiloe Island, Chile (42 degrees S). We estimated the proportion of arthropods consumed by all bird species captured using mist nests in a mixed rural landscape, and identified arthropods at the order level, based on remains contained in bird droppings. In addition, we estimated trophic diversity for those bird species with the highest number of samples. Arthropod remains were prevalent in dropping contents for nearly all sampled species (17 out of 18 captured species), indicating that arthropod consumption is broadly distributed in the avian assemblage. The insectivorous Chilean swallow (Tachycineta leucopyga) had the highest average number of arthropods per sample but the lowest arthropod diversity. On the contrary, the highest arthropod diversity in droppings corresponded to the insectivorous House Wren (Troglodytes aedon). The omnivorous species, Austral Blackbird (Curaeus curaeus) and White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps) consumed mainly Coleoptera. Finally, arthropod orders found in droppings varied among bird species from the same and between dietary guilds.

AB Taeniopoda is a genus of grasshoppers currently represented by 12 species distributed from southern USA to Panama, with most of them occurring along the transitional Nearctic-Neotropical region in central and southern Mexico. Despite being a small group of conspicuous, colourful species, the systematics of Taeniopoda has been largely neglected, including its phylogenetic affinity with the morphologically similar, monotypic genus Romalea. Here, we assessed the species limits in 11 of the species of Teniopoda based on two mitochondrial (mt) markers (COI, cyt b). Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed adding two nuclear gene markers (28S, H3). A relaxed molecular clock analysis was performed based on the mt markers. We detected nuclear mt paralogues (numts) and the probable introgression of T. tamaulipensis mtDNA in specimens of T. eques from central Mexico. Between six and 14 species of Taeniopoda were delimited by the sequencebased approaches performed (COI divergence with thresholds of 1 and 2%; General Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) model). The GMYC and 1% threshold analyses with COI were more congruent with the currently recognized morphologybased taxonomy with 10 and 11 putative species, respectively. Four of these species were regarded as 'stable', since they were supported by at least one of the molecular analyses and by diagnostic morphological features. The species-based phylogeny recovered Taeniopoda as paraphyletic with respect to the monotypic genus Romalea. Three morphologically and geographically congruent major clades were recovered, two with species having a considerably elevated pronotal crest and one with its members having it less elevated. The origin and subsequent diversification of Taeniopoda were estimated to occur from the mid and late Miocene to Pliocene, respectively. The current species diversity in Taeniopoda was estimated to occur during the Pleistocene, which was probably influenced by the climatic oscillations that occurred during this period and the uplift of mountain ranges in Central America.

   ANALYSIS
AB The feeding habits of Makaira nigricans, Kajikia audax, Istiophorus platypterus (Istiophoridae), and Xiphias gladius (Xiphiidae) in the southeast Pacific Ocean were examined in Manta and Santa Rosa, Ecuador. This study describes the diets of these billfish species, evaluates dietary differences between species, and assesses seasonal differences in diet. A total of 274 M. nigricans, 321 K. audax, 267 I. platypterus, and 252 X. gladius were collected between February 2014 and April 2015. The scombrid Auxis spp. was the most important prey for M. nigricans, K. audax and I. platypterus, while the squid Dosidicus gigas was the most important prey for X. gladius. The results of the ANOSIM confirmed significant differences in feeding habits between the members of the family Istiophoridae and X. gladius. Seasonal differences for I. platypterus also were observed. Billfishes are specialist consumers with a narrow niche breadth (B-a : M. nigricans and K. audax=0.1, I. platypterus=0.05, and X. gladius=0.04).

ID CONSERVATION VALUE; STEPPING-STONES; LANDSCAPE; ABUNDANCE
AB Small forest fragments may play a major role in fragmented areas, but there is scarce empirical data to test this hypothesis. To understand in which context birds can use small Atlantic Forest fragments, we tested the presence of 11 bird species in 30 small fragments (4-10 ha), in a range of matrices (eucalyptus pasture), and in different landscape configurations. The results showed that landscape composition is a good predictor for presence of birds in small fragments and their use can be further associated with matrix type. Considering the number of species, and the species Chiroxiphia caudata, we found a pattern in which models that consider the matrix composition are the most plausible. Relative importance of the variables indicates that matrix is the most important single variable among the selected species (five among eight). This suggests that small fragments are effective for increasing connectivity, mainly in landscapes with a higher percentage of permeable matrix.

AB Global food security is one if the major issues that needs utmost attention of the scientific community in near future. The growing food demand of the society is putting enormous pressure on the resources over which the food supply of the civilization depends. The two major components affecting the global food security are population and global climate change. The rate at which the population of the World is increasing, the food production needs to be doubled to meet the growing requirements. Consequences of global climate change not only reduce the productivity of major staple crops, but also cause destruction of the arable land that can be used for agricultural purposes. The present chapter discusses the effects of population increase and climate change upon food production, which will play a significant role in food security around the globe in near future.

AB Birds are highly susceptible to habitat fragmentation, traffic noise, roadkills, and other disturbances generated by the presence of roads. These impacts are manifested in the structure of bird communities and are mainly noticed near road edges. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a road on a savannah bird community in southern Brazil. The study was carried out within the Espinilho State Park (ESP), Rio Grande do Sul state. The ESP is divided by a road and we quantified bird abundance and richness along three transects, parallel to the road at different distances from it (T1: 10 m, T2: 250 m, T3: 500 m). To estimate bird richness and abundance we sampled five point counts along each transect. Sampling took place throughout the month of January 2015, during the summer. Bird species were categorized according to their feeding habits and habitat use. Richness and abundance increased with greater distance from the road. Transects closer to the roads were less similar than those more distant from the road. Insectivore species and species that use grassland and Espinilho habitat were less common in transects nearest the road. Our data indicate that road edges alter the species composition and structure of the bird community in the ESP, although our limited temporal sampling means that our results should be treated as preliminary. This effect is due to some species being attracted by the road whereas others avoid it or decline. Based on our findings, we reinforce the recommendation that roads should be avoided near or within areas destined for conservation. If roads must be built within or around protected areas, studies on the impact of these roads and possible mitigation measures are essential and urgent.

AB The returning of mineral contents and organic matter to the soil as litterfall is one of the most essential ecological process that contributes to the nutrient cycles and provides enough nutrients to plants for a healthy growth. The fallen leaves from urban forests of the cities of San Juan and Mendoza, Argentina are frequently collected especially during the autumn season with a loss of great quantity of litterfall every year. High amounts of nutrients and organic matter are exported from the urban ecosystem without completing the mineral nutrient cycle. The aim of this work is to evaluate the variation in foliar mineral and organic matter contents along seasons (spring, summer and autumn) for the two most abundant non-native species: Morus alba and Platanus hispanica located in the urban forests of the central-western part of Argentina, and the effect of the periodical leaf removal in urban areas. Differences in mineral and organic matter contents were found along the seasons. Foliar concentration losses follow the order of magnitude: N > Mg > P>K > Na. This research is a contribution to a more adequate understanding of the urban ecosystem patterns and dynamics, and it means to be helpful in the management and conservation practices of urban ecosystems.

AB Payments for Hydrologic Services (PHS) programs are increasingly used as a policy tool to provide incentives for upstream landowners to adopt land use activities that favor sustainable provision of high-quality water to downstream areas. However, the effectiveness of PHS programs in achieving their objectives and the potential for unintended (often undesirable) consequences remain poorly understood. We integrate results from ecohydrological and socioeconomic research to explore the impact of Mexico's PHS program on the target hydrologic services and people's decisions, behavior, and knowledge regarding forest conservation and water. Using central Veracruz as our case study, we identify areas of both synchrony and disconnection between PHS goals and outcomes. Mature and regenerating cloud forests (targeted by PHS) were found to produce enhanced hydrologic services relative to areas converted to pasture, including reduced peak flows during large rain events and maintenance of dry-season base flows. However, unexpectedly, these hydrologic benefits from cloud forests were not necessarily greater than those from other vegetation types. Consequently, the location of forests in strategic watershed positions (e.g., where deforestation risk or hydrologic recharge are high) may be more critical than forest type in promoting hydrologic functions within watersheds and should be considered when targeting PHS payments. While our results suggest that participation in PHS improved the level of knowledge among watershed inhabitants about forest-water relationships, a mismatch existed between payment amounts and landowner opportunity costs, which may contribute to the modest success in targeting priority areas within watersheds. Combined, these findings underscore the complexity of factors that influence motivations for PHS participation and land use decisions and behavior, and the importance of integrating understanding of both ecohydrological and socioeconomic dynamics into PHS design and implementation. We conclude by identifying opportunities for improving the design of PHS programs and recommending priority areas for future research and monitoring, both in Mexico and globally.

AB Compensation payments can allow or support nature protection instead of conventional forest management. The Forest Act of Slovakia enables agreement about compensation payments for special purpose forest management. Four management options were simulated for individual stands forming the Great Polom Nature Reserve and its buffer zone in northwest Slovakia. Compensation payments were estimated for change from management option "Conventional Management" towards "Alternative Management" meaning transition to selection forests, special "Forest Reserve Management" combining reserve and buffer zones, and "No Management" as a control reflecting just natural processes. Financial single net cash flows of different types of cutting operations was estimated with the single-tree simulator Sibyla. The study integrates a financial silvicultural model for simulation of stand establishment and young stand development including costs for planting and tending. When all stand generations in the study region were considered, afforestation and tending costs reduced compensation payments for managed options compared to the unmanaged option. Assumption for calculation of compensation payment considered only stand generations which were existing at the beginning of the contract period while following generation of young stands regenerated during this period were excluded from the financial calculation. The contract period comprised 45 years. In relation to "Conventional Management", compensation payment was 25 (sic)/ha/year for "Alternative Management" towards selection forest, 70 (sic)/ha/year for change to special "Forest Reserve Management" and 129 (sic)/ha/year for change to "No Management". Only long contract periods enable objective estimation of financial differences between conventional management and alternative opportunities, because short term results were biased by specific developments related to age structure of mature stands. When the contract period is much shorter than rotation, afforestation and tending should not to be carried out to avoid costs, because income from such investments could not be achieved within the contract period. Only cycles of one stand rotation will substantially change age and size structure and therefore can support nature protection.

AB The livestock sector provides more than one-third of human protein needs and is a major provider of livelihood in almost all developing countries. While providing such immense benefits to the population, poor livestock management can potentially provide harmful environmental impacts at local, regional, and national levels which have not been adequately addressed in many countries with emerging economies. Twenty-six percent of global land area is used for livestock production and forest lands are continuously being lost to such activities. Land degradation through soil erosion and nutrient depletion is very common across pastures and rangelands. The intensification of livestock production led to large surpluses of on-farm nitrogen and phosphorus inputs that can potentially contribute to nonpoint source pollution of water resources in many parts of the world. The sector is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributing around 14.5% of all human-induced GHG emissions, a major driver of use and pollution of freshwater (accounting 10% anthropogenic water use) and a contributor to the loss of biodiversity. About 60% of global biomass harvested annually to support all human activity is consumed by livestock industry, undermining the sustainability of allocating such large resource to the industry. Despite the negative impacts of livestock production, opportunities exist to balance the competing demands of livestock production and the environment. These include (1) improved technologies and practices that increase livestock productivity with optimal use of land and water, (2) reorienting grazing systems to provide environmental services for water, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and resource conservation, (3) reducing GHG emission from livestock production, and (4) an effective management strategy for efficient and sustainable use of manure in livestock production. Further research, appropriate policy development, and institutional support are important to ensure the competitiveness of the industry. Integration of crops with livestock production provides opportunities for increasing resource use efficiencies and reducing environmental pollution, making the system resilient to impacts of climate change, reducing GHG emissions from the system, enhancing soil quality and fertility, and improving water quantity and quality. Appropriate techniques for assessing and monitoring impacts of livestock production are necessary for developing strategies and making the system profitable, sustainable, and resilient. Isotopic and nuclear techniques play an important role in such assessment and monitoring.

AB Over the last few years, most areas of Iran including Golestan province have posed considerable risks to human use and future development. Therefore, several reliable techniques are required to quantify, monitor and update land use maps of these areas to explore rates of environmental retreats. In this study, Landsat-8 ETM+imageries of 2013 were consequently processed via Object Based Image Classification (OBIC) as an advanced approach and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) as a conventional pixel based approaches to classify land use in Golestan province in Northeastern of Iran using an ENVI 4.8 and eCognition software packages. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficients were calculated to assess these approaches, which were respectively 94.69% and 0.93 for OBIC and 81.53% and 0.75 for MLC. In addition, accuracy rate over 85% indicates satisfactory for land use mapping and planning purposes. Our result showed that pixel-based classification approach do not lead to sufficiently accurate land use maps; and land use mapping using OBIC approach provides better classification accuracy especially when we have an extensive study area. Thus, development of this approach is appropriate for satellite images with moderate resolution.

AB Reliable information on tree growth is a prerequisite for sustainable forest management (SFM). However, in tropical forests its implementation is often hampered by insufficient knowledge of the growth dynamics of trees. Although tree ring analysis of tropical trees has a long history, its application for SFM has only recently been considered. In the current study, we illustrate both the potentials and limitations of a retrospective growth assessment by tree ring analysis under the prevailing tropical conditions in a Surinamese rain forest. For this purpose, 38 commercial tree species were screened and grouped into three categories according to the visibility of their tree ring boundaries: (I) tree rings absent or indistinct, (II) distinct but partially vague tree rings which enable approximate age estimation, (III) very distinct tree rings. In 22 out of 38 commercial tree species distinct to very distinct tree ring boundaries could be identified. The anatomy of tree ring boundaries was described following Worbes and Fichtler (2010). Four species with distinct growth rings, Cedrela odorata, Hymenaea courbaril, Pithecellobium corymbosum and Goupia glabra, were studied in greater detail. Time-series analysis was used to characterise their radial growth. From the tree ring width, the annual diameter increment and cumulative diameter growth were calculated to find long-term growth patterns. Pithecellobium corymbosum and partially Hymenaea courbaril followed a typical S-shaped growth curve. By contrast, Goupia glabra and Cedrela odorata did not exhibit an age-related decrease of growth, but showed a constant linear growth over their entire life span. If based on more sample trees, such data can provide target-oriented information for improving SFM in tropical forests.

AB Silicified woods from near the town of Ocu on the Azuero Peninsula, Panama were first reported by Stern and Eyde in 1963; however, the significance of these fossils has been largely overlooked. Well-characterized fossil floras from Central America can be used to test hypotheses related to the historical biogeography and paleoclimate of the Neotropics. We describe 10 new wood types and one palm based on 22 samples from Oligo-Miocene deposits. Affinities at the family/order level include Fabaceae, Lauraceae, Moraceae, Sapotaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Arecaceae, Sapindales, Ericales, and Humiriaceae. The fossil woods are fragmentary and have not been found in-place, but the size and angularity of the specimens suggests minimal transport from the site of growth. We compared these woods with calcareous woods from the Lower Miocene Cucaracha Formation and silicified woods from the upper Miocene Alajuela Formation using Rare Earth Element (REE) analysis to test the hypothesis that the Ocu woods were preserved under uniform conditions and not reworked. Although the results were ambiguous with respect to the original hypothesis, we note that the REE concentrations in silicified woods are much lower than in calcareous woods. We used comparative analysis of wood anatomical features to draw conclusions about the paleoclimate from the fossil flora. All the dicot woods are diffuse porous and none have distinct growth rings; some have very wide vessels at low frequencies. These features are typical of canopy trees in tropical lowland forests. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of wood anatomical characters from a variety of communities and ecological categories showed that the anatomy of the Ocu woods is most similar to that found in tropical rainforests. Based on the combination of taxonomic identity and functional anatomy, we interpret these fossils as evidence for humid to perhumid megathermal climate in Panama during the late Paleogene-early Neogene.

AB We investigated the population ecology of Triunia robusta (C.T. White) Foreman, an endemic rainforest shrub of south-east Queensland, Australia. Two-time demographic data from 1999 and 2010 were used to estimate the species life span and changes in demographic factors over the 11 year period. The potential dispersal vectors and their activities were monitored, and the effects of predation on seed and seedling mortality were quantified. Published genetic data was used to assess the gene flow distance in years. On average, T. robusta has a life span of 103 years, with a generation time of 44 years. Larger populations (>200) increased in size since 1999, whereas smaller populations retained the same or slightly reduced numbers. Small, isolated populations in the northern distribution range showed substantially lower reproductive rates. Local rodents and marsupials were considered responsible for the majority of observed secondary seed dispersal (<10.3m) and predation activities. Post-predation mortality was high (82%), with only 12% surviving to become seedlings. The empirical evidence of short-distance dispersal, limited gene flow, high post-predation mortality rates and relatively low reproductive rates, combined with potential absence of primary dispersers suggests that critically small and isolated populations may be highly vulnerable.

AB Calafate (Berberis microphylla G. Forst.) is a spontaneous shrub grown in the Patagonian region, from which berries are traditionally harvested for different purposes. This study aims to investigate on the spatial genetic structure of calafate populations grown in southern Tierra del Fuego and their morphological and genetic diversity. A first step of the research focused on 23 putative populations screened by a landscape genetic approach based on 82 geo-referenced and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA marker characterized plants. The second phase regarded the analysis of the morphological characteristics of fruits, shoots and leaves observed on a subset of 39 plants. Taking into account multiple similarity between pairs and sub-sets of accessions, the observed differences have been associated to geographical and environmental conditions. The results allowed to postulate the existence of homogeneous populations within the studied plant sets and to formulate hypothesis on the evolution of B. microphylla in that area. No association between genetic and morphologic distances of the accessions has been observed.

AB Global change has led to the warming of the atmosphere and oceans, the diminishment of snow and ice, while the sea level is rising. These changes have widespread impacts on human and natural systems on all continents and across the oceans. In tropical regions, ecosystems and socio-economic cultures become more and more affected by the high vulnerability to extreme climate events, deforestation and population growth. Therefore long term climate records from these regions are needed to better understand the natural climate variability and to simulate the magnitude of human-induced factors on climate change. However, climate records from tropical regions are scarce in time and space. Whenever tree growth is limited directly or indirectly by climate variables that can be quantified and dated, dendroclimatological methods can be used to reconstruct past environmental conditions -dendroclimatology examines the relationship between tree growth and climate with an annual resolution. Dendroclimatology in the tropics still remains in an early stage, although paleoclimatic records from tropical regions are essential to our understanding of past changes in the Earth's climatic system, equator-to-pole linkages, and the prediction of sensitivity of tropical regions to future climate change. This review gives an overview on different aspects of tropical dendroclimatology on classical ring width studies in broad-leaved species, looking at two tropical biomes, moist broadleaf and dry broadleaf forests. It points to technical aspects of tropical dendrochronology and refers to a multitude of successful tree-ring studies of tropical species related to climate. This demonstrates that tropical dendroclimatology is undergoing a promising development; however, tropical tree-ring studies mainly take place in the dry tropics, while studies in the wet tropical forests are still the exception.

AB A tropical tree-ring study is presented using 36 specimens of Cariniana estrellensis from the Mata Atlantica Biome within the State of Sao Paulo: Caetetus and Carlos Botelho. We aimed to assess the suitability of this species for chronology building, as well as for dendroclimatological studies, with the help of its lifetime growth trajectories. Cariniana estrellensis forms visible tree rings with a dense sequence of parenchyma bands at the end of the latewood, followed by a relatively distant sequence of parenchyma bands in the subsequent early wood of a tree ring. However, it was impossible to establish a chronology, solely by tree-ring width measurements and crossdating, for a number of reasons, including sequences of problematic wood anatomy, abundance of wedging rings and probably missing rings. Therefore, building a robust chronology for this species requires a multi-parameter approach, however, no experience is currently available. Therefore, to reveal possible climate-growth relationships for Cariniana estrellensis at both sites, we tested to correlation analyses of microclimatic conditions with tree growth and investigated patterns of lifetime growth trajectories. Annual precipitation is over 1300 mm at both sites, with the dry season primarily between June and August. Both sites showed clear differences in their microclimatic regime and topography. Overall, light availability is the most likely crucial factor for the studied species. A significantly lower photosynthetic active radiation and daily photoperiod was found at Carlos Botelho by the strong influence of orographic rainfall, foggy conditions and shade caused by the adjacent mountain chain. Consequently, trees at this site generally showed a lower average annual growth rate as compared to the Caetetus site with differences between juvenile and mature growth phases remaining nearly constant throughout their lives. In contrast, trees from Caetetus had less consistent growth phases, with increased growth after the juvenile growth phase. Thus, it can be concluded that dendroclimatological studies using growth characteristics have the potential to clarify the generally complex stand dynamics of Cariniana estrellensis. However, the development of tree-ring chronologies, based on tree-ring width analyses of cores or discs is nearly impossible.

AB Tree ring patterns provide one of the best records of pre-instrumental environmental and climate variability. To date, tree ring chronologies were explored from woody plant species with C-3 photosynthetic pathway, only. For the first time, we have studied wood growth periodicity and stable carbon isotope ratios of tree ring cellulose of a tree species with C-4 photosynthesis and compared these data to those of a C-3 tree species from the same habitat. The investigated species, Mamane (Sophora chrysophylla, C-3) and 'Akoko (Euphorbia olowaluana, C-4), are small endemic Hawaiian trees sampled from a rather dry, high elevation site on the ridge between Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea on the island of Hawai'i, USA. A relatively strong correlation in ring patterns was found within the 'Akoko and the Mamane individuals as well as with ring-width patterns from a nearby population of introduced Deodar cedar (Cedrus deodara) trees that serve as a reference. This correlation is evidence that the C-4-plant'Akoko may form annual growth rings. In addition to being the first demonstration of annual growth rings in a C-4 plant, our findings have important implications for future climate change research in Hawai'i. Unlike plants with a C3-photosynthetic pathway, C-4 plants do not show strong discrimination against C-13 during the photosynthetic fixation of CO2. Thus, 'Akoko may provide a record of past atmospheric CO2 concentration (CO2 atm) that can be compared with, and possibly supplement, the well-known Keeling curve produced by the nearby Mauna Loa Atmospheric Observatory. Regression analysis indicates a significant relationship between 'Akoko delta C-13 averages and atmospheric delta C-13 values. Furthermore, time series of tree ring data from both species provide long-term information on the response of C-3 and C-4-plants to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate change. Trends in delta C-13 (intrinsic water-use efficiency, iWUE) of the two species show similar responses in that both demonstrate an increase in iWUE over time and with increased CO2 atm. 'Akoko and Mamane iWUE curves are different however, in that the 'Akoko (C-4) curve is non-linear and a significant increase could only be observed post 1975, while the Mamane curve shows a distinct linearly increasing trend throughout the observation period.

AB Light intensity is among the major environmental factors determining the ecological distribution of any plant. The effects of light availability on aquatic plants continue to be discussed, as some species show higher growth under full sun conditions and other species show reduced growth. The aim of this study was to test the effects of different shade levels on ramets and clonal growth of the fern Salvinia auriculata. We hypothesized that the ramets grow better under shade conditions over time as in most land ferns. We performed a greenhouse experiment, putting plants under three treatments: control (0% shade), 30% shade, and 70% shade. We monitored the growth of individual ramets as well as clonal spread for 30 days. The number of new ramets (clonal growth) increased exponentially in the three treatments, however this number was higher in shade than in full sun plots. The size of floating leaves, submerged leaves, and rhizomes was higher under shade treatments compared to individuals under sun treatment. Our results showed that S. auriculata has a high growth performance under shade environments, including both clonal growth and the size of individual ramets, similar to most land ferns. This species appears highly plastic as it also thrives under bright sun, which appears to be a consistent pattern among fern species in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Because shade has been proposed as a treatment to control and manage aquatic plants, application of this treatment should be carefully considered depending of the species, especially when it involves aquatic fern species.

AB During the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries several renowned researchers-e.g., C. Darwin, J. Dana, A. Agassiz, A. E. Verrill, and T. W. Vaughan-remarked on the absence of coral reefs in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP), concluding this was due mainly to the influence of cool currents and upwelling centers. From later surveys in southern Mexico in the 1920s (R. H. Palmer), and the Allan Hancock Expeditions across the eastern tropical Pacific in the 1930s (C. Wyatt Durham), workers began to recognize the presence of modest structural coral reef development at several sites in the ETP. A new era of coral reef studies began in the 1970s, and has increased in pace and intellectual depth to the present. This latest surge in coral science was a result of locally active researchers, especially in Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, and more recently in Ecuador and Chile. Progress in coral research in El Salvador and Nicaragua was thwarted from the 1970s to the early 1990s because of political turmoil and violence in this sector of the eastern Pacific. The establishment of national research funding agencies in Latin American countries, such as CONACYT (Mexico), CONICIT (Costa Rica), COLCIENCIAS (Colombia), and FONDECYT (Chile), has greatly benefitted coral reef research as well as scholarship opportunities for resident students to pursue advanced studies in marine science. The availability of vessels to support research in remote areas and at offshore sites has also facilitated ETP coral studies. Contrary to early views, structural coral reefs were discovered in major upwelling centers-southern Mexico (Huatulco), Costa Rica (Guanacaste), and Panama (Gulf of Panama). The number of known coral species approximately doubled from the late 1940s to 2000, from 60 (total scleractinians) and <20 (reef-building or zooxanthellate corals) to >120 and >40 species, respectively. Additionally, reports of the appearance or disappearance of extralimital coral species (e.g., in the genera Montipora, Siderastrea, Acropora, and Millepora) have added to the excitement and adventure of eastern Pacific studies. On site observations during two very strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) disturbances, 1982-83 and 1997-98, demonstrated that acute temperature stress can cause widespread coral bleaching and mortality and interference with reef growth. More recently, ETP waters have been found to have low pH and aragonite saturation state, which can also weaken carbonate structures and interfere with reef development. Recognizing the economic, scientific, and esthetic value of ETP coral reefs, several national and international agencies are now supporting coral research, which will have a salutary effect in increasing our knowledge and understanding of these long-neglected ecosystems.

AB The eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) is an isolated oceanic region exposed to extreme oceanographic conditions, including low salinity, low pH, high temperatures during El Nino, and low temperatures during La Nina and seasonal upwelling. The coral reefs in this region have a relatively limited suite of species compared to other coral reef areas of the world, but much like more diverse reefs the species present interact in complex ways. Here we synthezise the knowledge of taxonomic groups of reef organisms from prokaryotes to vertebrates, including algae, sponges, cnidarians, annelids and other worms, molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms and fishes. We also present summaries on the biodiversity of associated functional groups and habitats, including (a) reef zooplankton and cryptic fauna, and (b) soft benthic environments, rhodolith beds and mesophotic environments. Several factors that structure the biodiversity of ETP coral reefs are explored, including biological, physical and chemical controls. ETP coral reefs are relatively simple systems that can be used as models for studying biodiversity and interactions among species. We conclude this review by highlighting pressing research needs, from very basic inventories to more sophisticated studies of cryptic assemblages, and to investigations on the impacts of natural and anthropogenic effects on ETP coral reef biodiversity.

AB The global decline in biodiversity has been mainly attributed to the expansion of agricultural areas that transform continuous forest ecosystems into mosaic landscapes of simple agricultural and natural forest fragments. Considering this, the objective of this research was to evaluate if habitat modification affects trap nesting bees and wasps richness and abundance. An assemblage of bees and wasps that nest in pre-existing cavities was studied. The tested hypothesis was that species composition, richness and evenness are affected with habitat modification. Trap nests with different diameters were used to capture these insects in forests and in organic fields in Southern Brazil. Species composition in these areas was different, which led to the acceptance of the hypothesis that it is affected with habitat modification. The opposite occurred with alpha diversity because there was no significant difference between the richness of these areas. The most abundant genus, both in the forest areas and in the growing areas, was Trypoxylon, suggesting that the degree of impact on the Araucaria forest fragments is one of the factors that makes the diversity of these areas similar (in addition to the organic fields) since wasps of this genus usually occur in impacted areas.

AB The use of the Landsat constellation to quantify historic deforestation and reforestation over time is well established. This analysis, however, requires ground-referenced data that is often inaccessible in remote areas or expensive if no existing high-resolution satellite imagery exists. In response, we evaluate the capability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to serve as ground-reference data for identifying land-cover classes in Landsat imagery. We then apply these classes to quantify 30 years of historical deforestation and reforestation of an ecological reserve in Costa Rica. While spatial and spectral disparities between the sensors limit the generalization of the approach, our results demonstrate the ability of UAV and Landsat data to inexpensively classify a reserve's historic land cover over time and suggest an 11 year period for land cover to transition from pasture to secondary forest in lowland tropical environments.

AB Although insect herbivory can modify subsequent quantity and quality of their host plants, change in plant quantity following herbivory has received less attention than plant quality. In particular, little is known about how previous herbivore damage determines plant growth and biomass in an insect species-specific manner. We explored whether herbivore species-specific food demand influences plant growth and biomass. To do this, we conducted a series of experiments and field survey using two specialist butterflies, Sericinus montela and Atrophaneura alcinous, and their host plant, Aristolochia debilis. It is known that A. alcinous larva requires four times more food resources to fulfill its development than S. montela larva. Despite that A. alcinous larvae imposed greater damage on plants than S. montela larvae, plant growth did not differ due to herbivory by these species both in single and multiple herbivory events. On the other hand, total aboveground biomass of the plants was reduced more by A. alcinous than S. montela feeding regardless of the number of herbivory events. Feeding on plants with a history of previous herbivory neither decreased nor increased larval growth. Our results suggest that food demand of the two butterfly species determined subsequent plant biomass, although the plant response may depend on tolerance of the host plant (i.e., ability to compensate for herbivore damage). Such difference in the effects of different herbivore species on host plant biomass is more likely to occur than previously thought, because food demand differs in most herbivore species sharing a host plant.

AB The search for ecological indicators of population well-being in natural and managed ecosystems is a crucial aspect of effective biomonitoring, conservation and nature protection. In long-term monitoring programs environmental stress has a measurable effect on naturally selected traits, such as body shape or size. However, changes in colouration provide information about early warning responses. The red wood ant Formica aquilonia is ecologically and territorially dominant among wood ant species in European boreal coniferous forest, and possesses variable red-brownish melanin-based cuticular colouration. F. aquilonia gynes, which are unfertilized queens, exhibit colour variability on the head, propodeum and abdomen, yet only head colour features allow setting clearly visible and symmetrical (left/right) classes of morphs. We studied phenotypic colour variability, melanisation and fluctuating asymmetry of colour patterns in faces of F. aquilonia gynes from natural (forest interiors) and disturbed (clear-cut zones and forest edges) habitats in Finland. We defined five variable, clearly visible and symmetrical (left/right) colour morphs of gynes' faces. Individuals of totally dark morph were present only in disturbed habitats. General analyses of melanisation degree showed, that gynes from disturbed habitats were significantly darker compared to those from forest interiors. Individuals from the same nest tend to have a similar degree of melanisation. The mean darkness of face was highest among individuals from forest-edge nests and the lowest from forest interior nests. In all habitat types the darkness of face increased with an increase in head width. Increase of cuticular melanisation in F. aquilonia gynes in disturbed habitats could be explained with the theory of thermal melanism and stress-induced immune defence. Although some amount of fluctuating asymmetry among left/right symmetrical colour variations on faces of F. aquilonia gynes was found, it was affected neither by habitat type nor by head width. Melanisation degree of red wood ants have a potency to be used as ecological indicator for the level of disturbance in managed coniferous forests and fluctuating asymmetry of colour variations in ants might be studied furtherly in cases of more severe environmental concerns.

AB The interplay between plant-plant interactions and light heterogeneity in the understory of tropical forests has rarely been examined. We aimed to identify the relative importance of the understory light environment and terrestrial bromeliads in explaining the abundance and spatial organization of different plant life forms along a coastal forest gradient from seashore inland in southeastern Brazil. We estimated the abundance of various life forms (herbs, woody plants, bromeliads, climbers, and palms) and the degree of light availability using hemispherical photographs in 165 plots (1 m(2)) within a 1.75 ha site. We used ordination methods, partial redundancy analysis (pRDA), spatial filtering using Moran's eigenvector mapping, and Moran's I splines. Forest cover was highly heterogeneous, but did not explain variation in abundance of life forms. Spatially, bromeliads were negatively associated with woody saplings, herbs and climbing plants at scales between 5-20 m, while the distance to seashore was found to be unrelated to these patterns. Our findings revealed that terrestrial bromeliads play an important role in the spatial organization of various life forms near the forest floor. Overall, the presence of terrestrial bromeliads and the plant area index better explained the understory vegetation than forest cover and distance to seashore.

AB Background and Aims The Janzen-Connell model predicts that common species suffer high seed predation from specialized natural enemies as a function of distance from parent trees, and consequently as a function of con-specific density, whereas the predator satiation hypothesis predicts that seed attack is reduced due to predator satiation at high seed densities. Pre-dispersal predation by insects was studied while seeds are still on parent trees, which represents a frequently overlooked stage in which seed predation occurs.
   Methods Reproductive tree density and seed production were investigated from ten Quercus serrata populations located in south-west China, quantifying density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation over two years by three insect groups.
   Key Results Acorn infestation was nearly twice as high in the low-seed year as that in the high-seed year, with con-siderable spatio-temporal variation in the direction and magnitude of density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation evident. Across whole populations of trees, a high density of reproductive trees caused predator satiation and reduced insect attack in the high-seed year. Within individual trees, and consistent with the Janzen-Connell model, overall insect seed predation was positively correlated with seed production in the low-seed year. In addition, there was vari-ation among insect taxa, with positive density-dependent seed predation by Curculio weevils in the high-seed year and moths in the low-seed year, but apparent density independence by Cyllorhynchites weevils in both years.
   Conclusions The overall trend of negative density-dependent, pre-dispersal seed predation suggests that predator satiation limited the occurrence of Janzen-Connell effects across Q. serrata populations. Such effects may have large impacts on plant population dynamics and tree diversity, depending on the extent to which they are reduced by counteracting positive density-dependent predation for seeds on individual trees and other factors affecting suc-cessful recruitment.

AB To effectively conserve tropical forested areas, it is useful to study and understand historical land-cover changes and local people's attitudes toward the current land-uses. Using forest inventory data, and data collected from a survey of 145 households, we explored the forestland-cover changes, within the past 50 yr, in Xishuangbanna, China, and assessed the local residents' perceptions toward the existing forestland management schemes. Our analysis showed that although forestland coverage has increased during the time-period studied, the increase can be mostly attributed to the expansion of rubber plantations. Forest degradation continues to be an issue in the area studied. The government's attempts to mitigate the effects of rubber monocultures, by promoting environment-friendly plantations, have been proven challenging, which was mainly due to locals' unfavorable view of the plan. Also, because of the recent decreasing prices of dry rubber, many locals have lost their interest in managing the forest plots they own, hindering further the successful implementation of the plan. Considering these challenges, and the strong negative effects of rubber monocultures on biodiversity, we argue that the current incentives should be further strengthened to promote more efficiently the government's "Environment-Friendly Ecological Rubber Plantations" plan, and the joint management of the locals' forest plots.

AB For a half century, habitat configuration - the arrangement of habitat patches within a landscape - has been central to theories of landscape ecology, population dynamics, and community assembly, in addition to conservation strategies. A recent hypothesis advanced by Fahrig (2013) would, if supported, greatly diminish the relevance of habitat configuration as a predictor of diversity. The Habitat Amount Hypothesis posits that the sample area effect overrides patch size and patch isolation effects of habitat fragmentation on species richness. It predicts that the amount of habitat in a local landscape, regardless of configuration, is the main landscape-level determinant of species richness. If habitat amount is indeed the major, landscape-level driver of species richness, the slopes of the species-area relationship (SAR) for otherwise similar fragmented and unfragmented landscapes should be indistinguishable. We tested the Habitat Amount Hypothesis with data from two replicated and controlled habitat fragmentation experiments that disentangle the effects of habitat amount and configuration. One experiment provided time-series data on plant species richness and the other on micro-arthropod species richness. We found that, relative to less fragmented habitats, the SARs for fragmented habitats have significantly higher slopes and that the magnitude of the difference in slopes increased over time. Relatively more species were lost in smaller areas when fragments were more isolated. In both experiments, the proportion of species lost due to increased habitat fragmentation was nearly identical to the proportion lost due to reduced habitat amount. Our results provide a direct and experimentally derived refutation of the Habitat Amount Hypothesis, supporting the long-held view that in addition to area, patch isolation and configuration are important determinants of species richness. Differences in species richness between fragmented and non-fragmented habitats increase over time, demonstrating that long-term studies are needed to understand the effects of fragmentation, above and beyond the amount of habitat lost.

   CONSEQUENCES; PERSPECTIVES
AB A variety of landscape models are used to conceptualize and interpret human impacts on ecosystems and their biodiversity. The simplest, a 'patch-matrix' model, is rooted in island biogeography theory and assumes a dichotomy between generic, easily-defined habitat patches and a surrounding matrix that is completely inhospitable. This dichotomy between patch and matrix habitats has been recently relaxed, with the 'continuum' model taking this relaxation to its extreme and logical endpoint - a species-based model with no a priori definition of habitat or matrix, but rather focusing on ecological gradients. Yet, because few empirical comparisons of these bookending models exist, we lack understanding of their relative utility or the merits of hybrid approaches that combine attributes of patch-matrix and continuum models. To guide such considerations, we first develop a decision-making framework for the application of patch-matrix, continuum, and hybrid models. The framework takes into account study objectives, attributes of the landscape, and species traits. We then evaluate this framework by empirically comparing how continuum, patch-matrix, and hybrid models explain beetle distributions across two contrasting fragmented landscapes, for species differing in trophic level and habitat specificity. Within the Hope River Forest Fragmentation Project, a system with strong landscape contrast and distinct ('hard') structural edges between forest fragments and grassland, we find broad support for hybrid models, particularly those incorporating surrounding landscape structure. Conversely, within the Wog Wog Habitat Fragmentation Experiment, a system with weak landscape contrast and 'soft' structural edges between natural and plantation forest, we find co-support for continuum and hybrid models. We find no support in either system for patch-matrix, relative to continuum and hybrid models. We conclude by considering key questions and areas of research for advancing the application of models to understand species responses and biodiversity patterns associated with land-use change.

AB Well-controlled landscape experiments have played key roles in advancing fragmentation science, but such experiments are costly and may not be possible in many ecosystems -including the long-inhabited landscapes typical of many developing countries. In such contexts observational studies of pre-existing forest patches may offer valuable insights, but these bring other challenges including the non-random location of patches, the heterogeneous matrix between patches, and patch-specific management practices that may influence forest community composition. This paper argues that sacred natural sites might provide a middle ground between experimental and observational studies, allowing for more rigorous mensurative fragmentation experiments in long-inhabited multi-functional landscapes. To illustrate this potential, we analyze the drivers of productivity in 'church forests' across northern Ethiopia. These forest patches conserved by followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox church provide ample variation in area, edge, and surrounding matrix characteristics. Church forests also provide variation in long-term forest community composition, elevation and rainfall. Finally, unlike most observational studies, church forests offer a relatively stable institutional structure, including longstanding religious norms, allowing researchers to control for some heterogeneity in human influences. By combining remotely sensed data on church forest patches (n = 2558) with field data on church forest tree species composition (n = 27) and social survey data on church forest management practices (n = 145 respondents in 6 church communities) we show how ecological and anthropogenic factors influence church forest productivity. Like experimental patches, church forest productivity increases with size and decreases with amount of edge; productivity also increases with rainfall and increased tree species diversity within a given patch. But there is also evidence that church forest productivity and species composition are both affected by human management rooted in longstanding religious norms. Findings highlight how studies in sacred natural sites systems might help understand relationships between forest productivity, species diversity, and human management in long-fragmented landscapes.

AB 1. Large-scale disturbances can be important components of the temporal landscape of natural ecosystems, but generalities regarding ecosystem impacts are difficult due to their infrequent and unpredictable nature. Volcanic eruptions figure as one of the most prominent of these natural disturbances, but the effects on microbes and ground-dwelling arthropods, which modulate carbon and nutrient turnover, are relatively unknown.
   2. We evaluated the effects of the 2011 Puyehue-Cordon Caulle eruption in Patagonia, Argentina, on the litter and soil microbial and faunal communities in natural and afforested semi-arid ecosystems located 70 km west of the epicentre of the eruption. We hypothesized that volcanic ash deposition would strongly reduce soil faunal and microbial communities due to insecticidal effects of ash on arthropods, with a concomitant reduction in ecosystem processes.
   3. Our objective was to quantify the impact of the volcanic eruption by comparing pre-and post-eruption time points in the same study site, with nearly identical field methodology. We measured environmental variables of soil and litter moisture, pH, microbial biomass, and soil and litter microbial enzymatic activity. We evaluated ground-dwelling arthropods and nematodes using pitfall traps and soil extraction, respectively. Additionally, a parallel, controlled-condition experiment of simulated ash deposition was conducted to evaluate ash effects on litter decomposition and enzymatic activity.
   4. In the field, post-eruption soils had lower soil water content, pH and soil organic matter. Additionally, nematode abundance and soil microbial enzyme activity were significantly reduced. In contrast, ground-dwelling arthropods and litter enzymatic activity increased significantly. Finally, with simulated ash deposition, litter decomposition increased fourfold for native litter decomposition.
   5. Large-scale disturbances may play a key role in biogeochemical cycling in affected natural ecosystems, but not necessarily due to their catastrophic effects. In contrast to our original predictions, we observed a marked stimulation of biotic activity and carbon turnover in the aftermath of the Puyehue volcanic eruption, which demonstrates that the biotic component of these ecosystems has a substantial capacity to respond to these disturbances in short time frames. These results can contribute to placing the role of these large-scale infrequent disturbances in a more robust ecological context.

AB Consistent long-term estimates of fire emissions are important to understand the changing role of fire in the global carbon cycle and to assess the relative importance of humans and climate in shaping fire regimes. However, there is limited information on fire emissions from before the satellite era. We show that in the Amazon region, including the Arc of Deforestation and Bolivia, visibility observations derived from weather stations could explain 61% of the variability in satellite-based estimates of bottom-up fire emissions since 1997 and 42% of the variability in satellite-based estimates of total column carbon monoxide concentrations since 2001. This enabled us to reconstruct the fire history of this region since 1973 when visibility information became available. Our estimates indicate that until 1987 relatively few fires occurred in this region and that fire emissions increased rapidly over the 1990s. We found that this pattern agreed reasonably well with forest loss data sets, indicating that although natural fires may occur here, deforestation and degradation were the main cause of fires. Compared to fire emissions estimates based on Food and Agricultural Organization's Global Forest and Resources Assessment data, our estimates were substantially lower up to the 1990s, after which they were more in line. These visibility-based fire emissions data set can help constrain dynamic global vegetation models and atmospheric models with a better representation of the complex fire regime in this region.

AB The occurrence of pioneer tree species inside tropical forests is usually associated with canopy openness due to disturbances. The distribution of these species under different environmental conditions, aside from light presence, can be influenced by other variables such as soil attributes, water availability, and non-arborous species presence. This work evaluates pioneer tree distribution in the Pindorama Biological Reserve, Brazil, with respect to altitude, soil attributes, and non-arborous species in 65,400-m(2) plots in two topo-sequences of semi-deciduous forest. We evaluated the physical and chemical soil attributes altitude, basal area, height, and number of individuals of tree species with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm in a randomly chosen quadrant in each plot. Pioneer trees were characterized by the following higher occurrence species: Acacia polyphylla, Aloysia virgata, Casearia sylvestris, and Croton floribundus. Cluster analysis suggested five similar groups among sampling plots. For each group, the mean of altitude, physical and chemical soil attributes, and degree of non-arborous species infestation was calculated. Principal components analysis correlated variables with pioneer tree data. C. floribundus occurred at low altitudes at lower or higher fertility, C. sylvestris occurred in lower fertility plots, and A. polyphylla and A. virgata occurred in higher altitude plots.

TI Applications of fipronil (Adonis 3UL) and Metarhizium acridum for use

AB Litter and microbes are key drivers of nutrient cycles, particularly in arid ecosystems where decomposition rates are low. Locust control in arid regions represents a potentially important hazard to microbes, because local taxa are unlikely to have adapted to pesticide exposure and operations often occur during times of high microbial activity. We monitored the response of aboveground litter decomposition and soil bacteria functional diversity to aerial applications of fipronil (a chemical pesticide) barrier treatments and Metarhizium acridum (a fungal biopesticide) blanket treatments. Decomposition was monitored over 2 years (before and after treatments) using a replicated litter-bag experiment, whereas changes in bacteria functional diversity were measured over 1 month. Analysis of litter mass loss indicated there were no pesticide treatment effects relative to control. Less litter decomposed in small than large mesh bags, and less litter decomposed during the second year of the study. Litter had higher mean nitrogen (N) and carbon (C), and a lower C:N ratio, during the first year of the study. In contrast, within-treatment site analysis revealed a significant increase in litter mass remaining in bags at M. acridum-treated subsites. However, these values were only 4% different from control sites, suggesting that the effect detected may not be biologically significant. There appeared to be no pesticide treatment effect on bacterial community functional diversity and no significant temporal variation. The lack of large-scale pesticide treatment effects suggests that arid zone fungi and bacteria are resilient to such disturbances. Differences in decomposition was explained by differences in the activity of arthropods and in the shade provided by the two mesh sizes, and an annual decline could be attributed to lower litter C and N content and lower annual rainfall in Year 2. Results show the temporal variation possible in decomposition and microbe community measures in arid systems.

AB Clear-cutting, the main method of harvesting in many forests in the world, causes a series of dramatic environmental changes to the forest habitat and removes habitat resources for arboreal and epigeal species. It results in considerable changes in the composition of both plant and animal communities. Ants have many critical roles in the maintenance and functioning of forest ecosystems. Therefore, the response of ants to clear-cutting and the time it takes for an ant community to recover after clear-cutting are important indicators of the effect of this harvesting technique on the forest ecosystem. We investigated ground-dwelling ant communities during secondary succession of deciduous forests in Transylvania, Romania. Using space-for-time substitution, we explored a chronosequence from clear-cuts to mature forests (> 120 years). The object was to determine if cutting has measurable effects on ant community structure, and if ant species richness differs between successional stages. We recorded a total of 24 species of ants, 11 characteristic of forests and seven of open landscape. Ant species richness was higher in clear-cuts compared to closed-canopy and old stands. Number of ant individuals was highest in young age classes and lowest in closed-canopy age classes. There was no drastic change in species richness during the succession, however differences in community composition at different stages were recorded. Open landscape species are able to rapidly colonize following disturbance but disappear when the forest sites mature and many forest ant species are capable of surviving clear cutting.

AB QuestionsDo functional traits explain individual tree species' responses to environmental filters and dispersal limitations following stand-replacing fire? Can post-fire conditions initiate alternate trajectories of community assembly?
   LocationGlacier National Park, Montana, USA.
   MethodsWe characterized the species composition of tree re-establishment following nine recent fires in the lower subalpine zone of Glacier National Park, a region with multiple co-dominant tree species that has experienced extensive fire in recent decades. We used GLMMs to describe individual species' responses to spatial and temporal heterogeneity of post-fire conditions and seed availability, and used multivariate approaches to examine whether post-fire conditions can initiate alternate trajectories of forest community assembly.
   ResultsPost-fire regeneration responses were strongly species-dependent and consistent with functional trait differences. We found that there was a brief opportunity for establishment during the first several years after fire, during which tree recruitment for all species was contingent upon the availability of nearby seeds and the occurrence of favourable weather conditions. There was a remarkable amount of compositional change following fire, and the majority of our study sites transitioned from a mixed forest to a tree assemblage dominated by a single species.
   ConclusionsDifferential species-specific responses to climate and disturbance can initiate alternate trajectories of community assembly, triggering substantial changes in forest composition. The composition of post-fire tree assemblages reflects the differential responses of individual species to climate and disturbance, providing support for the interacting role of dispersal and environmental filtering in shaping post-disturbance communities and highlighting the importance of incorporating functional traits into predictive models of ecosystem dynamics.

AB QuestionQuantifying the duration and drivers of seedling persistence is critical for understanding seedling dynamics and species co-existence in plant communities. In this study, we incorporated data from multiple seedling censuses to characterize patterns of seedling persistence in a tropical karst forest. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of density dependence, habitat heterogeneity and recruitment timing on seedling persistence.
   LocationA tropical karst forest in Taiwan.
   MethodsUsing data from 144 seedling plots censused every 3mo from 2007 to 2012, we examined persistence times of 6399 seedlings of 36 species. Seedling survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Mixed effects Cox models were used to identify significant biotic (i.e. initial height, conspecific and heterospecific seedling and adult densities) and abiotic (i.e. mean elevation, convexity, slope, effective soil depth and recruitment time) drivers of seedling persistence at the community, guild and species levels.
   ResultsAt the community level, newly recruited seedlings had a median survival time of 6mo. Median survival time was higher for seedlings in the shade-tolerant guild compared to seedlings in the shade-intolerant guild (9 vs 3mo). When all species were analysed together, seedling persistence significantly increased with increasing initial size and soil depth and significantly decreased with increasing density of conspecific and heterospecific seedling neighbours. Drivers of seedling persistence tended to be guild and species specific, however negative effects of conspecific seedling neighbours were consistently detected in all models, indicating strong and pervasive conspecific negative density dependence. Significant effects of recruitment time, soil depth and convexity were revealed by guild- and species-specific models, suggesting abiotic niche differences.
   ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of multiple ecological processes for seedling persistence. Both abiotic and biotic factors may play an important role in species co-existence in this forest via niche partitioning and negative density dependence. Among these factors, negative conspecific density dependence had the strongest and most consistent effect. In addition, soil depth played a key role in shaping seedling regeneration, likely through effects of soil moisture. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the ecology of karst forests. Analysing seedling persistence in karst forest expands our general understanding of forest dynamics and species co-existence in tropical forests as a whole, especially at sites with high spatial heterogeneity.

AB Although the importance of gaps in forest dynamics has been well documented, the influence of gap size on the foraging behavior of small rodents and seedling predation has received little attention. In this study, we explored the foraging behaviors of seedling predators and seedling survival in the artificial gaps with different sizes and the associated closed canopy forest, to see the influence of rodent predation on seedling establishment of Quercus mongolica. Our results showed that small rodents (Apodemus peninsulae, Clethrionomys rufocanus, Tamias sibiricus and Sciurus vulgaris) tended to avoid recently created gaps in comparison with the associated closed canopy forests. As a consequence, lower levels of seedling predation (i.e., cotyledon removal and shoot clipping) and higher levels of seedling survival were observed in the gaps than in the closed canopy forests. In addition, gaps with large size tended to provide a better shelter for seedlings of Q. mongolica, possibly due to higher predation risks on small rodents in large gaps than in small gaps and the associated closed canopy forests. Our one-year study indicates that small rodents exert strong impacts on the recruitment of Q. mongolica through clipping young seedlings both in the gaps and closed canopy forests. Our study also implies that seedling predation by small rodents is regulated by gap size.

AB Dung beetles form an insect group that fulfils important functions in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world. These include nutrient cycling through dung removal, soil bioturbation, plant growth, secondary seed dispersal and parasite control. We conducted field experiments at two sites in the northern hemisphere temperate region in which dung removal and secondary seed dispersal were assessed. Dung beetles were classified in three functional groups, depending on their size and dung manipulation method: dwellers, large and small tunnelers. Other soil inhabiting fauna were included as a fourth functional group. Dung removal and seed dispersal by each individual functional group and combinations thereof were estimated in exclusion experiments using different dung types. Dwellers were the most diverse and abundant group, but tunnelers were dominant in terms of biomass. All dung beetle functional groups had a clear preference for fresh dung. The ecosystem services in dung removal and secondary seed dispersal provided by dung beetles were significant and differed between functional groups. Although in absolute numbers more dwellers were found, large tunnelers were disproportionally important for dung burial and seed removal. In the absence of dung beetles, other soil inhabiting fauna, such as earthworms, partly took over the dung decomposing role of dung beetles while most dung was processed when all native functional groups were present. Our results, therefore, emphasize the need to conserve functionally complete dung ecosystems to maintain full ecosystem functioning.

AB In forests, negative density/distance-dependent seedling mortality (NDD) caused by natural enemies plays a key role in maintaining species diversity [Janzen-Connell (J-C) model]. However, the relative importance of natural enemies in mediating NDD under heterogeneous light conditions has remained unclear. We examined the relative importance of pathogens (i.e., soil pathogens, leaf diseases) on seedling performance in forest understories (FUs) and gaps (gaps) during a 3-year period (results of first year of our study have been previously reported). For the hardwood, Prunus grayana, we investigated seedling mortality, morbidity agents, growth, and root infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) beneath conspecific and heterospecific adults in FUs and gaps. Seedling mortality was higher beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults throughout 3 years at both sites, mainly due to continuous leaf disease (i.e., angular leaf spot), whereas damping-off diseases caused mortality only in the first year. Beneath each adult, seedling mortality was higher in FUs than in gaps until second year, but it did not differ between two habitat types in the third year, because leaf diseases caused severe damage even in gaps. Seedling mass was significantly lower beneath conspecific adults. AMF infection of seedlings was also lower beneath conspecific adults, while it was higher in gaps than in FUs beneath both adults. This study demonstrates that the J-C model in a hardwood tree, P. grayana is mainly driven by high NDD seedling mortality caused by airborne leaf diseases, which continuously attack seedlings in a NDD manner regardless of environmental light conditions.

AB The diversity and functional identity of organisms are known to be relevant to the maintenance of ecosystem processes but can be variable in different environments. Particularly, it is uncertain whether ecosystem processes are driven by complementary effects or by dominant groups of species. We investigated how community structure (i.e., the diversity and relative abundance of biological entities) explains the community-level contribution of Neotropical ant communities to different ecosystem processes in different environments. Ants were attracted with food resources representing six ant-mediated ecosystem processes in four environments: ground and vegetation strata in cropland and forest habitats. The exploitation frequencies of the baits were used to calculate the taxonomic and trophic structures of ant communities and their contribution to ecosystem processes considered individually or in combination (i.e., multifunctionality). We then investigated whether community structure variables could predict ecosystem processes and whether such relationships were affected by the environment. We found that forests presented a greater biodiversity and trophic complementarity and lower dominance than croplands, but this did not affect ecosystem processes. In contrast, trophic complementarity was greater on the ground than on vegetation and was followed by greater resource exploitation levels. Although ant participation in ecosystem processes can be predicted by means of trophic-based indices, we found that variations in community structure and performance in ecosystem processes were best explained by environment. We conclude that determining the extent to which the dominance and complementarity of communities affect ecosystem processes in different environments requires a better understanding of resource availability to different species.

AB We conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of fire on the abundance and alpha diversity of ants based upon data published over the past 70 years. Overall, fire reduced ant diversity by 18 %, but had no effect on ant abundance. However, there was significant variation in the effect of fire on ant diversity amongst different vegetation types. Fire significantly decreased ant diversity in forests-especially in tropical forests-whereas in deserts, grasslands, and savannas it did not. Similarly, fire had a strong negative mean effect on ant diversity in sites where it is uncommon, but did not significantly affect diversity where it is a recurrent phenomenon. There is evidence that, in forests, wildfires have a stronger negative effect on ant diversity than does prescribed burning. In addition, we found marginally significant differences in the effect of fire on the abundance and diversity of forest ants among studies that sampled ants at different times post-fire, or that sampled ants from different soil strata. In contrast, fire did not significantly affect the abundance or diversity of savanna ants, and this was true even after we took into account the geographic location of the study, the ant community sampled, the time since fire, and the fire regime. Overall, the results of our study indicate that habitat type is an important predictor of ant community responses to fire. However, even within a given habitat, reported effects were quite variable among the studies reviewed, evidencing the idiosyncratic nature of fire effects on ants.

AB Land-use changes are one of the major drivers of global change. In many developed countries socioeconomic changes have induced forest expansion during the last centuries, with still seldom explored implications for ecosystem services. We assessed the growth rate and the contribution of these "new forests" on C storage under the imprint of land-use history from Mediterranean to temperate forests in two biogeographical regions in the Iberian Peninsula, using data from 6422 plots of the Spanish National Forest Inventory (1986-2007) and the land-cover map of 1956 to distinguish among pre-existing and new forests (appeared after 1956). Almost a quarter of current forests were new forests and they represented 22% of the total C pool. New forests maintained similar C stocks than pre-existing ones (similar to 45 Mg ha(-1)), but they are growing at rates 25% faster. Considering the whole Spanish forested territory, the new forest growth rate would offset around 9% of the rate of total C emitted in Spain between 1986 and 2007. The effects of land-use history on forest growth and C stocks varied with environmental conditions (for example, growth of new forests in areas with less water availability was higher than in pre-existing ones), supporting the idea that agricultural legacies may prevail in the long term. In a time when European forests exhibit the first signs of carbon sink saturation, our study endows a relevant ecological role to new forests appearing in the second half of the twentieth century.

AB Intensive cropland agriculture commonly increases streamwater solute concentrations and export from small watersheds. In recent decades, the lowland tropics have become the world's largest and most important region of cropland expansion. Although the effects of intensive cropland agriculture on streamwater chemistry and watershed export have been widely studied in temperate regions, their effects in tropical regions are poorly understood. We sampled seven headwater streams draining watersheds in forest (n = 3) or soybeans (n = 4) to examine the effects of soybean cropping on stream solute concentrations and watershed export in a region of rapid soybean expansion in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. We measured stream flows and concentrations of NO3-, PO43-, SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Al3+, Fe3+, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) biweekly to monthly to determine solute-export. We also measured stormflows and stormflow solute concentrations in a subset of watersheds (two forest, two soybean) during two/three storms, and solutes and delta O-18 in groundwater, rainwater, and throughfall to characterize watershed flowpaths. Concentrations of all solutes except K+ varied seasonally in streamwater, but only Fe3+ concentrations differed between land uses. The highest streamwater and rainwater solute concentrations occurred during the peak season of wildfires in Mato Grosso, suggesting that regional changes in atmospheric-composition and deposition influence seasonal stream solute concentrations. Despite no concentration differences between forest and soybean land uses, annual export of NH4+, PO43-, Ca2+, Fe3+, Na+, SO42-, DOC, and TSS were significantly higher from soybean than forest watersheds (5.6-fold mean increase). This increase largely reflected a 4.3-fold increase in water export from soybean watersheds. Despite this increase, total solute export per unit watershed area (i. e., yield) remained low for all watersheds (< 1 kg NO3- N . ha(-1) .yr(-1), < 2.1 kg NH4+-N.ha(-1).yr(-1), < 0.2 kg PO43--P .ha(-1) . yr(-1), < 1.5 kg Ca2+.ha(-1).yr(-1)). Responses of both streamflows and solute concentrations to crop agriculture appear to be controlled by high soil hydraulic conductivity, groundwater-dominated hydrologic flowpaths on deep soils, and the absence of nitrogen fertilization. To date, these factors have buffered streams from the large increases in solute concentrations that often accompany intensive croplands in other locations.

AB 1. The factors governing community assemblages in fragmented habitats remain a challenging topic in ecology, especially in the present context of global change. We studied the colonisation of holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) woodland by specialist Lepidoptera in an afforested savannah-like landscape that has emerged as a result of the abandonment of croplands. We sampled herbivorous caterpillars for 5 years to assess the interplay between tree age and structure (canopy size and connectivity) on Lepidoptera species abundance, richness, diversity and composition.
   2. 1336 individuals belonging to 24 species of Lepidoptera were collected. Species abundance, richness and diversity increased in the best connected large trees and in the best connected young ones, probably because of the greater likelihood of colonisation and the existence of colonisation credits, respectively. Although species abundance, richness and diversity varied significantly between years in all trees, there were no effects for tree age, canopy size, or connectivity.
   3. Although tree age and structure had little effect on species composition (alpha and beta diversity), thereby revealing a predominant random effect, the relative abundance of Noctuids and Pyralids was significantly affected by tree age, suggesting that differences in dispersal abilities exist between these families.
   4. These findings suggest that habitat age and structural interactions play a significant role in the accumulation of Lepidoptera species but have little importance in determining their identities. From a conservation point of view, the results highlight the need to preserve old, large and well-connected holm oak trees in agricultural landscapes as refuges for specialist insects.

AB The selenium contamination event that occurred at Kesterson Reservoir (Merced Co., CA) during the 1970-80s is a frequently cited example for the negative effects of contamination on wildlife. Despite the importance of arthropods for ecosystem services and functioning, relatively little information is available as to the impacts of pollution on arthropod community dynamics. We conducted surveys of the arthropod community present at Kesterson Reservoir to assess the impacts of selenium contamination on arthropod diversity, with a focus on ant species richness, composition and density. Trophic groups were compared to determine which arthropods were potentially receiving the greatest selenium exposure. Plant samples were analyzed to determine the selenium content by site and by location within plant. Soil concentrations varied across the study sites, but not across habitat types. Topsoil contained higher levels of selenium compared to core samples. Plants contained similar concentrations of selenium in their leaves, stems and flowers, but flowers contained the greatest range of concentrations. Individuals within the detritivores/decomposers and predators accumulated the greatest concentrations of selenium, whereas nectarivores contained the lowest concentrations. Species composition differed across the sites: Dorymyrmex bicolor was located only at the site containing the greatest soil selenium concentration, but Solenopsis xyloni was found at most sites and was predominant at six of the sites. Selenium concentrations in ants varied by species and collection sites. Nest density was also found to differ across sites, but was not related to soil selenium or any of the habitat variables measured in our study. Selenium was not found to impact species richness, but was a significant variable for the occurrence of two out of the eight native species identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Predicting old-growth tropical forest attributes from very high

AB Old-growth tropical forests are increasingly vanishing worldwide. Although the accurate quantification of tropical old-growth forests attributes is essential to understand, manage, and conserve their high diversity and biomass, conducting this task over large areas and at fine detail is not only expensive and time consuming, but also often practically impossible. This calls for the search for more efficient alternatives, particularly those based on remote sensing. In this study, we evaluate the potential of several surface metrics (tone and texture) extracted from very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery to model the structural and diversity attributes of a tropical dry forest (TDF) in southern Mexico. We constructed simple linear models that used each forest attribute as dependent variables, and the tone and texture metrics extracted from several bands, the panchromatic (resolution = 0.5 m), red (R), infrared, and two vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI); resolution = 2 m), of a VHR image (GeoEye-1) as predictive variables. The significance of the models including one, two, two and its interaction, and three image metrics was evaluated by comparing them with null models. The structural characteristics of the TDF (basal area (BA), mean height, stem density) showed the highest modelling potential, with the goodness-of-fit (R-2) values ranging from 0.58 to 0.66. Conversely, no significant models were obtained for total crown area (TCA) and all diversity attributes. Our results show that remote-sensing metrics detect the spatial variation in the structural attributes of this old-growth TDF better than they detect the variation in its diversity. Our ability to model forest attributes at large scales at fine detail (sampling plots <0.2 ha) can be much improved by combining the use of VHR imagery with an array as wide as possible of the image surface metrics, including both tone and texture.

AB Phylogeographic studies can contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on the patterns of genetic variation and the evolutionary history of species. The Hydropuntia cornea/ Hydropuntia usneoides species complex consists of two common species of red algae in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Both species exhibit high phenotypic plasticity and total overlap in morphological characters and are only distinguished genetically (group GI, assigned to H. usneoides and group GII, assigned to H. cornea). In the Yucatan Peninsula, where they are abundant, they have a sympatric distribution. In order to understand the historical events and their influence on the current distribution patterns of these species around the Yucatan Peninsula and compare them with some populations from Venezuela and Brazil, we analyzed variation in the plastid-encoded RuBisCo spacer. A total of 133 individuals collected from 14 sites were sequenced. The analyses revealed 12 haplotypes (R1-R12). The haplotype network revealed two major groups (GI and GII) separated by three mutational steps. Group I was found in almost all sampled sites (n = 13), while GII was found in six sites but was absent from the Gulf of Mexico (Campeche). Haplotype R1 was the most abundant in GI, and haplotype R4 was dominant in GII. Genetic variation was higher in GI than in GII. Mismatch distribution suggests that GI may be in a period of demographic equilibrium, and GII experienced a recent demographic expansion and may have come from the south when the northern portion of the peninsula emerged (2.8 million years ago). Our results revealed that the Yucatan Peninsula is a mix of southern and northern floristic influences, which can be explained by the geological events in the area.

AB Understanding how disease foci arise from single source lesions has not been well studied. Here, single wheat leaves were inoculated with Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici urediniospores, and all wheat leaves within two intersecting 0.3 9 3.0 m transects were sampled in eight replicates over 3 years. The lesions observed on each of the top three leaves on plants within 1.5 m from the source lesion were three-dimensionally mapped. The total number of lesions within a 1.5 m radius was estimated by dividing the number of lesions observed within each 0.025 m-wide annulus by the fraction of the annulus sampled. The estimated total number of lesions produced within 1.5 m of a single source lesion ranged from 27 to 776, with a mean of 288 lesions. Eighty percent of the lesions were recorded within 0.69 m of the source infection. The proportion of total lesions observed at a given distance from the source was fitted well by the Lomax and Weibull distributions, reflecting the large proportion of lesions arising close to the source, and when fitted by an inverse power distribution had a slope (b) of 2.5. There were more lesions produced on leaves higher in the canopy than on lower leaves, with more lesions being detected above than below the point of inoculation. Simultaneous measurement of lesion gradients and spore dispersal in the final year of the study suggests that this pattern is due to greater susceptibility of upper leaves, rather than increased dispersal to upper leaves.

AB Analysis of Earth observation (EO) data, often combined with geographical information systems (GIS), allows monitoring of land cover dynamics over different ecosystems, including protected or conservation sites. The aim of this study is to use contemporary technologies such as EO and GIS in synergy with fragmentation analysis, to quantify the changes in the landscape of the Rajaji National Park (RNP) during the period of 19years (1990-2009). Several statistics such as principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial metrics are used to understand the results. PCA analysis has produced two principal components (PC) and explained 84.1% of the total variance, first component (PC1) accounted for the 57.8% of the total variance while the second component (PC2) has accounted for the 26.3% of the total variance calculated from the core area metrics, distance metrics and shape metrics. Our results suggested that notable changes happened in the RNP landscape, evidencing the requirement of taking appropriate measures to conserve this natural ecosystem.

AB Biogeography of polypores distributed in the Malesian region is reviewed. Some of the species reported from this region are pantropical or paleotropical and widely distributed along the equator. Several species are restricted to lowland areas of Malesia and adjacent regions, and can be classified as Asian or Asian-Oceanian tropical species. Some species have only been recorded from lowland areas of Malesia at present, but detailed distributions are unclear for many of them. Some lowland Malesian species are also distributed in temperate areas of East Asia; among them, few species are circumglobal in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas many others are tropical species showing continuous distributions up to the warm temperate areas of East Asia. Species recorded from highland areas of Malesia include tropical species common to lowland Malesia, temperate species common to temperate Asia, and endemic species in highland areas of Malesia and adjacent regions. Regarding the factors that delimitate distribution of the Malesian polypores, I discuss polypore host preference, response to physical environmental factors, and dispersal ability.

AB Australian vegetation, much like that on other continents, is characterised by evergreen forests in humid climates, savannas in the seasonal tropics, desert shrublands and grasslands in arid climates, and wetland vegetation where water accumulates. While continental plant diversity is intermediate on a global scale, Australian vegetation is characterised by high endemism at species and genus levels, a number of biodiversity hotspots and some structurally and physiognomically unique forms. We propose a continental model of vegetation assembly in which autochthonous and intrusive species pools are exposed to resource filters dominated by water and nutrients, other abiotic drivers such as temperature and disturbance regimes (particularly fire and floods), as well as local biotic filters, most notably competition and predation. We present a new high-level ecological typology of Australian vegetation and evaluate how ecological processes and legacies shape and differentiate major types of vegetation across the continent. Some key plant traits apparently enable persistence and turnover of species groups that characterise vegetation types inhabiting different environments. We conclude that Australian vegetation reflects a broad ensemble of evolutionary filters, varying combinations of which may come to the fore under particular conditions. Advances in Australian plant ecology over more than a century increasingly reflect the complex relationships between ecological legacy, directional selection by contrasting agents under varying environments, and stochasticity.

AB The PREDICTS project-Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems (www.predicts.org.uk)-has collated from published studies a large, reasonably representative database of comparable samples of biodiversity from multiple sites that differ in the nature or intensity of human impacts relating to land use. We have used this evidence base to develop global and regional statistical models of how local biodiversity responds to these measures. We describe and make freely available this 2016 release of the database, containing more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and representing over 47,000 species. We outline how the database can help in answering a range of questions in ecology and conservation biology. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most geographically and taxonomically representative database of spatial comparisons of biodiversity that has been collated to date; it will be useful to researchers and international efforts wishing to model and understand the global status of biodiversity.

AB Introduction: As challenges to biodiversity mount, land-use policies have been implemented to balance human needs and the integrity of ecological systems. One such program, Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), incentivizes resource users to protect ecosystem services and has been implemented around the world to reduce soil erosion, create or improve wildlife habitats, and improve water quality and other environmental goals. The PES policy, at its core, is a concept that aims to capture the reciprocal relationships between human systems and ecological function and process. As such, PES epistemologically embodies a coupled human and natural systems approach.
   Outcomes: Yet, despite this conceptual alignment, the on-the-ground implementation or evaluation of PES typically does not adopt this coupled approach and PES programs have little integration between socioeconomic, sociocultural, human demographic, and ecological elements. To advance the evolution of PES, we consider what and how socioeconomic and ecological factors have been incorporated into PES program implementation and evaluation. We also present a conceptual model to articulate how PES research can capture the reciprocal relationships among socioeconomics, demography, and ecology and discuss the quantitative modeling approaches that can support this conceptual development, i.e., structural equation and agent-based modeling, and latent trajectory models.
   Conclusions: By strengthening the conceptual framework for PES within a coupled human and natural systems approach and identifyinganalytical approaches that can be used to quantify and characterize these complex cross-disciplinary relationships, we aim to support the evolution and advancement of PES, in service of more meaningful and positive outcomes for human well-being and ecological sustainability.

AB As the world's human population increases along the coastal zone, with major alteration of coastal embayments, increased on-water activities and a plethora of other intrusions into the coastal zone, there is a simultaneous increase in pressures on marine mammals. Growing evidence indicates that many marine mammals are highly susceptible to declines resulting from direct and indirect impacts arising from diverse human activities. Too frequently, assessment of the impact from coastal developments on marine mammals has been inadequate or completely lacking. At worst this has led to catastrophic decline in some populations. Without rigorous ecological assessments along with adaptive management frameworks prior to the initiation of developments, the number of marine mammal populations likely to be adversely impacted will continue to rise. To address these shortcomings, we present a globally applicable best practice framework by; (i) describing guiding principles and; (ii) reviewing appropriate procedures for assessment and monitoring of impacts of coastal developments on marine mammals. The approach outlined is embedded in Environmental Impact Assessment processes as a means by which decision makers and stakeholders can be informed. Recommendations presented are designed to encourage the application of robust scientific evaluation that applies appropriate survey design with sufficient statistical power to detect changes before trigger thresholds are reached. We emphasize that there is an urgent need to ensure assessments are comprehensive, effective and integrated with monitoring and adaptive management actions in order to minimize or effectively mitigate the impacts of human activities on marine mammal populations.

AB The role of the seed rain in affecting recruitment, regeneration, and plant community dynamics continues to be debated. Studies show that seed limitation for recruitment is more likely as ecosystems become colder and more species-poor, as in boreal forests, and for species that have large seeds and short-lived seed banks. Even if there is a limiting effect of the seed rain for recruitment, however, clumping seen for mature trees and other evidence suggests that its effect diminishes with time. I posit that the dynamics of plant communities are largely determined where the seed rain is abundant and not limiting-in local spaces close to dispersing plants. Putting all the evidence together, I conclude that it is what happens to seeds after dispersal-such as loss to predation and pathogenic attack, or germination success resulting from environmental tolerances-that has a greater effect on recruitment, regeneration and plant community dynamics. And thus the variation in the workings of seed fate mechanisms and environmental tolerances, deserve more research attention. The importance of the seed rain in affecting recruitment of individual plants, regeneration of individual plants, and plant community dynamics has been over-emphasized in plant modeling and theory.

AB We examined the variation in woody plant species composition, regeneration and biodiversity in relation to topographic heterogeneity, specifically catena shape (V and Lambda) and slope position (summit, shoulder, back slope, foot slope and toe slope). All research took place at the TMU Experimental Forest Station, located in northern Iran. Two sets of replicated quadrats were established along transects that encompassed the different catena shapes and positions. We recorded the density, height, and canopy cover of all trees >= 12 cm diameter at breast height within 30 quadrats (400m(2)), as well as the density of all tree regenerations within 120 quadrats (4m(2)). In addition, three measurements of biodiversity were calculated for both mature trees and regenerations. Mature tree species composition varied greatly with catena shape and slope position, as did that of regenerating trees. Despite differences in species composition, the various measurements of biodiversity were consistent across the landscape for mature trees, whereas significant variation in evenness was detected for regenerating trees. We concluded that the broad matrix of environmental conditions occurring within this rugged mountainous area generates a variety of microhabitats, which in turn contributes to both the variation in species composition and the consistent biodiversity of these forests.

AB The Amazon Forest is a hotspot of biodiversity harboring an unknown number of undescribed taxa. Inventory studies are urgent, mainly in the areas most endangered by human activities such as extensive dam construction, where species could be in risk of extinction before being described and named. In 2015, intensive studies performed in a few locations in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest revealed three new species of the genus Scleroderma: S. anomalosporum, S. camassuense and S. duckei. The two first species were located in one of the many areas flooded by construction of hydroelectric dams throughout the Amazon; and the third in the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, a protected reverse by the INPA. The species were identified through morphology and molecular analyses of barcoding sequences (Internal Transcribed Spacer nrDNA). Scleroderma anomalosporum is characterized mainly by the smooth spores under LM in mature basidiomata (under SEM with small, unevenly distributed granules, a characteristic not observed in other species of the genus), the large size of the basidiomata, up to 120 mm diameter, and the stelliform dehiscence; S. camassuense mainly by the irregular to stellate dehiscence, the subreticulated spores and the bright sulfur-yellow colour, and Scleroderma duckei mainly by the verrucose exoperidium, stelliform dehiscence, and verrucose spores. Description, illustration and affinities with other species of the genus are provided.

AB Soil organic phosphorus contributes to the nutrition of tropical trees, but is not accounted for in standard soil phosphorus tests. Plants and microbes can release organic anions to solubilize organic phosphorus from soil surfaces, and synthesize phosphatases to release inorganic phosphate from the solubilized compounds. We developed a procedure to estimate bioavailable organic phosphorus in tropical forest soils by simulating the secretion processes of organic acids and phosphatases. Five lowland tropical forest soils with contrasting properties (pH 4.4-6.1, total P 86-429 mg P kg(-1)) were extracted with 2 mM citric acid (i.e., 10 mu mol g(-1), approximating rhizosphere concentrations) adjusted to soil pH in a 4:1 solution to soil ratio for 1 h. Three phosphatase enzymes were then added to the soil extract to determine the forms of hydrolysable organic phosphorus. Total phosphorus extracted by the procedure ranged between 3.22 and 8.06 mg P kg(-1) (mean 5.55 +/- 0.42 mg P kg(-1)), of which on average three quarters was unreactive phosphorus (i.e., organic phosphorus plus inorganic polyphosphate). Of the enzyme-hydrolysable unreactive phosphorus, 28% was simple phosphomonoesters hydrolyzed by phosphomonoesterase from bovine intestinal mucosa, a further 18% was phosphodiesters hydrolyzed by a combination of nuclease from Penicillium citrinum and phosphomonoesterase, and the remaining 51% was hydrolyzed by a broad-spectrum phytase from wheat. We conclude that soil organic phosphorus can be solubilized and hydrolyzed by a combination of organic acids and phosphatase enzymes in lowland tropical forest soils, indicating that this pathway could make a significant contribution to biological phosphorus acquisition in tropical forests. Furthermore, we have developed a method that can be used to assess the bioavailability of this soil organic phosphorus. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Efforts aimed at sparing forests on tropical forest frontiers through REDD+, PES or conservation initiatives currently rely on a limited understanding of the operation of land markets and their effects on the opportunity cost of forests as frontiers develop. In this paper, we draw on a unique dataset of landholder reported land transactions that includes post-1991 land sales-in three sub-montane frontier forest areas on the eastern slopes of the Peruvian Andes. We analyze reported land sales that took place between 1979 and 2013 among Amazonian frontier farmers and find highly active land markets in all three areas, often in the absence of formal land tenure. As frontiers developed, parcel size fell, as did the portion of remaining forest cover, and land prices rose, reflecting both forest clearing and general land price inflation as the areas became more populated and developed. Across three study districts in 2013, each additional hectare of forest cleared raised the expected price of a parcel of land by US $1371-$2587. Importantly, we estimate the opportunity cost per hectare of frontier forest rose markedly over time: by $124-$226 per year between 2003 and 2013, a rate of increase over that period of 9-27% per year. Forest conservation programs that rely on estimates of landholders' willingness to accept compensation for sparing forest need to take into account that these values change rapidly as frontiers develop.

ICaempferia parviflora a popular rhizomatous medicinal plant was investigated for secondary metabolite and plant biomass accumulation in response to shading and cultivar type. Two cultivars KPM (K.parviflora Malysia) and KPT (K.parviflora Thai) were analyzed for growth and secondary metabolite content under four shade levels (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%). Photosynthetic capability, plant biomass and total flavonoid content were highest both cultivars under 30% shade after 9 months of growth cycle. 0% shade induced stress on plant growth and reduced photosynthetic capability and the flavonoid accumulation in both cultivars. 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF) was used as a chemical marker tb quantify secondary metabolite content in K. parviflora cultivars. DMF was greatest in KPM grown under 30% shade. KPT had higher biomass than KPM under 30% but lower DMF content. In conclusion, K. parviflora is a semi shade loving, plant suitable to grow under 30% shading for high yield and secondary metabolite production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Who Cares about Forests and Why? Individual Values Attributed to Forests

AB Understanding the multiple ways people value forests is important, as individual values regarding nature have been shown to partly determine willingness to participate in conservation initiatives. As individual values are influenced by past experiences, the way people value forests may be related to the ecosystem services they use and receive. We here aim to investigate if people value forests because of material and non-material benefits forest provide (material and non-material values), and if these values are defined by previous experiences associated with using forest resources and having frequent contact with forests. By interviewing 363 residents across 20 landscapes varying in forest cover in a post-frontier region in Amazonia, we evaluated: (1) if the use of forest resources-especially bushmeat, important for sustenance and cash income in virtually all tropical forests-is associated with attributing higher material value to forests; (2) whether the contact with forest (estimated by local forest cover and visits to forests) is associated with attributing higher non-material value to forests. As expected, respondents from households where hunting occurs and bushmeat consumption is more frequent attributed higher material value to forests, and those living in more deforested landscapes and that visited forests less often attributed lower non-material value to forests. The importance of bushmeat in shaping the way people value forests suggests that encouraging the sustainable use of this product will encourage forest conservation. Results also point to a potential dangerous reinforcing cycle: low forest cover and the loss of contact with forests may erode forest values and facilitate further deforestation. Engaging rural communities in forest conservation initiatives is challenging yet urgent in degraded landscapes, although harnessing appreciation for bushmeat could offer a starting point.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation influence species distributions and therefore ecological processes that depend upon them. Pollination may be particularly susceptible to fragmentation, as it depends on frequent pollinator movement. Unfortunately, most pollinators are too small to track efficiently which has precluded testing the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation reduces or eliminates pollen flow by disrupting pollinator movement. We used radio-telemetry to examine space use of the green hermit hummingbird (Phaethornis guy), an important 'hub' pollinator of understory flowering plants across substantial portions of the neotropics and the primary pollinator of a keystone plant which shows reduced pollination success in fragmented landscapes. We found that green hermits strongly avoided crossing large stretches of non-forested matrix and preferred to move along stream corridors. Forest gaps as small as 50 m diminished the odds of movement by 50%. Green hermits occurred almost exclusively inside the forest, with the odds of occurrence being 8 times higher at points with >95% canopy cover compared with points having <5% canopy cover. Nevertheless, surprisingly. the species occurred in fragmented landscapes with low amounts of forest (similar to 30% within a 2 km radius). Our results indicate that although green hermits are present even in landscapes with low amounts of tropical forest, movement within these landscapes ends up strongly constrained by forest gaps. Restricted movement of pollinators may be an underappreciated mechanism for widespread declines in pollination and plant fitness in fragmented landscapes, even when in the presence of appropriate pollinators.

AB The effects of herbivory can shape plant communities and evolution. However, the many forms of herbivory costs and the wide variation in herbivory pressure, including across latitudinal gradients, can make predicting the effects of herbivory on different plant species difficult. Functional trait approaches may aid in contextualizing and standardizing the assessment of herbivory impacts. Here we assessed the response of 26 old-field plant species to simulated defoliation in a greenhouse setting by measuring whole plant and leaf level traits in control and treated individuals. Simulated defoliation had no significant effects on any plant traits measured. However, the baseline leaf level traits of healthy plants consistently predicted the log response ratio for these species whole plant response to defoliation. The latitudinal mid-point of species' distributions was also significantly correlated with aboveground biomass and total leaf area responses, with plants with a more northern distribution being more negatively impacted by treatment. These results indicate that even in the absence of significant overall impacts, functional traits may aid in predicting variability in plant responses to defoliation and in identifying the underlying limitations driving those responses.

TI Tree Diversity Enhances Stand Carbon Storage but Not Leaf Area in a

   PRODUCTIVITY; BIODIVERSITY; INCREASES; GROWTH; ROOT
AB Research about biodiversity-productivity relationships has focused on herbaceous ecosystems, with results from tree field studies only recently beginning to emerge. Also, the latter are concentrated largely in the temperate zone. Tree species diversity generally is much higher in subtropical and tropical than in temperate or boreal forests, with reasons not fully understood. Niche overlap and thus complementarity in the use of resources that support productivity may be lower in forests than in herbaceous ecosystems, suggesting weaker productivity responses to diversity change in forests. We studied stand basal area, vertical structure, leaf area, and their relationship with tree species richness in a subtropical forest in south-east China. Permanent forest plots of 30 x 30 m were selected to span largely independent gradients in tree species richness and secondary successional age. Plots with higher tree species richness had a higher stand basal area. Also, stand basal area increases over a 4-year census interval were larger at high than at low diversity. These effects translated into increased carbon stocks in aboveground phytomass (estimated using allometric equations). A higher variability in tree height in more diverse plots suggested that these effects were facilitated by denser canopy packing due to architectural complementarity between species. In contrast, leaf area was not or even negatively affected by tree diversity, indicating a decoupling of carbon accumulation from leaf area. Alternatively, the same community leaf area might have assimilated more C per time interval in more than in less diverse plots because of differences in leaf turnover and productivity or because of differences in the display of leaves in vertical and horizontal space. Overall, our study suggests that in species-rich forests niche-based processes support a positive diversity-productivity relationship and that this translates into increased carbon storage in long-lived woody structures. Given the high growth rates of these forests during secondary succession, our results further indicate that a forest management promoting tree diversity after disturbance may accelerate CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere and thus be relevant in a climate-change context.

AB Our objective was to elucidate how climate and landscape composition influence the ground beetle community at different time and spatial scales. Ground beetles were sampled with pitfall traps at 36 sites located in nine provinces. A total of 2355 individuals, belonging to 96 species, were observed. The dominant species were Anisodactylus punctatipennis, Dolichus halensis halensis, Harpalus griseus, Harpalus jureceki, Pheropsophus jessoensis, and Pterostichus haptoderoides. The distribution pattern of ground beetles among nine provinces seemed to have a zonal variation with latitude in national scale. Dendrograms revealed that the province of Jeju-do has a distinctive species composition, and the highest species number compared with the other eight inland provinces. A cluster analysis showed that the distribution patterns of 18 dominant species could be separated into two groups according to their abundances. It suggested competition between dominant and subdominant groups for habitat resources. A higher number of species were associated with recent annual climate (June 2012 May 2013) than climate normals (1981-2010). Maximum temperature was the most determining factor among the temperature variables, whereas some species correlated with recent annual precipitation. However, Patrobus flavipes only correlated with precipitation normals. Furthermore, some species correlated with the landscape composition of the area surrounding the sample site. A. punctatipennis was associated with grasslands, which reflects their specialized food source and habitat type dependency. Pterostichus haptoderoides was associated with forest parameters. Finally, species number was positively correlated with both grasslands and annual precipitation. The results show that climate and heterogeneous landscape compositions may influence the distribution of ground beetle communities in agricultural fields.

AB Southern Chilean pristine temperate rainforests have been floristically stable during the Holocene, thus representing a pre-industrial baseline of forest ecology. Given this and its edaphic limitations, it is imperative to better understand these forests ecological patterns of mycorrhizal symbiosis. Therefore, here we compare the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) communities in three treeline Nothofagus pumilio contrasting plots of Chilean Andes (a volcano crater, pristine forest, and disturbed forest). The AM community assemblages were determined by morphological identification and spore counting, in three A horizon soil samples by plot. In the same nine soil samples, standard chemical analysis was performed. Eighteen AM species were described; Acaulospora was the most abundant genus. The forest plot had the highest AM species richness compared to the disturbed and crater plots. Interestingly, soils Olsen P (plant available phosphorus), pH, and Al+++ saturation similarly affected the AM assemblages. We suggest that some AM species could be specially adapted to extremely high Al saturation and extremely low plant available P conditions, as those experienced on Andean Nothofagus forests. These species may help initiate biological succession on highly disturbed ecosystems. We suggest that mycorrhizal fungi play a key role in seedling colonization of extreme environments such as the Andean treeline.

AB Background and Aims Ecologists are increasingly using plant functional traits to predict community assembly, but few studies have linked functional traits to species' responses to fine-scale resource gradients. In this study, it was tested whether saplings of woody species partition fine-scale gradients in light availability based on their leaf mass per area (LMA) in three temperate rain forests and one Mediterranean forest in southern Chile.
   Methods LMA was measured under field conditions of all woody species contained in approx. 60 plots of 2 m 2 in each site, and light availability, computed as the gap light index (GLI), was determined. For each site, species' pairwise differences in mean LMA (D LMA) and abundance-weighted mean GLI (D light response) of 2 m 2 plots were calculated and it was tested whether they were positively related using Mantel tests, i. e. if species with different LMA values differed in their response to light availability. Additionally linear models were fitted to the relationship between plot-level mean LMA and GLI across plots for each site.
   Key Results A positive and significant relationship was found between species' pairwise differences in mean LMA and differences in light response across species for all temperate rain forests, but not for the Mediterranean forest. The results also indicated a significant positive interspecific link between LMA and light availability for all forests. This is in contrast to what is traditionally reported and to expectations from the leaf economics spectrum.
   Conclusions In environments subjected to light limitation, interspecific differences in a leaf trait (LMA) can explain the fine-scale partitioning of light availability gradients by woody plant species. This niche partitioning potentially facilitates species coexistence at the within-community level. The high frequency of evergreen shadeintolerant species in these forests may explain the positive correlation between light availability and LMA.

AB A current lawsuit by the Des Moines Water Works against three upstream Iowa counties raises the prospect that agricultural drain managers nationwide will bear greater responsibility to promote conservation practices that protect downstream water quality. To date, however, an institutional and administrative approach for doing so is lacking. A pilot program in southwestern Michigan introduced a new method for apportioning drain management costs that rewards landowners who use conservation practices known to reduce sedimentation. The logic of the program is that as each parcel deposits less sediment into a drain, the cost of maintaining that drain will decline. We describe the program, review its performance relative to a number of criteria, and discuss its prospects for replication elsewhere. Several Michigan drain commissioners have expressed interest in replicating the approach which reduced participating landowners' drain assessments by 21 percent in the pilot program. The details of the program are quite specific to the case in Michigan, but institutionally it offers a way forward that could be applied widely.

AB Wave-swept shores are valuable for developing and testing key ecological principles. A synthesis of research is nonetheless missing a critical component: the chemosensory basis for behavioral interactions that determine population-and community-wide attributes. Chemical signaling environments on wave-swept shores, given their intense, turbulent mixing and complex topographies, would be difficult or impossible to simulate in a laboratory setting. For this reason, appropriately scaled field studies are needed to advance understanding of chemical stimuli and their biotic effects. Here, we performed a field investigation to establish the relative roles of dissolved and contact cues in predation by whelks (Acanthinucella spirata) on barnacles (Balanus glandula), their preferred prey. Experiments tested responses of whelks to seawater drawn above dense prey patches (10,240-12,180 barnacles m(-2)) and also over adjacent sand flats (no prey present). There was no evidence of waterborne stimuli associated with prey, even when sea states were nearly tranquil. Field trials also tested faux prey, which were constructed from cleaned barnacle shells and flavored gels. Prospective contact cues were presented to whelks at concentrations typical of epidermal tissue and cuticle in live, intact barnacles. These compounds were highly effective inducers of attack behavior and feeding. Selective enzyme degradations showed that the bioactive material was proteinaceous. Moreover, whelks did not distinguish faux barnacles with a single, purified glycoprotein (named "MULTIFUNCin") from live counterparts. Combined field results thus demonstrate the importance of contact cues, and indicate little, if any, effect of waterborne cues on predation by whelks under native conditions. Our findings underscore the need for appropriately scaled field experiments, and highlight surface chemistry as a critical factor that drives trophic interactions on rocky, wave-swept shores.

AB The increased global demand for tropical timber has driven vast expanses of tropical forests to be selectively logged worldwide. While logging impacts on wildlife are predicted to change species distribution and abundance, the underlying physiological responses are poorly understood. Although there is a growing consensus that selective logging impacts on natural populations start with individual stress-induced sublethal responses, this literature is dominated by investigations conducted with vertebrates from temperate zones. Moreover, the sublethal effects of human-induced forest disturbance on tropical invertebrates have never been examined. To help address this knowledge gap, we examined the body fat content and relative abundance of three dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) with minimum abundance of 40 individuals within each examined treatment level. These were sampled across 34 plots in a before-after control-impact design (BACI) in a timber concession area of the Brazilian Amazon. For the first time, we present evidence of logging-induced physiological stress responses in tropical invertebrates. Selective logging increased the individual levels of fat storage and reduced the relative abundance of two dung beetle species. Given this qualitative similarity, we support the measurement of body fat content as reliable biomarker to assess stress-induced sublethal effects on dung beetles. Understanding how environmental modification impacts the wildlife has never been more important. Our novel approach provides new insights into the mechanisms through which forest disturbances impose population-level impacts on tropical invertebrates.

AB In spite of recent advances, the relative roles of deterministic and stochastic processes in community assembly remains disputed. We tested community assembly hypotheses in a disturbance gradient in a logged mixed conifer-hardwood forest complex in southern Brazil. If abiotic heterogeneity was strong enough (Selection hypothesis), we expected niche clustering and reduced niche overlap between species and between ecological groups, phylogenetic clustering, significant beta-diversity departure from a random expectation after controlling for alpha-diversity variation, and non-random trait distribution due to abiotic filtering and limiting similarity. Null expectations were predicted under the Neutral hypothesis. Under the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis, we expected niche clustering and reduced niche overlap as in the Selection hypothesis, but random phylogenetic distribution, random beta-diversity variation, and random trait distribution due to niche-based specialization but weak habitat matching resulting from dispersal limitation and drift. We used a series of null models to provide an integrative evaluation of community assembly including species abundances, environmental preferences, phylogenetic relatedness, and trait distribution. Results supported the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis due to a combination of reduced niche overlap, niche clustering along soil and disturbance gradients, evidence for abiotic filtering of functional traits but absent phylogenetic structure and random beta-diversity variation. Support to the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis provides evidence for niche-based species selection along environmental gradients, coupled with poor matches between species distributions and environmental factors due to stochastic processes. It also highlights the importance of an integrative approach to the evaluation of community patterns indicative of assembly processes. Had only a subset of the approaches used been employed and different conclusions would have been reached: niche overlap and trait distribution analyses would have indicated a stronger role for selection, while phylogenetic and abundance analyses would have indicated stochastic community assembly. Future research should include different disturbance regimes along with environmental variation in order to assess the interplay of the different drivers that shape the community assembly process, as well as the potential of the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis as an explanation for the assembly process of complex and species-rich subtropical forests.

AB The tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) of central Veracruz, Mexico, predominantly grows on volcanic substrate from the Quaternary (2-0.08 Mya), but in very small areas it grows on shallow soils over limestone rock outcrops from the Cretaceous (90 Mya). Our objective was to contrast the vegetation structure and tree species composition of forest communities growing on rock outcrops (FOR) with nearby forests on prevalent volcanic soil (FOV). Results show that species richness and vegetation structure were similar between FOR and FOV. However, a clear difference was revealed by indicator species analysis (ISA), and multinomial classification model (CLAM). ISA and CLAM, respectively, identified 14 indicators and 13 specialists in FOR, whereas, they identified 7 indicators and 14 specialists in FOV. Some FOR indicators were Cercis canadensis, Clusia guatemalensis, Garrya laurifolia, Ostrya virginiana and Quercus pinnativenulosa. Some FOV indicators were Carpinus tropicalis, Clethra macrophylla, Liquidambar styraciflua and Quercus xalapensis; these species are also common in several Mexican TMCF. Our study demonstrates that the tree community on rock outcrops differs from the surrounding forest on volcanic soils; this is of particular interest because of its different species assemblage and contribution to the high beta diversity of the region.

AB Hummingbirds can vary their foraging strategies by adopting different behavior patterns. In Central America, the territorial behavior of these birds may be influenced by the floral resource availability in patches of Heliconia L. (Heliconiaceae) species. We investigated whether a similar pattern occurs in the South American species, Heliconia spathocircinata Aristeg., in a fragment of Atlantic forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and whether agonistic interactions between the hummingbirds were correlated with the body weight. We conducted focal observations over two flowering seasons (2011/2012 and 2012/2013) in 159 patches of H. spathocircinata to evaluate whether territorial defense by the hummingbirds depends on floral resource availability (number of inflorescences per patch of 78.5 m(2)), using a linear regression analysis. This patch area (territory size) was defined arbitrarily, based on the typical size of inflorescence patches found within the study area. The potential relationship between body weight and agonism was evaluated using a Pearson correlation. We recorded 55 different territories defended by Thalurania glaucopis (Gmelin, 1788) in patches containing between eight and 16 inflorescences. The number of times the T. glaucopis males defended their territories was influenced by the number of inflorescences per patch. Agonism was positively correlated with body weight only for intraspecific interactions in T. glaucopis. This indicates that the foraging behavior of the pollinator of the South American H. spathocircinata may be influenced directly by the available number of inflorescences in patches of this plant.

AB The "Bosco Fontana" natural reserve includes the last remaining mixed flood-plain forest in northern Italy and one of the most endangered ecosystems in Europe. Its effective management is hindered by the complexity of interactions of mixed-tree species and the influence of environmental factors on understory plant diversity. In this study we analyzed the patterns of natural evolution in semi-natural floodplain forest stands at Bosco Fontana with the aim of better understanding its current natural processes and dynamics. Stand structure, taxonomic and functional diversity, species composition, and leaf area index (LAI) of overstory and understory layers were surveyed in permanent plots over two inventory years (1995, 2005). The influence of environmental factors on understory plant diversity was assessed using Ellenberg's indices for light, soil moisture, soil nutrient and soil reaction. Results indicated that overstory species composition varies according to the soil moisture, with hornbeam prevailing in xeric sites and deciduous oak species in mesic sites. Xeric sites showed high functional dispersion in both drought and shade tolerant traits, while it was significantly lower in both overstory and understory in the moist site. Functional dispersion of drought tolerance in the overstory and understory layers was positively correlated, while species richness was negatively correlated between the two layers. Diversity in the understory was mainly correlated with soil conditions. Understory LAI was positively correlated with overstory LAI in xeric and mesic plots, while no correlations were found in the moist plot. Overall, our results suggest that site conditions ( soil conditions and water availability) are the major drivers of understory and overstory dynamics in the study forest. Hence, local site conditions and the understory should be carefully considered in the management of mixed floodplain forests.

AB Termites constitute the major component of the macrofauna of the soil, and influence the structure of the soil, in tropical regions. This study aimed to estimate their assemblages in a chronosequence of mango tree orchards in the north of Cte d'Ivoire and compare them with those in unmanaged savanna. Using a standardized method of rapid biodiversity estimation, termites were collected in seven age classes of mango tree orchards (class 1: < 5 years; class 2: 5-9 years; class 3: 10-14 years; class 4: 15-19 years; class 5: 20-24 years; class 6: 25-29 years; class 7: 30 years and over) and compared with termites collected from the savanna. Results show that the species richness was lowest in the young orchards of class 1 (9 species), and increased with the age of the orchards to reach its maximum in the old orchards of class 7 (28 species); these latter were comparable in richness with the savanna (26 species). The Shannon index (H') and the evenness (E) follow the same trend as the species richness. The orchards of classes 1 and 2 were more dissimilar to the savanna. In contrast, termites were well represented in the savanna and in the old orchard of classes 6 and 7. Rhinotermitinae and Cubitermitinae subfamilies, absent in the young orchards of classes 1 and 2, were very abundant in the old orchards (classes 6 and 7). Overall, the findings of this study show that only the old mango orchards sustain termite diversity that comes close to that of the savanna. In this region, the cessation of agricultural activities in mango orchards favors the reconstitution of termite communities and presumably the restoration of the ecosystem services provided by termites. Thus it would be possible to combine agriculture and the conservation soil biodiversity.

AB In different Mediterranean zones (MZ) of the world, extensive areas of native forests have been replaced by forest plantations composed of non-native species that exceeded 264 million ha globally in 2010. In Chile, 80% of these plantations are distributed in the same zone where forested wetlands are dominant. Non-native forest plantations are inversely related to the quantity, distribution and availability of water resources. In this study, the characteristics of the water regime of the forested wetlands were assessed, and their relationship to non-native forest plantations and native forest cover was established. The results indicated that most forested wetlands present a significant decrease in both depth and water volume in the summer (p < 0.05), which is related to a decrease in rainfall. However, those wetlands with a higher percentage of non-native forest plantations in their basins (> 18%) presented a temporary water regime, unlike those in which native forest dominated (>21%), which presented a permanent water regime. Strong negative relations were registered (p < 0.05) among the percentage of forest plantation and water availability, minimum depth and minimum water volume. On the other hand, the percentage of native forest was positively related with the same variables (p < 0.05). This study presents a clear relationship between forest activity and water availability, especially during the summer, when the normal decline of the water resources in the wetlands worsens.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate how predictive methods can be used to investigate the effectiveness of conservation interventions prior to their implementation and ensure that limited resources are invested in those interventions that will achieve the strongest outcomes for conservation. Too often, operational, financial and logistical constraints lead to the design of interventions based on past experience and expert opinion, without an assessment of the probable outcomes of alternative approaches. Here, we employ a simple method that can be used by conservation managers to evaluate a range of credible alternatives and select the intervention predicted to have the greatest impact. We apply scenario-based interviews to investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing household forest clearance at a REDD + site in Cambodia. In this context, we show that collective performance payments, structured either as payments to individual households or to village development funds, have the greatest potential to reduce household clearance. In comparison, greater enforcement effort and individually contracted performance payments - options that might otherwise have been considered credible choices - are predicted to perform poorly, with only negligible reductions in forest clearance.

ID INDEX
AB The light environment in the understory of cloud forests is highly heterogeneous and determined by species composition, canopy structure, site conditions, and seasonality. This study was carried out at San Eusebio cloud forest, Venezuela (2 300 - 2 500 masl). The impact of canopy structure variations on understory light availability was estimated in the dry (December-February) and rainy (March-November) seasons, in sites under continuous canopy cover and gaps of various sizes. Hemispherical photographs were taken to estimate the percentage of canopy openness, leaf area index, percentages of transmitted direct and diffuse light, and duration and frequency of sunflecks. A light index was calculated from the relative proportions of direct and diffuse light transmitted to the understory. For most variables, there were significant differences between seasons, as well as among different gap sizes and under closed canopy. The light index was low (0.25 to 26 of a maximum = 100), even for the largest gaps, indicating a highly shaded light environment, especially beneath closed canopy in the rainy season. Patterns and interactions among factors were analyzed (gaps vs. continuous canopy, gap sizes, location within the gaps, and seasonality) with a mixed effects repeated measures Anova design. Results showed that the amount of light reaching the understory is low in both gaps and closed canopy. However, small but significant differences in light availability existed for both seasonality and magnitude of the perturbations. These differences could contribute to explain the dynamics of tree species regeneration in this forest. The knowledge of the factors conditioning light availability in the understory where tree regeneration begins is crucial in cloud forests because of energetic limitations in this ecosystem, and might be essential for future restoration and conservation plans concerning the preservation of the diversity and integrity of these forests.

AB Conservation of biodiversity is an ongoing challenge. Governments face many constraints when pursuing conservation, one of the most pervasive being limited budgets for buying land for conservation. To achieve conservation goals, an alternative to acquisition is on-farm conservation. Research suggests that the success of on-farm conservation programs depends primarily on land managers' behaviour. In the past, one of the tools used for on-farm conservation has been financial incentives but these may be ineffective if they do not align with the intrinsic motivations of land managers. Our paper seeks to learn more about the intrinsic motivations of land managers by learning more about what contributes to their overall quality of life (life satisfaction). We hypothesize that by understanding the drivers of land manager's subjective assessments of their own life satisfaction we will be able to shed light on the types of incentives that could help promote on-farm conservation. Our analysis highlights that good relationships are the most important contributor to land managers' life satisfaction. We conclude that programs which help maintain good social networks whilst encouraging on-farm conservation are likely to align with intrinsic motivations of land managers and might therefore be more successful in making genuine additional contributions to biodiversity than programs providing only financial incentives.

AB The Guayana Shield is one of the oldest geological formations in South America, ranging from southern Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas to the extreme north of the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Roraima. Because of its ancient origin and isolation from other mountain ranges in South America, it harbors a rich flora with high levels of endemism. Recent expeditions to remote areas in the Brazilian portion of the Guayana Shield generated many new herbarium collections. Through these efforts, we report the first records for Brazil of 57 species and infraspecific taxa of vascular plants. In most cases, the taxa are narrowly distributed and were previously known from nearby populations in other countries. In other cases, however, the new Brazilian records expand considerably the known geographical distributions of the taxa.

AB The effectiveness of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) in Mexico may be reduced by a lack of guidance on intra-watershed priority zones and an overemphasis on water supply versus other services such as water quality. We explored the links between land use, water quality, and public health in central Veracruz. We identified zones of high and low cholera prevalence and evaluated the effects of land use on water quality at different scales. Production functions were used to evaluate relationships between water quality and public health. Additionally, using mitigation and defensive costs methods and a combined regression model, we estimated a marginal value per hectare of forest in avoiding public health costs associated with contaminated water. Prevalence of cholera was associated with E. coli. concentrations in streams. Primary forest cover was the land use most strongly correlated with E. coli., particularly within riparian corridors of 100 m width. Our results suggest a value of water quality regulation of at least $US 90 ha(-1) in riparian corridors. These results highlight the importance of targeting PES in priority areas within watersheds and considering both water quality and quantity as a means of increasing program efficiency and potentially broadening financial support for these programs.

AB Scatter-hoarding rodents may interact with the structural characteristics of their environment in several ways: by seeking dense areas inside the forest for protection during seed handling, by caching seeds close to objects that might be used as visual cues for seed recovery or by hiding themselves inside refuges such as burrows. We investigated the use of structural characteristics of the forest by a scatter-hoarder rodent (the Azara's agouti, Dasyprocta azarae) in the Brazilian Araucaria Forest. We evaluated the selection of microhabitat characteristics for feeding or caching seeds, and the selection of potential landmarks for increasing seed recovery rates. For that, we followed threaded seeds of Araucaria angustifolia (Araucari-aceae) and also placed artificial caches in the forest. We predicted that agoutis (1) select feeding and caching sites whose microhabitat characteristics potentially enhance protection against predators, (2) hoard seeds preferentially near potential landmarks and (3) find artificial caches placed near potential landmarks more frequently than caches placed away (<0.5 m) from any landmark. As expected, agoutis significantly selected feeding and caching sites with greater herbaceous cover, closer to tree trunks, and with higher tree density compared to randomly selected sites. Considering potential landmarks, agoutis not only selected sites near to fallen logs and treelets for caching but also preferred the latter for immediate seed consumption. Moreover, seeds buried near treelets were recovered more frequently than seeds cached near fallen logs, tree trunks or exposed rocks. The proximity of potential landmarks, however, did not influence seed removal from artificial caches, suggesting that visual cues do not enhance seed location by naive foragers. Our conclusions are: (1) agoutis transport seeds to potentially safer places for immediately consuming or burying them; (2) fallen logs and treelets are potential visual cues for seed recovery; and (3) naive foragers seem to use mainly olfactory cues for seed detection.

AB Diet compositions of Patagonotothen cornucola and Harpagifer bispinis were studied from two localities, one with continental influence in a wind-protected area (Puerto Riquelme) and another with oceanic influence in a wind-exposed area (Puerto Williams). The dietary analysis performed showed intra-specific differences among contrasting intertidal areas, with greater richness and diversity of prey types in fish from Puerto Riquelme than in Puerto Williams. Gammarid amphipods and Tanaidae dominated the diet of P. cornucola and H. bispinis in Puerto Riquelme, whereas the diet of both fish species in Puerto Williams was characterized by the crustacean isopod Exosphaeroma gigas and gammarids. The dietary overlap was quantified using two similarity indexes (Sorensen and Morisita-Horn), and the results obtained revealed a high diet overlap among the species in each locality. Diet composition did not show significant difference between sexes in both species, while P. cornucola from Puerto Riquelme presented significant differences in fish size in the diet, supporting the existence of some food partitioning. Dissolved oxygen and salinity were important factors in the diet variability of P. cornucola and H. bispinis, since both species showed greater richness and diversity of prey types in intertidal areas with higher dissolved oxygen and lower salinity levels (Puerto Riquelme). In conclusion, the dietary patterns of these two sympatric rocky intertidal species in the Patagonian channels and fjords appear to be regulated by the different environmental conditions that influence the availability and abundance of potential prey in the diet.

AB Successful pest-mammal eradications from remote islands have resulted in important biodiversity benefits. Near-shore islands can also serve as refuges for native biota but require ongoing effort to maintain low-pest or pest-free status. Three management options are available in the presence of reinvasion risk: (1) control-to-zero density, in which immigration may occur but reinvaders are removed; (2) sustained population suppression (to relatively low numbers); or (3) no action. Biodiversity benefits can result from options one and two. The management challenge is to make evidence-based decisions on the selection of an appropriate objective and to identify a financially feasible control strategy that has a high probability of success. This requires understanding the pest species population dynamics and how it will respond to a range of potential management strategies, each with an associated financial cost. We developed a two-stage modeling approach that consisted of (1) Bayesian inferential modeling to estimate parameters for a model of pest population dynamics and control, and (2) a forward projection model to simulate a range of plausible management scenarios and quantify the probability of obtaining zero density within four years. We applied the model to an ongoing, six-year trapping program to control stoats (Mustela erminea) on Resolution Island, New Zealand. Zero density has not yet been achieved. Results demonstrate that management objectives were impeded by a combination of a highly fecund population, insufficient trap attractiveness, and a substantial proportion of the population that did not enter traps. Immigration is known to occur because the founding population arrived on the island by swimming from the mainland. However, immigration rate during this study was indistinguishable from zero. The forward projection modeling showed that control-to-zero density was feasible but required greater than a two-fold budget increase to intensify the trapping rate relative to population growth. The two-stage modeling provides the foundation for a management program in which broad-scale trials of additional trapping effort or improved trap lures would test model predictions and increase our understanding of system dynamics.

AB We investigated the magnitude and drivers of spatial variability in soil and plant delta N-15 across the landscape in a topographically complex semiarid ecosystem. We hypothesized that large spatial heterogeneity in water availability, soil fertility and vegetation cover would be positively linked to high local-scale variability in delta N-15.
   We measured foliar delta N-15 in three dominant plant species representing contrasting plant functional types (tree, shrub, grass) and mycorrhizal association types (ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal). This allowed us to investigate whether delta N-15 responds to landscape scale environmental heterogeneity in a consistent way across species.
   Leaf delta N-15 varied greatly within species across the landscape and was strongly spatially correlated among co-occurring individuals of the three species. Plant delta N-15 correlated tightly with soil delta N-15 and key measures of soil fertility, water availability and vegetation productivity, including soil nitrogen (N), organic carbon (C), plant-available phosphorus (P), water-holding capacity, topographic moisture indices and normalized difference vegetation index. Multiple regression models accounted for 62-83% of within-species variation in delta N-15 across the landscape.
   The tight spatial coupling and interdependence of the water, N and C cycles in drylands may allow the use of leaf delta N-15 as an integrative measure of variations in moisture availability, biogeochemical activity, soil fertility and vegetation productivity (or 'site quality') across the landscape.

AB Many of the world's terrestrial environments are dominated by production land-uses, making the incorporation of production landscapes into conservation strategies critical for halting global biodiversity declines. Two challenges for developing such strategies are: (1) determining species' capacity to survive in production land-uses; and (2) understanding why some species can survive, while others cannot. The interaction between biological traits of organisms and their response to disturbances may assist in resolving these challenges. We compared species and trait composition of 41 lowland rainforest birds among unlogged and forestry production land-uses on New Britain Island, Papua New Guinea. At least 92% of forest species occurred in mature, native Eucalyptus plantation and regrown logged forest. However, composition changes demonstrated successive loss of some species (medium-and large-bodied frugivores, forest specialists) with increasing intensity of disturbance, indicating that forestry management practices can affect the functional composition of forest birds. In contrast to many continental studies where endemism confers susceptibility to disturbance, we found endemic island species widely distributed across all land-uses, reflecting their capacity for colonizing new environments. Ecological traits can help to explain species' responses to landscape management, however, the type and intensity of disturbance and biogeography of the region affect the traits-disturbance interaction. Our study indicates that native plantations may be able to assist with biodiversity conservation while providing production values, but only if they are judiciously managed in concert with unlogged and regrown logged forest reserves.

AB Studies on the effects of habitat fragmentation on small mammals often lead to confounding results as they only consider taxonomic groups in their analysis and neglect functional diversity of the communities. Here we describe the structure and composition of small mammal communities at 22 sites, ranging from 41 to 7035ha, in a hyper-fragmented landscape of an Amazonia-Cerrado ecotone. Also, in considering a taxonomic and habitat guild approach, we report the effects of habitat structures and patch spatial attributes on richness, abundance and species composition. Small mammal richness reported in southern Amazonia (N=23 species) is greater than most previous studies in the tropics. All rare small mammals captured in this study were forest interior species. Richness of forest interior species was positively related to larger patches, as shown by the species-area relationship. However, 52% of the small mammal species were in forest fragments smaller than 50ha, highlighting the importance of preserving both large and small forest fragments in a landscape with accelerated habitat reduction. Richness of edge-tolerant species was not associated with the tested variables, yet edge-tolerant species were more abundant in degraded environments. Marsupials were positively associated with vertical habitat structures, while rodents were more strongly related to a ground-level habitat structure. The landscape studied is extremely variable and has contributed to the difficulty in detecting clear patterns, particularly when considering only one approach. Because of the complementary outputs when analysing either taxonomic groups or habitat guilds, we recommend the use of multi-taxa studies of different guilds to assist decision makers in designing conservation strategies and appropriate management of small mammal populations.

   RESPONSES
AB Climate change scientists predict an increased intensity of storms (cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons) in the future. Intense storms facilitate plant invasion by increasing resource availability, reducing competition and increasing opportunities for propagule dispersal. We document here the state of current understanding about the response of invasive plant species to intense storms and suggest that the structure and function of forests in storm-prone regions may be much altered in the future as a result of weed invasion. Intense storms provide a large spatial and temporal window of opportunity for invasion and empirical research demonstrates growth and recruitment rates of invasive species increase following such events, and they spread readily. In particular, lianas and woody invasive species that are shade tolerant and recruit from the seedling layer may constitute the greatest threat to tropical forests following storm events. Forests persisting in fragmented landscapes will be exposed to some of the most severe consequences of intense storms and subsequent weed invasion. In storm-prone regions, forests of the future are likely to experience a decrease in diversity of native species and homogenization of communities at landscape and regional scales, slower rates of forest succession, increasing degradation of forest fragments and ultimately a decrease in ecosystem function.

AB This study modelled the potential biodiversity benefits and the opportunity costs of a patch-clear-cutting strategy over a clear-cutting strategy for Pinus radiata in New Zealand. Patch-clear cutting is a special case of clear cutting involving the removal of all the trees from strips or patches within a stand, leaving the remainder uncut or clear cutting a series of strips or patches. A forest-level optimisation model was extended to include uncertainty in timber growth, plant diversity, and cutting costs. Using a species-area relationship and economies of cutting scale, the net present value and optimal rotation age under alternative management strategies were calculated. Results suggested that the optimal rotation ages were similar (24 and 25 years) for the two cutting strategies. Patch-clear cutting provided higher biodiversity benefits (i.e., 59 vs. 11 understorey plant species) with an opportunity cost of 27 NZD (18 USD) per extra plant species or 1250 NZD (820 USD) ha(-1). However, the true benefits of patch-clear cutting would be even greater if other benefits of stand retention are included. Our research can potentially inform local decision making and inform international systems of payment for environmental services, such as the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program, to conserve biodiversity in developing countries with plantation forests.

AB Patch-size and connectivity effects on organisms are usually strong, but may be positive or negative, depending on the landscape context. A binary habitat/non-habitat perspective that fails to consider matrix heterogeneity often explains these inconsistent results, as matrix influences patch quality and connectivity differently for different species. Here we tested the effects of patch size, connectivity and matrix type on non-volant small-mammal assemblages in an eastern-Brazilian Amazonian forest-savanna mosaic. We sampled 14 forest-patches and 2 continuous-forest plots, using 60 baited live traps and 8 pitfall traps (60 L) per plot in 3 field expeditions. We estimated connectivity using the Proximity Index and matrix type as the proportions of savanna or regrowth forest around patches. We used one-dimensional NMDS, ANCOVA and multiple regression to test the relationships among species composition, species traits and predictor variables. We captured 178 individuals of 16 small-mammal species and an NMDS ordination showed a pattern of assemblage change that was strongly related to matrix type. Connectivity and patch size had no statistically significant effect on assemblage composition. Species associated with patches in regrowth-forest matrix were mostly rodents, relatively large and mainly frugivorous, while species associated with savanna-matrix patches were smaller, mostly insectivorous, marsupials. This may be related to how matrix is used by small mammals and affects patch quality, rather than how it limits animal movements. Composition of small-mammal assemblages in patches depended on the type of surrounding matrix, so matrix heterogeneity enhances small-mammal assemblage diversity in this landscape and should be taken into consideration in regional conservation-unit management plans.

AB Fire is considered a major factor in the succession process in "Cerrado'', determining the dynamics and composition of these Neotropical savanna plant formations. However, when savannas are protected from fire, both fire-tolerant and fire-sensitive plant species increase in density and size, especially species of trees. Nevertheless, how this change in the vegetation structure relates to changes in the ecosystem function has been seldom evaluated. Pollination is a major ecosystem service, and here we aimed to determine possible changes in floristic composition, floral biology, and pollination systems in an area of open savanna protected against fire over a period of 20 years in Minas Gerais state, Central Brazil. The comparison over the two decades showed that ecological succession, in the absence of fire, increased the diversity and decreased the dominance of plant species. There was an increase in specie richness from 156 spp. in 1992 to 206 spp. in 2012, with appearance of trees and species with specialized pollination systems. Plants were predominantly pollinated by bees in both periods, but floral diversity and specialization seem to have increased after fire suppression, for instance, with the emergence of more species pollinated by moths. Not only generalist lightcolored actinomorphic flowers, but also tubular or cup-like nectar flowers commonly associated with more specialized pollinators predominated in both periods. The dominance of these contrasting features actually increased after two decades, especially when we compare the number of individuals in each group. However, it seems that the increase in plant diversity and density of woody species did not lead to marked specialization of floral features and pollination system along the studied period.

AB AimThe knowledge of biodiversity facets such as species composition, distribution and ecological niche is fundamental for the construction of biogeographic hypotheses and conservation strategies. However, the knowledge on these facets is affected by major shortfalls, which are even more pronounced in the tropics. This study aims to evaluate the effect of sampling bias and variation in collection effort on Linnean, Wallacean and Hutchinsonian shortfalls and diversity measures as species richness, endemism and beta-diversity.
   LocationBrazil.
   MethodsWe have built a database with over 1.5million records of arthropods, vertebrates and angiosperms of Brazil, based on specimens deposited in scientific collections and on the taxonomic literature. We used null models to test the collection bias regarding the proximity to access routes. We also tested the influence of sampling effort on diversity measures by regression models. To investigate the Wallacean shortfall, we modelled the geographic distribution of over 4000 species and compared their observed distribution with models. To quantify the Hutchinsonian shortfall, we used environmental Euclidean distance of the records to identify regions with poorly sampled environmental conditions. To estimate the Linnean shortfall, we measured the similarity of species composition between regions close to and far from access routes.
   ResultsWe demonstrated that despite the differences in sampling effort, the strong collection bias affects all taxonomic groups equally, generating a pattern of spatially biased sampling effort. This collection pattern contributes greatly to the biodiversity knowledge shortfalls, which directly affects the knowledge on the distribution patterns of diversity.
   Main conclusionsThe knowledge on species richness, species composition and endemism in the Brazilian biodiversity is strongly biased spatially. Despite differences in sampling effort for each taxonomic group, roadside bias affected them equally. Species composition similarity decreased with the distance from access routes, suggesting collection surveys at sites far from roads could increase the probability of sampling new geographic records or new species.

AB Negative frequency-dependent selection among species is a key driver of community diversity in natural systems, but the degree to which negative frequency-dependent selection shapes patterns of survival and genetic diversity within species is poorly understood. In a 5-year field experiment, we show that seedlings of a tropical palm with rare genotypes had a pronounced survival advantage over seedlings with common genotypes, with effect sizes comparable to that of light availability. This 'rare genotype advantage' led to an increase in population-wide genetic diversity among seedlings compared to null expectations, as predicted by negative frequency-dependent selection, and increased reproductive success in adult trees with rare genotypes. These results suggest that within-species negative frequency-dependent selection of genotypes can shape genetic variation on ecologically relevant timescales in natural systems and may be a key, overlooked source of non-random mortality for tropical plants.

AB Recent studies have found that solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation significantly shifts the mass loss and nitrogen dynamics of plant litter decomposition in semi-arid and arid ecosystems. In this study, we examined the role of photodegradation in litter decomposition by using the DayCent-UV biogeochemical model. DayCent-UV incorporated the following mechanisms related to UV radiation: (1) direct photolysis, (2) facilitation of microbial decomposition via production of labile materials, and (3) microbial inhibition effects. We also allowed maximum photodecay rate of the structural litter pool to vary with litter's initial lignin fraction in the model. We calibrated DayCent-UV with observed ecosystem variables (e.g., volumetric soil water content, live biomass, actual evapotranspiration, and net ecosystem exchange), and validated the optimized model with Long-Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment (LIDET) observations of remaining carbon and nitrogen at three semi-arid sites in Western United States. DayCent-UV better simulated the observed linear carbon loss patterns and the persistent net nitrogen mineralization in the 10-year LIDET experiment at the three sites than the model without UV decomposition. In the DayCent-UV equilibrium model runs, UV decomposition increased aboveground and belowground plant production, surface net nitrogen mineralization, and surface litter nitrogen pool, but decreased surface litter carbon, soil net nitrogen mineralization, and mineral soil carbon and nitrogen. In addition, UV decomposition had minimal impacts on trace gas emissions and biotic decomposition rates. The model results suggest that the most important ecological impact of photodecay of surface litter in dry grasslands is to increase N mineralization from the surface litter (25%), and decay rates of the surface litter (15%) and decrease the organic soil carbon and nitrogen (5%).

AB Ant-plant interactions have mainly been considered as a protection mutualism where ants increase plant performance through protection from herbivory. However, host plants may also benefit from nutrients deposited by ants. Nitrogen limits the plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems and the nutrient exchange between ants and plants may be an important mechanism operating in ant-plant interactions. In this study, we quantified the exchange of macronutrients (carbon and nitrogen) between ants and plants, using the Asian weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina as a model species in a mango agroecosystem. A method was developed with which the amount of nitrogen retrieved to their host trees could be predicted by the trail density of O. smaragdina. Ant nutrient consumption was calculated based on data on O. smaragdina abundance and per capita consumption rates obtained in laboratory colonies. On a yearly basis, the influx of nitrogen to the host tree, originating from captured prey, averaged 14.4 (range 8.0-46.4) kg N ha(-1) y(-1). The loss of carbon from the host tree due to ant consumption of exudates from nectaries and tended homopterans averaged 278.1 (range 149.3-939.9) kg C ha(-1) y(-1). O. smaragdina may provide their host plant with a significant source of nitrogen albeit a substantial amount of carbon is consumed from the host plant. This study reveals that the flow of nutrients between ants and plants may play a critical and underestimated role in ant-plant mutualisms.

AB The loss of biodiversity in transitional forests between the Cerrado and Amazonia, the two largest neotropical phytogeographic domains, is an issue of great concern. This extensive region is located within the 'arc of deforestation' zone where tropical forests are being lost at the fastest rate on the planet, but floristic diversity and variation among forests here is still poorly understood. We aimed to characterize the floristic composition of forests in this zone and explored the degree and drivers of differentiation within and across Araguaia and Xingu watersheds. In 10 sites we identified all trees with diameter >= 10 cm; these totaled 4944 individuals in 257 species, 107 genera and 52 families. We evaluated the data for multivariate variation using TWINSPAN and DCA to understand the species distribution among sites. There was a larger contribution from the Amazonian flora (169 species) than that of the Cerrado (109) to the transitional forests. Remarkably, 142 species (55%) were restricted to only one sampling site, while 29 species (> 16%) are endemic to Brazil, suggesting potentially large loss of species and unique forest communities with the loss and fragmentation of large areas. Our results also suggest that watersheds may be a critical factor driving species distribution among forests in the Amazonian-Cerrado transition zone, and quantifying their role can provide powerful insight into devising better conservation strategies for the remaining forests.

AB The vertical and horizontal distribution of larval stages of the most common intertidal barnacle and mussel species were characterized in near-shore waters of central Chile. Paired day/night cruises were conducted on four spring-summer dates between December 2007 and November 2008, under contrasting wind, wave height, and near-shore stratification conditions. Regardless of variability in oceanographic conditions, the highest abundances of barnacle and mussel larvae were found within 1500 m from shore. Non-uniform vertical distributions were observed for chthamalids, balanids and mussel larvae, but patterns of diel variability differed among them. Chthamalid and balanid nauplii, as well as balanid cyprids were more abundant in the upper 20 m of the water column, while the density of chthamalid cyprids was highest near the bottom. Mussel larvae were only found within 20 m of the surface. The Mean Depth Distribution (MDD) of all nauplii (balanid and chthamalid) and chthamalid cyprids was deeper during day than night, suggesting typical diel vertical migration (DVM), but this difference was statistically significant only for nauplii. Mussels did not show diel differences in vertical distribution. The amplitude of DVM, measured as the difference between daytime and nighttime MDD, decreased with increasing wave height in chthamalid and balanid nauplii, but not with along-shore wind stress. Chthamalid nauplii, and to a lesser extent, balanid nauplii were found below the pycnocline during the day and above at night, suggesting that DVM involves daily crossing of this density barrier. In contrast, cyprids of all barnacle species were distributed across the pycnocline with no clear pattern. The results suggest that barnacle and bivalve larvae may exhibit a variety of behavioral responses to position themselves in the water column despite typically turbulent near-shore waters, and that such behavior varies between species and through ontogeny within species. Moreover, some stages of barnacle larvae perform DVM, but the amplitude decreased with increasing wave height- which may be either a plastic response to environmental cues or merely turbulent mixing impeding the ability of larvae to perform vertical migration.

AB The purple dye snail Plicopurpura pansa is recognized as the most important species within the Ilitatulco National Park (HNP) because its dye is used by Mexican ethnic groups from Oaxaca to dye cotton yarn used to produce ceremonial clothing with cultural value. In the HNP, reproductive and recruitment seasons of this species are scarcely documented, and this information is essential to understand its complete life cycle. The aini of this study was thus to establish when reproductive and recruitment seasons began, reached their maximum, and ended in the HNP. Snail length records were obtained for both sexes, and the mean value of age was estimated using length parameters reported in the literature. For each of the estimated age classes, ranging from 0.5- to +4-y-olds, snail abundance was calculated on a monthly basis. Based on a monthly natural mortality rate estimate of 0.53, virtual population analysis was performed to obtain two population indices: (1) snail spawner virtual abundance (or SS index), and (2) snail recruit virtual abundance (or SR index). The SS and SR indices were subjected to time series analysis. With the SS index, a complete reproductive season spanned from March to October/November, with maximum abundance of spawners during June/July; reproductive recovery was observed from October/November to March, between reproductive seasons. With the SR index, a complete recruitment season spanned from August to January/February with a maximum abundance of recruits during November/December. Monthly sea surface temperature changes showed a significant positive correlation with the SS index, and a significant negative correlation with the SR index. Results provide evidence that cultural exploitation is negatively affecting these snails, and support the view that this population is being overexploited within the HNP. Recommendations for improved management of this resource that will prevent its overexploitation are proposed.

   LAND-USE; DISTURBANCE REGIMES; QUATERNARY HISTORY; TROPICAL FORESTS
AB Humans have long utilized resources from all forest biomes, but the most indelible anthropogenic signature has been the expanse of human populations in temperate forests. The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, including those of hardwood, conifer and mixed dominance, with a particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of these forested areas. Implicit in the term 'temperate' is that the predominant climate of these forest regions has distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. The specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display an impressive variability among temperate forest regions. In addition to the more apparent current anthropogenic disturbances of temperate forests, such as forest management and conversion to agriculture, human alteration of temperate forests is actually an ancient phenomenon, going as far back as 7000 yr before present (BP). As deep-seated as these past legacies are for temperate forests, all current and future perturbations, including timber harvesting, excess nitrogen deposition, altered species' phenologies, and increasing frequency of drought and fire, must be viewed through the lens of climate change.

AB The conditions that a population experiences during one season can affect the strength of density dependence in the following season. In the tropics, many populations face their biggest challenges in the dry season due to limited food and cold-dry conditions. Seasonal environmental changes can be especially problematic for small, short-lived, seasonally breeding endotherms. To investigate the effects of seasonality on population dynamics, we studied five marsupial species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, using a 16-year dataset. We tested if (1) compensatory density feedback is stronger in the dry season, due to the high population sizes and limited food; (2) lower temperatures and the overall abundance of small mammals negatively affect dry season population growth rates; and (3) rainfall, a proxy for food availability, is positively related to wet season population growth rates. Population growth rates were regressed against seasonal population sizes and exogenous variables, and analyzed with linear autoregressive models. Seasonal compensatory density feedback occurred in both seasons, with compensation processes in just one season being sufficient to allow population persistence. Rainfall and the overall abundance of small mammals had little influence on populations, while colder temperatures decreased population growth rate of smaller species in both seasons. Although the study marsupials share similar life histories and phylogeny, they varied with respect to the season when compensatory density feedback was strongest. Our results demonstrate that seasonality plays a key role in driving marsupial population dynamics, and highlight the need to account for seasonality in demographic studies even in tropical environments.

AB Aridity has increased in the past decades and will probably continue to increase in arid and semiarid regions. Here we decipher the plant and soil capacity to retain metal cations when climate evolves to more arid conditions.
   We analyzed K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu concentrations in 580 soil samples and 666 plant (shoot and root) samples along a 3600 km aridity gradient in northern China.
   The concentrations of soil exchangeable K, Mg, Mn, Fe and Cu clearly decreased with increasing aridity due to the relationships of aridity with soil clay content and soil pH. Increases in exchangeable Na and Ca concentrations at mid- and high-aridity levels are probably due to the soil salinization, whereas increased exchangeable Fe concentrations at extreme levels of aridity may be more related to a reduced pH. Element concentrations in both plant shoots and roots were unrelated to soil exchangeable element concentrations; instead they increased monotonously with increasing aridity, corresponding with decreases in plant size and shoot/root ratios. The shoot/root mineralomass ratios in general increased with increasing aridity. The proportional higher element contents in shoots than in roots with increasing aridity are related to increased water uptake and/or use efficiency.
   The extractability of soil elements in response to changing climate varied with the nature of specific elements that are controlled by biological and geochemical processes, i.e., some decreased linearly with increasing aridity, whereas others first decreased and then increased with different thresholds. These contrasting effects of aridity on nutrient availability could further constrain plant growth and should be incorporated into biogeochemical models. The prevailing paradigm of a positive relationship between concentrations of plant and soil elements needs to be reconsidered under changing climatic conditions.

AB Oil palm plantations have expanded around the world, increasing concern about its pressure on deforestation rates and the homogenization of the landscape. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the impact of oil palm plantations on the physical characteristics of streams in Amazonia and their effects on Heteroptera, Odonata and Fish assemblages. A total of 23 streams were sampled, eight within fragments of primary forest, while 15 were in oil palm plantations. Data were collected on characteristics of the channel morphology, substrate, hydraulics, instream cover for aquatic organisms, riparian vegetation, human impacts and woody debris. Instream cover and proximity of human impacts were the variables that had the greatest effects on the physical structure of the streams, showing variation between streams of forest in pristine areas and oil palm plantations. Of the analyzed parameters, substrate, instream cover and woody debris influence the richness of Heteroptera, Odonata and Fish. The impact of oil palm plantations on local streams depended on the size of the plantations, and they cannot be considered an adequate substitute for lost habitats in efforts to preserve the physical habitat of Amazonian streams. Any type of conversion of the natural forest can have direct or indirect impacts on the dynamics and structure of these environments, with potentially negative consequences for their biodiversity. The maintenance of an adequate buffer zone of native riparian vegetation adjacent to the streams that flow through the plantations recommended, because this appears to be the principal factor determining the physical conditions of these streams.

AB Soil respiration (Rs) is the second largest carbon flux in terrestrial ecosystems and therefore plays a crucial role in global carbon (C) cycling. This biogeochemical process is closely related to ecosystem productivity and soil fertility and is considered as a key indicator of soil health and quality reflecting the level of microbial activity. Wildfires can have a significant effect on Rs rates and the magnitude of the impacts will depend on environmental factors such as climate and vegetation, fire severity and meteorological conditions post-fire. In this research, we aimed to assess the impacts of a wildfire on the soil CO2 fluxes and soil respiration in a semi-arid ecosystem of Western Australia, and to understand the main edaphic and environmental drivers controlling these fluxes for different vegetation types. Our results demonstrated increased rates of Rs in the burnt areas compared to the unburnt control sites, although these differences were highly dependent on the type of vegetation cover and time since fire. The sensitivity of Rs to temperature (Q10) was also larger in the burnt site compared to the control. Both Rs and soil organic C were consistently higher under Eucalyptus trees, followed by Acacia shrubs. Triodia grasses had the lowest Rs rates and C contents, which were similar to those found under bare soil patches. Regardless of the site condition (unburnt or burnt), Rs was triggered during periods of higher temperatures and water availability and environmental factors (temperature and moisture) could explain a large fraction of Rs variability, improving the relationship of moisture or temperature as single factors with Rs. This study demonstrates the importance of assessing CO2 fluxes considering both abiotic factors and vegetation types after disturbances such as fire which is particularly important in heterogeneous semi-arid areas with patchy vegetation distribution where CO2 fluxes can be largely underestimated.

AB In northeastern Brazil, areas converted for pasture and agriculture are often abandoned; therefore the recovered areas contain vegetation at different successional stages. The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity and structure of Caatinga vegetation areas with different histories of use in northeastern Brazil. Two areas were used: 1) preserved with no historical evidence of deforestation for agricultural purposes; and 2) regenerated after cultivation of Opuntia ficus-indica Mill., approximately 30 years ago. In each area, vegetation of 12 plots was collected, considering all individuals with circumference at 1.30 m above ground level (CAP) >= 6.0 cm. Collected species were classified according to dispersal strategy into the categories of anemochoric, zoochoric, and autochoric. For the analysis of a diversity, species richness, Shannon index, Pielou's evenness, and Simpson's index were used. beta diversity was evaluated using hierarchical cluster analysis. Structural analysis using density, basal area, and value of importance (VI) was conducted. A comparison between the diameter distributions of the areas was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Indicator species analysis (ISA) was conducted to identify the species preferences per area. The relationship of beta diversity with the differences in the composition of species and their densities were analyzed with TWINSPAN. The two areas showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in richness, density, and basal area. There was no significant difference in diversity. Cluster analysis indicated the formation of two floristic groups (40% dissimilarity), which was corroborated by TWINSPAN and ISA. The regenerating area after 30 years of abandonment showed similar species diversity as did the preserved area; however, floristic composition, species richness, density, and basal area did not recover. The similarity in diameter distributions between areas indicated that the abandoned area is recovering its regenerative capability.

AB Subjective and anatomy-based quantitative indices of distinctness of growth rings in tropical trees were related to deciduousness, species maximum height, and also potentially to local topography, independent of phylogenetic relationships.
   Most tropical tree species do not produce distinct growth rings, and the causes of this phenomenon have not received sufficient quantitative study. It has been shown that rainfall seasonality influences the formation of growth rings in some deciduous taxa. However, the numerous exceptions observed call for an examination of additional drivers of the phenomenon. We therefore hypothesized that in addition to seasonal climatic stress, functional and phylogenetic constraints may determine growth-ring distinctness. Ten potentially influential factors were examined in 38 Indian tropical tree species. Distinctness of growth rings was quantitatively assessed based on both subjective visual criteria and objective measures of anatomical characters. Multivariate and phylogenetically constrained analyses were used to test for functional, environmental, and phylogenetic effects. First, subjective scores of growth-ring distinctness correlated with objective anatomical measurements of vessel size and porosity related to water conductance, but also with additional anatomical characteristics unrelated to water dynamics. Second, ring distinctness variables were primarily related to deciduousness and species maximum height, and also weakly influenced by the topographic slope. A phylogenetic signal was detected in wood specific gravity values, the climatic variable of dry season rainfall, and the subjective distinctness score of growth rings, but accounting for phylogenetic structure did not significantly improve the prediction of ring distinctness. Thus, there was no evidence of an evolutionary constraint on the relationship in our sample of species. Our study thus demonstrates how distinctness of growth rings in tropical trees can be objectively represented on a continuous scale, and provides a quantitative explanation for its variability.

AB There is an ongoing debate to which extent the phenotypic plasticity is associated with the shade-tolerance of species along a broad environmental gradient. Seedlings of five species of varying shade tolerance were grown under each of the four combinations of high and low light or nutrient availabilities in shade houses. Leaf, fine root and whole-plant traits were measured to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity in seedlings of five species in response to light and nutrition gradients. Generally, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio, specific fine-root length and surface area (SRL, SRSA), leaf mass ratio, and relative growth rate decreased, whereas total root mass ratio increased with increasing shade tolerance of species, indicating light-demanding species had higher ability to capture above-and below-ground resources and thus had higher growth rate than shade-tolerant species. Light was a more important limiting factor than soil nutrients for the five studied species; and the light responsiveness at different nutrient availability for most morphological variables was similar among different species. In response to light and nutrient gradients, the mean plasticity index of all variables measured did not differ significantly among the five species, indicating that the species with contrasting shade tolerance have similar plasticity. There were significantly positive correlations in leaf area (mass) and fine-root surface area (mass) for each species along light and nutrient gradients. Moreover, there were significant correlations between leaf and fine-root nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, leaf area and fine-root surface area, SLA and SRL or SRSA across all species and treatments. Our result thus provided an evidence of a common leaf and root traits syndrome linking traits to effects on plant and ecosystem process.

AB It is widely recognised that the interaction between plants and herbivores cannot be completely understood if the natural enemies of the latter are not included. Most studies looking at the effects of herbivores and their enemies on plant fitness only consider one herbivore species or guild; however, plants in nature usually face the attack of more than one herbivore guild simultaneously and these herbivores may have a non-additive effect on the attraction with bodyguards and plant fitness. In this study, we asked whether folivory affects the activity of parasitoids on seed predators and whether this effect cascades down to plant fitness. We assessed these questions in a tritrophic system: the plant Ruellia nudiflora, its pre-dispersal seed predators and the parasitoids of the latter. Plants were submitted to either 50 % artificial defoliation or no defoliation (control). The number of seeds, fruit production and parasitoid incidence was assessed periodically in both sets of plants. Parasitoids indirectly and positively affected seed number, while defoliation had a direct negative effect on the number of seeds and an indirect negative effect on parasitoid incidence. However, the combined effect of defoliation and seed predation increased the indirect positive effect of the parasitoids on seed production, which overcame the negative effects of defoliation.

AB This paper aims to evaluate the economic impacts of greenhouse gas emission reduction on the Brazilian economy. To this end, we developed an integrated input-output linear programming model for 2009 using the Supply and Use Tables and emissions data of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology and Innovation. We simulated emissions targets for various potential scenarios in which the adopted policy design took account of sectoral composition in terms of emissions and available production technology. The results were directly affected by the high level of livestock emissions, counterbalancing this sector's economic importance for Brazil. In the short term, sectoral emissions targets associated with taxation policy or emission permits could be developed in order to create private incentives to mitigate emissions. In this sense, the results also show that different sectoral targets may be able to balance environmental benefits with the possible economic losses incurred by such policies.

AB Demand for tropical forest restoration has grown rapidly as the potential role of recovering secondary forests in sequestering carbon and enhancing biodiversity has been recognised. Active forest management is often prescribed to accelerate natural regeneration, but evidence for the efficacy of interventions is scarce for tropical forests. In this study we examine the hypothesis that the selective removal of abundant pioneers in the understory of recovering selectively logged forests can improve the composition of forest stands and accelerate succession. Four selective thinning treatments of increasing intensity were implemented in 8.75 ha compartments and replicated six times. Within each compartment, three monitoring plots were established and measured immediately after thinning and one year later to assess implementation of thinning treatments, growth and survival of stems, and changes in stand composition. Canopy openness was measured using hemispherical photography. Thinning treatments substantially reduced the abundance of pioneers, but there was only a slight increase in canopy openness (3.7-4.3%) relative to the control (1.8%) 8 months after implementation. Canopy openness increased dramatically across all treatments in the follow year due to the 2015-16 El Nino event and increased more in thinning treatments. Large (>10 cm dbh) and small (2-10 cm dbh) late-successional stems showed enhanced growth only in the low intensity thinning treatment, whereas the growth of small pioneer stems increased across the thinning intensity gradient. The cost of implementing thinning treatments was $US80 per ha or approximately 10% of the cost of planting treatments in the same forest. Our findings suggest that selective thinning of understory pioneer stems is a practical option for manipulating stand composition and potentially accelerating natural regeneration. Continued monitoring of the experiment should reveal the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We address the issue of adapting landscapes for improved insect biodiversity conservation in a changing climate by assessing the importance of additive (main) and synergistic (interaction) effects of land cover and land use with climate.
   We test the hypotheses that ant richness (species and genus), abundance and diversity would vary according to land cover and land use intensity but that these effects would vary according to climate.
   We used a 1000 m elevation gradient in eastern Australia (as a proxy for a climate gradient) and sampled ant biodiversity along this gradient from sites with variable land cover and land use.
   Main effects revealed: higher ant richness (species and genus) and diversity with greater native woody plant canopy cover; and lower species richness with higher cultivation and grazing intensity, bare ground and exotic plant groundcover. Interaction effects revealed: both the positive effects of native plant canopy cover on ant species richness and abundance, and the negative effects of exotic plant groundcover on species richness were greatest at sites with warmer and drier climates.
   Impacts of climate change on insect biodiversity may be mitigated to some degree through landscape adaptation by increasing woody native vegetation cover and by reducing land use intensity, the cover of exotic vegetation and of bare ground. Evidence of synergistic effects suggests that landscape adaptation may be most effective in areas which are currently warmer and drier, or are projected to become so as a result of climate change.

AB This study proposed a novel methodology to classify the shape of gaps using landscape indices and multivariate statistics. Patch-level indices were used to collect the qualified shape and spatial configuration characteristics for canopy gaps in the Lienhuachih Experimental Forest in Taiwan in 1998 and 2002. Non-hierarchical cluster analysis was used to assess the optimal number of gap clusters and canonical discriminant analysis was used to generate the discriminant functions for canopy gap classification. The gaps for the two periods were optimally classified into three categories. In general, gap type 1 had a more complex shape, gap type 2 was more elongated and gap type 3 had the largest gaps that were more regular in shape. The results were evaluated using Wilks' lambda as satisfactory (p < 0.001). The agreement rate of confusion matrices exceeded 96%. Differences in gap characteristics between the classified gap types that were determined using a one-way ANOVA showed a statistical significance in all patch indices (p = 0.00), except for the Euclidean nearest neighbor distance (ENN) in 2002. Taken together, these results demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methodology to classify the shape of a gap.

AB Biodiversity-friendly coffee certifications offer a viable way to protect wildlife habitat while providing a financial incentive to farmers. Most studies related to these certifications focus on avian habitat requirements and it is not known whether these standards also apply to other wildlife, such as mammals, that inhabit the coffee landscapes. We assessed the non-volant mammalian fauna and their associated habitat requirements in 23 sites representing forest, Bird Friendly (R) shade, conventional shade, and sun coffee habitats. We used Sherman trap-grids to measure small mammal abundance and richness, while camera traps were set for medium-sized and large mammals. We detected 17 species of mammals, representing 11 families. This preliminary study indicates that coffee farms in this region provide an important refuge for mammalian wildlife. Mammal species density ranked significantly higher in Bird Friendly (R) coffee sites than other coffee habitats, although there was no significant difference for species richness (using Chao2 estimator) among the habitat types. No significant difference was found in small mammal abundance among the habitat types. We found a higher species density of medium and large mammals in sites with larger, more mature shade trees associated with, but not required by Bird Friendly (R) certification standards. However, lower strata vegetation (5 cm to 1 m tall), the only vegetation parameter found to increase abundance and density for small mammals, is not specified in the Bird Friendly (R) standards. Our findings suggest that although the standards devised for avian habitat do benefit mammals, further study is needed on the requirements specific for mammals that could be included to enhance the coffee habitat for mammals that inhabit these coffee landscapes.

AB Seasonal meteorological variability within and among years has significant impact on forest productivity, thus understanding its detailed effects on tree growth contributes to the knowledge of the processes controlling forest productivity. This study used high frequency measurements of dendrometer bands (every 2-4 weeks over 1-2 years) to assess tree growth of four different planted forest types (Brazilian native tree species, Eucalyptus grand's, Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis, and Pinus taeda) in response to meteorological variables in distinct regions of Brazil. Multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to relate growth as function of meteorological variables. All species responded to multiple meteorological variables related to air temperature and water availability (maximum air temperature (p < 0.05), vapor pressure deficit (p < 0.01) and actual evapotranspiration (p < 0.01)). Dominant trees were more responsive to meteorological seasonality, compared to suppressed trees. Understanding the relations between forest growth and meteorological variables is useful and has practical applications, including the optimization of species zoning, modeling and the evaluation of climate change impacts on planted tree species for restoration or wood production purposes.

AB Acacia hybrid plantations are widely planted for pulpwood in Vietnam, but have the potential to be managed for high value saw-logs. This study examined the growth and physiological responses to thinning as a management option to increase the sawlog yield and value. Treatments were: unthinned (planting density 1111 trees ha(-1)), thinned to 833 or 600 trees ha(-1) in a single thinning at either age 2 (early) or 3 (late) years, and progressively thinned from 1111 to 833 trees ha(-1) at age 2 years, and then to 600 trees ha(-1) at age 3 years. Three years after early thinning to 600 stems ha(-1), mean stem diameter was increased by 16.7% and the stand volume was reduced by 15.8%; thinning to 833 stems ha(-1) resulted in no significant loss in stand volume and increased mean diameter by 7.5%. The leaf area index, LAI of stands thinned to 600 stems ha(-1) recovered rapidly and there was no significant difference between unthinned and thinned treatments 1 year after thinning; this recovery was also associated with a reduction in litterfall. Thinning to 600 stems ha(-1) increased A(1500) of the lower crown by 23.5 and 17.4% at age 2 and 3 yr, respectively; and this was associated with increased foliar phosphorus concentration. Thinning reduced leaf water stress during the dry season; leaf water potential and tree growth were significantly influenced by season. It was concluded that thinning to 600 trees ha(-1) at age 2 years or to 833 trees ha(-1) at age 3 years will produce wood with the highest diameter. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Relationships between seasonal climate, land cover and surface energy exchange in tropical montane cloud forest environments are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the seasonality of flux partitioning in lower montane cloud forest (LMCF), shaded coffee (CO) and sugarcane (SU) in central Veracruz, Mexico, as well as to evaluate the changes in surface energy exchange associated with the conversion of LMCF to CO or SU. Sensible (H) and latent heat (lambda E) fluxes were measured during the late dry and wet seasons using eddy covariance (CO and SU) and sap flow (LMCF) methods. Other measurements included: meteorological parameters, radiation balance, soil heat flux, soil moisture and vegetation characteristics. During the wet-season month of July, average midday Bowen ratios (beta s) for sunny conditions were lowest and least variable among land covers: 0.4 +/- 0.2 (SE) in LMCF, 0.5 +/- 0.1 in SU and 0.7 +/- 0.1 in CO. In contrast, during the late dry-season months of March and April, Ss were higher (i.e. higher H and lower lambda E) and more variable. The highest values of beta were observed in LMCF, reflecting effects of partial leaf-shedding by dominant deciduous species (2.4 +/- 0.8, March) and increased stomatal control (1.4 +/- 0.3, April). There was also evidence of stomatal limitation of lambda E in CO and SU, having beta s of up to 1.0 +/- 0.1 in April and March, respectively. As compared to LMCF, the average midday available energy (A(e)) for sunny conditions was very similar in CO (-3 +/- 7%) and 15 +/- 8% lower in SU. Although not all results were statistically significant, they suggest that for the wet season conversion of LMCF to shaded coffee or sugarcane led to a decrease of 15 +/- 14% or 15 +/- 17% in midday lambda E under sunny conditions, respectively, whereas corresponding values of H increased by 37 +/- 38% or remained about the same (-4 +/- 40%). In contrast, for the late dry season, conversion of LMCF to shaded coffee or sugarcane appears to have resulted in higher lambda E and lower H, with changes of, respectively, +79 (+/- 32)%/-45 (+/- 16)% (CO) or +39 (+/- 32)%/-43 (+/- 16)% (SU) for a partially leafless LMCF in March, and +17 (+/- 16)%/-11 (+/- 16)% (CO) for a fully-leafed LMCF in April. In order to more accurately quantify the changes in surface energy fluxes associated with LMCF conversion, future work should focus on reducing the errors in the flux estimates. Nevertheless, for sunny days during the wet season, potential changes in the moisture and heat content of the local atmosphere due to the conversion of LMCF to CO or SU seem to have been in the same direction as those induced by increased greenhouse gases (drying and warming), whereas for the late dry season the effects appear to have been opposite (moistening and cooling).

AB In polymorphic ants, non-reproductive work is divided between morphological subcastes of workers. However, as recent studies have shown, even in monomorphic species body size can also be associated with the division of labour. We studied whether workers of the common ant Lasius niger foraging (for honey) outside the nest differ in head size from individuals working inside the nest. We found that extranidal workers were significantly larger than intranidal workers. Comparing the present result with previous studies, the relationship between function and size in monomorphic ants might be more common than previously thought. However, when studying this type of association large sample sizes are recommended in order to obtain reliable results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive plants are exotic species that escape control by native specialist enemies. However, exotic plants may still be attacked by locally occurring generalist enemies, which can influence the dynamics of biological invasions. If invasive plants have greater defensive (resistance and tolerance) capabilities than indigenous plants, they may experience less damage from native herbivores. In the present study, we tested this prediction using the invasive plant Eupatorium adenophorum and two native congeners under simulated defoliation and generalist herbivore insect (Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera litura) treatments. E. adenophorum was less susceptible and compensated more quickly to damages in biomass production from both treatments compared to its two congeners, exhibiting greater herbivore tolerance. This strong tolerance to damage was associated with greater resource allocation to aboveground structures, leading to a higher leaf area ratio and a lower root: crown mass ratio than those of its native congeners. E. adenophorum also displayed a higher resistance index (which integrates acid detergent fiber, nitrogen content, carbon/nitrogen ratio, leaf mass per area, toughness, and trichome density) than its two congeners. Thus, H. armigera and S. litura performed poorly on E. adenophorum, with less leaf damage, a lengthened insect developmental duration, and decreased pupating: molting ratios compared to those of the native congeners. Strong tolerance and resistance traits may facilitate the successful invasion of E. adenophorum in China and may decrease the efficacy of leaf-feeding biocontrol agents. Our results highlight both the need for further research on defensive traits and their role in the invasiveness and biological control of exotic plants, and suggest that biocontrol of E. adenophorum in China would require damage to the plant far in excess of current levels.

AB REDD+ holds potential for mitigating emissions from tropical forest loss by providing financial incentives for carbon stored in forests, but its economic viability is under scrutiny. The primary narrative raised in the literature is thatREDD+ will be of limited utility for reducing forest carbon loss in Southeast Asia, while the level of finance committed falls short of profits from alternative land-use activities in the region, including large-scale timber and oil palm operations. Here we assess the financial costs and carbon benefits of various REDD+ strategies deployed in the region. We find the cost of reducing emissions ranges from $9 to $75 per tonne of avoided carbon emissions. The strategies focused on reducing forest degradation and promoting forest regrowth are the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions and used in over 60% ofREDD+ projects. By comparing the financial costs and carbon benefits of a broader range of strategies than previously assessed, we highlight the variation between different strategies and draw attention to opportunities where REDD+ can achieve maximum carbon benefits cost-effectively. These findings have broad policy implications for Southeast Asia. Until carbon finance escalates, emissions reductions can be maximized from reforestation, reduced-impact logging and investing in improved management of protected areas. Targeting cost-efficient opportunities for REDD+ is important to improve the efficiency of national REDD+ policy, which in-turn fosters greater financial and political support for the scheme.

AB Questions: What is the magnitude of the differences in environment and chronic human disturbance between contrasting slope aspects and topographic positions in a seasonally dry tropical forest? What is the effect of such topography-related differences on composition, structure and diversity attributes of the tree community of this forest?
   Location: Tziritzicuaro, Michoacan State, southern Mexico.
   Methods: Vegetation was sampled in 36 100-m(2) plots evenly distributed among three topographic positions (lower, middle and upper parts of a slope) and two slope aspects (N- and S-facing). Environment at these sites was described through modelling incoming solar radiation and in situ recording of temperature during 1 yr. Disturbance was visually assessed in the field to calculate a Chronic Disturbance Index. Vegetation structure and diversity were compared among the resulting combinations of slope and topographic position. PERMANOVA and CCA were used to examine the multivariate relationship among vegetation, topography and disturbance.
   Results: Slope aspects and topographic positions differed in terms of annual mean temperature, potential energy income and evapotranspiration. Conversely, disturbance was not so clearly related to topography. Regarding vegetation structure, significant differences were only found for individual sizes and abundance; these values increased towards the upper portion of S-facing slopes, but decreased with elevation in N-facing slopes. Species diversity (S, Jacknife 1 and Fisher's alpha) was higher in S-facing slopes and increased from lower to upper topographic positions. PERMANOVA showed that vegetation structure and diversity were influenced by topographic position (12.9%) and the interaction between soil moisture and chronic disturbance with slope aspect (8.2% and 8.3%, respectively). CCA showed that a modest proportion (21%) of variation in species composition is explained by the combination of environmental and disturbance variables.
   Conclusions: Slope aspect and topographic position represent axes of environmental and disturbance differentiation. Although vegetation attributes respond to these ecological factors, they do not show homogeneous responses. Floristic composition is clearly linked to environmental heterogeneity, while structural attributes and alpha-diversity appear to be more closely related to human disturbance and soil moisture, particularly on S-facing slopes. Integrating environmental heterogeneity and human disturbance with topographic variability enhances our understanding of large variation in tree community attributes in seasonal dry tropical forests.

AB Questions: Do composition and richness of woody plants differ between gaps and closed canopy in subtropical forests, and does this difference vary across life stages of tree species? Is tree species richness in gaps a function of regeneration density?
   Location: Subtropical Shorea robusta Gaertn (Sal) forest, central Nepal.
   Methods: We collected vegetation data from two old-growth S. robusta forest stands. We sampled 128 plots of 100 m(2) equally spread between the two habitats: gap and closed canopy. In each plot, we recorded the total number of woody species, number of individuals of seedlings and saplings of tree species and measured the DBH of all saplings. We compared species richness and composition of total woody species, seedlings and saplings between the two habitats. We used ordination to analyse species composition, and an individual-based species accumulation curves to illustrate the effect of density on species richness.
   Results: The species composition of total woody species and seedlings was similar in both habitats, but species composition of saplings differed between habitats. Total woody and seedling richness were similar between habitats at one site, but were richer under closed canopy at the other site. Sapling richness was higher in gaps at both sites and was a function of stem density at one site, but not at the other site.
   Conclusions: Gaps are not always areas of higher woody species richness and therefore may be less important than expected for the overall species richness of woody plants. Instead, they are potentially important for enhancing local tree richness by increasing sapling richness. Gap disturbance is the primary driver of structural heterogeneity in forests where topographic and edaphic gradients are negligible.

AB Seedlings play an important role in the processes of plant community succession. We compared seedling (dbh < 1 cm) species composition and diversity over a chronosequence (18-, 30-, 60-year-old second growth and old growth forest) after shifting cultivation in a tropical lowland rain forest area on Hainan Island, China. Seedling diversity reached a maximum in the 60-year-old second growth forest, which is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. With the progression of secondary succession, canopy openness (CO), soil organic matter, soil phosphorus content, and tree abundance showed a general decreasing trend; soil water content and tree basal area showed a general trend of increase, while soil pH and other nutrients reached maximum values and tree richness reached a minimum value at intermediate stages of succession. Seedling composition and diversity were significantly affected by soil water, pH, soil nutrient content, and biotic factors in the 18-year-old second growth forests; by soil pH, soil nutrient content, and biotic factors in the 30-year-old second growth forests; by CO, soil nutrient content and tree abundance in the 60-year-old second growth forests; and by CO, soil pH, and soil nutrient content in the old growth forests. At earlier stages of succession, the effect of the proportion of old growth forest in the surrounding landscape on seedling diversity was greater than that of land-use history, but the importance of these drivers was reversed at later stages of succession.

AB Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers' decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.

   forestry labor through participatory mapping in Southern Mexico
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
DE PES; Mapping; Participation; Labor; Discourse; Mexico
ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; PAYMENTS; MAPS
AB In recent years diverse actors have hailed participatory practice as an effective means to empowering people in payment for ecosystem services (PES) work. In Chiapas, Mexico participation is a central component of the Scolel' Te carbon forestry program, the cornerstone of which includes Plan Vivo participatory mapping. Plan Vivo mapping is used by the managing NGO, AMBIO, to build trust relations between participating farmers and program managers so as to ensure the successful production of carbon credits. However, I argue that it is also used to instill in farmers a series of behavioral and attitudinal transformations designed to align farmer land-use activities and attitudes with the program's carbon credit production objectives. Yet, despite these ambitions, the ability of the mapping activity in Scolel' Te to achieve its stated goals is challenged on the ground. In order to explain this discrepancy between the aspirations tied to the mapping activity and the mapping experience, I assess Plan Vivo mapping as a situated discourse and as a labor process. Taking the former perspective, I show how the managing NGO uses a paternalistic discourse to justify participatory mapping, one that presents farmers as misguided resource managers in need of external intervention. Then, using a labor process approach, I show how PVM acts to reorient farmer relationships to their land and to development organizations by intervening in farmer land-use practices and by establishing trust relations. It is, however, a process that consists of inequalities that stand to potentially limit the effectiveness of the activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental conservation is increasingly operated through partnerships among state, private, and civil society actors, yet little is known empirically about how such collectives function and with what livelihood and governance outcomes. The landscape approach to conservation (known also as the ecosystem approach) is one such hybrid governance platform. Implemented worldwide over the past decade by international NGOs, the landscape approach employs the 'ecosystem principles' of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In spite of its prominence as a conservation and development strategy, little political ecology scholarship has considered the landscape approach. This article offers a case study of a conservation landscape in the Congo Basin, the Tri-National de la Sangha (TNS), which connects tropical forests in Cameroon, Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic. Led by NGOs, the TNS has since 2001 relied on partnerships among logging companies, safari hunters, the state, and local communities. Although the landscape approach purports to facilitate re-negotiations of user rights, resource access patterns in the TNS appear to have molded to pre-existing power relations. Rather than incorporating local concerns and capabilities into management, local knowledge is discredited and livelihoods are marginalized. As a result, management occurs through spatially-demarcated zones, contrasting the fluidity of interactions among diverse groups: both human (loggers, hunter-gatherers, safari guides, NGOs) and non-human (trees, elephants). These findings are situated within a burgeoning literature on neoliberal environmental governance, and suggest that ensuring ecologically and socially positive outcomes will require careful and iterative attention to linkages between ecological processes and evolving power dynamics.

AB Tropical forests play a crucial role in the function of our planet and in the maintenance of life. Tropical forest vegetation maps are very important for managing tropical forests. Mapping tropical forest vegetation only by spectral-based remote sensing techniques has proven to be problematic. The objective of the study is to develop a rule-based model to identify different forest types using LandsatTMimages and GIS. In this paper, we developed the rule-based model to identify different forest types in Xishuangbanna, P.R. of China, using two temporal Landsat TM images and geo-data such as DEM, rainfall and temperature. The results show that the method put forward is useful and effective in tropical forest vegetation mapping, which can effectively integrate multi-knowledge and multi-resource data to identify the tropical forest vegetation types with higher accuracy.

AB The study aimed to assess the vegetation dynamics in Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) by using 250 meter resolution data product of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It focused mainly on vegetation indices (VI) as a proxy for vegetation activity. Long term trends in vegetation activity of MHNP and the factors that have affected the vegetation activity were identified. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were examined to count on both spatial and temporal trends. Seasonal Mann-Kendall (SMK) test was used to test the statistical significance of the data sets. The results showed significant variations in the vegetation activity in both NDVI and EVI. Results revealed about 3% and 31% of the total area is showing regressive and progressive trends for NDVI, respectively. Whereas EVI analysis exhibited 4% with regressive and an increase over 13.5% of the total area of MHNP. Besides hiking tracks, settlements, water course and fire activities; limestone exploration is the major cause of vegetation degradation, especially, in the western parts of MHNP. Degradation was found prominent near picnic spots and over the limestone extraction area. This study indicated that EVI is more sensitive to vegetation degradation as compared to NDVI.

AB Rodent preference for scatter-hoarding large seeds has been widely considered to favor the evolution of large seeds. Previous studies supporting this conclusion were primarily based on observations at earlier stages of seed dispersal, or on a limited sample of successfully established seedlings. Because seed dispersal comprises multiple dispersal stages, we hypothesized that differential foraging preference on seed size by animal dispersers at different dispersal stages would ultimately result in medium-sized seeds having the highest dispersal success rates. In this study, by tracking a large number of seeds for 5yr, we investigated the effects of seed size on seed fates from seed removal to seedling establishment of a dominant plant Pittosporopsis kerrii (Icacinaceae) dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents in tropical forest in southwest China. We found that small seeds had a lower survival rate at the early dispersal stage where more small seeds were predated at seed stations and after removal; large seeds had a lower survival rate at the late dispersal stage, more large seeds were recovered, predated after being cached, or larder-hoarded. Medium-sized seeds experienced the highest dispersal success. Our study suggests that differential foraging preferences by scatter-hoarding rodents at different stages of seed dispersal could result in conflicting selective pressures on seed size and higher dispersal success of medium-sized seeds.

AB Community ecologists have strived to find mechanisms that mediate the assembly of natural communities. Recent evidence suggests that natural enemies could play an important role in the assembly of hyper-diverse tropical plant systems. Classic ecological theory predicts that in order for coexistence to occur, species differences must be maximized across biologically important niche dimensions. For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been recently suggested that, within a particular community, plant species that maximize the difference in chemical defense profiles compared to neighboring taxa will have a relative competitive advantage. Here we tested the hypothesis that plant chemical diversity can affect local community composition in the hyper-diverse genus Piper at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. We first characterized the chemical composition of 27 of the most locally abundant species of Piper. We then tested whether species with different chemical compositions were more likely to coexist. Finally, we assessed the degree to which Piper phylogenetic relationships are related to differences in secondary chemical composition and community assembly. We found that, on average, co-occurring species were more likely to differ in chemical composition than expected by chance. Contrary to expectations, there was no phylogenetic signal for overall secondary chemical composition. In addition we found that species in local communities were, on average, more phylogenetically closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that functional traits other than those measured here also influence local assembly. We propose that selection by herbivores for divergent chemistries between closely related species facilitates the coexistence of a high diversity of congeneric taxa via apparent competition.

AB Conservation strategies for threatened species frequently include habitat restoration, but the success of such recovery efforts has been mixed. When the target is an insect herbivore, restoration efforts have traditionally attempted to increase the abundance of its host plant, but these actions' impact on host plant quality has largely been ignored. Here, we test the impact of two forms of habitat restoration, tree removal and stream damming, on the physical and chemical properties of a wetland sedge and on the adult traits of its larval consumer, a wetland butterfly. Tree removal altered plant physical and chemical traits in a manner largely consistent with reduced host plant quality. Females emerging from these plots had fewer mature oocytes in their ovaries upon emergence, suggesting that tree removal has a negative effect on butterfly potential fecundity. Stream damming did not affect plant traits but forewing length increased more steeply with body mass for females from these plots, indicating that small females from dammed plots have a relatively higher wing loading ratio that likely increases the energetic cost of flight. This idea was supported by results from our subsequent capture-mark-recapture study, where both female and male butterflies were less likely to emigrate from dammed plots. Male dispersal was also affected by restoration, but individual body mass rather than wing allometry mediated this effect. Our results highlight the need to consider restoration's impact on host plant quality, in addition to other aspects of habitat quality, when undertaking habitat restoration for threatened herbivores.

AB How ecological context shapes mutualistic relationships remains poorly understood. We combined long-term tree census data with ant censuses in a permanent 25-ha Amazonian forest dynamics plot to evaluate the effect of the mutualistic ant Myrmelachista schumanni (Formicinae) on the growth and survival of the common Amazonian tree Duroia hirsuta (Rubiaceae), considering its interactions with tree growth, population structure, and habitat. We found that the mutualist ant more than doubled tree relative growth rates and increased odds of survival. However, host tree size and density of conspecific neighbors modified the effect of the ant. Smaller trees hosting the mutualist ant consistently grew faster when surrounded by higher densities of conspecifics, suggesting that the benefit to the tree outweighs any negative effects of high conspecific densities. Moreover, our findings suggest that the benefit afforded by the ant diminishes with plant age and also depends on the density of conspecific neighbors. We provide the first long-term large-scale evidence of how mutualism affects the population biology of an Amazonian tree species.

   SEQUESTRATION
AB The Palaearctic steppes range from the Mediterranean basin towards China, forming one of the largest continuous terrestrial biomes. The literature on steppe ecology and conservation is vast but scattered and often not available in English. We provide a review of some key topics based on a new definition of steppes, which includes also Mediterranean steppes and alpine rangelands of the Asian Highlands. Revisiting the terrestrial ecoregions of the world, we estimate that the Palaearctic steppe biome extends over ca. 10.5 million km(2). Major chorological regions differ in their macroclimatic niche with a clear distinction between Middle Asia with its winter precipitation and the Central Asian summer-rain regions of the Mongolian plateau and of Tibet. Steppe soils store large amounts of carbon, yet the sequestration potential is debated and depends on land use. Major physiognomic-ecological steppe types include forest-, typical-, desert-, and alpine-steppe, which vary in the importance of grasses, mainly C3 species. The steppes host a specialised fauna, and Middle Asia, Tibet, and especially Mongolia, have large herds of migrating ungulates. The share of pristine and protected sites is low in the steppe regions, with conversion into croplands being the most important land use impact in Europe, Middle Asia, and the Mediterranean, while grazing has a severe impact in some parts of Mongolia and Tibet. There are major gaps in our knowledge on: (1) the effects of climate change on the crucial seasonal patterns; (2) the role of steppe soils in the global carbon budget; and (3) the ecology and distribution of most animal groups except vertebrates.

AB The fragmentation and isolation of preserved habitat patches within intensive agricultural landscape threaten species survival in steppes. In Ukraine, < 5 % of the original steppe area has survived, mostly in nature reserves, loess ravines and kurgans (burial mounds). The latter are small, but relatively numerous objects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether plant species density (= the number of species per plot) within small steppe patches on kurgans differs from that within large steppe enclaves in southern Ukraine. Another aim was to determine the influence of patch area, isolation and heat load index on species density on kurgans. Presence-absence data for vascular plant species were collected on plots of a size of 100 and 1 m(2). Thirty kurgans and ten sites within large steppe enclaves were sampled. Every noted species was classified as specialist or generalist. For kurgans data on area and degree of isolation were collected. Additionally the heat load index for plots on kurgans was calculated. The density of habitat specialists was higher in larger steppe enclaves than on kurgans at both spatial scales. On kurgans the most important predictors of specialist density were isolation (negative) and kurgan area (positive). The density of generalists was positively affected by the heat load index. Kurgans can provide refuges for steppe plant species. However, our results show that over a longer time period, proximity to larger steppe refuges is important to maintain species diversity within these small patches.

AB The relative importance of resource heterogeneity and quantity on plant diversity is an ongoing debate among ecologists, but we have limited knowledge on relationships between tree diversity and heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability in tropical forests. We expected tree species richness to be: (1) positively related to vertical soil nutrient heterogeneity; (2) negatively related to mean soil nutrient availability; and (3) more influenced by nutrient availability in the upper than lower soil horizons. Using a data set from 60, 20 x 40-m plots in a moist forest, and 126 plots in miombo woodlands in Tanzania, we regressed tree species richness against vertical soil nutrient heterogeneity, both depth-specific (0-15, 15-30, and 30-60 cm) and mean soil nutrient availability, and soil physical properties, with elevation and measures of anthropogenic disturbance as co-variables. Overall, vertical soil nutrient heterogeneity was the best predictor of tree species richness in miombo but, contrary to our prediction, the relationships between tree species richness and soil nutrient heterogeneity were negative. In the moist forest, mean soil nutrient availability explained considerable variations in tree species richness, and in line with our expectations, these relationships were mainly negative. Soil nutrient availability in the top soil layer explained more of the variation in tree species richness than that in the middle and lower layers in both vegetation types. Our study shows that vertical soil nutrient heterogeneity and mean availability can influence tree species richness at different magnitudes in intensively utilized tropical vegetation types.

AB This paper provides the first analysis at the sub-municipality scale of the relationships between population densities and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon between 2000 and 2010. We use the database on deforestation published by the Brazilian space research center (INPE) and the population census data released by the federal geographical and statistical agency IBGE at their finest scale: the census tract level. By crossing the population density and deforestation variables, we identify ten human settlement patterns in the Amazon. There are low-low and high-high classes of population density and deforestation, but also low-high and high-low classes. This analysis helps understand the low overall relations in the Amazon for population and deforestation. We emphasize the expansion of large-scale agriculture and cattle ranching as causing the depopulation of rural areas while in many regions of the Amazon quite strong population densities coexist with relatively low extents of deforestation. Such findings stress the need to implement case-specific public policies in these regions in order to encourage human presence compatible With the conservation of forest cover and biodiversity. We also confirm the importance of the Amazon urbanization process, including the 'discrete urbanization' of rural areas, and the need to better recognize the distinct social and environmental problems of urban areas.

AB Soils harbor a huge diversity of microorganisms that participate in various biogeochemical cycles and influence soil fertility. Our knowledge of soil microbiota, however, is limited by the complexity and heterogeneity of soil habitats and the huge microbial diversity. In this study, fertilized and unfertilized soils from a long-term fertilization experiment were gamma-sterilized before self- or cross-inoculation with non-sterilized soil aliquots containing their respective microbial communities. Bacterial community dynamics resulting from each reinoculated treatment was monitored over 90 days using B-ARISA. This study design allowed us to assess the respective influences of two driving factors, original community and soil nutrient availability, on microbial community assemblage dynamics. For all treatments, the bacterial communities that evolved in the sterilized soils differed from those in the original soils and displayed dynamic shifts over time. These shifts were particularly illustrated by the appearance of numerous OTUs that were undetectable in the original soils and suggest that community assembly is primarily determined by niche factors. However, stronger community shifts and higher variations among the replicates were observed after reinoculation of nutrient-rich soil, suggesting an increased impact of stochastic processes on community assembly. Our results demonstrate that reinoculation-based approaches are not only valid for detecting a variety of low abundant soil bacteria but also for distinguishing the soil characteristics and ecological rules that shape soil microbial population assemblage.

AB Floral visitors differ in their efficacy as pollinators, and the impact of different pollinator species on pollen flow and plant reproduction has been frequently evaluated. In contrast, the impact of intraspecific behavioural changes on their efficacy as pollinators has seldom been quantified.
   We studied a self-incompatible shrub Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae) and its hummingbird pollinators, which adjust their behaviour according to floral resource availability. Fluorescence microscopy was used to access pollen tube growth and incompatibility reaction in pistils after a single visit of territorial or intruder hummingbirds in two populations. To characterise the plant populations and possible differences in resource availability between areas we used a three-term quadrat variance method to detect clusters of floral resources.
   Within-species variation in foraging behaviour, but not species identity, affected pollinator efficacy. Effectively, hummingbirds intruding into territories deposited more compatible pollen grains on P. rigida stigmas than territory holders in both study areas. Additionally, territory holders deposited more incompatible than compatible pollen grains.
   Our results imply that intraspecific foraging behaviour variation has consequences for pollination success. Quantifying such variation and addressing the implications of intraspecific variability contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics and consequences of plant-pollinator interactions.

AB Gall inducers use these structures as shelters and sources of nutrition. Consequently, they cause multiple physiological changes in host plants.
   We studied the impact caused by seed coat galls of a braconid wasp on the performance of fruits, seeds and seedlings of tree Inga laurina. We tested whether these seed galls are 'nutrient sinks' with respect to the fruit/seed of host plant, and so constrain the reproductive ability and reduce seedling longevity. We measured the influence of such galls on the secondary compounds, fruit and seed parameters, seed viability and germination and seedling performance.
   Inga laurina has indehiscent legumes with polyembryonic seeds surrounded by a fleshy sarcotesta rich in sugars. The galls formed inside the seed coat and galled tissues presented higher phenol concentrations, around 7-fold that of ungalled tissues. Galls caused a significant reduction in parameters such as fruit and seed size, seed weight and the number of embryos. Fluctuating asymmetry (a stress indicator) was 31% higher in leaves of galled seed plants in comparison to ungalled seed plants. However, the negative effects on fruit and seed parameters were not sufficient to reduce seed germination (except the synchronization index) or seedling performance (except leaf area and chlorophyll content).
   We attributed these results to the ability of I. laurina to tolerate gall attack on seeds without a marked influence on seedling performance. Moreover, because of the intensity of seed galling on host plant, we suggest that polyembryony may play a role in I. laurina reproduction increasing tolerance to seed damage.

AB New approaches have emerged in integrating ecosystem services, their structure and function for ecological restoration. As the concept relating with ecosystem services has become widely accepted in last decade in China, its linking with ecological restoration will provide good opportunities and make substantial progress towards sustainable development. By analyzing the traditional ecological restoration procedure in China, we developed a framework of ecological restoration based on ecosystem services valuation. Relevant researches of ecological restoration based on ecosystem services are also carefully reviewed. China's ecosystem services studies and payments for ecosystem services (PES) experiences were extensively discussed to show the ecological restoration strategy and its change. Two case studies in China were presented to show the framework for ecological restoration based on PES. We suggested that despite the limitations of valuation uncertainties at present, PES could be an opportunity for ecological restoration by evaluating the trade-offs of different stakeholders. In current state in China, challenges and opportunities coexist and scientists should work together in the integrated research of sustainable ecological management and economic development policies.

AB Methylmercury (MeHg), a neurotoxin, is a global concern because of its potential risk to human and ecological health. Elevated mercury (Hg) concentrations were recently reported in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to increasing Hg input from distant regions, yet little is known about MeHg production and distribution in the terrestrial ecosystems of the TP. Here, we report longitudinal occurrence of MeHg and the factors regulating net MeHg production in 23 grassland sites from eastern to western TP. The soil MeHg content varied from 0.002 to 0.058 ng g(-1), with different distribution patterns between the eastern and western TR There was a positive correlation between the MeHg concentration and the longitude after 90 degrees E, which is similar to the distribution patterns of the total mercury (THg), water and organic carbon in this region. Average MeHg concentration in topsoil is generally higher than that in subsoil. Our results show that MeHg concentration in soils of the TP is directly affected by soil water, potential microbial methylators and THg, while indirectly regulated by soil organic carbon through the microbial community and the longitude-dependent precipitation through soil water. Our study suggests that soil water is the most important driver regulating net MeHg production in the grasslands of the TP. These findings have important implications for unraveling the mechanism of net production of MeHg in high-altitude environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Impact of sedimentary processes on white-sand vegetation in an Amazonian

AB Amazonian white-sand vegetation has unique tree communities tolerant to nutrient-poor soils of interest for interpreting processes of adaptation in neotropical forests. Part of this phytophysionomy is confined to Late Quaternary megafan palaeo-landforms, thus we posit that sedimentary disturbance is the main ecological factor controlling tree distribution and structuring in this environment. In this study, we characterize the topographic trend of one megafan palaeo-landform using a digital elevation model and verify its relationship to the forest by modelling the canopy height with remote sensing data. We also compare the composition and structure (i.e. canopy height and diameter at breast height) of tree groups from the outer and inner megafan environments based on the integration of remote sensing and floristic data. The latter consist of field inventories of trees >= 10 cm dbh using six (500 x 20 m) plots in varzea, terra firme and igapo from the outer megafan and 20 (50 x 20 m) plots in woodlands and forests from the inner megafan. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were applied for clustering and dissimilarity analyses, respectively. The megafan is a sand-dominated triangular wetland with a topographic gradient of < 15 cm km(-1), being more elevated along its axis. The outer megafan has a higher number of tree species (367), taller canopy height (mean of 14.1 m) and higher diameter at breast height (mean of 18.2 cm) than the white-sand forest. The latter records 89 tree species, mean canopy height of 8.4 cm and mean diameter at breast height of 15.3 cm. Trees increase in frequency closer to channels and toward the megafan's axis. The flooded and nutrient-poor sandy megafan substrate favoured the establishment of white-sand vegetation according to the overall megafan topography and morphological heterogeneities inherent to megafan sub-environments.

AB What factors are related to establishment dynamics following disturbance in late-successional versus second-growth tropical forests of the Pacific islands? Are those relationships robust to interannual fluctuations in establishment? In three sites juveniles were enumerated in 30 (5 x 5-m) subplots within 45 x 50-m tree plots in 2004 and 2005, 2.5 and 3.5 y following a Category-3 tropical cyclone (hurricane), in the Vava'u Island Group, Kingdom of Tonga. Recruitment was almost three-fold greater in the second sample period. Spatial pattern of focal species density was related to density of other juveniles, proximity of conspecific adults and canopy cover in the two years using Seemingly Unrelated Regression. Shade-tolerant species were the most abundant recruits in late-successional sites, establishing near-conspecific adults and other juveniles, while shade-establishing species were recruiting in gaps in second-growth forest where they also constitute the canopy trees. This pattern, observed in both years, reinforces divergent successional trajectories for second-growth and late-successional forest.

TI Re-framing the climate change debate in the livestock sector: mitigation

AB Livestock play a key role in the climate change debate. As with crop-based agriculture, the sector is both a net greenhouse gas emitter and vulnerable to climate change. At the same time, it is an essential food source for millions of people worldwide, with other functions apart from food security such as savings and insurance. By comparison with crop-based agriculture, the interactions of livestock and climate change have been much less studied. The debate around livestock is confusing due to the coexistence of multiple livestock farming systems with differing functions for humans, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission profiles and different characteristics and boundary issues in their measurement, which are often pooled together. Consequently, the diversity of livestock farming systems and their functions to human systems are poorly represented and the role of the livestock sector in the climate change debate has not been adequately addressed. In this article, building upon the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC 5AR) findings, we review recent literature on livestock and climate change so as better to include this diversity in the adaptation and mitigation debate around livestock systems. For comparative purposes we use the same categories of managerial, technical, behavioral and policy-related action to organize both mitigation and adaptation options. We conclude that different livestock systems provide different functions to different human systems and require different strategies, so they cannot readily be pooled together. We also observe that, for the different livestock systems, several win-win strategies exist that effectively tackle both mitigation and adaptation options as well as food security.

AB Hummingbirds are the most common group of vertebrate pollinators in the Neotropics, associated with pollination of ornithophilous flowers. The group can be divided into hermits and non-hermits, in which hermits are often regarded as the most specialized group closely associated with more specialized ornithophilous plants. In this study, we investigated the association of ornithophilous flowers and hummingbirds in two small fragments of forest surrounded by an urban matrix. We characterized the species composition, abundance and phenology of the hummingbirds and ornithophilous plants and related pollinator abundance to floral resource availability. Our results were compared to published data from other forest areas from the Cerrado. In our study areas, the diversity of ornithophilous plants and hummingbirds was similar to what has been reported for forest fragments in the Cerrado. Nevertheless, we found Thalurania furcata, a non-hermit, acting as the most frequent hummingbird pollinator in contrast to more preserved areas in which a hermit, Phaethornis pretrei, is commonly found as the main pollinator for ornithophilous plants. The nectar energy availability at the plant population level was the only factor associated with hummingbird visitation rates, suggesting that a higher availability of nectar resources in the fragments attracts greater abundance of birds. The unusual setting of having a non-hermit species as the main hummingbird pollinator in forest areas suggests that habitat fragmentation can favor more generalist hummingbird species, and this potentially has consequence for the pollination of associated plants.

AB Stream flows and connectivity have been impacted by road crossings and other changes in land use worldwide, with potential negative impacts for aquatic biodiversity. We investigated how pervasive stream flow, habitat, and connectivity alteration is predicted to be in tributaries of the Brazilian Amazon, represented through stream impoundments. We mapped impoundments associated with roads or agricultural land use across the Amazon's Curua-Una basin and identified landscape factors correlated with each type of impoundment. Impoundments were widespread, and deforestation and the land use changes it facilitated was the driving factor underlying their creation. We found, on average, one impoundment per 7.5 stream kilometers, or 3 km(2), of deforested land, a concentration significantly higher than in areas of native forest, which had an average of one impoundment per 117 stream kilometers or 100 km(2). Continuing to slow deforestation and agricultural conversion would reduce new agricultural impoundments and conditions facilitating soil erosion and subsequent impoundments at road-stream crossings. If Brazil's Forest Code can be effectively enforced, it could contribute substantially to slowing down deforestation and restoring areas already affected. There is an additional need for incentives for sustainable agricultural practices that directly reduce impacts to streams and remove in-stream cattle water impoundments. These possible solutions to address stream alterations would be strengthened by regulatory oversight for watershed management in the Amazon basin through implementation of existing Brazilian water laws, which could provide the groundwork for better valuing aquatic resources in the world's largest freshwater ecosystem.

AB Natural regeneration offers a cheaper alternative to active reforestation and has the potential to become the predominant way of restoring degraded tropical landscapes at large-scale. We conducted a meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed; and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code, has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed. Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration.

AB The Forest and Landscape Restoration movement has emerged as an approach to reconcile biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provisioning and human well-being in degraded landscapes, but little is known so far about the potential of different reforestation methods to achieve these objectives. Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m(2), their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale programs and policies.

AB In fragmented landscapes, ecological processes may be significantly influenced by edge effects, but few data are available for edge effects across forest-farmland edges. We investigated patterns of species richness, abundance, and species composition in ground beetles across forest-farm edges in two different agro-forest landscapes in Korea. Nine and five sites were selected from Hwaseong, a fragmented landscape, in 2011 and 2012, respectively, while eight sites were selected from Hoengseong, a relatively well-protected landscape, in 2012. Ground beetles were collected by pitfall trapping. Species richness was higher in the surrounding habitat than in the forest interior or edge in both Hwaseong and Hoengseong. However, in Hwaseong, species richness of the forest edge was similar to that of the forest interior, while in Hoengseong forest edge species richness was intermediate between that of the forest interior and surrounding areas. In addition, non-metric multidimensional scaling based on the combined data of both locations showed that the species composition of ground beetles in the forest edge was more similar to that of the forest interior than the surrounding areas, although some open-habitat species occurred at the forest edges. Three characteristic groups (forest specialists, edge-associated species, and open-habitat species) of ground beetle species were detected by indicator value analysis. In our study, ground beetle assemblages differed in the forest edges of two agro-forest landscapes, suggesting that the edge effect on biota can be influenced by landscape structure.

AB The phyllosphere (comprising the leaf surface and interior) is one of the world's largest microbial habitats and is host to an abundant and diverse array of bacteria. Nonetheless, the degree to which bacterial communities are benign, harmful, or beneficial to plants in situ is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the net effect of reducing bacterial abundance and diversity would vary substantially among host species (from harmful to beneficial) and this would be strongly mediated by soil resource availability. To test this, we monitored tree seedling growth responses to commercial antibiotics among replicated resource supply treatments (N,P,K) in a tropical forest in Panama for 29months. We applied either antibiotics or control water to replicated seedlings of five common tree species (Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis, and Tetragastris panamensis). These antibiotic treatments significantly reduced both the abundance and diversity of bacteria epiphytically as well as endophytically. Overall, the effect of antibiotics on performance was highly host specific. Applying antibiotics increased growth for three species by as much as 49% (Alseis, Heisteria, and Tetragastris), decreased growth for a fourth species by nearly 20% (Sorocea), and had no impact on a fifth species (Desmopsis). Perhaps more importantly, the degree to which foliar bacteria were harmful or not varied with soil resource supply. Specifically, applying antibiotics had no effect when potassium was added but increased growth rate by almost 40% in the absence of potassium. Alternatively, phosphorus enrichment caused the effect of bacteria to switch from being primarily beneficial to harmful or vice versa, but this depended entirely on the presence or absence of nitrogen enrichment (i.e., important and significant interactions). Our results are the first to demonstrate that the net effect of reducing the abundance and diversity of bacteria can have very strong positive and negative effects on seedling performance. Moreover, these effects were clearly mediated by soil resource availability. Though speculative, we suggest that foliar bacteria may interact with soil fertility to comprise an important, yet cryptic dimension of niche differentiation, which can have important implications for species coexistence.

AB A lack of empirical evidence for the microbial regulation of ecosystem processes, including carbon (C) degradation, hinders our ability to develop a framework to directly incorporate the genetic composition of microbial communities in the enzyme-driven Earth system models. Herein we evaluated the linkage between microbial functional genes and extracellular enzyme activity in soil samples collected across three geographical regions of Australia. We found a strong relationship between different functional genes and their corresponding enzyme activities. This relationship was maintained after considering microbial community structure, total C and soil pH using structural equation modelling. Results showed that the variations in the activity of enzymes involved in C degradation were predicted by the functional gene abundance of the soil microbial community (R-2>0.90 in all cases). Our findings provide a strong framework for improved predictions on soil C dynamics that could be achieved by adopting a gene-centric approach incorporating the abundance of functional genes into process models.

AB Soil food web research has long recognized that real webs include a number of complexities often hidden in research focused on aboveground grazing webs. These complexities include nutrient recycling, omnivory (consuming more than one prey item) and multiple reticulated channels through which energy and resources flow. Increasing evidence in real and modeled food webs suggests a critical complexity of all webs is the presence of multi-channel feeding. Multi-channel feeding, or multi-channel omnivory, occurs when a consumer feeds across two energy channels: such as a consumer that eats both roots and detritus or bacteria and fungi. As growing empirical research has documented that multi-channel omnivores are the most common type of consumer in real webs, modeling studies have also highlighted that such omnivory can be stabilizing. Here I briefly review the evolving paradigm of multi-channel feeding in food webs and outline several major areas of research that could advance predictions of how common multi-channel feeding should be in soil food webs and its impacts on stability and trophic dynamics.

AB The prevalence of edges is increasing due to anthropogenic landscape change. Edge responses can vary considerably between and within species. Understanding species' responses to edges, and the causes of variation in such responses is central to managing biodiversity in contemporary landscapes.
   A resource distribution model predicts that species that require complementary resources in different land cover types will be most abundant at edges, displaying a positive edge response. Eastern tiger (Papilio glaucus) and spicebush (P. troilus) swallowtail butterflies use forest plant species for oviposition sites but open-habitat plants for nectar. They are excellent models for testing the positive edge response and exploring sources of variability in edge responses, such as species-specific traits or temporal effects.
   In southwestern Ontario, we examined both the abundance and flight orientation of these species in relation to forest/meadow edges and at different times of day. We used a transect method similar to the Pollard walk and a catch and release method, respectively.
   The distribution and flight behaviour of these butterfly species were overall consistent with a positive edge response. Both species were most abundant at the edge and oriented their flight towards the edge from the forest and meadow. However, P. glaucus demonstrated a much stronger positive edge response, while P. troilus showed temporal variation in its response.
   Our results confirm the ability of the resource distribution model to predict species edge responses and movement behaviours, but also indicate that species-specific traits and time of sampling can influence such responses.

AB Catastrophic damage that occurs at the early establishment stage of eucalypts, such as decapitation by browsing mammals, may have deleterious effects on survival, growth and tree shape. Such damage may result in a significant loss of productivity from planted forests, as well as represent a major selective force shaping patterns of adaptation in natural forests. An important recovery strategy of many eucalypts is to re-sprout from basal lignotubers, which contain a proliferation of dormant buds as well as stored carbohydrates. We investigated the genetic variation in seedling recovery following decapitation of two Eucalyptus globulus populations that differ in the extent to which they appear to allocate resources to foliar defence as opposed to recovery traits.
   The two contrasting populations studied were from the continuous eastern distribution of E. globulus on the island of Tasmania. One population, from the wet southern forests, has relatively small lignotubers but high foliar defences; whereas the other from the dry northern forests, has relatively large lignotubers but low foliar defences. Seedlings of 10 families from each population were subjected to artificial decapitation treatments in the nursery at 6 months old, planted in a replicated field design and assessed up to 32 months after treatment.
   The two populations differed significantly in their initial response to decapitation, with seedlings from the population with the larger lignotubers and stem base having greater survival and more shoots. Decapitation above the cotyledonary node had a more deleterious effect on survival than decapitation above the first seedling node. The surviving plants exhibited genetic stability not only in constitutive differences, but in the way they changed in response to decapitation. After 20 months of growth in the field, there were no lasting treatment effects on important growth traits, with genetic-based population differences overriding the initial treatment effects. These results are consistent with differential resource allocation being part of the adaptive response of E. globulus, and show that early-age decapitation has little long-term impact on the expression of inherent population differences in growth strategies and foliar chemistry.

TI Aniba inaequabilis (Lauraceae), a new species from Peru
SO PHYTOTAXA
LA English
DT Article
AB A new plant species from the Amazon in Peru, Aniba inaequabilis, is here described. The new species belongs to a group of Aniba species that has papillose leaves, but differs from all the species described in this group by the combination of stamens with few sparse hairs, stamens of whorl I and II with different shapes and the glands at the base of the inner stamens fused. In this paper the new species is described and illustrated and its relationship with other species of Aniba with papillose leaves is discussed.

AB Background: As a highly valued and multiple function tree species, Cyclocarya paliurus is planted and managed for timber production and medical use. However, limited information is available on its genotype selection and cultivation for growth and phytochemicals. Responses of growth and secondary metabolites to light regimes and genotypes are useful information to determine suitable habitat conditions for the cultivation of medicinal plants.
   Results: Both light regime and provenance significantly affected the leaf characteristics, leaf flavonoid contents, biomass production and flavonoid accumulation per plant. Leaf thickness, length of palisade cells and chlorophyll a/b decreased significantly under shading conditions, while leaf areas and total chlorophyll content increased obviously. In the full light condition, leaf flavonoid contents showed a bimodal temporal variation pattern with the maximum observed in August and the second peak in October, while shading treatment not only reduced the leaf content of flavonoids but also delayed the peak appearing of the flavonoid contents in the leaves of C. paliurus. Strong correlations were found between leaf thickness, palisade length, monthly light intensity and measured flavonoid contents in the leaves of C. paliurus. Muchuan provenance with full light achieved the highest leaf biomass and flavonoid accumulation per plant.
   Conclusions: Cyclocarya paliurus genotypes show diverse responses to different light regimes in leaf characteristics, biomass production and flavonoid accumulation, highlighting the opportunity for extensive selection in the leaf flavonoid production.

AB Acclimation to changing light conditions plays a crucial role in determining the competitive capability of tree species. There is currently limited information about acclimation to natural light gradient and its effect on shoot structure and biomass in Taxus species. We examined the acclimation of the leaf and shoot axis morphology, structure and biomass allocation of Taxus yunnanensis and T. chinensis var. mairei under three different natural light environments, full daylight, 40-60% full daylight and <10% full daylight. The leaf biomass, nitrogen content per unit area, leaf carbon content per dry mass and leaf dry mass to fresh mass ratio increased with light in both species, demonstrating an enhanced investment of photosynthetic biomass and structural investment under high light. The number of leaves per unit shoot axis length and the leaf dry mass per unit shoot axis length increased with light in both species. However, the light increase did not result in the increase of the total shoot mass. T. yunnanensis produced larger leaves under low light and a higher shoot axis length per unit dry mass under high light, whereas the leaf size and biomass yield of T. chinensis var. mairei were not sensitive to light.

AB Different combinations of behavioural and physiological responses may play a crucial role in the ecological success of species, notably in the context of biological invasions. The invasive mussel Xenostrobus securis has successfully colonised the inner part of the Galician Rias Baixas (NW Spain), where it co-occurs with the commercially-important mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. This study investigated the effect of a heatwave on the physiological and behavioural responses in monospecific or mixed aggregations of these species. In a mesocosm experiment, mussels were exposed to simulated tidal cycles and similar temperature conditions to those experienced in the field during a heat-wave that occurred in the summer of 2013, when field robo-mussels registered temperatures up to 44.5 degrees C at low tide. The overall responses to stress differed markedly between the two species. In monospecific aggregations M. galloprovincialis was more vulnerable than X. securis to heat exposure during emersion. However, in mixed aggregations, the presence of the invader was associated with lower mortality in M. galloprovincialis. The greater sensitivity of M. galloprovincialis to heat exposure was reflected in a higher mortality level, greater induction of Hsp70 protein and higher rates of respiration and gaping activity, which were accompanied by a lower heart rate (bradycardia). The findings show that the invader enhanced the physiological performance of M. galloprovincialis, highlighting the importance of species interactions in regulating responses to environmental stress. Understanding the complex interactions between ecological factors and physiological and behavioural responses of closely-related species is essential for predicting the impacts of invasions in the context of future climate change.

AB Background: Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides L.) is widely used in more than 120 countries for land management (e.g. rehabilitation of saline lands). A wild ecotype of vetiver grass was found in southern China in the 1950s, but little is known about its adaptability to saline stress. For the purpose of understanding its tolerance to salinity as well as corresponding tolerance mechanisms, in a greenhouse with natural lighting, seedlings were grown in culture solutions and subjected to a range of NaCl concentrations for 18 days.
   Results: Compared to no NaCl treatment, 200 mM NaCl significantly reduced leaf water potential, leaf water content, leaf elongation rate, leaf photosynthetic rate and plant relative growth rate and increased leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) content, but the parameters showed only slight reduction at 150 mM NaCl. In addition, salinity caused an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in leaves. Moreover, increasing NaCl levels significantly increased Na+ but decreased K+ concentrations in both roots and leaves. The leaves had higher K+ concentrations at all NaCl levels, but lower Na+ concentrations compared to the roots, thereby maintaining higher K+/Na+ ratio in leaves.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that the salinity threshold of this wild vetiver grass is about 100 mM NaCl, i.e. highly tolerant to salt stress. This wild vetiver grass has a high ability to exclude Na+ and retain K+ in its leaves, which is a critical strategy for salt tolerance.

ID NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL; CLASSIFICATION; GENUS
AB This work presents an updated checklist of the Bignoniaceae from the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), and information on the patterns of geographic distribution of individual species within two RN biomes. Forty-three native species distributed in 18 Bignoniaceae genera were recorded for RN. The species richness found for RN in this study was 43% higher than previously documented, indicating the great need of additional biodiversity studies in Rio Grande do Norte. Of the 43 species listed, 27 were recorded in the checklist of Brazilian plants, while 16 species represent new occurrences. Three additional species were included in the checklist of Brazilian plants (which listed 30 species of Bignoniaceae for the RN); however, specimens of these taxa were not located for RN during this study and are not included in the final checklist presented here. The collection effort carried out for this work led to an improved knowledge of species distributions in the two biomes found in RN: the Caatinga dry woodland and the Atlantic Forest. The number of species found to be restricted to each biome and the absolute number of species occurring in the Caatinga dry woodland expanded considerably. All new species records were found in small herbaria from the RN state, emphasizing the importance of regional herbaria for an improved understanding of biodiversity patterns. This study highlights the importance of intensive identification efforts in small regional collections, combined with well-planned fieldwork for an accurate estimation of species richness in poorly studied areas of Brazil.

AB Amazonia National Park is located in southwestern Para State in central Amazonia. The 10,707 km 2 park is one of the largest protected areas in Brazil and is covered with pristine forests, but the region is threatened by dam construction projects. An incomplete mammal biodiversity inventory was conducted in the area during the late 1970s. Here, we present results of sampling from 7,295 live-trap nights, 6,000 pitfall-trap nights, more than 1,200 km of walking transect censuses, and approximately 3,500 camera-trap days, all conducted between 2012 and 2014. These sampling efforts generated a list of 86 known species of nonvolant mammals, making the park the single most species-rich area for nonvolant mammals both in the Amazon Basin and in the Neotropics as a whole. Amazonia National Park is a megadiverse site, as is indicated by its mammalian richness, which includes 15 threatened mammal species and 5 to 12 new species of small mammals. As such, it merits being a high-conservation priority and should be an important focus of Brazilian authorities' and the international scientific community's conservation efforts. A comprehensive conservation plan is urgently needed, especially given the ecological threats posed by dam construction.

AB Varzeas are forest areas seasonally flooded by white-water rivers and have a variety of tree species, which bear fruit during the filling or flood and in the beginning of low water periods. During those periods of inundation, fruits and seeds are important resources for different fish species. In this study, the viability of whole seeds removed from the stomach and intestine of fishes was analyzed. Fishes were collected with gillnets installed during 24-hr cycles along the flooded forest, during the filling, flood, and in the beginning of low water periods of the Year 2014 in the Catalao lake, Brazilian Central Amazon. In total, 1,915 specimens of fish were captured, and 148 specimens (8% from the total) contained seeds in their digestive tracts. Some fishes that consumed seeds are species commercially important and have migratory habits. Fishes consumed 3,092 seeds. All whole seeds removed from the digestive tracts of fishes were seeded in varzea soil and maintained in a greenhouse. Seeds of 16 plant species (89%) germinated. Our conclusion is that fish species can play an important role in the ecology of varzea forests by dispersing seeds, contributing to the colonization of new areas, and allowing genetic flow between subpopulations distributed along the rivers.

AB Among approaches to establish the importance of niche differentiation for species coexistence, the use of functional traits is attractive for its potential to suggest specific coexistence mechanisms. Recent studies have looked for trait patterns reflective of niche differentiation, building on a line of research with a deep but somewhat neglected history. We review the field from its foundation in limiting similarity theory in the 1960s to its resurgence in 2000s, and find the theory of trait patterning still in a stage of development. Elements still to be accounted for include environmental fluctuations, multidimensional niche space, transient dynamics, immigration, intraspecific variation, evolution and spatial scales. Recent empirical methods are better than early approaches, but still focus on patterning arising in simplistic models, and should rigorously link niche space with trait space, use informative null models, and adopt new metrics of pattern as theory develops. Because tests based on overly simplistic expectations of trait pattern are of little value, we argue that progress in the field requires theory development, which should entail exploring patterns across a set of conceptual and system-specific models of competition along trait axes.
   Synthesis Traits relate to ecological performance and are easy to measure. Trait patterns can thus be a practical tool for inferring community assembly processes, and have been extensively used for this purpose. Classical trait patterning theory dates back to the 1960s, and despite heavy criticism still persists in empirical studies. Here we highlight steps needed for traits to realize their potential. These include firmly linking them to niche axes, and updating pattern expectations to consider recent results from models of niche dynamics, such as the emergence of species clusters. Further theory development should reveal whether there is a common traits-based signature across different niche mechanisms.

AB Soil erosion threatens both soil and water resources and has increased globally because of the removal of natural vegetation and the intensification of existing agriculture. Brazil is privileged by a large proportion of natural vegetation and abundant freshwater. Recently, modifications of the Brazilian Forest Act (BFA) have been approved, which offer landowners that had committed illegal riparian deforestation in the past amnesty from reforestation, and further reductions of riparian protected areas are currently discussed. Here, we used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to simulate river discharge and sediment exports in a typical human-impacted Brazilian catchment, the Rio das Mortes catchment. By restoring the riparian vegetation according to the BFA and ignoring amnesties to land owners, the current annual sediment export of the catchment of 0.830 t ha(-1) was reduced by 29.4% according to our model. Further, simulated reforestation twice the size demanded by the BFA resulted in a 31.4% reduction of the current sediment export. However, reforestation of a 5-m homogeneous riparian corridor only, as currently discussed in the Federal Brazilian State of Sao Paulo, reduced sediment exports by only 23.8%, not considering expected additional erosion due to deforestation outside the simulated reforested 5-m corridor. Our study is the first catchment-wide assessment of the role of riparian vegetation in preventing soil erosion in Brazil. Its results support intensive reforestation efforts of the riparian zone and point to substantial negative effects of further reductions of the protected riparian corridor width and amnesties from reforestation to land owners.

AB Human activities around parks can alter vegetation patterns within them, resulting in edge effects that degrade their ability to sustain ecological processes and support biodiversity. We quantified vegetation patterns and edge effects over a large geographic extent in Murchison Falls Conservation Area, Uganda, using freely available remotely sensed data. Over a 13-yr period, we quantified seasonal patterns in productivity using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), comparing the park exterior, a boundary zone <= 10 km from the border inside the park, and the park interior. To identify the extent of edge effects, we further fit mixed models by vegetation type within 1-km bands within the boundary zone. Productivity was higher in the park interior than exterior in both wet and dry seasons, and in the wet season, it was also lower in the boundary zone than the interior. NDVI variability differed between seasons; it declined from exterior to interior in the wet season, but was highest in the boundary zone and similar between interior and exterior during the dry season. Within the boundary zone, edge effects varied by land cover type and extended 4-6 km into MFCA. Abrupt differences in vegetation patterns between the park and adjacent unprotected areas indicated a "hard edge" in this system. While hard edges are readily apparent, the subtle changes in productivity that extend into and degrade park systems are harder to detect. We demonstrated a low-cost and novel approach to detect such effects using readily available satellite imagery, which indicated human influence affecting 29-40% of the park. As human populations grow, parks will become further isolated, and measuring and managing edge effects may be crucial to achieving conservation objectives.

AB Species-abundance distribution (SAD) is an essential tool to explain the mechanism of diversity maintenance in ecological communities. Most of the studies on diversity maintenance in a specific forest dynamics plot just consider stems with a certain minimum size class to include into the tree community to be examined. However, the species in the juvenile stage are easily disturbed by a variety of factors; here, we define the minimum stem size to tag trees in a community as the community size (DBHmintag), which implies that the communities with different minimum diameter at breast height (DBH) sizes to tag trees are tree assemblages containing tree populations of different minimum DBH. We used data from 17 1-ha forest dynamics plots across six old-growth forest types in a tropical nature reserve to explore diversity maintenance mechanism by SAD curves (at three levels of DBHmintag) fitting to neutral model and niche preemption model. We found that the SADs of the two zonal vegetation types (tropical montane rain forest and tropical lowland rain forest) were best fitted by neutral model at each level of DBHmintag; meanwhile, the best fitted models for the four azonal vegetation types (tropical coniferous forest, tropical deciduous monsoon rain forest, tropical montane evergreen forest, and tropical montane dwarf forest) varied with DBHmintag levels, for communities with DBHmintag >= 1 cm and DBHmintag >= 5 cm, the fitting effect of neutral model was better than niche preemption model's for the forest dynamics plots in the four azonal vegetation types, and for communities with DBHmintag >= 10 cm, the four azonal vegetation types were all best fitted by the niche model. Our results suggest that species diversity maintenance mechanisms of the two zonal vegetation types derived from the neutral model increased the predictive accuracy at each level of DBHmintag, and meanwhile, the four azonal vegetation types derived from the neutral model increased the predictive accuracy at smaller community size; however, with the increase in DBHmintag, these communities derived from the niche theory model increased the predictive accuracy. Habitat heterogeneity might be the major constraints in determining the neutral or niche process for diversity maintenance of a specific forest community.

AB Background and Aims Morphological variation in light-foraging strategies potentially plays important roles in efficient light utilization and carbon assimilation in spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments such as tropical moist forest understorey. By considering a suite of morphological traits at various hierarchical scales, we examined the functional significance of crown shape diversity and plasticity in response to canopy openness.
   Methods We conducted a field comparative study in French Guiana among tree saplings of 14 co-occurring species differing in light-niche optimum and breadth. Each leaf, axis or crown functional trait was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes.
   Key Results We found divergent patterns between shade-tolerant and heliophilic species on the one hand and between shade and sun plants on the other. Across species, multiple regression analysis showed that relative crown depth was positively correlated with leaf lifespan and not correlated with crown vertical growth rate. Within species displaying a reduction in crown depth in the shade, we observed that crown depth was limited by reduced crown vertical growth rate and not by accelerated leaf or branch shedding. In addition, the study provides contrasting examples of morphological multilevel plastic responses, which allow the maintenance of efficient foliage and enable effective whole-plant light capture in shaded conditions under a moderate vertical light gradient.
   Conclusions This result suggests that plastic adjustment of relative crown depth does not reflect a strategy maximizing light capture efficiency. Integrating and scaling-up leaf-level dynamics to shoot-and crown-level helps to interpret in functional and adaptive terms inter-and intraspecific patterns of crown traits and to better understand the mechanism of shade tolerance.

North America harbours 67 of the 172 species recognised within the tribe, 54 being endemic. Our aims were to identify areas of endemism of the North American Tigridieae using endemicity analysis (EA) and to infer their relationships using parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE). A data matrix with 2769 geographical records of Tigridieae was analysed. The EA allowed to identify six consensus areas of endemism in Mexico. The PAE resulted in one cladogram with four clades and the following five biotic components: northern Mexico, western Mexico, central Mexico, southern Mexico and central-southern Mexico. The richness analysis of these areas of endemism indicated that the greatest concentration of species is located in central Mexico, with 14 species in one grid-cell. Grid-cells with 12 species each were identified in low western Mexico, high western Mexico, southern Mexico and central-southern Mexico. This last area is characterised by the greatest endemism, including nine species. The formation of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt seems to have been a key element to explain the diversification of North American Tigridieae.

AB Landscape dynamics are common phenomenon in the human-dominated environments whereby it can be observed that the composition and configuration between landscape elements change over time. This dynamism brings about habitat loss and fragmentation that can greatly alter ecosystem services at patch, class, and landscape levels. We conducted a study to examine composition and configuration of forested landscape in the central highlands of Ethiopia using satellite images of over a period of four decades, and FRAGSTAT raster dataset was used to analyze fragmentation. Our result showed five land use/land cover (LULC) types in the study area. Cultivated land and settlement land increased at the expense of forestland, shrubland, and grassland. Fragmentation analysis showed the number of patches increased for all LULC types, indicating the level of fragmentation and interspersion. Juxtaposition increased for shrubland, grassland, and cultivated lands and decreased for settlement and forestland resulting in the fragmentation and isolation of patches. The study of LULC along with fragmentation at the landscape level can help improve our understanding of the pace at which conversion of landscape elements is happening and the impacts on ecosystem services as studies of LULC are courser in nature and would not show how each land use is reducing in size, proximity and shape among other things that determine ecosystem services. Such type of studies in rural landscapes are very vital to consider appropriate land management policies for the landscape level by taking into account the interaction between each element for sustainable development. We recommend land managers, conservationists, and land owners for observing the roles of each patch in the matrix to maximize the benefits than focusing on a single element.

AB Complex interactions between plants and soil microorganisms drive key ecosystem and community properties such as productivity and diversity. In nutrient-poor systems such as sand dunes, plant traits and fungal symbioses related to nutrient acquisition can strongly influence vegetation dynamics. We investigated plant and fungal communities in a relic foredune plain located on an archipelago in Qu,bec, Canada. We detected distinct communities across the edaphic and successional gradient. Our results showed a clear increase in plant species richness, as well as in the diversity of nutrient-acquisition strategies. We also found a strong correlation between aboveground vegetation and soil fungal communities, and both responded similarly to soil physicochemical properties. Soil pH influenced the composition of plant and fungal communities, and could act as an important environmental filter along this relic foredune plain. The increasing functional diversity in plant nutrient-acquisition strategies across the gradient might favor resource partitioning and facilitation among co-occurring plant species. The coordinated changes in soil microbial and plant communities highlight the importance of aboveground-belowground linkages and positive biotic interactions during ecological succession in nutrient-poor environments.Strong correlation between vegetation and soil fungal communities, similar responses to soil properties, and increasing diversity of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies were revealed along a coastal dune successional and edaphic gradient.Strong correlation between vegetation and soil fungal communities, similar responses to soil properties, and increasing diversity of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies were revealed along a coastal dune successional and edaphic gradient.

AB Incentivizing carbon storage can be a win-win pathway to conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. In savannas, however, the situation is more complex. Promoting carbon storage through woody encroachment may reduce plant diversity of savanna endemics, even as the diversity of encroaching forest species increases. This tradeoff has important implications for the management of biodiversity and carbon in savanna habitats, but has rarely been evaluated empirically. We quantified the nature of carbon-diversity relationships in the Brazilian Cerrado by analyzing how woody plant species richness changed with carbon storage in 206 sites across the 2.2 million km(2) region at two spatial scales. We show that total woody plant species diversity increases with carbon storage, as expected, but that the richness of endemic savanna woody plant species declines with carbon storage both at the local scale, as woody biomass accumulates within plots, and at the landscape scale, as forest replaces savanna. The sharpest trade-offs between carbon storage and savanna diversity occurred at the early stages of carbon accumulation at the local scale but the final stages of forest encroachment at the landscape scale. Furthermore, the loss of savanna species quickens in the final stages of forest encroachment, and beyond a point, savanna species losses outpace forest species gains with increasing carbon accumulation. Our results suggest that although woody encroachment in savanna ecosystems may provide substantial carbon benefits, it comes at the rapidly accruing cost of woody plant species adapted to the open savanna environment. Moreover, the dependence of carbon-diversity trade-offs on the amount of savanna area remaining requires land managers to carefully consider local conditions. Widespread woody encroachment in both Australian and African savannas and grasslands may present similar threats to biodiversity.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the most diverse environments, but it is also one of the most threatened areas in terms of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Assessment of changes in the community structure during the recovery of forests can be performed using indicator organisms. Dung beetles perform several ecological functions and show high sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of regeneration time of Atlantic Forest sites on structure of Scarabaeinae assemblages. We sampled dung beetles using ten baited pitfall traps per site, in six sites grouped into three classes of forest regeneration time (similar to 30, similar to 60 and > 80 years) in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, during January 2015. A total of 520 individuals belonging to 16 species and nine genera of dung beetles were sampled. Rarefied species richness did not differ between sites with different regeneration times. Average species richness and abundance of Scarabaeinae was smaller in areas of shorter recovery time. True alpha diversity was higher in areas with intermediate recovery whereas Shannon diversity showed higher values in areas of shorter recovery. Approximately 29 % of the variation in abundance data of Scarabaeinae was explained by environmental variables, with one-third of this variation explained also by spatial predictors. External factors such as landscape management and farming practices in the surroundings must be taken into consideration in management plans and the management of natural areas for the recovery of biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest. These external factors can considerably affect the structure of communities and lead to scenarios of greater diversity in intermediate regeneration sites due to the heterogeneity of the landscape.

AB Natural resource management agencies in many countries take advantage of recreational hunting to manage the impacts or abundance of mammal populations that damage biodiversity or environmental, economic, or social values. In Australia, public lands are increasingly being made available for recreational hunters to pursue introduced mammals that can cause substantial damage to important resources. There is fervent debate over the role that recreational hunting might play in controlling introduced mammals in Australia, and scant evidence to build management strategies upon. In this review, we combine information from Australia and elsewhere in a systematic examination of the potential for recreational hunting to contribute to the control of introduced mammals on public lands in Australia. We examine the traits of introduced mammal species and populations, geographical settings, hunters, and management agencies to propose situations where hunting might be most useful, and suggest how current practice could be improved. We find there is insufficient evidence to support or disprove arguments that contemporary recreational hunting programs are effective at controlling introduced mammal populations on public lands. Moreover, current hunting management programs offer little potential for clarifying the situation or optimizing the value of recreational hunting as a pest animal control tool. To resolve this problem, we outline a framework of competing models and diagnostic criteria for assessing the effects of recreational hunting on introduced mammal populations. We contend that hunting will continue to be an under-utilized and over-politicized resource until management strategy is informed by transparent monitoring based on rational strategic objectives that provide mutual benefits to hunters and public resource managers.

AB The widespread clearing of tropical forests causes lower tree cover, drier microclimate, and higher and drier fuel loads of forest edges, increasing the risk of fire occurrence and its intensity. We used a manipulative field experiment to investigate the influence of fire and fuel loads on ant communities and their interactions with myrmecochorous seeds in the southern Amazon, a region currently undergoing extreme land-use intensification. Experimental fires and fuel addition were applied to 40 x 40-m plots in six replicated blocks, and ants were sampled between 15 and 30 days after fires in four strata: subterranean, litter, epigaeic, and arboreal. Fire had extensive negative effects on ant communities. Highly specialized cryptobiotic and predator species of the litter layer and epigaeic specialist predators were among the most sensitive, but we did not find evidence of overall biotic homogenization following fire. Fire reduced rates of location and transport of myrmecochorous seeds, and therefore the effectiveness of a key ecosystem service provided by ants, which we attribute to lower ant abundance and increased thermal stress. Experimental fuel addition had only minor effects on attributes of fire severity, and limited effects on ant responses to fire. Our findings indicate that enhanced fuel loads will not decrease ant diversity and ecosystem services through increased fire severity, at least in wetter years. However, higher fuel loads can still have a significant effect on ants from Amazonian rainforests because they increase the risk of fire occurrence, which has a detrimental impact on ant communities and a key ecosystem service they provide.

AB We present a dated phylogenetic tree for the Neotropical genus Attalea (Arecaceae). We used six orthologues from the nuclear WRKY gene family across 98 accessions to address relationships among species and biogeographical hypotheses. We found that the formerly recognized groups within Attalea are not monophyletic and therefore there is no support for multiple genera as previously thought. Species of Attalea-like palms from the Atlantic forest form a well-supported clade sister to the Attalea species from Amazonia, the Andean valleys and Mesoamerica. Dates for the main divergence events suggest a relationship with the development of the dry forests that now span eastern South America and the now-lost Pebas Lake region in the western Amazon. Attalea crassispatha possibly colonized Hispaniola by a long-distance dispersal event, not via the land bridge Great Antilles Avian Ridge (GAAR), before the Panama channel closed. The common ancestor of Attalea appears to have been an Atlantic forest clade c. 30 Mya. The early split between the Atlantic-forest clade and the two Amazonian-northern Andean clades was probably the result of climatic changes that caused an increase in aridity in South America.

AB Stem development in palms usually involves the building up of a trunk of maximum diameter before emerging from the ground. Unlike most arboreal palms, the oligarchic palm Iriartea deltoidea has been shown to grow in both height and diameter. Nevertheless, the drivers of this unusual growth strategy are poorly known. We examined the growth rates of 554 stems found in 10 ha of the 50-ha Yasuni Forest Dynamics Plot. We explored whether palm growth responds to: (1) the size of individual palms; (2) light availability; or (3) the number of conspecifics and heterospecifics in the surrounding neighbourhood. Individual growth rates were positively related to palm height in the three life stages considered here (seedlings, saplings and adults). The mean annual diameter increment was higher (3.2 +/- 4.6 mm year(-1)) in individuals with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of <20 cm, and mean vertical elongation of juveniles (0.2 +/- 0.2 m year(-1)) was initiated early in development until they became pre-adults. Growth in I. deltoidea was minimally affected by the presence of neighbours (basal area of conspecifics and heterospecifics), suggesting that this species can succeed at high densities with low levels of interspecific competition. Under the forest canopy, growth rates were not significantly different in palms with greater light exposure. Our findings contribute to an understanding of the factors that make I. deltoidea a dominant species in western Amazonia. (C) 2016 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Habitat loss and landscape fragmentation are often associated with changes in biological communities at different spatial scales. Our goal in this study was to identify fragment characteristics and environmental variables linked to palm species richness, abundance and community similarity at local and landscape spatial scales and to contrast these patterns between adults and juveniles. We sampled palm communities in 22 fragments of Choco rainforest in and around the Mache-Chindul Ecological Reserve in north-western Ecuador, where we recorded 9991 individuals of 23 palm species. At the landscape scale, fragment size and surrounding forest cover were not associated with species richness or abundance for either adults or juveniles. However, community similarity of juveniles was related to surrounding forest cover and the abundance of juveniles and adults increased with elevation. At the local scale, adults and juveniles differed in their relationships to environmental variables and distance to fragment edge: juveniles showed reduced species richness and different community composition near fragment edges compared with interior habitat, but adults did not. These results provide baseline information on palm communities in a poorly studied conservation hotspot and highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial scales and life stages in studies of habitat fragmentation.

AB Studies of cambial dynamics have been employed to investigate the growth behavior of trees. In these investigations, however, spatial variation in cambial rhythm within the stem is usually not taken into account. This study aims to evaluate the contribution of multiple sampling scales on the cambial dynamics of Cedrela odorata L. (Meliaceae) in different seasons. The effects of slope orientation were also tested. Samples were processed and analyzed with standard plant histology techniques. Data from multiple sampling scales were analyzed with nested ANOVA for each season, and the total variance was partitioned according to the fraction related to each scale. The main sources of variability were associated with the scale of tree and scales smaller than 1 cm. Radial growth was not significantly related to acclivity orientation. Thus, to obtain samples that represent total variability in cambial dynamics, it is preferable to increase the number of sampled trees; to take multiple samples from a few millimetres apart from each other, or to assess multiple histological sections. Samples on scales greater than a few centimetres apart should not be given priority.

AB Ecological niche theory predicts that coexistence is facilitated by resource partitioning mechanisms that are influenced by abiotic and biotic interactions. Alternative hypotheses suggest that under certain conditions, species may become phenotypically similar and functionally equivalent, which invokes the possibility of other mechanisms, such as habitat filtering processes. To test these hypotheses, we examined the coexistence of the giant redfin Pseudobarbus skeltoni, a newly described freshwater fish, together with its congener Pseudobabus burchelli and an anabantid Sandelia capensis by assessing their scenopoetic and bionomic patterns. We found high habitat and isotope niche overlaps between the two redfins, rendering niche partitioning a less plausible sole mechanism that drives their coexistence. By comparison, environment-trait relationships revealed differences in species-environment relationships, making habitat filtering and functional equivalence less likely alternatives. Based on P. skeltoni's high habitat niche overlap with other species, and its large isotope niche width, we inferred the likelihood of differential resource utilization at trophic level as an alternative mechanism that distinguished it from its congener. In comparison, its congener P. burchelli appeared to have a relatively small trophic niche, suggesting that its trophic niche was more conserved despite being the most abundant species. By contrast, S. capensis was distinguished by occupying a higher trophic position and by having a trophic niche that had a low probability of overlapping onto those of redfins. Therefore, trophic niche partitioning appeared to influence the coexistence between S. capensis and redfins. This study suggests that coexistence of these fishes appears to be promoted by their differences in niche adaptation mechanisms that are probably shaped by historic evolutionary and ecological processes.

AB As one of the few countries in Latin America to have reversed persistent losses in tree cover, Chile may hold important insights for forest transition theory. However, existing studies have not provided methodologically consistent analyses at sufficient temporal and spatial scales to properly assess the state of Chile's forest transition. In the current study, we generate high-resolution maps of Chilean land use change between 1986, 2001 and 2011. We couple remote sensing with a review of historic assessments of Chile's forest resources to document long-term trends in forest extent. This historical review identifies multiple discrete forest transitions throughout Chile's history. These fluctuations in forest clearing emphasize that the cultural, economic and political forces that precipitate forest transitions can all be reversed. The remote sensing analysis calls into question official statistics indicating an expansion of native forests between 1986 and 2011. We find that increases in forest cover were largely driven by the expansion of forest plantations, rather than through native forest regeneration. Plantation forests directly displaced native forests in many locations, especially during the 1986-2001 period. Nevertheless, declines in the rate of forest conversion during the 2001-2011 period suggest that plantations are beginning to ease pressure on native forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study explores the main direct and underlying causes of deforestation in Brazil's Legal Amazon region by considering spatial differences. The computation of localized parameters is based on geographically weighted regression (GWR). The novelty of this paper lies in its incorporation of economic, rather than Euclidean, distances into the GWR. Economic distances are measured by travel time, sourced from Google Inc. A global approach revealed several important factors that affect deforestation, including: rural population, GDP (suggesting a U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve), forest stock, cattle ranching, timber value, and road networks (both official and unofficial). Local analysis uncovered patterns not seen under global models, especially in the state of Para. Most notably, crop cultivation was found to accelerate deforestation in southeastern Para and northeastern Mato Grosso, while in some regions (especially in the northeastern corner of Para), the area covered by crop plantations was negatively associated with deforestation. For Para, rural credit constraints, larger territories designated as sustainable use areas and indigenous lands, and higher levels of precipitation inhibit deforestation. Further, rural population has a very heterogeneous impact on deforestation across Legal Amazon: it is not a significant factor of deforestation in northern Para and Amapa, but it has a relatively strong effect in the western parts of Mato Grosso and Rondonia. Also, official and illegal roads create significantly more pressure on forests in remote regions compared to developed areas. Finally, the use of economic distances, as opposed to Euclidean distances, leads to notably different GWR results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aims of this study were to (1) uncover the ant diversity and functional groups of Cypress-Tupelo swamps; (2) examine the differences of ant assemblages across vertical strata within trees and across tree species within swamps; and (3) determine if the ant mosaic hypothesis applies to observed patterns of arboreal ant distribution. Pitfall traps were set in tree crowns and on trunks to collect the arboreal ants in three swamps in Louisiana. A total of 21 species from 11 genera were collected. Contrary to our hypothesis, ant diversity on trunks was higher than that in the canopy. A multivariate analysis revealed that the canopy and trunk support distinct ant assemblages, whereas ant species composition was not consistently different among the three dominant tree species- bald cypress, water tupelo, and red maples. In addition, evidence of ant mosaic distribution patterns were not detected. Moreover, we did not find dramatic changes of ant diversity or community structure in trees that were infested with invasive red imported fire ants. Our study provides a benchmark to evaluate the effects of disturbances and conservation management in swamp ecosystems.

AB Evolution of Earth surface systems (ESS) comprises sequential transitions between system states. Treating these as directed graphs, algebraic graph theory was used to quantify complexity of archetypal structures, and empirical examples of forest succession and alluvial river channel change. Spectral radius measures structural complexity and is highest for fully connected, lowest for linear sequential and cyclic graphs, and intermediate for divergent and convergent patterns. The irregularity index represents the extent to which a subgraph is representative of the full graph. Fully connected graphs have . Lower values are found in linear and cycle patterns, while higher values, such as those of divergent and convergent patterns, are due to a few highly connected nodes. Algebraic connectivity ( indicates inferential synchronization and is inversely related to historical contingency. Highest values are associated with fully connected and strongly connected mesh graphs, whereas forking structures and linear sequences all have = 1, with cycles slightly higher. Diverging vs. converging graphs of the same size and topology have no differences with respect to graph complexity, so complexity change is dependent on whether development results in increased or reduced richness. Convergent-divergent mode switching, however, would generally increase ESS complexity, decrease irregularity, and increase algebraic connectivity. As ESS and associated graphs evolve, none of the possible trends reduces complexity, which can only remain constant or increase. Algebraic connectivity may increase, however. As improving shortcomings in ESS evolution models generally result in elaborating possible state changes, this produces more structurally complex but less historically contingent models.

AB We describe and illustrate Lesia tepuiensis, a new species of subshrub from rock outcrops of the Serra do Araca tepui in Amazonas, Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses based on 7219-aligned base pairs of the plastid and nuclear DNA sequences recovered the new species as sister to Lesia savannarum, the type species of Lesia, a genus recently described as monotypic. The new species is readily distinguished from L. savannarum by having a red, pouched corolla tube, lanceolate calyx lobes, a hirsute to tomentose leaf indument and a rupicolous habit. Phylogenetic analyses of the relationships of Lesia with other genera in the subtribe Columneinae indicated that Lesia and Codonanthopsis form a monophyletic group sister to a clade endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic forest formed by Nematanthus and Codonanthe. The pouched corolla tube found in the genera Lesia and Nematanthus appears to have evolved independently in these two lineages. Ecological and distributional data, as well as a key to the species of Lesia and related genera, are also provided.

AB This study presents the results from a survey of landowner interest in a propositional payment modality for Costa Rica's Pagos por Servicios Ambientales (PSA) program that is based on a sliding-scale payment scheme. This payment scheme would transition from higher monetary payments per hectare per year for the first units of land invested, to lower payments per hectare per Year for additional units of land invested; however, as payments per hectare decrease, monetary payments would be supplemented with non-financial rewards. This program structure is designed to 1) offer higher per-hectare financial incentives to smaller scale landowners, who would otherwise face steep trade-off costs by transitioning to conservation-based land-use, and 2) offer greater non-financial incentives to larger-scale landowners, who face less sharp trade-off costs, and who might be more interested in prestige- and status-based non-financial incentives than the currently meager PSA payments. I found support for the proposed program modality across all classes of landowners. Interest in PSA participation by small- and medium-scale landowners showed sensitivity to proposed payments, with landowners indicating a strong desire to participate in conservation land-use as soon as the proposed financial incentives were sufficient to cover their opportunity costs. Large-scale landowners showed little sensitivity to payment size, and in general-with mode=10 and median=7 responses on a 10 point Likert-scale-indicated strong willingness to participate in the PSA program under the proposed structure, even if financial incentives per hectare were decreased significantly for large investments of land, but prestige- and status-based awards were introduced. These results are discussed in the context of an emerging literature on signaling theory, conspicuous conservation, and the interaction of financial incentives and social norms.

AB Monitoring the impacts of land-use practices is of particular importance with regard to biodiversity hotspots in developing countries. Here, conserving the high level of unique biodiversity is challenged by limited possibilities for data collection on site. Especially for such scenarios, assisting biodiversity assessments by remote sensing has proven useful. Remote sensing techniques can be applied to interpolate between biodiversity assessments taken in situ. Through this approach, estimates of biodiversity for entire landscapes can be produced, relating land-use intensity to biodiversity conditions. Such maps are a valuable basis for developing biodiversity conservation plans. Several approaches have been published so far to interpolate local biodiversity assessments in remote sensing data. In the following, a new approach is proposed. Instead of inferring biodiversity using environmental variables or the variability of spectral values, a hypothesis-based approach is applied. Empirical knowledge about biodiversity in relation to land-use is formalized and applied as ascription rules for image data. The method is exemplified for a large study site (over 67,000 km(2)) in central Chile, where forest industry heavily impacts plant diversity. The proposed approach yields a coefficient of correlation of 0.73 and produces a convincing estimate of regional biodiversity. The framework is broad enough to be applied to other study sites.

AB Forests in the mountains are a treasure trove; harbour a large biodiversity; and provide fodder, firewood, timber and non-timber forest products; all of these are essential for human survival in the highest mountains on earth. The present paper attempts a spatiotemporal assessment of forest fragmentation and changes in land use land cover ( LULC) pattern using multitemporal satellite data over a time span of around a decade ( 2000-2009), within the third highest protected area ( PA) in the world. The fragmentation analysis using Landscape Fragmentation Tool ( LFT) depicts a decrease in large core, edge and patches areas by 5.93, 3.64 and 0.66 %, respectively, while an increase in non-forest and perforated areas by 6.59 and 4.01 %, respectively. The land cover dynamics shows a decrease in open forest, alpine scrub, alpine meadows, snow and hill shadow areas by 2.81, 0.39, 8.18, 3.46 and 0.60 %, respectively, and there is an increase in dense forest and glacier area by 4.79 and 10.65 %, respectively. The change analysis shows a major transformation in areas from open forest to dense forest and from alpine meadows to alpine scrub. In order to quantify changes induced by forest fragmentation and to characterize composition and configuration of LULC mosaics, fragmentation indices were computed using Fragstats at class level, showing the signs of accelerated fragmentation. The outcome of the analysis revealed the effectiveness of geospatial tools coupled with landscape ecology in characterization and quantification of forest fragmentation and land cover changes. The present study provides a baseline database for sustainable conservation planning that will benefit the subsistence livelihoods in the region. Recommendations made based on the present analysis will help to recover forest and halt the pessimistic effects of fragmentation and land cover changes on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the region.

AB Ecological edge effects are sensitive to landscape context, including matrix type and the presence of other nearby edges. In sub-Saharan Africa, temporary cattle corrals (bomas) develop into productive nutrient hotspots (glades) that attract diverse wildlife and persist for decades.
   Building on previous descriptive work, we experimentally altered boma configurations in an African savanna and asked how boma density and matrix type (open plains vs. bushland) influence the development of edge effects around abandoned bomas.
   We randomly assigned eleven plots to three treatments: one boma, two bomas 200 m apart, or two bomas 100 m apart. Before boma establishment and aeyen18 months after boma abandonment, we sampled soil nutrients, foliar nutrients, plant communities, and large herbivore use at each plot.
   Bomas developed into glade hotspots with elevated nutrient concentrations, altered vegetation, and elevated use by large herbivores. Few edge effects were detectable at distances aeyen50 m. Both glade density and matrix type affected the development of edge effects around experimental glades. When compared to patterns around single glades, the presence of a second glade 100 m away strengthened glade edge effects (more difference between glade and matrix), but the presence of a second glade 200 m away weakened edge effects. Vegetation edge effects were stronger in bushland areas than open plains, while wildlife shifts were strongest along the bushland-plain interface.
   Our results highlight the potential for edge effect variability in complex landscapes, and show that manipulative experiments can help illuminate causes and consequences of that variability.

AB Ecuador has experienced one of the highest rates of deforestation in South America over the turn of the century with consequent threats to the provision of essential life-supporting environmental services. The Ecuadorian government instituted the 'Socio Bosque Program' (PSB) in 2008 in an effort to incentivize the conservation of privately-owned native forests. This study is the first to examine the PSB additionality in prevented deforestation through use of a geographic information system. Moreover, face-to-face surveys were conducted and analyzed to create a typology of forest owners based on their estimated likelihood to engage in forest land changes and elicit corresponding preferences for PSB-like forest conservation program participation. The survey data were collected from individual Ecuadorian forest owners in the Western region of the province of Pichincha. We estimate that less than 1% of forestland enrolled in the PSB would have been deforested were it not enrolled in the program. Landowners more likely to engage in deforestation practices denoted greater interest in participating in a conservation program when contracts allowed for the sustainable harvesting of timber. Landowners likely to conserve, showed greater interest in participating in a conservation program contingent on the amount of financial incentive provided. A design strategy, counter to the traditional focus, points to the allowance of sustainable forest harvesting, as a means of more effectively preventing deforestation in the Tropics.

AB Fire is an increasingly important agent of forest degradation in the Amazon, but little attention has been given to the susceptibility of seasonally flooded forests to fire. Satellite images suggest that forests flooded seasonally by nutrient-poor black waters are more susceptible to fire and may suffer greater fire damage than nearby upland forests. Reasons for this difference may include the presence of a root mat, more fine fuel as litter and a drier understory in the flooded forest. We investigated this difference in the field, hypothesizing that differences in the aboveground structure of the pre-burn forest can contribute to the difference in impacts of, and susceptibility to, fires. We employed a portable profiling LiDAR (PPL), first to compare damage between adjacent black water seasonally flooded and upland forests that were burned by the same fire event, and to then assess pre-fire canopy structure attributes known to affect fire susceptibility. For both assessments, we used PPL-derived metrics of leaf area and vertical and horizontal variation in the structure of vegetation in the canopy. Four years after the fire, the LiDAR metrics showed greater combined effects of high damage and slow recovery in the seasonally flooded forest; reduction of total Leaf Area Index (LAI) after burning was only 10% for upland forest but was 71% in the flood forest. Compared to unburned upland, the canopy of unburned flood forest had structural differences that increase susceptibility to fire, including drier microclimate. It had more gaps, a more open understory and a lower upper canopy. Small patches lacking canopy closure (LAI < 1.0) were far more abundant in the unburned flood forest. We conclude that black water seasonally flooded forest suffers greater fire damage than upland forest and canopy structure contributes to its greater susceptibility to the occurrence of fires. This must be considered in assessments of future Amazon fire risks and impacts, including flood forest acting as a potential conduit for spreading fire to upland forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Spatial patterns are important to understanding factors that shape many ecological processes in natural plant and animal communities. However, the spatial patterns of Cubitermes mounds remain poorly understood despite their importance in many ecological processes in savanna ecosystems. We assessed the structural characteristics and spatial patterns of Cubitermes mounds in 25 x 25 m plots along a catena sequence i.e. upper, middle and bottom in a seasonal savanna wetland. A density of 1317 mounds ha(-1) was estimated for this savanna system. Mound density decreased whereas mound size increased down the catena, and mounds were absent in the floor region of the catena due to prolonged inundation. Spatial analysis showed that mounds were randomly distributed in the upper section of the catena and either random or clustered in the middle and bottom sections. True segregation between large and small mounds only occurred in the upper section of the catena; otherwise small mounds were either randomly distributed or clustered in relation to large mounds in the middle and bottom sections of the catena. With increase in spatial scale, however, mounds were independent indicating the absence of interaction between mounds. In the bottom region of the catena, mounds were independent at small spatial scales but positively correlated with increase in spatial scales a result consistent with low mound density and mutual stimulation, respectively. In conclusion, along the catena sequence, mound size and spatial distribution are a function of competition in the upper regions, whereas in the bottom regions these characteristics appear to be regulated by inundation. The study highlights the importance of hydrology, topography and competition for the structure and spatial patterning of Cubitermes mounds, and consequently for the spatial heterogeneity of ecological processes in savanna ecosystems.

AB Understanding the mechanisms generating species distributions remains a challenge, especially in hyperdiverse tropical forests. We evaluated the role of rainfall variation, soil gradients and herbivory on seedling mortality, and how variation in seedling performance along these gradients contributes to habitat specialisation. In a 4-year experiment, replicated at the two extremes of the Amazon basin, we reciprocally transplanted 4638 tree seedlings of 41 habitat-specialist species from seven phylogenetic lineages among the three most important forest habitats of lowland Amazonia. Rainfall variation, flooding and soil gradients strongly influenced seedling mortality, whereas herbivory had negligible impact. Seedling mortality varied strongly among habitats, consistent with predictions for habitat specialists in most lineages. This suggests that seedling performance is a primary determinant of the habitat associations of adult trees across Amazonia. It further suggests that tree diversity, currently mostly harboured in terra firme forests, may be strongly impacted by the predicted climate changes in Amazonia.

AB This article examines how resource materiality, scarcity, and evolving international environmental regulation shape global production networks (GPNs). Nature-facing elements, including resource scarcity and environmental regulation, have seldom featured in GPN analysis. So, too, GPN analysis emphasizes spatial relations between network actors over temporal change. We extend GPN theorization through a temporal analysis of industrial change, connecting manufacturing to upstream resource materialities and shifting regulation, and to downstream consumers increasingly concerned with provenance and material stewardship. To illustrate, we document a resource-sensitive GPNacoustic guitar manufacturingwhere scarcity of select raw materials (tonewoods) with material qualities of resonance, strength, and beauty, as well as tighter regulation, has spawned shifting economic geographies of new actors who influence the whole GPN. Such actors include specialist extraction firms, salvagers, traders, verification consultants, and customs agents who innovate in procurement and raw material supply risk management. Traditional large guitar manufacturing firms have struggled with regulation and securing consistent resource supply, although smaller lead manufacturing firms have creatively responded via novel procurement methods and marketing, developing closely bound, iterative relationships with specialist timber harvesters, traders, and with emotionally attached consumers. A cohort of tonewood supply firms and guitar manufacturersespecially in Australia, the Pacific Northwest and Canada, key locations of both resource and design expertisehave together altered material stewardship practices and commodity production. Niche strategies derive exchange value from rarity and resource innovation, embracing raw material variability, inconsistent supply, and the need for alternatives. How firms adapt to resource supply security risks, we argue, is an imperative question for GPN analysis.

AB The dry tropical forests are among the most vulnerable ecosystems of the world and, however, are relatively understudied. These forests provide various ecosystem services, and are progressively being converted into patches of dry scrubs, savanna and marginal cropland systems, due to various anthropogenic perturbations. Soils of these regions are relatively nutrient poor with a patchy nutrient and water distribution pattern. Therefore, the variability in these natural resources imposed by the present climate change scenario may affect the forest plant community of dry tropics via its impact on seedling growth and recruitment. Seedlings are considered as the most sensitive stage of plant lifecycle, and therefore, understanding of seedling regeneration may help in restoration of forest ecosystems. Seedling growth is majorly regulated by various naturally occurring resources (such as light, water, nutrient, etc.) and disturbances (such as defoliation, grass competition, fire, etc.). Therefore, efforts on the regeneration of these forest systems are highly necessitated. In the present study, we critically reviewed the studies on seedling survival and growth under different resource and disturbance regimes with a special focus to dry tropical environment. We found that water, light, nutrients, herbivory, and grass competition majorly regulates recruitments, growth, and establishment of the tree seedling in dry tropical environment. Most of the studies are limited to observe the effect of one or two factors over the seedling survival and growth. However, the resources and disturbances may have an interactive effect over seedling growth. Therefore, studies encompassing the interactions of various growth factors (resources and disturbances) under different climatic conditions are urgently needed for the successful regeneration of tree seedlings and for the restoration of plant community. Moreover, it will improve our ability to manage the tropical vegetation under changing climatic scenario.

AB There are tens of thousands of species of phytoplankton found throughout the tree of life. Despite this diversity, phytoplankton are often aggregated into a few functional groups according to metabolic traits or biogeochemical role. We investigate the extent to which phytoplankton species dynamics are neutral within functional groups. Seasonal dynamics in many regions of the ocean are known to affect phytoplankton at the functional group level leading to largely predictable patterns of seasonal succession. It is much more difficult to make general statements about the dynamics of individual species. We use a 7-year time series at station L4 in the Western English Channel with 57 diatom and 17 dinoflagellate species enumerated weekly to test whether the abundance of diatom and dinoflagellate species varies randomly within their functional group envelope or whether each species is driven uniquely by external factors. We show that the total biomass of the diatom and dinoflagellate functional groups is well predicted by irradiance and temperature and quantify trait values governing the growth rate of both functional groups. The biomass dynamics of the functional groups are not neutral and each has their own distinct responses to environmental forcing. Compared to dinoflagellates, diatoms have faster growth rates and grow faster under lower irradiance, cooler temperatures, and higher nutrient conditions. The biomass of most species varies randomly within their functional group biomass envelope, most of the time. As a consequence, modellers will find it difficult to predict the biomass of most individual species. Our analysis supports the approach of using a single set of traits for a functional group and suggests that it should be possible to determine these traits from natural communities.

AB In tropical forest conservation, areas with full statutory protection are often surrounded by buffer zones. Information on the patterns of tree community structure differences in these zones is helpful to evaluate the conservation efficacy. Our study was implemented within a biodiversity hotspot, in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve of north-western Vietnam, which has a statutorily protected core zone and a buffer zone, where local H'Mong people are permitted low intensity forest use. The forests are rich in tree species (249 observed). Many of these tree species provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) (48%) or valuable timber (22%), and 18 species are red-listed. Overall tree density was not different in the two zones, but tree diameter and species richness were lower in the buffer zone. At the tree level, logistic regression analysis indicated that red-listed status, large diameter, and low density of conspecifics increased the probability of tree absence from the buffer zone but not the potential use as a NTFP. However, most NTFP species had different densities in the core and buffer zones, and this correlated with signs of human interference. At the species level, the density of species was the most important variable, and rarity strongly increased the probability of species absence. Our results also indicate that rare and red-listed trees were depleted in the buffer zone. In consideration of conservation goals, the future monitoring of these species at the Ta Xua Nature Reserve and other protected areas is needed, and conservation measures most likely need to be improved.

AB We aimed to quantify the variation of leaf delta C-13 along an arid and semi-arid grassland transect in northern China. We also evaluated the effects of environmental factors (i.e. precipitation, temperature and altitude) on the spatial variation of leaf delta C-13 in northern grasslands and Tibetan Plateau, China.
   We sampled leaves of plant species belonging to three herb genera (Stipa spp., Leymus spp. and Cleistogenes spp.) and three shrub genera (Caragana spp., Reaumuria spp. and Nitraria spp.) for carbon isotope analysis from 50 locations along a 3200-km arid and semi-arid grassland transect in northern China. Leaf delta C-13 data in Tibetan Plateau and northern grasslands in China were also compiled from studies in literature.
   Along the transect, leaf delta C-13 for C-3 plants ranged from -28.0aEuro degrees to -23.3aEuro degrees, and from -16.3aEuro degrees to -13.8aEuro degrees for C-4 plant Cleistogenes spp.. The change in leaf delta C-13 ranged from -0.26aEuro degrees to -3.51aEuro degrees with every 100mm increase of annual precipitation, and leaf delta C-13 of shrubs (Nitraria spp., Reaumuria spp. and Caragana spp.) responded more markedly to climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) than that of herbs (Stipa spp., Leymus spp. and Cleistogenes spp.), indicating higher sensitivity of shrub delta C-13 to climatic changes. The most important factor regulating spatial variations of leaf delta C-13 in Tibetan Plateau was altitude, while it was precipitation in northern grasslands. Our results suggested that shrubs are more adapted to increasing drought in arid and semi-arid grassland. Controls of environmental factors on leaf delta C-13 depended on the most limiting factors in arid grassland (precipitation) and Tibetan grasslands (atmospheric CO2 concentration).

AB We assessed whether diversity in plant hydraulic traits can explain the observed diversity in plant responses to water stress in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs). The Ecosystem Demography model 2 (ED2) was updated with a trait-driven mechanistic plant hydraulic module, as well as novel drought-phenology and plant water stress schemes. Four plant functional types were parameterized on the basis of meta-analysis of plant hydraulic traits. Simulations from both the original and the updated ED2 were evaluated against 5yr of field data from a Costa Rican SDTF site and remote-sensing data over Central America. The updated model generated realistic plant hydraulic dynamics, such as leaf water potential and stem sap flow. Compared with the original ED2, predictions from our novel trait-driven model matched better with observed growth, phenology and their variations among functional groups. Most notably, the original ED2 produced unrealistically small leaf area index (LAI) and underestimated cumulative leaf litter. Both of these biases were corrected by the updated model. The updated model was also better able to simulate spatial patterns of LAI dynamics in Central America. Plant hydraulic traits are intercorrelated in SDTFs. Mechanistic incorporation of plant hydraulic traits is necessary for the simulation of spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics in SDTFs in vegetation models.

AB The Amazon basin is the largest and most species-rich tropical forest and river system in the world, playing a pivotal role in global climate regulation and harboring hundreds of traditional and indigenous cultures. It is a matter of intense debate whether the ecosystem is threatened by hunting practices, whereby an "empty forest" loses critical ecological functions. Strikingly, no previous study has examined Amazonian ecosystem resilience through the perspective of the massive 20th century international trade in furs and skins. We present the first historical account of the scale and impacts of this trade and show that whereas aquatic species suffered basin-wide population collapse, terrestrial species did not. We link this differential resilience to the persistence of adequate spatial refuges for terrestrial species, enabling populations to be sustained through source-sink dynamics, contrasting with unremitting hunting pressure on more accessible aquatic habitats. Our findings attest the high vulnerability of aquatic fauna to unregulated hunting, particularly during years of severe drought. We propose that the relative resilience of terrestrial species suggests a marked opportunity for managing, rather than criminalizing, contemporary traditional subsistence hunting in Amazonia, through both the engagement of local people in community-based comanagement programs and science-led conservation governance.

AB Although tree-ring chronologies of Cedrela fissilis and Cedrela angustifolia showed a common climatic signal, local conditions influence growth, suggesting that forest guidelines should be appropriate to the species and context.
   Cedrela species are highly valued because of the quality of their timber. Understanding the behaviour of each different Cedrela species and their ecology is of importance to ensuring that forest harvesting and management do not endanger the survival of natural populations. These species grow in a wide range of environmental gradients and different types of forests in Bolivia. This study used dendrochronological methods to analyse growth-precipitation relationships of two Cedrela species coming from three locations with different environmental conditions: dry Chiquitano (Concepcin), Chiquitano transitional Amazonian (Guarayos), and Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests (Postrervalle). The rainy season in all locations runs from October to April and the dry season runs from May to September. Twelve Cedrela fissilis specimens were sampled from dry Chiquitano, 11 Cedrela fissilis specimens from Chiquitano transitional Amazonian, and 30 Cedrela angustifolia specimens from Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests. The samples were crossdated and exhibited a common signal between trees from three sites, despite tree rings from the Chiquitano transitional Amazonian forest being narrower and displaying blurred bands of parenchyma in the boundaries. Significant inter-series correlation was found for the C. fissilis species series from dry Chiquitano with r = 0.261 (p < 0.01) and Chiquitano transitional Amazonian forests with r = 0.284 (p < 0.01), and for Cedrela angustifolia from Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests with r = 0.374 (p < 0.01). Mean annual growth was 2.07, 1.92, and 2.82 mm year(-1) at the three sites, respectively. Cedrela species from dry Chiquitano and Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests were sensitive to precipitation from October to April of the current growth year (wettest season) and to low temperatures from May to July of the current growth year (driest season). Samples from Chiquitano transitional Amazonian were more sensitive to precipitation during late rainy season (March, April, and May of the current growth year) and high temperatures during the rainy months (November-December). Growth differences between sites and species in response to climate variations and local conditions should be taken into account and handled with different forest management guidelines.

AB The planting or seeding of pioneer species to promote restoration apparently contributes little to the establishment of late-successional species, despite the common assumption that they facilitate forest regeneration. We evaluate the consequences of planting pioneers for coastal dune restoration by measuring plant traits (specific leaf area, wood density, delta C-13 and maximum plant height), species composition and canopy openness in three rehabilitating forests of different ages, where a pioneer species (Acacia karroo) was seeded, and one undisturbed old-growth forest. We surveyed woody species composition in 2010 and in 2015 to assess how changes in A. karroo influences community structure of rehabilitating forest. Our results showed that the number of adult individuals of A. karroo decreased progressively with forest age, indicating that the demise of individuals of A. karroo opens canopy gaps in rehabilitating sites. This accorded with a significantly higher variation of canopy openness levels in the oldest rehabilitating site. Rehabilitating sites tended to progress towards a reduced trait space as they aged, contrasting with the old-growth forest that showed an expanded trait space. Communities located at high levels of canopy openness were dominated by species with lower values of specific leaf area and wood density, indicative of acclimation to high light conditions and fast-growing strategies. Our results suggest that changes in light availability due to canopy gap formation, can act as an environmental filter which may deflect forest regeneration trajectories. We show that coupling a trait-based approach with environmental measurements can give insight in regeneration trajectories of rehabilitating sites and, therefore, better inform restoration practices. Preventing the formation of large canopy gaps in restoration programs using pioneers as a regeneration pathway may facilitate the natural recovery of degraded forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Access to P species is a driver for plant community composition based on nutrient acquisition. Here we investigated the distribution and accumulation of soil inorganic P (Pi) and organic P (Po) forms in a bracken and bluebell dominated upland soil for the period between bluebell above ground dominance until biomass is formed from half bluebells and half bracken. Chemical characterisation and P-31 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy was used to determine the organic and inorganic P species. Total P concentration in soils was 0.87 g kg(-1), while in plants (above- and below-ground parts) total P ranged between 0.84-4.0 g kg(-1) and 0.14-2.0 g kg(-1) for bluebell and bracken, respectively. The P speciation in the plant samples was reflected in the surrounding soil. The main forms of inorganic P detected in the NaOH-EDTA soil extracts were orthophosphate (20.0-31.5%), pyrophosphate (0.6-2.5%) and polyphosphate (0.4-7.0%). Phytate (myo-IP6) was the most dominant organic P form (23.6-40.0%). Other major peaks were scyllo-IP6 and alpha-and beta-glycerophosphate (glyP). In bluebells and bracken the main P form detected was orthophosphate ranging from(21.7-80.4%) and 68.5-81.1%, in above-ground and below-ground biomass, respectively. Other detected forms include alpha-glyP (4.5-14.4%) and beta-glyP (0.9-7.7%) in bluebell, while in bracken they were detected only in stripe and blade in ranges of 2.5-5.5% and 4.4-9.6%, respectively. Pyrophosphate, polyphosphate, scyllo-IP6, phosphonates, found in soil samples, were not detected in any plant parts. In particular, the high abundance of phytate in the soil and in bluebell bulbs, may be related to a mechanism through which bluebells create a recalcitrant phosphorus store which form a key part of their adaptation to nutrient poor conditions.

AB This paper describes and discusses the feeding ecology of two stingray species that occur in the Azores: Dasyatis pastinaca and Myliobatis aquila. Both are common coastal species associated with sandy, muddy and rocky bottoms, from surface waters to depths of over 200 m. The diet described here is based on the stomach content analysis from 33 specimens (23 D. pastinaca, 10 M. aquila) collected by spearfishing between June and October 2010 at three different locations along the coast of Terceira Island, Azores. Food habits of D. pastinaca consist mainly of Decapod crustaceans (with a relevance for Pachygrapsus marmoratus) followed by other groups with high representativeness: Polychaeta and Mysidacea. The diet of M. aquila consists mainly of Calliostoma lusitanicum and Stramonita haemastoma. Both species from our sample proved to be generalist predators with different feeding habits. The diet of D pastinaca is characterized by Crustacea (81% IRI) and that of M. aquila characterized by Mollusca (82% IRI).

AB Fisheries management in marine protected areas (MPAs) aims to preserve the health of ecosystems and the fisheries they support. Fisheries actions in MPAs are selected from a diverse array of management tools and implemented under the assumption that they are not deleterious and do not impede conservation efforts. However, proper evaluations are needed to assess the effectiveness of management strategies. We analyzed 7 yr changes in the structure of benthic communities in the MPA in Bahia Independencia, one of the most productive coastal regions worldwide and part of the Humboldt Current upwelling system off Peru. Owing to the high productivity and the limited resource use allowed, we predicted that environmental variability rather than small-scale fishing activities would drive community changes. We found a significant unidirectional change in benthic community structure of the Bahia Independencia that was strongly associated with the continuous extraction of a few benthic species, with little influence of environmental factors. We suggest that the fishing of filter feeding bivalves and crabs is linked to the disturbances to macroalgae and associated fauna and probably to the release of top-down effects, which led to similar to 43% reduction in biomass of the whole benthic community. Our findings indicate that establishing MPAs and implementing standard fisheries management strategies in this productive coastal area may not be enough to guarantee the conservation and sustainable use of their resources. Managers should be able to implement site-specific management actions that take into account the full array of interactions between humans, biological communities and particularities of the physical setting.

AB Dasypus kappleri is the largest species of the genus Dasypus and is restricted to the Amazonian rainforest biome. Over the last century, related taxa have been described and synonymized without comprehensive analyses, and the current classification involving two subspecies, Dasypus k. kappleri and Dasypus k. pastasae, has never been revised. The aim of this work is to clarify the taxonomy of Dasypus kappleri through integrative morphological and morphometric analyses. We examined 70 specimens housed in scientific collections as well as photographs of the type specimens of five nominal taxa. Three methodologies (discrete characters, linear and geometric morphometrics) were employed. All results converged on the recognition of three allopatric groups, each with diagnostic qualitative and quantitative traits, that we recognize as full species: Dasypus kappleri Krauss, 1862, occurs in the Guiana shield; Dasypus pastasae (Thomas, 1901) is distributed from the eastern Andes of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela south of the Orinoco River into the western Brazilian Amazon; and Dasypus beniensis Lonnberg, 1942, occurs in the lowlands of Amazonian Brazil and Bolivia to the south of the Madre de Dios, Madeira, and lower Amazon rivers. This revision raises to nine the number of living species of Dasypus.

AB Woody encroachment due to changes in climate or in the disturbance regimes (fire and herbivory) has been observed throughout the savannah biome over the last century with ecological, hydrological and socioeconomic consequences. We assessed changes in tree density and basal area and estimated changes in rain interception by the canopies across a 5-year period over a biomass gradient in Cerrado vegetation protected from fire. We modelled throughfall, stemflow and net rainfall on the basis of tree basal area (TBA). Tree density increased by an average annual rate of 6.7%, basal area at 5.7% and rain interception by the canopies at 0.6% of the gross rainfall. Independent of the vegetation structure, we found a robust relationship of 0.9% less rainfall reaching the ground as TBA increases by 1 m(2) ha(-1). Increases in tree biomass with woody encroachment may potentially result in less water available for uptake by plants and to recharge rivers and groundwater reserves. Given that water is a seasonally scarce resource in all savannahs, woody encroachment may threaten the ecosystem services related to water resources.

AB Ancient tropical grassy biomes are often misrecognized as severely degraded forests. I trace this confusion to several factors, with roots in the nineteenth century, including misinterpretations of the nature of fire in savannahs, attempts to reconcile savannah ecology with Clementsian succession, use of physiognomic (structural) definitions of savannah and development of tropical degradation frameworks focused solely on forests. Towards clarity, I present two models that conceptualize the drivers of ecosystem degradation as operating in both savannahs and forests. These models highlight how human-induced environmental changes create ecosystems with superficially similar physiognomies but radically different conservation values. Given the limitation of physiognomy to differentiate savannahs from severely degraded forests, I present an alternative approach based on floristic composition. Data from eastern lowland Bolivia show that old-growth savannahs can be reliably distinguished by eight grass species and that species identity influences ecosystem flammability. I recommend that scientists incorporate savannahs in tropical degradation frameworks alongside forests, and that savannah be qualified as old-growth savannah in reference to ancient grassy biomes or derived savannah in reference to deforestation. These conceptual advances will require attention not only to tree cover, but also to savannah herbaceous plant species and their ecologies.

Amazon deforestation declined by 70% between 2005 and 2014 due to drops in commodity prices and interventions by federal and state governments, such as law enforcement campaigns and credit restrictions for landowners who deforest illegally. Despite these impressive achievements, Brazil still deforests 5,000 km(2) of Amazonian forests each year. How then will Brazil eliminate Amazon deforestation altogether if the country is only committed to cut illegal deforestation by 2030-as stated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (iNDC) to the 2015 climate change treaty meeting in Paris? Here we provide an analysis of the major socio-economic-political threats that could constrain Brazil from achieving its current goals. We then propose six fundamental strategies to help Brazil achieve a more ambitious goal to eliminate all major legal and illegal Amazon deforestation. These strategies involve bringing social and environmental safeguards to the infrastructure plans in the region, consolidating and expanding positive incentives for the production of sustainable commodities, establishing a new policy to guarantee the social and environmental sustainability of rural settlements, fully implementing the national legislation protecting forests (the Forest Code), protecting the land rights of indigenous people and traditional communities, and expanding the existing network of protected areas, allocating the 80 million hectares of not designated public forests as protected areas or areas for sustainable use of timber and non-timber forest products. The implementation of these strategies however depends on the formulation of a new development paradigm that promotes economic growth, social justice and productive agriculture, while protecting the fundamentally important ecological services of tropical forests.

AB Biodiversity is well studied in ecology and the concept has been developed to include traits of species, rather than solely taxonomy, to better reflect the functional diversity of a system. The deep sea provides a natural environmental gradient within which to study changes in different diversity metrics, but traits of deep-sea fish are not widely known, hampering the application of functional diversity to this globally important system. We used morphological traits to determine the functional richness and functional divergence of demersal fish assemblages along the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at depths of 300-2,000 m. We compared these metrics to size diversity based on individual body size and species richness. Functional richness and size diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest diversity at intermediate depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern, with the highest values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species richness increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were deduced by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses. The patterns in diversity and the variation in certain morphological traits can potentially be explained by changes in the relative dominance of pelagic and benthic feeding guilds. All measures of diversity examined here suggest that the deep areas of the continental slope may be equally or more diverse than assemblages just beyond the continental shelf.

AB We describe the Mesoamerican leaf litter weevil genus Plumolepilius Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new genus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Molytinae: Conotrachelini) (type species P. trifiniensis Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species), species of which inhabit mountain ecosystems from the state of Chiapas in southeastern Mexico to northern Panama. In this paper we describe nine new species from Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador: P. trifiniensis Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (El Salvador and Guatemala); P. branstetteri Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (Guatemala and Mexico); P. longinoi Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (Guatemala and Mexico); P. cortezi Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (Guatemala and Mexico); P. canoi Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (Guatemala); P. schusteri Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (Guatemala and Mexico); P. daryi Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (Guatemala); P. yolnabajensis Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (Guatemala); and P. macalajauensis Barrios-Izas & Anderson, new species (Guatemala).
   The genus and the species are named and described, information on their geographical distributions is given and images of the habitus of both sexes and the aedeagus are presented. A key to the species of Plumolepilius based on males is included.
   The monophyly of Plumolepilius was confirmed by a parsimony analysis of external and male aedeagus morphology and the genus is best characterized by the presence of plumose scales lining the prosternal channel. Phylogenetic analysis supports that Lepilius Champion 1905 is the sister genus of Plumolepilius.

AB Deforestation and changes in land use have reduced the tropical dry forest to isolated forest patches in northwestern Costa Rica. We examined the effect of patch area and length of the dry season on nestedness of the entire avian community, forest fragment assemblages, and species occupancy across fragments for the entire native avifauna, and for a subset of forest dependent species. Species richness was independent of both fragment area and distance between fragments. Similarity in bird community composition between patches was related to habitat structure; fragments with similar forest structure have more similar avian assemblages. Size of forest patches influenced nestedness of the bird community and species occupancy, but not nestedness of assemblages across patches in northwestern Costa Rican avifauna. Forest dependent species (species that require large tracts of mature forest) and assemblages of these species were nested within patches ordered by a gradient of seasonality, and only occupancy of species was nested by area of patches. Thus, forest patches with a shorter dry season include more forest dependent species.

TI Litter Decomposition in a Semiarid Dune Grassland: Neutral Effect of
   Water Supply and Inhibitory Effect of Nitrogen Addition
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

AB Background
   The decomposition of plant material in arid ecosystems is considered to be substantially controlled by water and N availability. The responses of litter decomposition to external N and water, however, remain controversial, and the interactive effects of supplementary N and water also have been largely unexamined.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   A 3.5-year field experiment with supplementary nitrogen and water was conducted to assess the effects of N and water addition on mass loss and nitrogen release in leaves and fine roots of three dominant plant species (i.e., Artemisia halondendron, Setaria viridis, and Phragmites australis) with contrasting substrate chemistry (e.g. N concentration, lignin content in this study) in a desertified dune grassland of Inner Mongolia, China. The treatments included N addition, water addition, combination of N and water, and an untreated control. The decomposition rate in both leaves and roots was related to the initial litter N and lignin concentrations of the three species. However, litter quality did not explain the slower mass loss in roots than in leaves in the present study, and thus warrant further research. Nitrogen addition, either alone or in combination with water, significantly inhibited dry mass loss and N release in the leaves and roots of the three species, whereas water input had little effect on the decomposition of leaf litter and fine roots, suggesting that there was no interactive effect of supplementary N and water on litter decomposition in this system. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate that the inhibitory effects of external N on dry mass loss and nitrogen release are relatively strong in high-lignin litter compared with low-lignin litter.
   Conclusion/Significance
   These findings suggest that increasing precipitation hardly facilitates ecosystem carbon turnover but atmospheric N deposition can enhance carbon sequestration and nitrogen retention in desertified dune grasslands of northern China. Additionally, litter quality of plant species should be considered when modelling the carbon cycle and nutrient dynamics of this system.

AB Negative density dependence may cause reduced clustering among individuals of the same species, and evidence is accumulating that conspecific density-dependent self-thinning is an important mechanism regulating the spatial structure of plant populations. This study evaluates that specific density dependence in three very large observational studies representing three successional stages in a temperate forest in northeastern China. The methods include standard spatial point pattern analysis and a heterogeneous Poisson process as the null model to eliminate the effects of habitat heterogeneity. The results show that most of the species exhibit conspecific density-dependent self-thinning. In the early successional stage 11 of the 16 species, in the intermediate successional stage 18 of the 21 species and in the old growth stage all 21 species exhibited density dependence after removing the effects of habitat heterogeneity. The prevalence of density dependence thus varies among the three successional stages and exhibits an increase with increasing successional stage. The proportion of species showing density dependence varied depending on whether habitat heterogeneity was removed or not. Furthermore, the strength of density dependence is closely related with species abundance. Abundant species with high conspecific aggregation tend to exhibit greater density dependence than rare species.

AB Forest policies have typically relied on prescriptive standards to mitigate various nonpoint negative externalities, whereas more recent approaches have focused on the use of incentive-based policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), to encourage activities associated with positive externalities. We provide a general review on the current state of knowledge concerning prescriptive standards and incentive-based policies in the context of nonpoint and point source externalities that are typical in industrial and nonindustrial forestry. Our specific focus is on reviewing and assessing the current and future applications of performance bonding in forest policy. We argue that bonds can be viewed either as an enforcement mechanism to achieve compliance with standards, or alternatively, as a deposit-refund instrument that imposes a tax on harmful activities while subsidizing beneficial ones in the form of a refund. Four forest policy settings are considered: best management practices (BMP) for protecting the integrity of water resources, reduced impact logging (RIL) standards in industrial concessions, fire-fuel mitigation in wildland-urban interface (WUI), and carbon sequestration in standing forests and soils. Unique challenges that the successful design of performance bonding present are used as motivation for future research.

AB The variation of altitude and proximity to watercourses influence the composition and structure of palm tree assemblages in Northern Amazon. This study aimed to understand the effects of these environmental gradients in floristic composition and structure of palm trees in the municipalities of Sao Joao da Baliza (A1) and Caroebe (A2) in Roraima. We measured the palm trees with aerial stem of breast height diameter of 1.30 m (DBH) > 2 cm in 10 samples of 20 x 50 m. Were sampled 168 individuals, distributed in seven genera and ten species. In A1 (altitude = 141.0 +/- 12.8 m; proximity of water = 3.2 +/- 0.1 km), Astrocaryum gynacanthum and Euterpe precatoria had the highest importance value (VI). In A2 (altitude = 181.2 +/- 4.3 m; proximity of water = 0.5 +/- 0.1 km) Oenocarbus bataua and Euterpe precatoria were higher (VI). Two floristic groups of palm trees separating the sampled areas (around 63%) related mainly to the effect of the proximity of water. Understanding the effects of environmental gradients in the composition and structure of the assemblages of palms helps in assessing the potential of extractive management of non- timber forest products in the Amazon.

AB The Amazonian region of Ecuador shared with the rest of Amazonia a complex network of cultures and civilizations, which were drastically reduced or became extinct after the colonialist policies that were promoted from Europe and later by the new republics. Since then, the colonialist processes have been based on economic and developmental policies that are incompatible with the culture, ways of life, and ecology of the region, and have unleashed a dramatic series of social consequences that represent obstacles for the healthy development of its inhabitants. As a territory that has been exploited for its natural resources, chaotically occupied by the human population, with inefficient systems of production and ecological vulnerability, we believe that the concept of internal colony should remain a current issue. The concept of internal colony should be present in the search for solutions to the problems confronting the region.

AB Two dry forests of southwestern Ecuador separated 43 km from each other, one situated at 460 m above sea level and the other at 680 m, are surveyed for ants giving a total of 28 species collected manually and from pitfall traps. Eleven species are shared between the sites whilst four are exclusive to one site and 13 to the other. Differences in humidity, rainfall seasonality, and disturbance regimes may account for at least part of the differences observed between the ant communities of the two sites. Dorymyrmex pyramicus peruvianum Wheeler, 1919 and Pseudomyrmex kuenckeli (Emery, 1890) are reported from Ecuador for the first time. Cardiocondyla emeryi Forel, 1881 and Camponotus conspicuus zonatus Emery, 1894 are reported from mainland Ecuador for the first time. The genus Dorymyrmex Mayr, 1866 is recorded from Ecuador for the first time.

AB The lack of effective biodiversity baselines is a major impairment to implement conservation plans. Hence, constructing and updating species lists provides vital information about species distribution records. The Sustainable Amazon Network (in Portuguese Rede Amazonia Sustentavel; RAS) is an interdisciplinary research initiative that aims to evaluate land-cover changes effects in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. Within the scope of this project, we sampled ants and orchid bees and herein present a list of species collected in Paragominas, PA, Brazil; the most complete lists of species published to date of these groups for the eastern Amazon. We sampled these insects across several land-cover types, from undisturbed forested habitats, through varyingly disturbed forested habitats and secondary forests to production areas (silviculture, pastures and arable fields). In total we recorded 285 species of ants and 36 species of orchid bees. Species richness was higher in primary forests for both groups, followed by production areas. Orchid bees reached their highest richness in secondary forests. For orchid bees, production areas were dominated by a few hyper-dominant species, such as Eulaema nigrita. For future assessments if the aim is to make a complete inventory, we recommend the use of additional sampling methods. Finally, we expect this study can be used as a baseline for understanding the effectiveness of ongoing changes in forest conservation and land management practices and in determining conservation status for several taxa described here.

AB Human activities have modified landscapes worldwide, promoting fragmentation and isolation of forest habitats. Such landscape modifications are responsible for changes in species composition due to extinction and colonization events. Forest species dynamism is usually affected by forest fragmentation when remaining fragments are small and isolated, but forest dynamism is usually more stable when forest fragments are large and connected. In this study we verified changes in bird composition during 23 years of bird monitoring at the Mata dos Godoy State Park (PEMG). We aimed to evaluate the avian community dynamism of this reserve, as well as its effectiveness in protecting biodiversity in an extremely fragmented landscape. We reviewed historical records of bird species composition and checked for any possible misidentifications, updated the list and created an annual data set of bird species occurrence. We used this list to evaluate species persistence, species loss, and colonization over the study period. Additionally, species were classified according to their guilds in order to determine which species traits were associated with local extinction. A total of 331 bird species were recorded in PEMG over 23 years of monitoring, 17 of which were considered locally extinct or possibly extinct, and 11 were recent local colonizations. This indicates that bird composition in PEMG has been relatively stable over the years. However, local extinction was more likely for large frugivores and insectivores, which are guilds already known to be more susceptible to local extinction. Colonizations, in turn, were associated with guilds of more open habitats, like edge insectivores. We suggest that extinctions and colonizations are also potentially related to species distribution ranges and climate change. Although local extinctions occurred, PEMG still maintains a significant fraction of its historical avifauna and may potentially maintain source populations for many bird species, thus making it an important reserve for the north of Parana.

AB The factors that affect the home range size of domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) in a semi-domesticated condition (i.e., cats that receive shelter and food from humans but are free to move in the wider natural environment) is not completely understood. Here, using radio telemetry, we present the first assessment of the home range size and activity patterns of male domestic cats living in the insular environment of Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and examine the extent to which these were influenced by the presence ('resident males with females': RMF group) or absence ('single males': SM group) of females in the residences of their owners. Daily and seasonal activity patterns have also been characterized. Home ranges of the RMF were markedly smaller than that of the SM and exhibited less overlap with the home ranges of other males than did those of the SM. Male cats were most active at twilight and evening (44.68 +/- 1.07) and least active in the afternoon (28.76 +/- 2.79). RMF presented nocturnal activity greater than SM, especially in the dry season. Our data indicate that presence of females is an important factor in shaping these parameters of domestic male cats.

AB Niche differentiation among tropical forest plants can generate species turnover along gradients of soil, topography, climate, and land use history. In this study we explore the relative importance of these variables as drivers of floristic composition in Cueva de Los Guacharos National Park. We established twenty 0.1-ha plots, within which trees, lianas, and shrubs (diameter >= 2.5 cm) were censused. We selected plot locations in primary and disturbed forests, and we measured topography and soil variables. Despite their structural similarity, primary and disturbed forests differed floristically, and also differed in environmental variables measured. A NMDS ordination showed that variation in the floristic composition across plots is highly correlated to the exchangeable acidity, elevation, temperature, and magnesium availability. Variance partitioning analysis shows that together spatial and environmental variables explain 24.2 percent of the variation in species composition. 'Pure environmental' variables were more important in explaining compositional variability than 'pure spatial' processes (9.8% and 1.4%, respectively). Residual variance may be attributed to stochastic process or non-measured biotic effects.

AB Empirical and theoretical work has suggested that plants can change their compensatory responses to herbivory as they develop. However, such a relationship is likely to be more complex than previously thought since the amount and type of damage a plant receives can also change as the plant develops. Here, we determined the survival, growth, and reproductive output of plants (Actinocephalus polyanthus) from different ontogenetic stages that received variable levels of natural or simulated herbivore damage. Juvenile plants and nonreproductive adults in which leaves were damaged showed full vegetative compensation, whereas pre-reproductive plants were not able to replace the lost leaves. However, these same pre-reproductive plants produced more inflorescences and thus more seeds and seedlings than control plants. In contrast, damage to vegetative and/or reproductive structures during the reproductive phase resulted in a negative effect on seed and seedling production. Herbivory effects on plant survival, growth, and reproduction during the vegetative and pre-reproductive phases were independent of the amount of damage. However, during reproduction, the magnitude of these effects was strongly influenced by the amount of damage and the reproductive stage of the plant at the time of the damage. In short, our results demonstrate that the survival, growth, and reproductive responses to herbivory of A. polyanthus can be dependent on the timing and/or intensity of damage. The reproductive response of A. polyanthus to our simulated herbivory treatments during the pre-reproductive phase represents an example of overcompensation. Furthermore, it indicates that vegetative regrowth is not necessarily a driving factor for tolerance.

AB The long-standing paradigm that pollination systems adapted to hovering birds evolved only in the New World was recently challenged by the discovery of hovering pollination by Old World specialized passerine pollinators. This raises the possibility that hovering pollination may evolve more easily than previously believed, given sufficient selective pressure on plant traits, on nectarivory, or both. We observed foraging behavior by the sunbird Cyanomitra oritis at flowers of the native Old World plant Impatiens sakeriana. We measured the length of pedicels and peduncles (PedPed length), which can make the flowers difficult to reach while the bird perches on the stem, and determined if it influenced sunbird hovering or perching at a flower. Detailed analyses of video recordings showed that sunbirds only hovered at flowers with a long PedPed, whereas they employed both foraging modes when an adequate perch was available. A hovering sunbird could deplete nectar in a shorter time than a perching one. The frequency of visits was not greater at flowers with longer PedPed or with more open I. sakeriana flowers in the vicinity. Our study provides evidence that sunbird behavior does not follow simple energetic models, and that some sunbird pollination systems in the Old World resemble highly specialized hummingbird systems in the New World much more than expected, especially the overall adaptation of the system to bird hovering.

TI Novel Covariance-Based Neutrality Test of Time-Series Data Reveals
   Asymmetries in Ecological and Economic Systems
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HYPOTHESIS; EVOLUTION
AB Systems as diverse as the interacting species in a community, alleles at a genetic locus, and companies in a market are characterized by competition (over resources, space, capital, etc) and adaptation. Neutral theory, built around the hypothesis that individual performance is independent of group membership, has found utility across the disciplines of ecology, population genetics, and economics, both because of the success of the neutral hypothesis in predicting system properties and because deviations from these predictions provide information about the underlying dynamics. However, most tests of neutrality are weak, based on static system properties such as species-abundance distributions or the number of singletons in a sample. Time-series data provide a window onto a system's dynamics, and should furnish tests of the neutral hypothesis that are more powerful to detect deviations from neutrality and more informative about to the type of competitive asymmetry that drives the deviation. Here, we present a neutrality test for time-series data. We apply this test to several microbial time-series and financial time-series and find that most of these systems are not neutral. Our test isolates the covariance structure of neutral competition, thus facilitating further exploration of the nature of asymmetry in the covariance structure of competitive systems. Much like neutrality tests from population genetics that use relative abundance distributions have enabled researchers to scan entire genomes for genes under selection, we anticipate our time-series test will be useful for quick significance tests of neutrality across a range of ecological, economic, and sociological systems for which time-series data are available. Future work can use our test to categorize and compare the dynamic fingerprints of particular competitive asymmetries (frequency dependence, volatility smiles, etc) to improve forecasting and management of complex adaptive systems.

AB The alpha and beta diversity (dissimilarity) of Melolonthinae, Rutelinae, and Dynastinae beetles recorded from 8 studies of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt was assessed. Two measures of alpha diversity: the number of species and the taxonomic diversity were used. As expected, taxonomic diversity and species richness have different trends. The community with the highest species richness (Popocatepetl), had low taxonomic diversity, while in communities with relatively low richness (Huehuetitla, Zapata, La Malinche, Iztaccihuatl and Pico de Orizaba), taxonomic diversity had low and high values. Beta diversity was also assessed with 2 measures: species dissimilarity and taxonomic dissimilarity. Species dissimilarity ranged from 61% to 94%, while the taxonomic dissimilarity was between 29% and 68%. As expected, there is a significant relationship between species and taxonomic dissimilarity, and no correlations between dissimilarity and the geographic distance between localities were found. This study highlights the importance of using complementary diversity metrics that take into account evolutionary information of ecological communities, mainly in regions with a complex biogeographical history.

AB A negative relationship between stand biomass and the density of stems is expected to develop during the self-thinning process in resource-limited forests; this leads to a large proportion of the total biomass occurring in large trees. Nevertheless, frequent disturbance regimes can reduce self-thinning and the accumulation of large trees. We investigated size-density relationships and the contribution of large trees (dbh70cm) to stand biomass in 55 1-ha plots along a 600km transect in central-southern Amazonia. The effects of natural-disturbance gradients (frequency of storms and soil characteristics) and seasonality on forest-structure components (density of stems and mean individual mass) and stand biomass were examined. Contrary to self-thinning predictions, stand biomass increased in forests with higher stem densities. Large trees contained only an average of 5% of stand biomass, and half of the stand biomass was represented by small trees with diameters <27cm. These findings indicate that persistent or strong disturbance plays a critical role in forest structure and biomass in the central-southern Amazon. Frequent storms were identified as an important source of disturbance in the region. Forests under higher frequency of storms had trees with lower individual mass and higher stem packing. More physically restrictive soils seem to magnify the effects of exogenous disturbances limiting individual tree size. Forests in areas with longer dry seasons had lower stem densities; however, individual mass was higher in these areas. These structural components of biomass seem to counterbalance each other in generating total stand biomass. Seasonality affected forest structural components but not stand biomass.Synthesis. Forests of central-southern Amazonia are not resource limited and accumulate most part of their biomass in small- to mid-sized trees. The effects of environmental gradients on specific structural components of stand biomass differ such that strong positive effects on one component can mitigate strong negative effects on other component. Future work on the determinants of stand biomass should investigate forest structure and the contributions of individual components to stand biomass.

AB In the current scenario of human transformation of natural landscapes, fragmentation and habitat loss is considered one of the major threats to biodiversity. The characteristics of altered landscapes and remaining habitat patches influence the persistence of species and, as a direct consequence, the functioning of ecological processes. The main focus of studies at landscape scale is to understand how human modifications in natural areas lead to changes in abundance and richness of species. However, such approaches do not directly describe the functional composition of communities, nor do they describe the functional responses to fragmentation and habitat loss. Birds are an interesting taxonomic group to explore this theme, since they present important, broadly-described ecological functions for human modified habitats (e.g., seed dispersal, pollination, and insect pest control). Thus, we aimed to explore the functional responses of birds to landscape characteristics. We selected 14 human modified landscapes of Atlantic forest, found within a radius of 30 km of Alfenas, Brazil. Each landscape was characterized by metrics describing landscape configuration and composition, such as forest percentage and mean connectivity. Birds were sampled in the central patches of the landscapes and classified into 15 functional groups, based on species' traits. We constructed Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and used Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to identify the best models that explained the abundance and richness of species in each functional group. Few groups had high functional redundancy, showing the fragility of the majority of functional groups in the current modified landscapes. Forest dependent functional groups were favored by connected landscapes, higher percentage of forest cover, and high percentages of coffee matrix. On the other hand, forest independent groups were favored by irregular habitat areas and negatively impacted by forest cover and sugar cane matrices. Consistent management of altered landscapes, based on functional responses, can assist the recovery and maintenance of natural areas. We highlight the complexity involved in landscape management, considering it requires simultaneous work on composition and configuration.

AB Individual tree and stand basal area growth were studied in a thinning experiment established over two sites in subtropical eastern Australia. The experiment compared the less shade tolerant species Eucalyptus dunnii with the more shade tolerant Corymbia citriodora var. variegata, both grown in plantation monoculture. Growth was compared over a 21/2-3 year period that immediately followed thinning at 51/2-71/2years of age. Towards the end of the growth period, tree crown depths and leaf mass per unit area were measured at one site. Crown depth and leaf mass per area of C. citriodora were greater than of E. dunnii, characteristics consistent with a more shade tolerant species. Gross stand basal area growth of E. dunnii was faster than that of C. citriodora. Individual-tree basal area growth behaviour was consistent with inter-tree competition involving asymmetric competition for light. Opening the stand by thinning reduced inter-tree competition to near zero. In unthinned control stands, smaller, more shaded trees of C. citriodora were better able to retain their basal area growth rates than those of E. dunnii in the face of competition. In consequence, the more shade tolerant C. citriodora developed a more evenly spread frequency distribution of tree diameters than less shade tolerant E. dunnii. This would have consequences for the assortment of log sizes that would be available ultimately from monocultures of the two species.

AB Understanding the mechanisms of secondary succession related to forest management practices is receiving increasing attention in community ecology and biodiversity conservation. Abiotic and biotic filtering are deterministic processes driving community reassembly. A functional trait or phylogeny-based approach predicts that environmental filtering induced by clearcut-logging results in functional/phylogenetic clustering in younger forests, while biotic filtering (competitive exclusion) promotes functional/phylogenetic overdispersion in old-growth forests. From this perspective, we examined the patterns of functional/phylogenetic structures using tree community data (147 species x 170 plots). These data were chronosequenced from clearcut secondary forests to old-growth subtropical forests in the Ryukyu Archipelago, with species' trait data (leaf and stem) and species level phylogeny. To detect clustering or overdispersion in the functional and phylogenetic structures, we calculated the standardized effect size of mean nearest trait distance and mean nearest phylogenetic distance within the plots. Functional or phylogenetic clustering was relatively weak in secondary forests, and their directional change with increasing forest age was not generally detected. Mean nearest trait/phylogenetic distance for most plots fell within the range of random expectation. The results suggest that abiotic/biotic filtering related to functional traits or phylogenetic relatedness plays a diminished role in shaping species assembly during secondary succession in the subtropical forest. Our findings of functional and phylogenetic properties might shed light on the importance of dispersal (stochastic) processes in the regional species pool during community reassembly after anthropogenic disturbance. It will also contribute to the development of coordinated schemes that maintain potential species assembly processes in the subtropical forest.

AB Knowledge about growth rhythm and longevity of tropical trees is essential to understand life strategies of native species, and consequently, of forest remnants. This study aims to investigate the growth dynamics of Centrolobium robustum, a representative species from Atlantic Forest. For this purpose, radial growth was examined through tree rings and cambium analysis, from macroscopical, anatomical, and ultrastructural perspectives. The apical and radial stem growth was evaluated through leaf and cambium phenology, respectively. Leaf and cambium behaviors were associated with environmental seasonality. The results showed that the period of cell production and cambial development occurred in association with leaf expansion and during the wet, warm, and long-day season. Seasonality of cambial and leaf phenology in response to the environment determined the annual formation of tree rings, and it allowed to evaluate C. robustum growth rates and longevity. Species seasonality also responded to abnormal climatic events during the study period, which shows its sensitivity to environmental changes and represents a factor to be considered in the forest management programs.

   SPECIATION; METACOMMUNITY; COEXISTENCE; MONOPOLIZATION; BIODIVERSITY
AB Both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to describe how natural communities become assembled at both regional and biogeographical scales. Yet, these theories have largely been developed in isolation. Here, we unite these separate views and develop an integrated eco-evolutionary framework of community assembly. We use a simulation approach to explore the factors determining the interplay between ecological and evolutionary mechanisms systematically across spatial scales. Our results suggest that the same set of ecological and evolutionary processes can determine community assembly at both regional and biogeographical scales. We find that the importance of evolution and community monopolization effects, defined as the eco-evolutionary dynamics that occur when local adaptation of early established immigrants is fast enough to prevent the later immigration of better pre-adapted species, are not restricted to adaptive radiations on remote islands. They occur at dispersal rates of up to ten individuals per generation, typical for many species at the scale of regional metacommunities. Dispersal capacity largely determines whether ecological species sorting or evolutionary monopolization structure metacommunity diversity and distribution patterns. However, other factors related to the spatial scale at which community assembly processes are acting, such as metacommunity size and the proportion of empty patches, also affect the relative importance of ecology versus evolution. We show that evolution often determines community assembly, and this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions about spatial scale, mode of reproduction, and environmental structure. Moreover, we found that community monopolization effects occur even though species fully pre-adapted to each habitat are abundant in the metacommunity, a scenario expected a priori to prevent any meaningful effect of evolution. Our results strongly support the idea that the same eco-evolutionary processes underlie community assembly at regional and biogeographical scales.

AB Messor barbarus (LINNAEUS, 1767) ants are Mediterranean region seed predators. However, transported seeds can be found rejected in refuse piles around their nests, making this ant a seed dispersal agent. This raises the following quesdons: Do refuse piles affect seed distribution? Do their small-scale seed composition, richness, and density in autumn and winter differ from those of areas without refuse piles? Are there differences in the vegetation found the following spring in refuse piles that have survived the winter or on sites where they have been destroyed, compared with control areas without refuse piles? In a Mediterranean steppe, we measured autumn and winter seed banks in a greenhouse, both in refuse piles and in controls. The following spring, in situ seedlings from refuse piles, from refuse piles artificially destroyed (sieved) in winter, and from controls without refuse piles were recorded. Seedling species richness and density were significantly higher in autumn in refuse piles than in controls. Nevertheless, no increased seedling contribution from the transient seed bank was detected in the winter refuse piles. The following spring, natural persistent refuse piles showed no seedlings. However, seedling species richness and density were significantly higher in places where refuse piles had been sieved before in winter. The construction of refuse piles by M. barbarus locally concentrates seed density and seed species richness; for the first time, a positive impact on seedlings is observed in places where refuse piles were sieved before winter and the potential bias of this methodology must be now compared with actions of natural agents (surface runoff) that destroyed refuse piles in winter.

AB When specialists and generalists compete for a limited resource, specialists are more constrained because they are less likely to find an alternative resource. In parasitoids with overlapping host ranges, asymmetric competition should therefore exist where specialists are more likely to win the host in a contest. Competition between parasitoids has been studied mostly in hymenopterans. In hymenopteran parasitoid wasps, females must reach the host to lay their eggs and can thus strongly influence the outcome of competition between future offspring by killing eggs or larvae of competitors. We studied competition between the free-ranging larvae of two sympatric coleopteran parasitoid rove beetles (one specialist, Aleochara bilineata and a generalist, Aleochara bipustulata) with overlapping host ranges competing in agricultural fields for pupae of the cabbage root fly. In these species, females lay their eggs in the soil, then first instars find the host where they will develop as solitary parasitoids and deal with potential competitors. Because adult longevity and fecundity favour the generalist, we postulated that first instars of the specialist would be superior larval competitors. Accordingly, we studied the outcome of encounters between first instars of the two species provided with a single host. Irrespective of its release prior to or simultaneously with its generalist competitor, the larva of the specialist most often won. Moreover, specialist larvae still won half of the encounters when generalist larvae were given a 24-h advantage. This might explain the coexistence of the two species in the field.

AB The determination of favorable light habitat conditions per species and life stage is transcendental, for both ex situ and in situ conservation strategies of endangered forest tree species, and for their utilization as plantation trees. This becomes especially important when planting material is scarce. We studied the multivariate responses in biomass allocation and in gas exchange to light and to CO2 in Cedrela salvadorensis seedlings, grown under similar light conditions as those this species faces in nature. During a period of 135 days, groups of ten seedlings were put under 75, 45, 15 and 3.5 % of full sun exposure obtained with neutral shade cloth, under nursery conditions. A series of biomass allocation variables and detailed gas exchange parameters (photosynthesis response curves to light and to internal carbon concentration) were measured at the end of the growth period in plants of the four treatments. According to the principal component analyses, highest values of gas exchange response were associated with the lower values of biomass allocation traits. These changes can be associated with resource-conservative and resource-acquisitive strategies, where the C. salvadorensis seedlings acclimatize their traits for the exploration and exploitation of light, to high or to dim light environment, respectively. The multivariate analyses also showed that the plants had a high performance at 45 % of light environments. These results suggest that 45 % of light environment was the optimal light habitat of this species at the tested developing stage. Our results have important implications to choose the best natural habitat for a successful establishment of C. salvadorensis. We propose practical considerations for programs of reforestation or reintroduction where this species be involved.

AB Interspecific interactions are considered to be important structuring forces in early successional vegetation. Whereas competition seems to prevail in less severe environments, facilitation tends to increase in importance in harsh environments. Hence, facilitation is expected to play an important role in degraded tropical areas with high irradiance, heat loads, and evapotranspiration, where conditions are far from optimum for most forest species. We planned a restoration project on the southeastern Brazilian coastal plain to compare growth and survival of tree seedlings planted at two densities (isolated or aggregated) in a factorial experiment with nutrient addition, We monitored survival, height, ground level diameter, and crown projection of 4132 saplings from 19 species that ranged along a successional gradient, over an 18-month period. We used mixed-effect models to analyze the relationship between species performance and treatments, and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to select the models, The best, model showed higher survival in aggregated plantations (indicating facilitation) for non-pioneer (slower growing) species, In contrast, we found lower diameter growth in aggregated plantation (indicating competition), Fertilizer addition did not affect survival in clusters, but, surprisingly, it had a negative effect on isolated plants of both pioneer and non-pioneer species. Fertilizer addition had a positive effect on diameter and crown projection growth in aggregated plantations (reducing competition), especially for pioneer species. Thus, whether facilitation or competition was the predominant interaction depended on the effect analyzed. As establishment of non-pioneer species in disturbed sites can be challenging, restoration designs could take advantage of higher survival rates in clusters and use resource addition to ameliorate growth and decrease competition for limited resources.

AB Resistance and tolerance are two ways that plants cope with herbivory. Tolerance, the ability of a plant to regrow or reproduce after being consumed, has been studied less than resistance, but this trait varies widely among species and has considerable potential to affect the ecology of plant species. One particular aspect of tolerance, compensatory responses, can evolve rapidly in plant species; providing insight into interactions between consumers and plants. However, compensation by invasive species has rarely been explored. We compared compensatory responses to the effects of simulated herbivory expressed by plants from seven Solidago gigantea populations from the native North American range to that expressed by plants from nine populations from the nonnative European range. Populations were also collected along elevational gradients to compare ecotypic variation within and between ranges. Solidago plants from the nonnative range of Europe were more tolerant to herbivory than plants from the native range of North America. Furthermore, plants from European populations increased in total biomass and growth rate with elevation, but decreased in compensatory response. There were no relationships between elevation and growth or compensation for North American populations. Our results suggest that Solidago gigantea may have evolved to better compensate for herbivory damage in Europe, perhaps in response to a shift to greater proportion of attack from generalists. Our results also suggest a possible trade-off between rapid growth and compensation to damage in European populations but not in North American populations.

AB Understanding processes that promote species coexistence is integral to diversity maintenance. In hyperdiverse tropical forests, local conspecific density (LCD) and light are influential to woody seedling recruitment and soil nutrients are often limiting, yet the simultaneous effects of these factors on seedling survival across time remain unknown. We fit species-and age-specific models to census and resource data of seedlings of 68 woody species from a Costa Rican wet tropical forest. In decreasing order of prevalence, seedling survivorship was related to LCD, soil base cations, irradiance, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Species-specific responses to factors did not covary, providing evidence that species life history strategies have not converged to one continuum of high-surviving stress tolerant to low-surviving stress intolerant species. Survival responses to all factors varied over the average seedling's lifetime, indicating seedling requirements change with age and conclusions drawn about processes important to species coexistence depend on temporal resolution.

AB Multiple niche-based processes including conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) determine plant regeneration and community structure. We ask how interspecific and intraspecific density-dependent interactions relate to plant life histories and associated functional traits. Using hierarchical models, we analysed how such interactions affected first-year survival of seedling recruits of 175 species in a tropical forest, and how species abundances and functional traits are related to interspecific variation in density-dependent effects. Conspecific seedling neighbour effects prevailed over the effects of larger conspecific and all heterospecific neighbours. Tolerance of seedling CNDD enhanced recruit survival and subsequent abundance, all of which were greater among larger seeded, slow-growing and well-defended species. Niche differentiation along the growth-survival trade-off and tolerance of seedling CNDD strongly correlated with regeneration success, with manifest consequences for community structure. The ability of larger seeded species to better tolerate CNDD suggests a novel mechanism for CNDD to contribute to seed-size variation and promote species coexistence through a tolerance-fecundity trade-off.

AB 1. This study focuses on the importance in hyperdiverse regions, such as the Amazonian forest, of accelerating and optimising the census of invertebrate communities.
   2. We carried out low-intensity sampling of tropical moth (Lepidoptera) assemblages in disturbed forest fragments in Brazil.
   3. We combined DNA barcoding and taxonomists' expertise to produce fast and accurate surveys of local diversity, including the recognition and census of undescribed and endemic species.
   4. Integrating expert knowledge of species distributions, we show that despite limited sampling effort, our approach revealed an unexpectedly high number of new and endemic species in severely threatened tropical forest fragments.
   5. These results highlight the risk of silent centinelan extinctions and emphasise the urgent need for accelerated invertebrate surveys in high-endemism and human-impacted tropical forests.

Cytochrome b and IRBP DNA data were used for elucidating the phylogenetic relationships of Cerradomys and estimating the time of divergence of different evolutionary lineages, while morphometric analyses were carried out for analyzing the rate of phenotypic evolution. Our findings showed that the first speciation events occurred in the Pliocene and early Pleistocene, leading to the C. marinhus, C. maracajuensis, and C. scotti distributed in central and western Brazil while species from eastern Brazil (C. langguthi, C. vivoi, C. subflavus, and C. goytaca) originated in the middle to late Pleistocene. Cerradomys goytaca populations diverged from inland C. subflavus ca. 0.29 MYBP with an accelerated rate of phenotypic evolution resulting in unique craniometric attributes, likely due to the strong selective pressures imposed by harsh habitats.

AB Biomass allocation can exert a great influence on plant resource acquisition and nutrient use. However, the role of biomass allocation strategies in shaping plant community composition under nutrient limitations remains poorly addressed. We hypothesized that species-specific allocation strategies can affect plant adaptation to nutrient limitations, resulting in species turnover and changes in community-level biomass allocations across nutrient gradients. In this study, we measured species abundance and the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in leaves and soil nutrients in an arid-hot grassland. We quantified species-specific allocation parameters for stems vs leaves based on allometric scaling relationships. Species-specific stem vs leaf allocation parameters were weighted with species abundances to calculate the community-weighted means driven by species turnover. We found that the community-weighted means of biomass allocation parameters were significantly related to the soil nutrient gradient as well as to leaf stoichiometry, indicating that species-specific allocation strategies can affect plant adaptation to nutrient limitations in the studied grassland. Species that allocate less to stems than leaves tend to dominate nutrient-limited environments. The results support the hypothesis that species-specific allocations affect plant adaptation to nutrient limitations. The allocation trade-off between stems and leaves has the potential to greatly affect plant distribution across nutrient gradients.

AB Global change will likely affect savanna and forest structure and distributions, with implications for diversity within both biomes. Few studies have examined the impacts of both expected precipitation and land use changes on vegetation structure in the future, despite their likely severity. Here, we modeled tree cover in sub-Saharan Africa, as a proxy for vegetation structure and land cover change, using climatic, edaphic, and anthropic data (R-2=0.97). Projected tree cover for the year 2070, simulated using scenarios that include climate and land use projections, generally decreased, both in forest and savanna, although the directionality of changes varied locally. The main driver of tree cover changes was land use change; the effects of precipitation change were minor by comparison. Interestingly, carbon emissions mitigation via increasing biofuels production resulted in decreases in tree cover, more severe than scenarios with more intense precipitation change, especially within savannas. Evaluation of tree cover change against protected area extent at the WWF Ecoregion scale suggested areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem services concern. Those forests most vulnerable to large decreases in tree cover were also highly protected, potentially buffering the effects of global change. Meanwhile, savannas, especially where they immediately bordered forests (e.g. West and Central Africa), were characterized by a dearth of protected areas, making them highly vulnerable. Savanna must become an explicit policy priority in the face of climate and land use change if conservation and livelihoods are to remain viable into the next century.

AB The neutral theory of biodiversity assumes that coexisting organisms are equally able to survive, reproduce, and disperse (ecological equivalence), but predicts that stochastic fluctuations of these abilities drive diversity dynamics. It predicts remarkably well many biodiversity patterns, although substantial evidence for the role of niche variation across organisms seems contradictory. Here, we discuss this apparent paradox by exploring the meaning and implications of ecological equivalence.
   We address the question whether neutral theory provides an explanation for biodiversity patterns and acknowledges causal processes. We underline that ecological equivalence, although central to neutral theory, can emerge at local and regional scales from niche-based processes through equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms. Such emerging equivalence corresponds to a weak conception of neutral theory, as opposed to the assumption of strict equivalence at the individual level in strong conception. We show that this duality is related to diverging views on hypothesis testing and modeling in ecology. In addition, the stochastic dynamics exposed in neutral theory are pervasive in ecological systems and, rather than a null hypothesis, ecological equivalence is best understood as a parsimonious baseline to address biodiversity dynamics at multiple scales.

AB The gray wolf (Canis lupus) is a source of concern and a cause of damage to people's livelihoods. In Finland, as in most countries, actual damages are compensated according to the real lost value. However, often, the suffered damages are larger than what is compensated, and worries and fears are not accounted for at all. The purpose of our transdisciplinary action research is to contribute to the process of modifying the scientific, administrative, and everyday habits of mind in order to meet the practical prerequisites of living with the wolf. In 2014, we planned and participated in a process designed to update Finland's wolf population management plan. During our study, we applied e-deliberation, conducted a national wolf survey, and organized solution-oriented workshops in wolf territory areas around Finland. By applying abductive reasoning, we illustrate the basic features of an economic scheme that would help finance and coordinate practical modifications to the ecological, economic, and institutional circumstances and settings in wolf territory areas. The potential economic instrument is based on payments for improved ecostructures. In our paper, we describe the organization, functioning, and financing of this instrument in detail.

AB The mixed-broadleaved Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.) forest (MBKPF) is a zonal climax ranging from Northeast China to the Far East region of Russia. However, since the 1950s, most of the MBKPFs in Northeast China have become the mixed broadleaved secondary forests due to the heavy forest exploitation by timber harvesting. The natural regeneration of Korean pine is generally poor because of the light limitation in Northeast China. This study was conducted to understand how Korean pine seedlings adapt to different canopy openness (CO) and what would be the minimum CO for its establishment and growth in the natural forest stands. In order to test the hypothesis that Korean pine seedlings have acclimated to low light regimes, the responses of photosynthetic, morphological and growth parameters to light environments were examined in Korean pine seedlings that were field-grown in secondary forests. The results can provide the references for the restoration of MBKPFs in Northeast China. Three-year-old Korean pine seedlings were under-planted in secondary forest stands with three levels of CO at 30%, 15% and 7%, which were created by modifying the branches of the secondary forest stands. After one year of acclimation under the secondary forest stands, the variations in the physiological and morphological characteristics of the needles as well as the growth parameters were measured. The maximum net photosynthesis (A(max)), dark respiration (R-d), needle chlorophyll (Chl) contents and total needle nitrogen (N) contents all responded positively to the increased CO. The total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC), A(max),R-d, and N contents in the 7% stand were significantly lower than those in the 15% and 30% stands (p < 0.05). The capture efficiency of excitation energy by open Photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres (F-v'/F-m') in the 7% stand was the lowest and was significantly different from those in the 15% and 30% stands (p < 0.05), although no significant differences were found between 15% and 30% CO (p > 0.05). These results indicated that 7% CO seedlings were experiencing some degree of low light stress. The leaf mass area (LMA) and height growth decreased as the CO decreased from 30% to 15% to 7%, while the lateral shoot growth increased. Therefore, needle morphology, tree height and crown growth of Korean pine seedlings displayed a large plasticity in response to variations in light intensities. These findings suggest that Korean pine seedlings can strongly acclimate in the forest canopy by adjusting physiological traits that are associated with light energy distribution in the PSII and by adjusting the morphological features of their needles. These results suggest that the minimum canopy openness required for the survival of P. koraiensis seedlings (4 years old) grown under a canopy should be more than 7%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present a historical overview of forest concepts and definitions, linking these changes with distinct perspectives and management objectives. Policies dealing with a broad range of forest issues are often based on definitions created for the purpose of assessing global forest stocks, which do not distinguish between natural and planted forests or reforests, and which have not proved useful in assessing national and global rates of forest regrowth and restoration. Implementing and monitoring forest and landscape restoration requires additional approaches to defining and assessing forests that reveal the qualities and trajectories of forest patches in a spatially and temporally dynamic landscape matrix. New technologies and participatory assessment of forest states and trajectories offer the potential to operationalize such definitions. Purpose-built and contextualized definitions are needed to support policies that successfully protect, sustain, and regrow forests at national and global scales. We provide a framework to illustrate how different management objectives drive the relative importance of different aspects of forest state, dynamics, and landscape context.

AB How climate change interacts upon human activities necessary for meeting the needs of a society is important to understand. Mining is such an activity, as it provides the fundamental raw materials required in everyday life. However, mining is potentially extremely vulnerable to climate change. This is because of the exacerbation of interactions already occurring to the local environment-human system, as well as the development of new interactions and their subsequent impacts. Within the literature, there has been no generic review or synthesis of the fundamental interactions between climate change and surface mining. This paper intends to undertake such a review and synthesis of the literature. The paper discusses the potential and actual interactions between climate change and surface mining in relation to five core themes: Heavy Metals; Hydrological Processes & Resources; Ecological Impacts; Air Pollution; and Mass Movement. This is based upon an extensive and focussed review of the current and available literature. The paper then concludes with a discussion of open themes and future research concerning climate change and surface mining in relation to three fundamental spatial dynamic questions.

AB Based on the inventory of 67 fengshui woods, we first decomposed the beta diversity of these communities into nestedness and spatial turnover; then we quantified the relative contribution of abiotic factors to the variation of species composition using variation partitioning method at the meta-community scale. We found that the species composition was heterogeneous with high beta diversity and characterized by obvious spatial turnover pattern. Abiotic variables explained only a little variation of species composition; instead, undefined environmental variables and stochastic processes were the main factors driving species assemblage of fengshui woods in this study. For the sustainability of fengshui woods, management and conservation efforts should be devoted to a large range of fengshui communities instead of only focusing on several ones. Furthermore, linking the conservation of traditional culture and nature is likely to be more effective in managing and conserving fengshui woods than ignoring traditional beliefs, values and institutions.

AB The future of biodiversity in Asia is increasingly dependent on networks of effective protected areas. Three wildlife sanctuaries of the Bangladesh Sundarbans are typical examples of protected areas where detection and monitoring of threats is difficult due to low densities of patrol staff and low frequency of patrolling relative to the area that requires monitoring. The aim of this study was to use camera traps to quantify: 1) the levels of different types of illegal human activities (IHA), 2) spatio-temporal variation in illegal human activities, and 3) what proportion of camera trap records can be used to identify perpetrators. Each photograph was categorized as either illegal human activity (IHA) or legal human activity (LHA) based on interpretation of the particular human activity and equipment observed in photograph. For IHA, infraction type was based on the Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012. A total of 914 unique human activity events were recorded (872 IHA and 42 LHA) in camera trap photos over a total of 1039 trap nights. The best model suggests that during spring tide 91% of camera trapped locations in the West Sanctuary had IHA occurring in them during the survey period, while 84% and 74% locations had IHA in the South Sanctuary and East Sanctuary respectively. Camera trapping in remote areas can potentially help protected area managers to increase rates of detection of IHA in their conservation landscapes and increase rates of arrests and prosecutions by providing appropriate supporting evidence.

AB As distinct community assembly processes can produce similar community patterns, assessing the ecological mechanisms promoting coexistence in hyperdiverse rainforests remains a considerable challenge. We use spatially explicit neighbourhood models of tree growth to quantify how functional trait and phylogenetic similarities predict variation in growth and crowding effects for the 315 most abundant tree species in a 25-ha lowland rainforest plot in Ecuador. We find that functional trait differences reflect variation in (1) species maximum potential growth, (2) the intensity of interspecific interactions for some species, and (3) species sensitivity to neighbours. We find that neighbours influenced tree growth in 28% of the 315 focal tree species. Neighbourhood effects are not detected in the remaining 72%, which may reflect the low statistical power to model rare taxa and/or species insensitivity to neighbours. Our results highlight the spectrum of ways in which functional trait differences can shape community dynamics in highly diverse rainforests.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) is a powerful economic tool that gives positive conditional incentives for the provision of additional ecosystem services over the status quo, which has been used widely in terrestrial conservation. Interest in the concept of marine PES has recently emerged, but the fluid, transboundary and often common pool nature of marine ecosystems presents challenges for PES design and implementation. Here, we consider the potential role of PES in addressing current gaps in fisheries management. Used in combination with conventional regulatory approaches, PES may increase private sector engagement and generate more sustainable financing for fisheries management whilst spreading accountability throughout the supply chain. The approach is most likely to be feasible and effective in commercially valuable fisheries with: (i) demand for one or more ecosystem service and a threat to supply; (ii) suitable baseline data available and potential management actions underpinned by robust science; (iii) clarity and security of property rights; (iv) capacity for hybrid multi-level governance; (v) capacity for rigorous monitoring, control and surveillance; and (vi) potential for financial sustainability of the scheme. An examination of four contrasting fisheries - Namibian hake, Mozambican shallow-water shrimp, Western and Central Pacific skipjack tuna and Bangladesh hilsa - demonstrates that a developing world fishery will rarely fulfil each of these preconditions a priori, but that the potential for successful application of PES still exists. In practice, PES design will depend on the institutional context and require creative and innovative approaches to the maintenance of conditionality and additionality.

AB Forests >80 m tall have the highest biomass, and individual trees in these forests are Earth's largest with deep crowns emerging above neighboring vegetation, but it is unclear to what degree these maxima depend on the emergent trees themselves or a broader-scale forest structure. Here we advance the concept of emergent facilitation, whereby emergent trees benefit co-occurring species. Trees reorganize foliage within crowns to optimize available light and, if long-lived, can reiterate after crown dam,age to become emergent. The height, depth, and spacing of emergent trees in turn allows for abundant light to pass through the canopy, leading to light-use complementarity as well as elevated biomass, leaf area, and species diversity of the forest as a whole. We chose Sequoia sempervirens to develop this concept and installed eleven 1-ha plots in old-growth forests spanning nearly six degrees of latitude in California. Each plot was based off a 316-m-long centerline where biomass and leaf area of all vegetation were quantified. We employed hierarchical measurements and stratified random sampling spanning the full size range of individuals to generate 180 equations for determining biomass and leaf area of all dominant plant species in these forests. Biomass (5190 Mg ha(-1)), leaf area (LAI = 19.4), and aboveground carbon (2600 Mg ha(-1)) are global maxima, occurring in plots with the highest proportion of emergent trees. Decay-resistant Sequoia heartwood contributes the bulk of this mass, ranging from 61.5 to 76.7% of plot totals. Heartwood is a key contributor to the development of trees with emergent crowns, since its durability enables trees to recover leaf area and to re-grow crowns after damage so that they can continue expanding for millennia. By distributing leaf area among fewer trees with deeper crowns, Sequoia maintains very high leaf area itself (LAI up to 14.5) while simultaneously allowing other species to flourish underneath (non-Sequoia LAI up to 8.0). Because Sequoia is not replaced by other species, aboveground biomass, leaf area, and carbon content of these forests are essentially asymptotic over time. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Understanding the soil phosphorus (P) cycle is a prerequisite for predicting how environmental changes may influence the dynamics and availability of P in soil. We compiled a database of P fractions sequentially extracted by the Hedley procedure and its modification in 626 unfertilized and uncultivated soils worldwide. With this database, we applied structural equation modeling to test hypothetical soil P transformation models and to quantify the importance of different soil P pools and P transformation pathways in shaping soil P availability at a global scale. Our models revealed that soluble inorganic P (Pi, a readily available P pool) was positively and directly influenced by labile Pi, labile organic P (Po), and primary mineral P and negatively and directly influenced by secondary mineral P; soluble Pi was not directly influenced by moderately labile Po or occluded P. The overall effect on soluble Pi was greatest for labile Pi followed by the organic P pools, occluded P, and then primary mineral P; the overall influence from secondary mineral P was small. Labile Pi was directly linked to all other soil P pools and was more strongly linked than soluble Pi to labile Po and primary mineral P. Our study highlights the important roles of labile Pi in mediating P transformations and in determining overall P availability in soils throughout the world.

AB AimSpatial and temporal biases in species-occurrence data can compromise broad-scale biogeographical research and conservation planning. Although spatial biases have been frequently scrutinized, temporal biases and the overall quality of species-occurrence data have received far less attention. This study aims to answer three questions: (1) How reliable are species-occurrence data for flowering plants in Africa? (2) Where and when did botanical sampling occur in the past 300 years? (3) How complete are plant inventories for Africa?
   LocationAfrica.
   MethodsBy filtering a publicly available dataset containing 3.5 million records of flowering plants, we obtained 934,676 herbarium specimens with complete information regarding species name, date and location of collection. Based on these specimens, we estimated inventory completeness for sampling units (SUs) of 25kmx25km. We then tested whether the spatial distribution of well-sampled SUs was correlated with temporal parameters of botanical sampling. Finally, we determined whether inventory completeness in individual countries was related to old or recently collected specimens.
   ResultsThirty-one per cent of SUs contained at least one specimen, whereas only 2.4% of SUs contained a sufficient number of specimens to reliably estimate inventory completeness. We found that the location of poorly sampled areas remained almost unchanged for half a century. Moreover, there was pronounced temporal bias towards old specimens in South Africa, the country that holds half of the available data for the continent. There, high inventory completeness stems from specimens collected several decades ago.
   Main conclusionsDespite the increasing availability of species occurrence data for Africa, broad-scale biogeographical research is still compromised by the uncertain quality and spatial and temporal biases of such data. To avoid erroneous inferences, the quality and biases in species-occurrence data should be critically evaluated and quantified prior to use. To this end, we propose a quantification method based on inventory completeness using easily accessible species-occurrence data.

AB Environmental heterogeneity influences the species composition of tropical forests, with implications for patterns of diversity and species coexistence in these hyperdiverse communities. Many studies have examined how variability in soil nutrients and topography influence plant community composition, with differing results. None have quantified the relative contribution of environmental heterogeneity versus endogenous processes to variability in forest community composition over time and with respect to successional recovery. Using five consecutive trees censuses of a forest plot in Puerto Rico, conducted between 1990 and 2011, we evaluated the influence of edaphic and topographic variability on community composition. The plot has a well-documented land-use history and is subject to periodic hurricane disturbance. Using multiple canonical distance-based redundancy analyses, we studied how spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrients and topography structure community composition over time, as the forest recovers from long-term land-use effects and two major hurricanes in 1989 and 1998. For the entire plot, spatial variables (principle coordinates of neighbourhood matrices), representing the autocorrelation of tree species in the community, explained the majority (49-57%) of the variability in tree community composition. The explanatory power of spatial variables decreased over time, as forest structure recovered from hurricane damage and the stems in the understorey died. Soil nutrients and topography, collectively, explained a moderate portion (33-37%) of the species compositional variation and were slightly more robust in explaining compositional differences in areas of more intense past land use. Areas of less-intense past land use showed weaker community-environmental trends overall, illustrating a tendency for stronger resource competition (i.e. light, water and soil nutrients) between species in these areas. This illustrates how environmental-plant community interactions are strengthened by the lasting effects of human land-use legacies, which persist for decades to centuries.Synthesis. Our findings confirm past land use to be a fundamental driver of the structure and composition of secondary forests through its impacts on the tree community, the abiotic terrestrial environment and their interaction. Since the extent of second-growth tropical forests continues to increase, our findings highlight the importance of understanding the processes that determine the rate and nature of their succession.

AB A plant's growth rate is seen as a central element of its ecological strategy, and as determined by its traits. Yet the literature is inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to influence growth rate.
   We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies (>500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate). We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature. To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and adult.
   Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings and adults, respectively.
   Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions, major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature. For example, for one-third of the traits considered, the majority (>75%) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage.
   Synthesis. We show for some traits, how trait-growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size. Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.

AB Weaver ants are tropical insects that nest in tree canopies, and for centuries these ants have been used for pest control in tropical orchards. Trees hosting weaver ants might benefit not only from the pest protective properties of these insects but also an additional supply of nutrients from ant feces deposited on the leaves. In a recent study, we demonstrated that Coffea arabica plants hosting Oecophylla smaragdina weaver ants under laboratory conditions experienced enhanced nitrogen availability compared with plants grown without ants. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to further investigate the interactions of weaver ants with the host plants with respect to plant nutrition. Here, we report the identification and quantification of urea, a highly effective foliar nutrient present in the fecal depositions of O. smaragdina. Feces samples obtained from six O. smaragdina colonies were analyzed, and urea concentrations ranging from 1.98 to 31.05 mu g/mg ant feces were detected. Subsequently, we investigated the uptake and translocation of 15 N2-urea in amounts corresponding to the estimated urea contribution via feces depositions on single host plant leaves under laboratory conditions. The results clearly demonstrated that fecal urea was not only assimilated but also translocated within the plant. This evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that the fecal urea of weaver ants is a source of nitrogen for the host trees. Thus, weaver ant feces likely contribute to an improved nutritional status of ant-hosting trees in tropical orchards, thereby adding value to the use of weaver ants for the biocontrol of insect pests.

AB Seed-dispersal ecology in tropical montane forests (TMF) differs in some predictable ways from tropical lowland forests (TLF). Environmental, biogeographic and biotic factors together shape dispersal syndromes which in turn influence forest structure and community composition. Data on diaspore traits along five elevational gradients from forests in Thailand, the Philippines, Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria showed that diaspore size decreases with increasing altitude, fleshy fruits remain the most common fruit type but the relative proportion of wind-dispersed diaspores increases with altitude. Probably corresponding to diaspore size decreasing with increasing elevation, we also provide evidence that avian body size and gape width decrease with increasing altitude. Among other notable changes in the frugivorous fauna across elevational gradients, we found quantitative evidence illustrating that the proportion of bird versus mammalian frugivores increases with altitude, while TMF primates decrease in diversity and density, and switch diets to include less fruit and more leaf proportionately. A paucity of studies on dispersal distance and seed shadows, the dispersal/predation balance and density-dependent mortality thwart much-needed conclusive comparisons of seed dispersal ecology between TMF and TLF, especially from understudied Asian forests. We examine the available evidence, reveal knowledge gaps and recommend research to enhance our understanding of seed dispersal ecology in tropical forests. This review demonstrates that seed dispersal is a more deterministic and important process in tropical montane forests than has been previously appreciated.

AB The transformation of natural landscapes in extensive anthropogenic areas has significantly affected ecological processes, and studies that evaluate such changes are essential for the definition of conservation strategies. In this study, we sought to identify the variables influencing the occupancy of Atlantic forest fragments by the endemic and endangered maned sloth. We selected 33 sampling stations, distributed at least 500 m apart throughout the municipality of Santa Maria de Jetiba-ES, Brazil. We sampled each station five times to verify the presence or absence of the species and to collect local variables. Using GIS tools, we defined a buffer of 200 m around each fragment and calculated the landscape metrics. After analysis of collinearity, we selected six variables - three local variables, two at patch level and one at landscape level - to assess their effect on the occupancy and detection probabilities. We selected models using AICc and calculated the weight of evidence and ratio of the models as well as the cumulative weight of each predictor variable. We detected the sloth in 48% of the stations. Its occupation was positively correlated to two variables on the local scale: Important Feeding Trees and Canopy height. Our results show that the maned sloth respond to fine local scale variables, but not to landscape structure. This is probably associated with the relatively high proportion of forest cover in the study area, but it also indicates the maned sloth flexibility to occupy fragmented landscape. Based on our results, we reinforce the unquestionable importance of local variables for species occupancy within fragmented landscapes, such as those related with the forest structure, and it is particularly important for strictly arboreal species.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict P, C, and N forms in soils developed from basalt, using multivariate models and soil samples with different granulometries. Samples from Oxisols and Alfisols from croplands, pasture, and native vegetation areas were collected at the 0.0-0.20 and 0.60-0.80-m soil layers, and analyzed for contents of available P, remaining P, organic C, total C, and total N. Spectra in the region between 1,100 and 2,500 nm were obtained on samples with granulometry smaller than 2.0 and 0.2 mm. Multivariate prediction models were constructed and validated from the results obtained by the reference methods and spectra. Sample screenings through 0.2 mm mesh improved the relationship between wavelengths in NIRS and the contents of organic C, total C, and total N in the soil, which allowed better calibration and prediction models for these attributes. Irrespectively of particle sizes, the models did not show appropriate robustness, accuracy, and precision for extractable P and remaining P.

AB Clonal growth is of great importance for survival, growth, expansion, and resource utilization of some species. Knowing how clonal plants respond morphologically and physiologically to different light environments can be useful to explain their occurrence and abundance patterns under specific environmental conditions. Responses of clonal growth, leaf gas exchange, fluorescence emission, and photosynthetic pigment concentrations to different light environments (100, 60, 30, and 15%) were studied in Amomum villosum, grown in the traditional way for economic purpose in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. The results showed that A. villosum attained vigorous clonal growth under 30% and 60% light, with a higher plant height, number of ramets, stolon length, thicker stems and stolons. Shade-grown A. villosum possessed a larger leaf area than that of the sun-grown plants in order to capture more light. For A. villosum, the higher light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, light-saturation point, larger fresh and dry biomass can explained the better clonal growth for A. villosum under 30% and 60% light. Amomum villosum attained the highest values of minimal chlorophyll fluorescence under 100% light and the lowest values of maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII under 15% light. Our findings indicated that the full irradiance was too strong and 15% light was too weak for A. villosum plants. It was also verified by higher concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in the shaded plants compared to those grown under full sun light. Our results suggested that A. villosum seemed to be adapted to moderate light environment (60-30%) which was indicated by vigorous clonal growth and higher photosynthesis. This information is very useful to select clonal species for rainforest or understory projects. The cultivation of A. villosum in rainforest should not be done under too strong (100%) or too weak light environment (less than 15%).

AB Government and international agencies have highlighted the need to focus global change research efforts on tropical ecosystems. However, no recent comprehensive review exists synthesizing humid tropical forest responses across global change factors, including warming, decreased precipitation, carbon dioxide fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and land use/land cover changes. This paper assesses research across spatial and temporal scales for the tropics, including modeling, field, and controlled laboratory studies. The review aims to (1) provide a broad understanding of how a suite of global change factors are altering humid tropical forest ecosystem properties and biogeochemical processes; (2) assess spatial variability in responses to global change factors among humid tropical regions; (3) synthesize results from across humid tropical regions to identify emergent trends in ecosystem responses; (4) identify research and management priorities for the humid tropics in the context of global change. Ecosystem responses covered here include plant growth, carbon storage, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and disturbance regime shifts. The review demonstrates overall negative effects of global change on all ecosystem properties, with the greatest uncertainty and variability in nutrient cycling responses. Generally, all global change factors reviewed, except for carbon dioxide fertilization, demonstrate great potential to trigger positive feedbacks to global warming via greenhouse gas emissions and biogeophysical changes that cause regional warming. This assessment demonstrates that effects of decreased rainfall and deforestation on tropical forests are relatively well understood, whereas the potential effects of warming, carbon dioxide fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and plant species invasions require more cross-site, mechanistic research to predict tropical forest responses at regional and global scales.

AB Ants are ecologically dominant and have been used as valuable bio-indicators of environmental change or disturbance being used in monitoring inventories. However, the majority of inventories have concentrated on ground-dwelling ant fauna disregarding arboreal fauna. This paper aimed to list the ant species collected both on the ground and in the vegetation of the Parque Estadual do Cristalino, an important protected site in the center of the southern Amazon. Moreover, we compared the composition of the ground dwelling and vegetation foraging ants. Two hundred and three (203) species distributed among 23 genera and eight subfamilies were sampled, wherein 34 species had not yet been reported in the literature for Mato Grosso State. As expected, the abundance and richness of ants was higher on the ground than in the understory. Also, the composition of the ant assemblages was different between these habitats (with only 20% occurring in both) indicating that complementary methods which include arboreal and terrestrial ants are indicated for efficient inventory. This study provides an inventory of the arboreal and ground ant fauna contributing to the knowledge and conservation of Amazonian ant fauna.

AB Native American populations present the highest prevalence of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection in the Americas, which may be associated to severe disease outcomes. Ten HBV genotypes (A-J) have been described, displaying a remarkable geographic structure, which most likely reflects historic patterns of human migrations. In this study, we characterize the HBV strains circulating in a historical sample of Native South Americans to characterize the historical viral dynamics in this population. The sample consisted of 1070 individuals belonging to 38 populations collected between 1965 and 1997. Presence of HBV DNA was checked by quantitative real-time PCR, and determination of HBV genotypes and subgenotypes was performed through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a fragment including part of HBsAg and Pol coding regions (S/Pol). A Bayesian Skyline Plot analysis was performed to compare the viral population dynamics of HBV/A1 strains found in Native Americans and in the general Brazilian population. A total of 109 individuals were positive for HBV DNA (similar to 10%), and 70 samples were successfully sequenced and genotyped. Subgenotype A1 (HBV/A1), related to African populations and the African slave trade, was the most prevalent (66-94%). The Skyline Plot analysis showed a marked population expansion of HBV/A1 in Native Americans occurring more recently (1945-1965) than in the general Brazilian population. Our results suggest that historic processes that contributed to formation of HBV/A1 circulating in Native American are related with more recent migratory waves towards the Amazon basin, which generated a different viral dynamics in this region.

AB The human microbiome project (HMP) has made it possible to test important ecological theories for arguably the most important ecosystem to human health-the human microbiome. Existing limited number of studies have reported conflicting evidence in the case of the neutral theory; the present study aims to comprehensively test the neutral theory with extensive HMP datasets covering all five major body sites inhabited by the human microbiome. Utilizing 7437 datasets of bacterial community samples, we discovered that only 49 communities (less than 1%) satisfied the neutral theory, and concluded that human microbial communities are not neutral in general. The 49 positive cases, although only a tiny minority, do demonstrate the existence of neutral processes. We realize that the traditional doctrine of microbial biogeography "Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects" first proposed by Baas-Becking resolves the apparent contradiction. The first part of Baas-Becking doctrine states that microbes are not dispersal-limited and therefore are neutral prone, and the second part reiterates that the freely dispersed microbes must endure selection by the environment. Therefore, in most cases, it is the host environment that ultimately shapes the community assembly and tip the human microbiome to niche regime.

AB Our knowledge about the functional foundations of ecosystem service (ES) provision is still limited and more research is needed to elucidate key functional mechanisms. Using a simplified eco-hydrological scheme, in this work we analyzed how land-use decisions modify the partition of some essential regulatory ES by altering basic relationships between biomass stocks and water flows. A comprehensive meta-analysis and review was conducted based on global, regional and local data from peer-reviewed publications. We analyzed five datasets comprising 1348 studies and 3948 records on precipitation (PPT), aboveground biomass (AGB), AGB change, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield (WY), WY change, runoff (R) and infiltration (I). The conceptual framework was focused on ES that are associated with the ecological functions (e.g., intermediate ES) of ET, WY, R and I. ES included soil protection, carbon sequestration, local climate regulation, water-flow regulation and water recharge. To address the problem of data normality, the analysis included both parametric and non-parametric regression analysis. Results demonstrate that PPT is a first-order biophysical factor that controls ES release at the broader scales. At decreasing scales, ES are partitioned as result of PPT interactions with other biophysical and anthropogenic factors. At intermediate scales, land-use change interacts with PPT modifying ES partition as it the case of afforestation in dry regions, where ET and climate regulation may be enhanced at the expense of R and water-flow regulation. At smaller scales, site-specific conditions such as topography interact with PPT and AGB displaying different ES partition formats. The probable implications of future land-use and climate change on some key ES production and partition are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global warming is likely leading to species' distributional shifts, resulting in changes in local community compositions and diversity patterns. In this study, we applied species distribution models to evaluate the potential impacts of temperature increase on ant communities in Korean temperate forests, by testing hypotheses that 1) the risk of extinction of forest ant species would increase over time, and 2) the changes in species distribution ranges could drive upward movements of ant communities and further alter patterns of species richness. We sampled ant communities at 335 evenly distributed sites across South Korea and modelled the future distribution range for each species using generalized additive models. To account for spatial autocorrelation, autocovariate regressions were conducted prior to generalized additive models. Among 29 common ant species, 12 species were estimated to shrink their suitable geographic areas, whereas five species would benefit from future global warming. Species richness was highest at low altitudes in the current period, and it was projected to be highest at the mid-altitudes in the 2080s, resulting in an upward movement of 4.9 m yr(-1). This altered the altitudinal pattern of species richness from a monotonic-decrease curve (common in temperate regions) to a bell-shaped curve (common in tropical regions). Overall, ant communities in temperate forests are vulnerable to the on-going global warming and their altitudinal movements are similar to other faunal communities.

AB In the Falkland Islands, islands with invasive rats have fewer passerine species compared to islands without rats. On islands on which rats have been eradicated, passerine species richness is indistinguishable from that found on islands historically free of rats, but community composition differs between these two island types. In particular, the most dominant species on historically rat-free islands, Cinclodes antarcticus, is less abundant and prevalent on eradicated islands. We compared passerine energy flow on islands with rats, islands from which rats have been eradicated, and islands on which rats were historically absent. Passerine communities on islands historically without rats used nine times more energy than on islands with rats present. Despite equivalent passerine species richness, passerine energy flow was approximately half on islands from which rats had been eradicated compared to historically rat-free islands. Because passerine energy flow was determined by community composition and not by species richness, passerine species within this community appear to be functionally complementary and not functionally redundant. At least one species, C. antarcticus, plays an irreplaceable role. Our results also document the dramatic and lingering effects of invasive species following their eradication, and the importance of species complementarity for the resilience of community properties.

AB Based on species endemism, three biodiversity centers, called "Ecological Corridors" have been proposed as one of the main conservation strategies for the Atlantic Rain Forest. This study tested whether the organization of the social paper wasp assemblage fits those centers. A standardized protocol was used for sampling the social paper wasp fauna. The structural organization was estimated by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) based on the similarity indexes of Sorensen (qualitative data) and Morisita-Horn (quantitative data). Regressive models were applied to the first axes' site scores of the NMDS, to the latitudinal and altitudinal variations, and to the speciation and immigration probabilities predicted by the neutral theory for a metacommunity. Our results indicated that the social paper wasp assemblage is organized in a continuum, with two distinct biodiversity centers. The organization of the assemblage along the gradient was dependent on latitudinal and altitudinal variations and their interactions, and also on the speciation and immigration probabilities. Several studies have demonstrated that the current biodiversity patterns of the Atlantic Forest might be explained by the past climate and, consequently, by the connection between the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest. In addition, speciation and immigration probabilities strongly influence the compositional and structural variations of the social paper wasp assemblage along the latitudinal gradient.

AB The ecological consequences of human-driven overexploitation and loss of keystone consumers are still unclear. In intertidal rocky shores over the world, the decrease of keystone macrograzers has resulted in an increase in the dominance of herbivores with smaller body (i.e., "mesograzers"), which could potentially alter community assembly and structure. Here, we experimentally tested whether mesograzers affect the structure of rocky intertidal communities during the period of early colonization after the occurrence of a disturbance. A manipulative field experiment was conducted to exclude mesograzers (i.e., juvenile chitons, small snails, amphipods, and juvenile limpets) from experimental areas in an ecosystem characterized by the overexploitation of keystone macrograzers and predators. The results of multivariate analyses suggest that mesograzers had significant effects on intertidal community structure through negative and positive effects on species abundances. Mesograzers had negative effects on filamentous algae, but positive effects on opportunistic foliose algae and barnacles. Probably, mesograzers indirectly favored the colonization of barnacles and foliose algae by removing preemptive competitors, as previously shown for other meso- and macrograzer species. These results strongly support the idea that small herbivores exert a firm controlling effect on the assembly process of natural communities. Therefore, changes in functional roles of top-down controllers might have significant implications for the structure of intertidal communities.

AB The upper soil provides support, water, and nutrients to terrestrial plants and is therefore crucial for forest dynamics. We hypothesised that a tree's metabolic activity (and therefore its metabolome; the total set of metabolites) would be affected by both the depth of upper soil layers and water availability. We sampled leaves for stoichiometric and metabolomic analyses once per season from differently sized Quercus ilex trees under natural and experimental drought conditions representing the likely conditions in the coming decades). Although the metabolomes varied according to tree size, smaller trees did not show higher concentrations of biomarker metabolites related to drought stress. However, the effect of the drought treatment on the metabolomes was greatest for small trees growing in shallow soils. Our results suggest that tree size is more dependent on the depth of the upper soil, which indirectly affects a tree's metabolome, rather than on the moisture content in the upper soil. Metabolomic profiling of Q. ilex supports our finding that water availability in the upper soil is not necessarily correlated with tree size. The higher impact of drought on trees growing in shallower soils nevertheless indicates that any increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of drought - as has been projected for the Mediterranean Basin and other areas - would affect small trees most. Metabolomics has proved to be a useful means for investigating the links between plant metabolism and environmental conditions. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB The muricid gastropods Concholepas concholepas (loco or false abalone), endemic to Chile and Peru, and Haliotidae Haliotis spp. (abalone) are highly priced seafood delicacies traded in Asian markets. Historical catches, management strategies, production, prices, and revenues are analyzed for these wild and farmed gastropods. Wild abalone prices have a positive effect (P < 0.01), landings a negative effect (P = 0.01), and farmed aquaculture production a negative effect (P = 0.09) on Chilean loco export prices. This underscores the high degree of market integration and the direct price relationship for these gastropods between Chilean and the Asian seafood markets. Drops in the Chilean export prices of locos had a negative effect on official loco landings in Chile, affecting the small-scale territorial user rights for fishery comanagement scheme developed for the species. The study shows evidence of distal connections (telecoupling) between production and market forces, that can jeopardize fishery management efforts. Aquaculture being developed in certain parts of the world can impact quite specifically on the attempts to achieve sustainable fisheries in other geographically distinct areas. Because of large market fluctuations, and a global drive to develop large-scale farming of marine gastropods, there is an urgent need to strengthen the adaptive capacity for diversification, and to add value to resources, so as not to hamper the long-term development of traditional coastal fishing communities.

AB The proposed interoceanic canal will connect the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean, traversing Lake Nicaragua, the major freshwater reservoir in Central America. If completed, the canal would be the largest infrastructure-related excavation project on Earth. In November 2015, the Nicaraguan government approved an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) for the canal. A group of international experts participated in a workshop organized by the Academy of Sciences of Nicaragua to review this ESIA. The group concluded that the ESIA does not meet international standards; essential information is lacking regarding the potential impacts on the lake, freshwater and marine environments, and biodiversity. The ESIA presents an inadequate assessment of natural hazards and socioeconomic disruptions. The panel recommends that work on the canal project be suspended until an appropriate ESIA is completed. The project should be resumed only if it is demonstrated to be economically feasible, environmentally acceptable, and socially beneficial.

AB Active restoration of rainforests is essential in enhancing the recovery of biodiversity in many tropical regions suffering from deforestation. However, the value of actively restored rainforests for birds is still relatively poorly understood because of the short history of active restoration programs. Here, we studied the recovery of bird communities in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We sampled birds along a restoration gradient consisting of six restoration areas (3-16 years old) and used five primary forests as reference areas. We found that bird community compositions changed in an orderly fashion along the restoration gradient. The abundance of arboreal insectivore frugivores and forest specialists increased, while that of foliage-gleaning insectivores, granivores and forest visitors decreased towards older sites. The similarity of the bird communities of the restored forests to those of the nearby primary forests increased linearly with time. If this recovery rate is extrapolated to the future, the bird communities could reach a pre-disturbance state after only approximately 20 years of active restoration. However, previous studies have shown that recovery is typically a non-linear process, and the time needed for bird communities to recover is more likely longer than this. Nevertheless, our study provides evidence that bird communities benefit from active rainforest restoration after human-induced deforestation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coexistence between ecologically similar species can promote competition for resources. Hummingbirds (Aves: Trochilidae) are nectarivorous birds that usually coexist in sympatry, and visit flowers using different foraging behaviors and levels of aggressiveness as a strategy to diminish resource competition. Here, we describe the dynamics in territorial and dominance behaviors in a hummingbird community inhabiting a highland during winter in Western Mexico. We explored in natural conditions how foraging strategies and dominance status of the hummingbirds was influenced by community species composition, sex, age and size of the individuals, floral abundance, and nectar resource availability. The community studied was composed of 11 species (four residents, three altitudinal migrants, three latitudinal migrants), and all possible combinations of dominance and territoriality were found. Differences in the dominance status and foraging behavior were related to the species, sex, age and body size of the individuals, as well as the number of flowers in the patches, and the abundance of the migratory species over time. The aggressive and territorial species preferred the places with more flowers, and started the majority of the interactions attacking even birds that did not visited the flowers. The subordinate non-territorial hummingbirds visited floral patches of different sizes, did not start aggressive interactions and when they were involved in one, this occurred during their visits to the territorial hummingbird's flowers. Hummingbird dominance changed during the winter and at the end of the season, when the latitudinal migrant species left our study site, the resident species were more abundant, dominant and territorial. Dominance status and foraging behavior, together with floral preferences and the spatial distribution of nectar resources, acted as mechanisms organizing this hummingbird community.

AB We investigated the occurrence of myrmecophilous florivorous lycaenid larvae in Banisteriopsis malifolia (Malpighiaceae) according to habitat conservation status (disturbed and preserved savanna), plant phenology, height and the presence of tending ants. The abundance and richness of lycaenids were sixfold and fivefold greater, respectively, in the disturbed area than in the protected savanna. Lycaenids occurred mostly on plants visited by Camponotus blandus, a mutualistic partner of larvae. Habitat type was the main factor influencing lycaenid occurrence, as plants in open areas offered more food resources and tending ants. Banisteriopsis malifolia was considered useful as a host for lycaenids in disturbed sites.

AB Woody plant demographics provide important insight into ecosystem state-shifts in response to changing fire regimes. In Australian tropical savannas, the switch from patchy landscape burning by Aborigines to unmanaged wildfires within the past century has been implicated in biodiversity declines including the fire-sensitive conifer, Callitris intratropica. C. intratropica commonly forms small, closed-canopy groves that exclude fire and allow recruitment of conspecifics and other fire-sensitive woody plants. C. intratropica groves provide a useful indicator of heterogeneity and fire regime change, but the mechanisms driving the species' persistence and decline remain poorly understood. We examined the hypothesis that C. intratropica population stability depends upon a regime of frequent, low-intensity fires maintained by Aboriginal management. We combined integral projection models of C. intratropica population behaviour with an environmental state change matrix to examine how vital rates, grove dynamics and the frequency of high- and low-intensity fires contribute to population stability. Closed-canopy C. intratropica groves contributed disproportionately to population growth by promoting recruitment, whereas singleton trees accounted for a larger proportion of adult mortality. Our patch-based population model predicted population declines under current fire frequencies and that the recruitment of new groves plays a critical role in the species' persistence. Our results also indicated that reducing fire intensity, a key outcome of Aboriginal burning, leads to C. intratropica population persistence even at high fire frequencies. These findings provide insight into the relationship between ecosystem composition and human-fire interactions and the role of fire management in sustaining the mosaics that comprise 'natural' systems.

AB The present study has estimated spatial distribution of biomass carbon density from satellite remote sensing data, historical archives and collateral data from 1930 to 2013. The spatial forest canopy density datasets for 1930, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 were analysed to obtain biomass carbon pools at 5 km grid level. The overall loss of forest cover was 28% from 1930 to 2013. Analysis of change in the forest canopy density indicates that the dense forest cover reduced from 419,175 km(2) in 1975 to 390,966 km(2) in 2013. The total above ground biomass carbon stock of Indian forest was calculated as 3070.27 Tg C in 2013. Standing biomass carbon stocks varied significantly during different steps of time periods. There are a total 67,184 grid cells with loss of carbon stocks during 1930-1975 followed by 55,742 cells during 1975-1985. The annual carbon loss in the above ground biomass showed the highest decrease during the period of 1930 to 1975 and estimated as 2168.50 Tg C while the net annual loss of carbon is 48.19 Tg C. The maximum observed net annual loss of carbon stocks was 53.97 Tg C during 2005 to 2013. Carbon content for various states shows that maximum carbon stocks were stored in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh (11.27%) in 2013. State-wise change analysis indicates the highest loss of carbon stocks in Tripura (80.99%) from 1930 to 2013. Overall reduction in carbon stock in Indian forests has been estimated as 3079.98 Tg C (50.08%) from 1930 to 2013. The spatial characterization of distribution and changes in carbon stocks can provide useful information for planning and strategic management of resources and fulfilling global initiatives to conserve forest biodiversity.

AB Many numerical studies, among them, global and regional models, have been used to simulate climatic impact due to Amazon deforestation. Most of them did not consider deforestation as usually observed and the induced dynamic changes. The present study explores the physical impacts due to Amazon deforestation by considering local and remote changes in the circulation and thermodynamics. For this, numerical experiments were conducted with RegCM3 using a relatively fine horizontal grid spacing (50 km), more realistic deforested areas (similar to the highway-network-shaped), and an updated land use map. The studied period was 2001-2006 October-March. As in most previous studies focusing on Amazon deforestation, the RegCM3-simulated air temperature increases over degraded areas, ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 A degrees C, and precipitation decreases of around 10 %. This result is mainly related to depletion in evapotranspiration rates provided by lesser soil water extraction by the degraded vegetation. The weakening of upward motion in the mid-upper troposphere is an associated mechanism that explains the precipitation decrease after Amazon deforestation. A new result is the simulated precipitation increase, about 10 %, over the eastern South America and the adjacent South Atlantic Ocean. In these areas, the precipitation increase during October-March is associated with intensification of upper-level high pressure (the Bolivian high) coupled with negative geopotential height anomalies southeastward of the center of the high.

AB Both water availability and temperature modulate the growth of Hymenaea courbaril on karst in Central Brazil. There is evidence of teleconnections between South Atlantic SST and tree growth.
   Tropical dry forests have low annual precipitation and long dry seasons. Water availability, the main restrictive growth factor, becomes more pronounced in the shallow and highly porous soil of karst regions. Understanding how climate regulates tree growth in stressful environments is essential for predicting climate change impacts on trees. The aim of this study was to build a tree-ring chronology of Hymenaea courbaril growing in a karst dry forest and evaluate how local climate and teleconnections modulate its growth. To accomplish this, increment cores of 19 individuals were sampled in Terra Ronca State Park located in Goias State, Central Brazil. After surface polishing, tree rings were identified, measured, dated, and a tree-ring chronology was built with 17 individuals. The chronology was correlated with local and regional climate data (temperature, precipitation, air humidity). We also tested teleconnections with sea surface temperature (SST) of the Equatorial Pacific and South Atlantic. Results show that air humidity, precipitation amount, and its distribution during the transition period between dry and wet seasons positively regulate this species growth. On the other hand, growth is negatively correlated with temperature during the middle of the previous year's dry season. Additionally, growth is negatively correlated with SST of the Southern Atlantic, but not with Equatorial Pacific. These relationships between climate and growth indicate that predicted increases in regional temperature and decreases in water availability may limit the growth of H. courbaril in karst dry forests.

AB Striking hydro-climatic differences of 2 years (wet; dry) dramatically control the increment pattern of L. huasango in varying extent, even causing a "growth collapse" during the La Nia drought 2010/2011.
   We present the first multi-year long time series of local climate data in the seasonally dry tropical forest in Southern Ecuador and related growth dynamics of Loxopterygium huasango, a deciduous tree species. Local climate was investigated by installing an automatically weather station in 2007 and the daily tree growth variability was measured with high-resolution point dendrometers. The climatic impact on growth behaviour was evaluated. Hydro-climatic variables, like precipitation and relative humidity, were the most important factors for controlling tree growth. Changes in rainwater input affected radial increment rates and daily amplitudes of stem diameter variations within the study period from 2009 to 2013. El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related variations of tropical Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures influenced the trees' increment rates. Average radial increments showed high inter-annual (up to 7.89 mm) and inter-individual (up to 3.88 mm) variations. Daily amplitudes of stem diameter variations differed strongly between the two extreme years 2009 (wet) and 2011 (dry). Contrary to 2009, the La Nia drought in 2011 caused a rapid reduction of the daily amplitudes, indicating a total cessation ('growth collapse') of stem increment under ENSO-related drought conditions and demonstrating the high impact of climatic extreme events on carbon sequestration of the dry tropical forest ecosystem.

AB Understanding the processes that lead to successful invasions is essential for the management of exotic species. We aimed to assess the comparative relevance of habitat (both at local and at regional scale) and plant features on the species richness of local canopy spiders of both indigenous and exotic species. In an oceanic island, Azores archipelago, we collected spiders in 97 transects belonging to four habitat types according to the degree of habitat disturbance, four types of plants with different colonisation origin (indigenous vs. exotic), and four types of plants according to the complexity of the vegetation structure. Generalised linear mixed models and linear regressions were performed separately for indigenous and exotic species at the local and regional landscape scales. At the local scale, habitat and plant origin explained the variation in the species richness of indigenous spiders, whereas exotic spider richness was poorly correlated to habitat and plant structure. The surrounding landscape matrix substantially affected indigenous spiders, but did not affect exotic spiders, with the exception of the negative effect exerted by native forests on the richness of exotic species. Our results revealed that the local effect of habitat type, plant origin and plant structure explain variations in the species richness observed at a regional scale. These results shed light on the mechanistic processes behind the role of habitat types in invasions, i.e., plant fidelity and plant structure are revealed as key factors, suggesting that native forests may act as physical barriers to the colonisation of exotic spiders.

AB Avian brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of their hosts, which rear the parasite's progeny. The costs of parasitism have selected for the evolution of defence strategies in many host species. Most research has focused on resistance strategies, where hosts minimize the number of successful parasitism events using defences such as mobbing of adult brood parasites or rejection of parasite eggs. However, many hosts do not exhibit resistance. Here we explore why some hosts accept parasite eggs in their nests and how this is related to the virulence of the parasite. We also explore the extent to which acceptance of parasites can be explained by the evolution of tolerance; a strategy in which the host accepts the parasite but adjusts its life history or other traits to minimize the costs of parasitism. We review examples of tolerance in hosts of brood parasites (such as modifications to clutch size and multi-broodedness), and utilize the literature on host-pathogen interactions and plant herbivory to analyse the prevalence of each type of defence (tolerance or resistance) and their evolution. We conclude that (i) the interactions between brood parasites and their hosts provide a highly tractable system for studying the evolution of tolerance, (ii) studies of host defences against brood parasites should investigate both resistance and tolerance, and (iii) tolerance and resistance can lead to contrasting evolutionary scenarios.

AB Chemotactile cues unintentionally left by animals can play a major role in predator-prey interactions. Specialized predators can use them to find their prey, while prey individuals can assess predation risk. However, little is known to date about the importance of chemotactile cues for generalist predators such as ants. Here, we investigated the response of a generalized predatory ant, Formica polyctena, to cues of two taxonomically distinct prey: a spider (Pisaura mirabilis) and a cricket (Nemobius sylvestris). In analogy, we studied whether crickets and spiders showed antipredator behavior in response to ant cues. When confronted with cues of the two prey species, Formica polyctena workers showed increased residence time and reduced movement speed, which suggests success-motivated searching behavior and thus increased foraging effort. The ants' response did not differ between cues of the two prey species, coinciding with similar aggression and consumption rates of dead prey. However, the cuticular hydrocarbons, which likely resemble part of the potential cues, differed strongly between the species, with only few methyl-branched alkanes in common. This suggests that ants respond to multiple compounds left by other organisms with prey-search behavior. The two prey species, in turn, showed no detectable antipredator behavior in response to ant cues. Our study shows that ants can detect and respond to chemotactile cues of taxonomically and ecologically distinct prey species, probably to raise their foraging success. Using such chemotactile cues for prey detection may drastically increase their foraging efficiency and thus contribute to the high ecological success of ants.

AB Intraspecific trait variation is widespread in nature, yet its effects on community dynamics are not well understood. Here we explore the consequences of intraspecific trait variation for coexistence in two- and multispecies competitive communities. For two species, the likelihood of coexistence is in general reduced by intraspecific variation, except when the species have almost equal trait means but different trait variances, such that one is a generalist and the other a specialist consumer. In multispecies communities, the only strong effect of non-heritable intraspecific variation is to reduce expected species richness. However, when intraspecific variation is heritable, allowing for the possibility of trait evolution, communities are much more resilient against environmental disturbance and exhibit far more predictable trait patterns. Our results are robust to varying model parameters and relaxing model assumptions.

AB The Central American locust (CAL) Schistocerca piceifrons piceifrons Walker is one of the most harmful plant pests in the Yucatan Peninsula, where an important gregarious zone is located. The olfactory response and host plant acceptance by the CAL have not been studied in detail thus far. In this work, the olfactory response of the CAL to odor of various plant species was evaluated using an olfactometer test system. In addition, the host plant acceptance was assessed by the consumption of leaf area. Results showed that the CAL was highly attracted to odor of Pisonia aculeata. Evaluation of host plant acceptance showed that the CAL fed on Leucaena glauca and Waltheria americana, but not on P. aculeata or Guazuma ulmifolia. Analysis of leaf thickness, and leaf content of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) showed that the CAL was attracted to plant species with low leaf C content.

AB Fragmentation and habitat loss contribute considerably to global declines of amphibians and reptiles. However, few studies focus on forest edges, created during the fragmentation process, as proximate drivers of the local demographic structure of populations. Here, we use abundance data of amphibians and reptiles to study their responses to forest edges in nine fragmented forested landscapes of the Neotropics. Species-specific abundance data were collected in plots established at varying distances from their respective nearest forest edge. We tested for edge effects on the abundance of species, and used curve clustering techniques to group species with similar edge responses, i.e. species with either increasing or decreasing abundance from the matrix towards the forest interior. We also grouped species that showed no change in abundance with respect to the nearest forest edge and those whose abundance response was unimodal, peaking in either forest habitat or the surrounding matrix habitat. We found that 96% of all amphibians and 90% of all reptiles showed an edge response, with the abundance of 74.5% of amphibians and 57.3% of reptiles decreasing with increasing proximity to forest edges. However, species-specific edge effects were not always consistent, with some species having opposite edge responses when measured in different landscapes. The depth of edge effects exhibited by forest species, i.e. species that increased in abundance in the forest interior, extended up to one kilometre away from forest edges. We show that the median edge effect on forest species extends to 250 m within the forest interior, indicating that tropical forest patches with a mean diameter < 500 m (minimum area approximate to 78 ha) are unsuitable for half of forest-dependent species considered in this study.

AB Conflicts between local people's livelihoods and conservation have led to many unsuccessful conservation efforts and have stimulated debates on policies that might simultaneously promote sustainable management of protected areas and improve the living conditions of local people. Many government-sponsored payments-for-ecosystem-services (PES) schemes have been implemented around the world. However, few empirical assessments of their effectiveness have been conducted, and even fewer assessments have directly measured their effects on ecosystem services. We conducted an empirical and spatially explicit assessment of the conservation effectiveness of one of the world's largest PES programs through the use of a long-term empirical data set, a satellite-based habitat model, and spatial autoregressive analyses on direct measures of change in an ecosystem service (i.e., the provision of wildlife species habitat). Giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) habitat improved in Wolong Nature Reserve of China after the implementation of the Natural Forest Conservation Program. The improvement was more pronounced in areas monitored by local residents than those monitored by the local government, but only when a higher payment was provided. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of a PES program depends on who receives the payment and on whether the payment provides sufficient incentives. As engagement of local residents has not been incorporated in many conservation strategies elsewhere in China or around the world, our results also suggest that using an incentive-based strategy as a complement to command-and-control, community- and norm-based strategies may help achieve greater conservation effectiveness and provide a potential solution for the park versus people conflict.
   Efectos de los Pagos por Servicios Ambientales sobre la Recuperacion del Habitat de la Faun Los conflictos entre el bienestar de los habitantes locales y la conservacion han derivado en numerosos esfuerzos de conservacion sin exito y han estimulado los debates sobre las politicas que pueden simultaneamente promover el manejo sustentable de las areas protegidas y mejorar las condiciones de vida de los locales. En todo el mundo se han implementado muchas estrategias de pagos por servicios ambientales (PSA) patrocinados por el gobierno. Sin embargo, se han realizado pocas evaluaciones de su efectividad, y muchas menos se han realizado para medir directamente sus efectos sobre los servicios ambientales. Realizamos una evaluacion empirica y espacialmente explicita de la efectividad de conservacion de uno de los programas de PSA mas grandes del mundo por medio del uso de un conjunto de datos empiricos a largo plazo, un modelo de habitat con base satelital y analisis espaciales auto-regresivos sobre las medidas directas del cambio en un servicio ambiental (es decir, el suministro de habitat para especies de fauna). El habitat del panda gigante (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) mejoro en la Reserva Natural Wolong en China despues de la implementacion del Programa de Conservacion de Bosques Naturales. La mejoria fue mas pronunciada en las areas monitoreadas por los residentes locales que en aquellas monitoreadas por el gobierno local, pero solamente cuando se proporciono un pago mayor. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la efectividad del programa de PSA depende de quien recibe el pago y si el pago proporciona incentivos suficientes. Mientras el compromiso de los residentes locales no se ha incorporado a muchas estrategias de conservacion en otras partes de China o del mundo, nuestros resultados tambien sugieren que el uso de una estrategia basada en incentivos como complemento a estrategias basadas en comando-y-control, comunidad y normas puede ayudar a alcanzar una mayor efectividad de conservacion y a proporcionar una solucion potencial para el conflicto de parque versus personas.

AB Understanding foraging strategies of birds is essential to understanding mechanisms of their community assembly. To provide such information on a key Southeast Asian rainforest family, the babblers (Timaliidae), we evaluated foraging behavior and abundance in 7 morphologically and behaviorally similar sympatric species (Cyanoderma erythropterum, C. rufifrons, Stachyris maculata, S. nigricollis, S. poliocephala, Macronus ptilosus, and Mixornis gularis) in 5 habitats defined by structural complexity: (1) continuous native rainforest, (2) logged native rainforest fragments, (3) mature industrial tree plantation, (4) young industrial plantation, and (5) oil palm plantation. Enough data were obtained to compare abundance in all 7 species and foraging behavior in 5. All species were common in forest fragments and mature industrial tree plantations and less so in continuous rainforest and young industrial plantations; only M. gularis occurred in oil palm. In terms of foraging, M. gularis was the greatest generalist; C. rufifrons foraged mainly on live leaves in the forest midstory; and S. maculata, C. erythropterum, and M. ptilosus foraged mainly on dead leaves suspended in understory vegetation at significantly different heights. The dead-leaf substrate depends on a rich supply of falling leaves and extensive understory structure, conditions most common in native forest and old industrial plantations, and less so in mature forest, young plantations, and oil palm. Because of the importance of foraging data to understanding and managing biodiversity, we encourage the development of foraging fields in eBird (ebird.org), so that birdwatchers may help collect these relatively rare data.

AB Herbaceous plants are a key component of tropical forests. Previous work indicates that herbs contribute substantially to the species richness of tropical plant communities. However, the processes structuring tropical herb diversity, and how they contrast with woody communities, have been underexplored. Within the understory of a 50-ha forest dynamics plot in central Panama, we compared the diversity, distribution, and abundance of vascular herbaceous plants with woody seedlings (i.e., tree and lianas < 1 cm DBH and >= 20 cm tall). Beta-diversity was calculated for each community using a null model approach. We then assessed the similarity in alpha and beta-diversity among herbs, tree seedlings, and liana seedlings. Strengths of habitat associations were measured using permutational ANOVA among topographic habitat-types. Variance partitioning was then used to quantify the amount of variation in species richness and composition explained by spatial and environmental variables (i.e., topography, soils, and shade) for each growth form. Species richness and diversity were highest for tree seedlings, followed by liana seedlings and then herbs. In contrast, beta-diversity was 16-127% higher for herbs compared to woody seedlings, indicating higher spatial variation in this stratum. We observed no correlation between local richness or compositional uniqueness of herbs and woody seedlings across sites, indicating that different processes control the spatial patterns of woody and herbaceous diversity and composition. Habitat associations were strongest for herbs, as indicated by greater compositional dissimilarity among habitat types. Likewise, environmental variables explained a larger proportion of the variation in species richness and composition for herbs than for woody seedlings (richness = 25%, 14%, 12%; composition = 25%, 9%, 6%, for herbs, trees, and lianas, respectively). These differences between strata did not appear to be due to differences in lifespan alone, based on data from adult trees. Our results point to contrasting assembly mechanisms for herbaceous and woody communities, with herbs showing stronger niche-derived structure. Future research on tropical herbaceous communities is likely to yield new insights into the many processes structuring diverse plant communities.

AB Although the effects of variation between individuals within species are traditionally ignored in studies of species coexistence, the magnitude of intraspecific variation in nature is forcing ecologists to reconsider. Compelling intuitive arguments suggest that individual variation may provide a previously unrecognised route to diversity maintenance by blurring species-level competitive differences or substituting for species-level niche differences. These arguments, which are motivating a large body of empirical work, have rarely been evaluated with quantitative theory. Here we incorporate intraspecific variation into a common model of competition and identify three pathways by which this variation affects coexistence: (1) changes in competitive dynamics because of nonlinear averaging, (2) changes in species' mean interaction strengths because of variation in underlying traits (also via nonlinear averaging) and (3) effects on stochastic demography. As a consequence of the first two mechanisms, we find that intraspecific variation in competitive ability increases the dominance of superior competitors, and intraspecific niche variation reduces species-level niche differentiation, both of which make coexistence more difficult. In addition, individual variation can exacerbate the effects of demographic stochasticity, and this further destabilises coexistence. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for emerging empirical interests in the effects of intraspecific variation on species diversity.

AB Disturbance shapes plant communities over a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales. How natural and anthropogenic disturbance interact to shape ecological communities is highly variable and begs a greater understanding. We used five censuses spanning the years 1990-2011 from the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in northeast Puerto Rico to investigate the interplay of human land-use legacies dating to the early 20th century and two recent hurricanes (Hugo, 1989 and Georges, 1998). The LFDP is a landscape mosaic comprised of an area of mature subtropical wet forest and three areas of secondary forest with differing past land-use intensities. We examined the degree to which hurricane disturbance-effect and subsequent community recovery varied across past land-use classes. We expected areas with greater intensity of human land use to be more affected by hurricane disturbance therefore exhibiting greater initial damage and longer successional recovery times. Structurally, areas of secondary forest contained smaller trees than old-growth areas; hurricanes caused widespread recruitment of shrubs and saplings that thinned with time since the first hurricane. Species richness of the plot declined over time, mostly due to the loss of rare species, but also due to the loss of some heliophilic, pioneer species that became abundant after the first hurricane. Species composition differed strongly between areas of secondary and mature forest, and these differences were largely constant over time, except for an increase in compositional differences following the second hurricane. An indicator species analysis attributed this pattern to the longer persistence of pioneer species in areas of greater past land-use intensity, likely due to the more open canopy in secondary forest. When secondary forest areas of differing past land-use intensity were considered separately, few species of low community rank were found as indicators. When these areas were combined, more and higher-ranked species emerged as indicators, creating ecologically meaningful indicator species combinations that better captured the broad-scale plant community response to past land use. Our findings support the idea that effects of past land use can persist for decades to centuries following land-use abandonment, illustrating the importance of land-use legacies in shaping regenerating tropical secondary forests.

AB Ulex europaeus (gorse) is an invasive shrub deemed as one of the most invasive species in the world. U. europaeus is widely distributed in the south-central area of Chile, which is considered a world hotspot for biodiversity conservation. In addition to its negative effects on the biodiversity of natural ecosystems, U. europaeus is one of the most severe pests for agriculture and forestry. Despite its importance as an invasive species, U. europaeus has been little studied. Although information exists on the potential distribution of the species, the interaction of the invasion process with the spatial dynamic of the landscape and the landscape-scale factors that control the presence or absence of the species is still lacking. We studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of the landscape and how these relate to U. europaeus invasion in south-central Chile. We used supervised classification of satellite images to determine the spatial distribution of the species and other land covers for the years 1986 and 2003, analysing the transitions between the different land covers. We used logistic regression for modelling the increase, decrease and permanence of U. europaeus invasion considering landscape variables. Results showed that the species covers only around 1 % of the study area and showed a 42 % reduction in area for the studied period. However, U. europaeus was the cover type which presented the greatest dynamism in the landscape. We found a strong relationship between changes in land cover and the invasion process, especially connected with forest plantations of exotic species, which promotes the displacement of U. europaeus. The model of gorse cover increase presented the best performance, and the most important predictors were distance to seed source and landscape complexity index. Our model predicted high spread potential of U. europaeus in areas of high conservation value. We conclude that proper management for this invasive species must take into account the spatial dynamics of the landscape within the invaded area in order to address containment, control or mitigation of the invasion.

AB The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of habitat loss and forest replacement by cattle pasture on the alpha and beta diversity, abundance, biomass and species composition of dung beetles with different dispersal ability. Dung beetles were captured in 19 forest fragments and neighbouring pastures. Forest fragment area ranged from 3.7 to 4825 ha and in this study were grouped into four categories: small, medium, large and control forest. A total of 35,048 dung beetles representing 101 species were collected. Forest fragments had the highest richness with 81 species, followed by pasture with 58 species. Replacement of forest by pasture reduced species richness; however, due to the proximity and connectivity of these areas with Cerrado patches, pastures also had high species richness, but species composition was independent of adjacent fragments. Small fragments had lower abundance and species richness than our other habitat categories, even pastures. Our results highlight that proximity and connectivity with Cerrado areas influenced the patterns of alpha and beta diversity of dung beetles in fragments and pastures. We highlight that the ability to cross the pasture matrix is a strong adaptive trait for species living in human-modified landscapes. Consequently, species with these abilities are less susceptible to the effects of forest fragmentation and local extinction. Our results reinforce the importance of considering the biogeographic location and distribution pattern of species in forest fragmentation studies.

AB Understanding and quantification of phosphorus (P) fluxes are key requirements for predictions of future forest ecosystems changes as well as for transferring lessons learned from natural ecosystems to croplands and plantations. This review summarizes and evaluates the recent knowledge on mechanisms, magnitude, and relevance by which dissolved and colloidal inorganic and organic P forms can be translocated within or exported from forest ecosystems. Attention is paid to hydrological pathways of P losses at the soil profile and landscape scales, and the subsequent influence of P on aquatic ecosystems. New (unpublished) data from the German Priority Program 1685 Ecosystem Nutrition: Forest Strategies for limited Phosphorus Resources were added to provide up-to-date flux-based information. Nitrogen (N) additions increase the release of water-transportable P forms. Most P found in percolates and pore waters belongs to the so-called dissolved organic P (DOP) fractions, rich in orthophosphate-monoesters and also containing some orthophosphate-diesters. Total solution P concentrations range from ca. 1 to 400 mu g P L-1, with large variations among forest stands. Recent sophisticated analyses revealed that large portions of the DOP in forest stream water can comprise natural nanoparticles and fine colloids which under extreme conditions may account for 40-100% of the P losses. Their translocation within preferential flow passes may be rapid, mediated by storm events. The potential total P loss through leaching into subsoils and with streams was found to be less than 50 mg P m(-2) a(-1), suggesting effects on ecosystems at centennial to millennium scale. All current data are based on selected snapshots only. Quantitative measurements of P fluxes in temperate forest systems are nearly absent in the literature, probably due to main research focus on the C and N cycles. Therefore, we lack complete ecosystem-based assessments of dissolved and colloidal P fluxes within and from temperate forest systems.

AB Large areas of rainforest in Asia have been converted to plantations, with uncertain effects on soil biodiversity. Using standard metagenetic methods, we compared the soil biota of bacteria, fungi, and nematodes at three rainforest sites in Malaysia with two rubber plantation sites with similar soils and geology. We predicted the following: (1) that the rubber sites would have a lower alpha- and beta-diversity than the rainforest sites, due to the monospecific canopy cover and intensive management with herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers, and (2) that due to differences in the physical and biotic environment associated with cultivation, there would be distinct communities of bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. However, regarding (1), the results showed no consistent difference in alpha- and beta-diversity of bacteria, fungi, or nematodes between rainforest and rubber plantation sites. It appears that conversion of rainforest to rubber plantations does not necessarily result in a decrease in diversity of soil biota. It may be that heterogeneity associated with the cultivation regimen compensates for loss of biotically imposed heterogeneity of the original rainforest. Regarding (2), as predicted there were statistically significant differences in community composition between rainforest and rubber plantation for bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. These differences could be related to a range of factors including light level, litter fall composition, pH, C and N, selecting a distinct set of soil taxa, and it is possible that this in itself would affect long-term soil function.

AB The usual approach to reconstructing long-term vegetation dynamics is through the use of fossil pollen records from sedimentary sequences. This requires, however, an understanding of the relationship between modern pollen and the species composition and distribution on landscapes. Since different taxa produce different amounts of pollen, with different dispersal characteristics, understanding this relationship can be complex. This research aimed to address the following questions: Is it possible to distinguish different high-altitude forests by modem pollen signature? Is modern pollen abundance related to forest structure, forest diversity or to differences in altitude? How well can modern and fossil pollen assemblages reveal changes in the forest composition over the past similar to 1300 years?
   Data were collected on present-day forest composition and structure and diversity, paired with modern pollen samples in three high-altitude forest types: pine forest, cloud forest and a transitional forest (a mixture of Pinus-Quercus-Carpinus) in west-central Mexico. A sediment core was collected from each vegetation type for reconstructing past vegetation. Constrained and unconstrained ordination methods were used to discern patterns of variation and the correlates behind the datasets. To compare the fossil with the modern pollen assemblages, dissimilarity indexes were computed between each of the fossil pollen sequences and their modern assemblages at different altitudes using the chord distance.
   Results demonstrated that each of the three forests types was distinctive in composition, and modern and fossil pollen reflected local vegetation at stand level; mean diameter and altitude were the main variables related to differences among modern pollen signatures. When reconstructing high-altitude vegetation in the subtropics, it is important to consider all taxa, even if they are rare. Therefore, in order to reveal responses to climate change and human disturbances at stand level in forests at different successional stages; particularly from 10(2) to 10(4) m(2) and, at temporal scales from 10(2) to 10(3) years, it is essential to combine modern and fossil pollen together with present-day vegetation records.

AB Understanding how wetland organisms interact with neighbor habitats along environmental gradients is important to recognize wetland integrity and its connectivity at landscape-level. We evaluated whether assemblage characteristics (e.g. alpha-diversity) of marsh-ants are associated with geographic changes in environmental conditions, and if these factors are associated with marsh-upland dissimilarity in ant species composition (beta-diversity). Ant-samples were collected both in the marsh and in the neighboring upland habitat at 5-sites along the South-west Atlantic (SWA) coastline (36A degrees S to 40A degrees S), encompassing two-distinct biogeographic regions. Generalized Linear Models showed that at the marsh scale, ant occurrence increased with maximum temperature and Spartina densiflora cover, but decreased with total-plant cover. Ant richness increased with salinity, S. densiflora cover and marsh area; and ant alpha-diversity increased with S. densiflora cover and decreased with total marsh plant cover and plant height. Composition of ant assemblages differed between the marsh and the upland habitat depending on the site, and beta-diversity decreased with precipitation, salinity, tidal amplitude and alpha-diversity of the herbaceous stratum. Then, the abundance and alpha-diversity of ants varied along SWA marshes in relation to changes in local environmental factors and the regional landscape. Moreover, changes in species characteristics across coastal-landscape seem to interact with environmental gradients, resulting in reduced beta-diversity values with increasing environmental harshness. Thus, our results suggest that the link of geographic changes in the physical environment with the changes in species traits drives the variation in marsh-upland dissimilarity across the space.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a major threat to biodiversity, as it can alter ecological processes at various spatial and trophic scales. At the species level, fragmentation leading to the isolation of populations can trigger reductions in genetic diversity, potentially having detrimental effects on population fitness, adaptability and ultimately population persistence. Leptomyrmex pallens is a widespread rainforest ant endemic to New Caledonia but now confined to habitat patches that have been fragmented by anthropogenic fire regimes over the last 200 years. We investigated the social structure of L. pallens in the Aoupini, region (c.a. 4900 ha), and assessed the impacts of habitat fragmentation on its population genetic structure. Allele frequencies at 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci were compared among 411 worker ants from 21 nests distributed across the region. High within-nest relatedness (r = 0.70 +/- 0.02), and a single queen found in 38 % of the nests by pedigree analysis indicate that the species is monogynous to weakly polygynous. Estimates of gene flow and genetic structure across the region were subsequently determined using a combined dataset of single workers per nest and of unrelated foraging workers. These estimates coupled with a comprehensive landscape genetic analysis revealed no evidence of significant population structure or habitat effects, suggesting that the Aoupini, region harbours a single panmictic population. In contrast, analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data revealed a high degree of genetic structuring, indicating limited maternal gene flow and suggesting that gene flow among nests is driven primarily by winged males. Overall these findings suggest that fire-induced habitat fragmentation has had little impact on the population dynamics of L. pallens. Additional studies of less mobile species should therefore be conducted to gain further insights into fire related disturbances on the unique biodiversity and function of New Caledonian ecosystems.

AB Canopy gaps play a significant role in maintaining structure and composition of tropical forests. This study was carried out in tropical evergreen forests of central Western Ghats in India to understand the influence of canopy gap size and the relationship of gap regime attributes to diversity measures and regeneration. The average gap size in the study area was found to be 396 m(2) and around half of gaps were 4-8 years old. Gaps created by natural single tree fall were smaller in size but significantly higher in number. Diversity and regeneration of woody species were compared with canopy gaps and intact vegetation. Species richness and diversity was higher in gaps than in intact vegetation. Macaranga peltata, a shade intolerant species dominated gaps while intact vegetation was dominated by shade tolerant Kingiodendron pinnatum. Gap size significantly influenced species diversity and regeneration. Gap area and age were significantly and negatively correlated with diversity measures but positively correlated with regeneration. Among all the attributes of gaps, regeneration was significantly positively correlated with light intensity. Gaps maintained species diversity and favored regeneration of woody species. In addition to gap size and age, other gap ecological attributes also affected species diversity and regeneration.

AB Interactions between plants and insect herbivores are important determinants of plant productivity in managed and natural vegetation. In response to attack, plants have evolved a range of defenses to reduce the threat of injury and loss of productivity. Crop losses from damage caused by arthropod pests can exceed 15% annually. Crop domestication and selection for improved yield and quality can alter the defensive capability of the crop, increasing reliance on artificial crop protection. Sustainable agriculture, however, depends on reduced chemical inputs. There is an urgent need, therefore, to identify plant defensive traits for crop improvement. Plant defense can be divided into resistance and tolerance strategies. Plant traits that confer herbivore resistance typically prevent or reduce herbivore damage through expression of traits that deter pests from settling, attaching to surfaces, feeding and reproducing, or that reduce palatability. Plant tolerance of herbivory involves expression of traits that limit the negative impact of herbivore damage on productivity and yield. Identifying the defensive traits expressed by plants to deter herbivores or limit herbivore damage, and understanding the underlying defense mechanisms, is crucial for crop scientists to exploit plant defensive traits in crop breeding. In this review, we assess the traits and mechanisms underpinning herbivore resistance and tolerance, and conclude that physical defense traits, plant vigor and herbivore-induced plant volatiles show considerable utility in pest control, along with mixed species crops. We highlight emerging approaches for accelerating the identification of plant defensive traits and facilitating their deployment to improve the future sustainability of crop protection.

AB The simplest theories often have much merit and many limitations, and, in this vein, the value of neutral theory (NT) of biodiversity has been the subject of much debate over the past 15 years. NT was proposed at the turn of the century by Stephen Hubbell to explain several patterns observed in the organization of ecosystems. Among ecologists, it had a polarizing effect: There were a few ecologists who were enthusiastic, and there were a larger number who firmly opposed it. Physicists and mathematicians, instead, welcomed the theory with excitement. Indeed, NT spawned several theoretical studies that attempted to explain empirical data and predicted trends of quantities that had not yet been studied. While there are a few reviews of NT oriented toward ecologists, the goal here is to review the quantitative aspects of NT and its extensions for physicists who are interested in learning what NT is, what its successes are, and what important problems remain unresolved. Furthermore, this review could also be of interest to theoretical ecologists because many potentially interesting results are buried in the vast NT literature. It is proposed to make these more accessible by extracting them and presenting them in a logical fashion. The focus of this review is broader than NT: new, more recent approaches for studying ecological systems and how one might introduce realistic non-neutral models are also discussed.

AB Habitat fragmentation is one of the principal causes of biodiversity loss and hence understanding its impacts on community assembly and disassembly is an important topic in ecology. We studied the relationships between fragmentation and community assembly processes in the land-bridge island system of Thousand Island Lake in East China. We focused on the changes in species diversity and phylogenetic diversity that occurred between life stages of woody plants growing on these islands. The observed diversities were compared with the expected diversities from random null models to characterize assembly processes. Regression tree analysis was used to illustrate the relationships between island attributes and community assembly processes. We found that different assembly processes predominate in the seedlings-to-saplings life-stage transition (SS) vs. the saplings-to-trees transition (ST). Island area was the main attribute driving the assembly process in SS. In ST, island isolation was more important. Within a fragmented landscape, the factors driving community assembly processes were found to differ between life stage transitions. Environmental filtering had a strong effect on the seedlings-to-saplings life-stage transition. Habitat isolation and dispersal limitation influenced all plant life stages, but had a weaker effect on communities than area. These findings add to our understanding of the processes driving community assembly and species coexistence in the context of pervasive and widespread habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB Subtropical forests across south China have been extensively affected by anthropogenic disturbances with potential profound effects on plant biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF). However, whether and to what degree biodiversity influences biomass of subtropical forests remains uncertain. In this study, we analyzed the effects of tree biodiversity (species diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity) on stand biomass at three stages (early, mid and late) of succession in subtropical forests. As forest succession progressed, we found that the changes in species diversity were different compared with those of functional and phylogenetic diversity. Most of the indices of species and functional and phylogenetic diversity were not significantly correlated with stand biomass at two spatial grains (plot sizes of 10 m x 10 m and 20 m x 30 m). However, when other abiotic and biotic factors (i.e., altitude, canopy light, stem density and forest phase) were included with diversity indices in mixed models to explain biomass, the effect of functional diversity on biomass was significant at both resolution. For species diversity indices, the effect was significant at the 20 m x 30 m resolution, and phylogenetic diversity had no significant effect. Our results indicate that biodiversity affects forest biomass during the succession of a subtropical forest and suggest that functional diversity may provide a better metric than species or phylogenetic diversity for determining the biodiversity effect on biomass. Moreover, our results indicate that the diverse conclusions reached in other BEF analyses might be explained by differences in the plot size examined and the diversity metrics selected. Because the bivariate relationship between biodiversity and biomass can be strongly confounded by covarying abiotic and biotic factors, we suggest that the effects of abiotic factors, succession stage, and management practices on BEF should be carefully considered in future research.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) utilization may be affected by agricultural complexity, in particular when combining annual crops and livestock grazing on the same land area and at overlapping times. Our objectives were to qualify and quantify soil organic and inorganic P compounds using sodium hydroxide-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaOH-EDTA) extraction and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) in response to increasing complexity with integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) in subtropical Brazil. Soil at a depth of 0-5 cm was collected from three long-term (7 to 12 years) cropping studies with and without ruminant grazing of cover crops. All sites were managed under no tillage, and treatments with livestock were managed with moderate grazing intensity. In these agro-ecosystems, grazing compared with no-grazing had greater soil P content as total and bioavailable orthophosphate and lower soil organic P and fewer monoesters, including inositol phosphates. Grazing increased P bioavailability and reduced recalcitrant organic P concentration in soil; therefore, cropping systems that integrate livestock (ICLS) can be a sustainable alternative to improve P use in farming systems of subtropical Brazil.

AB Over a 3 yr period fine-scale (m) movements of red snapper Lutjanus campechanus were estimated with the Vemco VR2W Positioning System (VPS) on 3 artificial reefs, and wider scale (km) movements were estimated with surrounding receivers (n = 23). Tagged red snapper (n = 56) were tracked for extended periods (17-1096 d). Residency (23 mo) and site fidelity (82% yr(-1)) showed that red snapper maintained a close association with the artificial reef structure (34.5 +/- 44.0 m). Fine-scale monthly home range (95% kernel density estimates [KDE]) and core areas (50% KDE) were positively correlated with water temperature. In the winter, all red snapper showed less movement, and during the warmer months most (63%, 29 out of 46) fish used a secondary reef site. Over diel periods, fish showed significantly greater movements during day hours on 2 reef sites and during night hours on 1 reef site. The surrounding receiver array validated 88% (15 of 17 fish) of the VPS-determined emigrations. Many (53%, n = 9) fish moved short distances (similar to 1.5 km) to nearby reefs, and some red snappers (n = 3) that emigrated returned to their original release site. Red snapper showed some prey-like behaviors, e. g. close association with reef structure, quick movements over open habitat, and paired emigrations to nearby sites. These behaviors suggested that red snapper are subject to predation by larger apex predators, and as stocks increase, such factors will become increasingly more important for future management.

AB Protected areas form a quintessential component of the global strategy to perpetuate tropical biodiversity within relatively undisturbed wildlands, but they are becoming increasingly isolated by rapid agricultural encroachment. Here we consider a network of 788 forest protected areas (PM) in the world's largest tropical country to examine the degree to which they remain intact, and their responses to multiple biophysical and socioeconomic variables potentially affecting natural habitat loss under varying contexts of rural development. PAs within the complex Brazilian National System of Conservation Units (SNUG) are broken down into two main classes-strictly protected and sustainable use. Collectively, these account for 22.6% of the forest biorries within Brazil's national territory, primarily within the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest, but are widely variable in size, ecoregional representation management strategy, and the degree to which they are threatened by human activities both within and outside reserve boundaries. In particular, we examine the variation in habitat conversion rates in both strictly protected and sustainable use reserves as a function of the internal and external human population density, and levels of land use revenue in adjacent human-dominated landscapes. Our results show that PAs surrounded by heavily settled agro-pastoral landscapes face much greater challenges in retaining their natural vegetation and that strictly protected areas are considerably less degraded than sustainable use reserves, which can rival levels of habitat degradation within adjacent 10-km buffer areas outside.

AB Amazonia is the most biodiverse rainforest on Earth, and the debate over how many tree species grow there remains contentious. Here we provide a checklist of all tree species collected to date, and describe spatial and temporal trends in data accumulation. We report 530,025 unique collections of trees in Amazonia, dating between 1707 and 2015, for a total of 11,676 species in 1225 genera and 140 families. These figures support recent estimates of 16,000 total Amazonian tree species based on ecological plot data from the Amazonian Tree Diversity Network. Botanical collection in Amazonia is characterized by three major peaks, centred around 1840, 1920, and 1980, which are associated with flora projects and the establishment of inventory plots. Most collections were made in the 20th century. The number of collections has increased exponentially, but shows a slowdown in the last two decades. We find that a species' range size is a better predictor of the number of times it has been collected than the species' estimated basin-wide population size. Finding, describing, and documenting the distribution of the remaining species will require coordinated efforts at under-collected sites.

AB Background: The atmospheric CO2 concentration is rising continuously, and abnormal precipitation may occur more frequently in the future. Although the effects of elevated CO2 and drought on plants have been well reported individually, little is known about their interaction, particularly over a water status gradient. Here, we aimed to characterize the effects of elevated CO2 and a water status gradient on the growth, photosynthetic capacity, and mesophyll cell ultrastructure of a dominant grass from a degraded grassland.
   Results: Elevated CO2 stimulated plant biomass to a greater extent under moderate changes in water status than under either extreme drought or over-watering conditions. Photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance were also enhanced by elevated CO2 under moderate drought, but inhibited with over-watering. Severe drought distorted mesophyll cell organelles, but CO2 enrichment partly alleviated this effect. Intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) and total biomass water use efficiency (WUEt) were increased by elevated CO2, regardless of water status. Plant structural traits were also found to be tightly associated with photosynthetic potentials.
   Conclusion: The results indicated that CO2 enrichment alleviated severe and moderate drought stress, and highlighted that CO2 fertilization's dependency on water status should be considered when projecting key species' responses to climate change in dry ecosystems.

AB Background: To investigate the effect of environmental factors such as light and shade on essential oil yield and morphological traits of Moroccan Myrtus communis, a chemometric study was conducted on 20 individuals growing under two contrasting light environments.
   Results: The study of individual's parameters by principal component analysis has shown that essential oil yield, altitude, and leaves thickness were positively correlated between them and negatively correlated with plants height, leaves length and leaves width. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis have also shown that the individuals of each sampling site were grouped separately. The one-way ANOVA test has confirmed the effect of light and shade on essential oil yield and morphological parameters by showing a statistically significant difference between them from the shaded side to the sunny one. Finally, the multiple linear model containing main, interaction and quadratic terms was chosen for the modeling of essential oil yield in terms of morphological parameters.
   Conclusions: Sun plants have a small height, small leaves length and width, but they are thicker and richer in essential oil than shade plants which have shown almost the opposite. The highlighted multiple linear model can be used to predict essential oil yield in the studied area.

AB Soil invertebrates such as ants are thought to be important manipulators of soils in temperate and tropical ecosystems. The fungus gardening ant, Trachymyrmex septentrionalis, is an important agent of biomantling, that is, of depositing soil excavated from below onto the surface, and has been suggested as an agent of bioturbation (moving soil below ground) as well. The amount of bioturbation by this ant was quantified by planting queenright colonies in sand columns consisting of 5 layers of different colored sand. The amount of each color of sand deposited on the surface was determined from April to November 2015. In November, colonies were excavated and the color and amount of sand deposited below ground (mostly as backfill in chambers) was determined. Extrapolated to one ha, T. septentrionalis deposited 800 kg of sand per annum on the surface, and an additional 200 kg (17% of the total excavated) below ground. On average, this mixes 1.3% of the sand from other layers within the top meter of soil per millennium, but this mixing is unlikely to be homogeneous, and probably occurs as "hotspots" in both horizontal and vertical space. Such mixing is discussed as a challenge to sediment dating by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL).

AB Functional analysis of secondary succession may allow identifying and predicting processes of community assembly, which can be simultaneously driven by factors related to ecological filters and neutral forces. This study evaluated trait-convergence assembly patterns and trait-divergence assembly patterns in successional areas of Araucaria forest. Plant species were sampled in both the upper and lower strata and were described by 15 functional traits. Data analyses were based on multiplication and Procrustes adjustment of matrices, which permit to discriminate trait-convergence assembly patterns and trait-divergence assembly patterns along the forest succession (our environmental variable), and the influence of phylogeny on these patterns. Initial and late forests were highly different in species composition, but the regenerating stratum was already more similar especially in functional terms. Traits related to the acquisitive-conservative trade-off (wood density, leaf nitrogen content, leaf area, leaf dry matter content) revealed strong convergent patterns of successional changes. Moreover divergence was maximized by specific leaf area, seed mass, deciduousness, and dispersal mode, showing a higher functional diversity in late Araucaria forests.

AB Leaves of Omphalea oleifera Hemsl. damaged by Urania fulgens Walker were examined. Leaves were anatomically described, histochemical tests were performed and the content of lignin and phenolic acids estimated. Morpho-anatomical features were similar in damaged leaves and the control, but minor histochemical differences were observed. The tissues adjacent to the damage showed lignin deposits and calcium oxalate crystals. The estimated amounts of lignin and cafeic, ferulic and chlorogenic acids were respectively 11% and 109.65, 16.58 and 0.082 mu g.g(-1) dry wt in the damaged leaves, whereas for the intact were 7%, 97.65, 5.48 and 0.051 mu g.g(-1) dry wt. The results suggest that the insect damage triggers induced responses in O. oleifera including production and accumulation of phenolic compounds and calcium oxalate crystals on the leaf tissues.

AB The tree Piptadenia gonoachantha is widely used in forestry and in forest restoration projects, which require methods for evaluating tree growth. Long-term studies are necessary to determine patterns and detect changes in species growth rhythms. Tree ring analysis provides a precise method for determining age and documenting long-term growth trends in tropical tree species. The present study evaluated the periodicity of tree ring formation and radial growth dynamics of P. gonoachantha from a population of known age in the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve. Two radii from six trees were sampled using non-destructive methods. Tree rings were counted and measured to estimate age and to calculate diametric increment. All samples had 16 tree rings, which matched the known plantation age and confirmed the annual formation of rings. The individuals sampled had a mean annual diametric increment of 9.5 mm / year. Results showed a trend towards decreasing growth rate with increasing age. Individuals of P. gonoachantha in Ombrophilous Dense Forest produce annual tree rings, which holds potential for future dendroecological studies.

AB The concept of limiting similarity predicts that closely related taxa are less likely to co-occur than expected by chance. The degree to which the phylogenetic relatedness in plant communities is in accord with limiting similarity has been little tested at the scale where the consequences of adaptive differentiation during speciation should be most evident: the scale of neighboring, congeneric plants within a community. To quantify species co-occurrence patterns in relation to environment, we sampled sedge species, their rooting level relative to the water table, and the water pH in 2,124 0.25 m(2) quadrats distributed across 29 subarctic fens in the central Labrador Peninsula. We estimated phylogenetic relationships using four DNA regions (ETS, ITS, matK, trnL-trnF) for all species of Carex (42), Eriophorum (6), and Trichophorum (2) in the region, of which 21, four, and two, respectively, occurred in the sampled fens. We demonstrate that closely related species of Carex are less likely to co-occur than expected by chance using 1) a probabilistic method to test the significance of pairwise co-occurrence patterns of species, and 2) linear mixed modeling to relate these patterns to phylogenetic relationships and ecological tolerances along gradients of substrate pH and rooting level in relation to the water table. The results also indicate that suites of species with significant mutual pairwise co-occurrence belong to distant lineages within the Cariceae-Dulichieae-Scirpeae clade of Cyperaceae and have stabilizing niche differences. We suggest that niche differentiation during the evolution and diversification of a clade of wetland Carex species over the past few million years, especially during the dynamic glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, has resulted in diverse sedge communities that share space and resources in harsh northern peatland habitats.

AB The mobility and dispersal of organisms affect population genetics and dynamics, and consequently affect persistence and the risk of extinction. Thus, it is important to understand how organisms move in the fragmented landscapes in order to manage populations and predict the effects of habitat changes on species persistence. This study evaluated the functional connectivity of an orchid bee (Eulaema atleticana Nemesio, 2009) with a high fidelity to forest habitats in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Corridor by analyzing genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, and gene flow estimated from microsatellite and mitochondrial markers. Genetic diversity was not correlated with area of the forest fragments, or with forest isolation. At the mosaic scale, Eulaema atleticana showed no significant or low genetic differentiation, indicating genetic homogeneity among forest fragments. A previous field study indicated that Eulaema atleticana was one of the most sensitive Euglossina bees to forest fragmentation but the present molecular analyses demonstrates that current gene flow is sufficient to maintain genetic variability at the mosaic scale.

AB The effects of riparian forest removal on a neotropical stream fish assemblage were assessed in the Mata Atlantica. Fish assemblage structure and fish feeding patterns were quantified at three sites along a pristine-to-deforested gradient in a Serra do Mar stream: (1) a pristine site fully covered by canopy with no light penetration and transparent waters, (2) an intermediate site with partially removed forest and (3) a fully removed forest site with no canopy and full light penetration where siltation and turbid waters predominate. Fish assemblage structure, fish densities and their feeding patterns differed widely among sites. Whilst the same five fish species occurred at the three sites, forest removal favoured the occurrence of sediment-tolerant iliophagous benthic species at the deforested site. At the pristine site, invertebrate prey predominated in water column fish diet and feeding overlap among species was low. Severe shifts in the feeding patterns were noticed in both deforested sites. Invertebrates were replaced by detritus, organic matter and algae at both sites and feeding overlap increased markedly. The overwhelming feeding adaptability of these neotropical fishes appeared capable of buffering the deleterious effects of forest removal on stream quality in terms of increased light penetration, siltation and water turbidity. Forest cutting in this Mata Atlantica stream clearly caused strong functional changes associated with forest clearance through important modifications in the assemblage organization and trophic patterns of the main species, but did not eliminate species.

AB Biodiversity and spatial-temporal distribution of hermit crabs captured as bycatch in the nonselective fishery of shrimp were analyzed in this study from July 2010 through June 2011 off coast Santa Catarina State (southern Brazil). Ecological indexes and redundancy analyses were conducted to understand the hermit community and their relationship with environmental factors. In total, 644 specimens were collected, representing two families, five genera, and six species, demonstrating remarkable species richness in the study area, mainly because Santa Catarina is a subtropical region. Isocheles sawayai showed the highest abundance, followed by Loxopagurus loxochelis. Both species demonstrated correlation with temperature (positive) and sediment grain size (negative). The highest richness and evenness values were estimated at the deeper area (17 m). However, in 5 m deep area showed the lowest evenness because of the high dominance of I. sawayai, resulting in a lower estimated diversity. During a period of lower temperature and higher salinity (July), higher levels of diversity were registered, probably because of the lower dominance of tropical species (I. sawayai) and the presence of some species distributed in offshore regions (Petrochirus diogenes, Dardanus insignis and Pagurus exilis). Thus, we detected that the capture effort designated in the shrimp fishery activities had a strong influence in the diversity of hermit crabs and other associated fauna, especially because of catch specimens in expressive abundance at various stages of development, including juveniles. This profile makes us argue in favor of constant monitoring of bycatch resources in order to preserve the marine fauna.

AB In this paper, we present a third-grade ecology learning environment that integrates two forms of modeling-embodied modeling and agent-based modeling (ABMs)-through the generation of mathematical representations that are common to both forms of modeling. The term "agent" in the context of ABMs indicates individual computational objects or actors that obey simple rules assigned or controlled by the user. It is the interactions between these agents that give rise to emergent, aggregate-level behaviors in complex systems. While several researchers have argued for the effectiveness of ABMs for learning about complex systems, the design of classroom activity systems using ABMs, especially for elementary students, has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we report on a 2-week long proof-of-concept study conducted in a third-grade classroom of 15 students in which students began with an embodied modeling activity of foraging behavior, followed with the generation of mathematical inscriptions based on their embodied actions, and finally, conducted further inquiry of interdependence in an ecosystem using two separate ABMs. Furthermore, we show that the lens of mechanistic reasoning can be productively used to identify the process of students' conceptual development of interdependence in an ecosystem as they engage in the modeling activities.

AB Polyploidy is a common mode of speciation that can have far-reaching consequences for plant ecology and evolution. Because polyploidy can induce an array of phenotypic changes, there can be cascading effects on interactions with other species. These interactions, in turn, can have reciprocal effects on polyploid plants, potentially impacting their establishment and persistence. Although there is a wealth of information on the genetic and phenotypic effects of polyploidy, the study of species interactions in polyploid plants remains a comparatively young field. Here we reviewed the available evidence for how polyploidy may impact many types of species interactions that range from mutualism to antagonism. Specifically, we focused on three main questions: (1) Does polyploidy directly cause the formation of novel interactions not experienced by diploids, or does it create an opportunity for natural selection to then form novel interactions? (2) Does polyploidy cause consistent, predictable changes in species interactions vs. the evolution of idiosyncratic differences? (3) Does polyploidy lead to greater evolvability in species interactions? From the scarce evidence available, we found that novel interactions are rare but that polyploidy can induce changes in pollinator, herbivore, and pathogen interactions. Although further tests are needed, it is likely that selection following whole-genome duplication is important in all types of species interaction and that there are circumstances in which polyploidy can enhance the evolvability of interactions with other species.

AB Edge effects have been studied extensively in fragmented landscapes, often with conflicting findings. Edge effects may also be important in other situations, such as linear clearings (e.g. along roads, power lines or train tracks). We tested for responses of small mammals to a narrow (c. 10 m) linear clearing created by a railway in the largest area of Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. Only two environmental variables, light intensity and train noise, were greatest at the edge and decreased with distance from the edge. Temperature differed (greater extremes and more variable) only at the edge itself. The few small mammal species that were only rarely captured at the edge resulted in an apparent edge-effect with respect to species richness. The abundance of small mammals, however, was independent of distance from the railway. There was no correlation between resource availability at the tracks and abundance of small mammals. Edge effects were minimal, which suggests that narrow railways (in contrast with roads) in unfragmented landscapes probably do not have a significant impact (if any) on wildlife, as found elsewhere and especially in tropical forests. The use of railways instead of roads is a potential strategy to minimize the effects of traversing important habitats for commercial reasons.

AB Forest degradation is the long-term and gradual reduction of canopy cover due to forest fire and unsustainable logging. A critical consequence of this process is increased atmospheric carbon emissions. Although this issue is gaining attention, forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon has not yet been properly addressed. The claim here is that this process is not constant throughout Amazonia and varies according to colonization frontiers. Moreover, the accurate characterization of degradation requires lengthy observation periods to track gradual forest changes. The forest degradation process, the associated timeframe, spatial patterns, trajectories, and extent were characterized in the context of the Amazon frontiers of the 1990s using 28 years (1984-2011) of annual Landsat images. Given the large database and the characteristic of logging and burning, this study used data mining techniques and cell approach classification to analyze the spatial patterns and to construct associated trajectories. Multi-temporal analysis indicated that forest degradation in the last two decades has caused as many interannual landscape changes as have clear-cuts. In addition, selective logging, as a major aspect of forest degradation, affected a larger amount of forest land than did forest fire. Although a large proportion of logged forest was deforested in the following years, selective logging did not always precede complete deforestation. Instead, the results indicate that logged forests were abandoned for approximately 4 years before clearance. Throughout the forest degradation process, there were no recurrent forest fires, and loggers did not revisit the forest. Forest degradation mostly occurred as a result of a single selective logging event and was associated with low-intensity forest damage.

AB In this study, I tested the effect of Syagrus loefgrenii nut number on the removal intensity by rodents across seasons. Also, I assessed both S. loefgrenii fruit production, and dispersion pattern to analyze the relationship between these parameters and nut removal. Trials were performed (autumn, winter, spring, and summer), in which endocarps were placed inside trays (5, 15, and 40 endocarps) in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna). Syagrus loefgrenii exhibited clumped distribution, although its local density had no correlation with endocarp removal rate. Despite of variations, S. loefgrenii fruit production had no seasonal difference, although, high proportions of endocarps were year round removed. This mostly results from nearly complete endocarp loss in depots of 5 and 15, while the opposite occurred in those of 40. Hence, the intensity of removal consistently decreases with endocarp number, so that endocarp removal conformed to negative distance-dependence. As this palm exhibit clumped distribution and, in principle, fruit asynchronously, if, at least, a group of neighboring stems bore fruits simultaneously, an enhanced number of nuts might be available at a given site. Therefore, seeds within a dense S. loefgrenii fruit patch might experience high survival rates due to satiation of post dispersal seed predators.

AB Throughout the developing world, mobile phones are spreading rapidly into rural areas where subsistence livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and human-wildlife conflict (HWC) are each common. Despite this trend, little is known about the relationship between mobile phones and HWC in conservation landscapes. This paper examines this relationship within ethnically Maasai communities in northern Tanzania on the border of Tarangire National Park. Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection and analysis are used to (1) describe how Maasai agro-pastoralists use phones to manage human-wildlife interactions; and (2) assess the relationship between phone use and measures of HWC, controlling for other factors. The findings indicate that households use phones to reduce the number and severity of HWC events and that the relationship between phones and HWC varies according to the type of HWC.

AB Red wood ants (RWA) are of great ecological importance for the forest ecosystem. Forestry practices, like clear-cutting, and trampling load, due to tourism, logging, and grazing stock, can greatly affect their colonies, disturbing their microhabitat. RWA in Greek forests have not been investigated so far. We herein report on the distribution and morphological traits of Formica lugubris mounds studied in Elatia forest (Rhodope mountains, Northern Greece), an all-aged managed mixed forest where selective logging practices are performed. Nearby vegetation, slope, canopy cover, shrub density, and distance from the nearest neighboring trees were also recorded. Mound density was shown to be much higher in this Greek forest compared to RWA mounds in other European-managed forests. Furthermore, we recorded a continuous nest establishment, despite forest management disturbances and trampling load. Our study suggests that single-tree selective forestry practices are essential for creating ideal microhabitats for the RWA and, therefore, for maintaining RWA populations.

AB Streams and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by permeable boundaries that are crossed by resource subsidies. Although the importance of these subsidies for riverine ecosystems is increasingly recognized, little is known about how they may be influenced by global environmental change. Drawing from available evidence, in this review we propose a conceptual framework to evaluate the effects of global change on the quality and spatiotemporal dynamics of stream-terrestrial subsidies. We illustrate how changes to hydrological and temperature regimes, atmospheric CO2 concentration, land use and the distribution of nonindigenous species can influence subsidy fluxes by affecting the biology and ecology of donor and recipient systems and the physical characteristics of stream-riparian boundaries. Climate-driven changes in the physiology and phenology of organisms with complex life cycles will influence their development time, body size and emergence patterns, with consequences for adjacent terrestrial consumers. Also, novel species interactions can modify subsidy dynamics via complex bottom-up and top-down effects. Given the seasonality and pulsed nature of subsidies, alterations of the temporal and spatial synchrony of resource availability to consumers across ecosystems are likely to result in ecological mismatches that can scale up from individual responses, to communities, to ecosystems. Similarly, altered hydrology, temperature, CO2 concentration and land use will modify the recruitment and quality of riparian vegetation, the timing of leaf abscission and the establishment of invasive riparian species. Along with morphological changes to stream-terrestrial boundaries, these will alter the use and fluxes of allochthonous subsidies associated with stream ecosystems. Future research should aim to understand how subsidy dynamics will be affected by key drivers of global change, including agricultural intensification, increasing water use and biotic homogenization. Our conceptual framework based on the match-mismatch between donor and recipient organisms may facilitate understanding of the multiple effects of global change and aid in the development of future research questions.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between availability and consumption of food for two species of Neotropical fruit bats Carollia perspicillata and Sturnira lilium. The study was conducted in the Parque Estadual Mata dos Godoy, an Atlantic forest fragment with 680 ha in size. Monthly bat surveys were conducted at four sampling points (four nights with four mist nets per night during 6 h after sunset). The available fruit biomass of nine Piper species and seven Solanum species was measured, as well as the biomass consumed by C. perspicillata and S. lilium. We found a significant positive correlation between fruit biomass consumption and availability for both bat species. The proportion of available/eaten biomass only showed a significant difference for S. lilium, with a higher value in Solanum. The amount of biomass eaten was different only for P. umbellatum and P. glabratum between bat species. Carollia perspicillata mainly consumed fruits of two Piper species, whereas S. lilium consumed fruits of two different Piper species as well as a greater variety of Solanum fruits.

AB Aims We evaluated whether habitat association is consistent between two tree life history stages, young and adult, and whether spatial gradients explain species composition variation.
   Methods We investigated habitat association of tree assemblages using multivariate regression tree analysis (MRT). Habitat preference was assayed using indicator species analysis. We addressed the contribution of pure environment (i.e. habitat), spatially structured environment and pure space on species composition variation using variation partitioning by partial redundancy analysis (pRDA). Principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) were used to produce spatial regressors.
   Results Habitat association changed during plant ontogeny. Flooding depth explained differences in species composition at young tree stages. Distribution pattern of adult trees was explained by spatial variation in soil fertility. Pure space explained a higher fraction of community variability of young trees (16 %) than habitat (5 %). In contrast, adult trees were structured mostly by habitat (10 %).
   Conclusions Niche expansion was observed along tree ontogeny, with adult trees occupying a wider range of flooding conditions. The higher effect of pure space on young tree distribution highlights the importance of distance-dependent processes (e.g. dispersal) on the variation in community composition. The large unexplained component resulted from variation partitioning indicates that stochastic environmental events (e.g. climate histories) might contribute to explaining tree assemblage dynamics in the Pantanal system.

AB Pasture and crop lands restrict seed dispersal near remnant forest fragments, especially by restricting the movements of dispersal agents and limiting propagule dispersal. Some factors can improve seed dispersal in open areas, such as the presence of high numbers of isolated trees in close proximity to forest fragments. We sought to determine if: (i) the structural characteristics and (ii) densities of isolated trees in pasture lands, and (iii) their distances from the forest fragments, infl uence seed dispersal. We installed 18 seed traps in each of six pastures (total= 108 traps) bordering forest fragments distributed over 6 distance classes from the forest edges (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 m). We determined the characteristics of the plants surrounding the traps. GLM and GLMer analyses were performed and the best model was selected by AIC. We collected 8162 seeds (4722 anemochorous, 3304 epizoochorous, 72 autochorous, and 64 endozoochorous) belonging to 26 species. Our results showed that plants with high crown coverage close to forest fragments and at high densities in the pastures increased seed dispersal. These results may aid future restoration of pasture lands by improving seed dispersal in this harsh habitat and promoting better connectivity between forest fragments.

AB Protected areas (PAs) are under increasing pressure to demonstrate their broader value and contribution to society. Scientific research and associated knowledge production comprise one such value, which has received relatively little attention in the academic literature. Here, we use the Amazon region as a case study to quantify scientific knowledge production (as measured by scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals) in PAs and identify the main biophysical, geographical and social characteristics that influence such production. We adopt a multi-model inference approach with an innovative hurdle regression model to independently assess the factors influencing the presence of research and the number of studies in PAs. Our results indicate a highly skewed pattern of scientific production, with many PAs with few or no associated scientific articles. Larger, older and more highly protected PAs in Ecuador and Peru were most likely to have scientific production, while time since first publication was most strongly associated with the number of publications from a PA. These findings provide important insights that could be used to support and strengthen policy aimed at increasing the value of Amazonian protected areas for scientific research.

AB Large dams cause extensive inundation of habitats, with remaining terrestrial habitat confined to highly fragmented archipelagos of land-bridge islands comprised of former hilltops. Isolation of biological communities on reservoir islands induces local extinctions and degradation of remnant communities. "Good practice" dam development guidelines propose using reservoir islands for species, conservation, mitigating some of the detrimental impacts associated with flooding terrestrial habitats. The degree of species retention on islands in the long-term, and hence, whether they are effective for conservation is currently unknown. Here, we quantitatively review species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands. We specifically investigate island species richness in comparison with neighbouring continuous habitat, and relationships between island species richness and island area, isolation time, and distance to mainland and to other islands. Species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands have been investigated in only 15 of the >58,000 large-dam reservoirs (dam height >15m) operating globally. Research predominantly originates from wet tropical forest habitats and focuses on mammals, with species richness being the most widely-reported ecological metric. Terrestrial taxa are, overall, negatively impacted by isolation on reservoir islands. Reservoir island species richness declines with isolation time, and although the rate of loss is slower on larger islands, all islands exhibit depauperate species richness <100 years after isolation, compared to continuous mainland habitats. Such a pattern of sustained and delayed species loss following largescale habitat disturbance is indicative of an extinction debt existing for reservoir island species: this pattern is evident across all taxonomic groups and dams studied. Thus, reservoir islands cannot reliably be used for species conservation as part of impact mitigation measures, and should instead be included in area calculations for land impacted by dam creation. Environmental licensing assessments as a precondition for future dam development should explicitly consider the long-term fate of island communities when assessing biodiversity loss vs energy output.

AB The patterns of distribution and storage of carbon in managed areas of Atlantic Forest are still poorly understood. In order to understand the role of these areas in carbon sequestration, it was aimed to characterize the forest structure and estimate the aboveground biomass in harvest areas of jucara fruit (Euterpe edulis Mart.). The study was carried out in altered areas where the management of jucara fruits was introduced at 'Serra do Mar' State Park-SP state, Brazil and its surroundings, including the phytophysiognomies Montane and Submontane Atlantic Forest. To represent all the different situations in which management is practiced, eight areas were selected and each one was allocated in a plot of 10 x 100 m divided into subplots of 10 x 10 m, in which all individuals trees were inventoried (trees, jucaras, banana trees and ferns) with DBH (diameter at breast height)> 4.8 cm. The study areas were characterized as Secondary Forests and as Systems of Banana and Jucara Consortium. The biomass found in the studied plots ranged from 47.9 to 279.9 Mg ha(-1). Secondary Forests had higher biomass than Systems of Banana and Jucara Consortium, the trees being responsible for most of this biomass. The management of the fruits of the palm jucara for pulping food represents a sustainable alternative to the illegal extraction of palm heart in the region, diversifying the existing banana cultivations, adding value to forests and increasing carbon storage in areas of Atlantic forest with agroforestry.

AB Poverty, food insecurity, climate change and biodiversity loss continue to persist as the primary environmental and social challenges faced by the global community. As such, there is a growing acknowledgement that conventional sectorial approaches to addressing often inter-connected social, environmental, economic and political challenges are proving insufficient. An alternative is to focus on integrated solutions at landscape scales or landscape approaches'. The appeal of landscape approaches has resulted in the production of a significant body of literature in recent decades, yet confusion over terminology, application and utility persists. Focusing on the tropics, we systematically reviewed the literature to: (i) disentangle the historical development and theory behind the framework of the landscape approach and how it has progressed into its current iteration, (ii) establish lessons learned from previous land management strategies, (iii) determine the barriers that currently restrict implementation of the landscape approach and (iv) provide recommendations for how the landscape approach can contribute towards the fulfilment of the goals of international policy processes. This review suggests that, despite some barriers to implementation, a landscape approach has considerable potential to meet social and environmental objectives at local scales while aiding national commitments to addressing ongoing global challenges.

AB Models of ecological community assembly predict how communities of interacting organisms may be shaped by abiotic and biotic factors. Competition and environmental filtering are the predominant factors hypothesized to explain community assembly. This study tested the effects of habitat, phylogenetic and phenotypic trait predictors on species co-occurrence patterns and abundances, with the endemic primates of Madagascar as an empirical system. The abundance of 11 primate species was estimated along gradients of elevation, food resource abundance and anthropogenic habitat disturbance at local scales in south-east Madagascar. Community composition was compared to null models to test for phylogenetic and functional structure, and the effects of phylogenetic relatedness of co-occurring species, their trait similarity and environmental variables on species' abundances were tested using mixed models and quantile regressions. Resource abundance was the strongest predictor of community structure. Where food tree abundance was high, closely related species with similar traits dominated communities. High-elevation communities with lower food tree abundance consisted of species that were distantly related and had divergent traits. Closely related species had dissimilar abundances where they co-occurred, partially driven by trait dissimilarity, indicating character displacement. By integrating local-scale variation in primate community composition, evolutionary relatedness and functional diversity, this study found strong evidence that community assembly in this system can be explained by competition and character displacement along ecological gradients.

AB Allocation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) among plant organs is an important factor regulating growth rate, which is a key ecological process associated with plant life-history strategies. However, few studies have explored how N and P investment in photosynthetic (leaves) and non-photosynthetic (stems and roots) organs changes in relation to depletion of each element. We investigated nutrient concentrations of plant organs in relation to whole-plant nutrient concentration (total nutrient weight per total biomass) as an index of nutrient status of each individual using the saplings of the 13 species in three tropical rain forests with contrasting N and P availabilities (tropical evergreen forests and tropical heath forests). We found a steeper decrease in foliar N concentration than foliar P concentration with decreasing whole-plant nutrient concentration. Moreover, the steeper decrease in foliar N concentration was associated with relatively stable N concentration in stems, and vice versa for P. We suggest that the depletion of N is associated with a rapid dilution of foliar N because the cell walls in non-photosynthetic organs function as an N sink. On the other hand, these species can maintain foliar P concentration by decreasing stem P concentrations despites the depletion of P. Our results emphasize the significance of non-photosynthetic organs as an N sink for understanding the variation of foliar nutrient concentrations for the tree species in the three Bornean rain forests with different N and P availabilities.

AB QuestionsOur study tests the relative importance of different attributes of isolated trees in explaining the properties of the regeneration assemblage beneath their crowns to evaluate their effect on the composition of early successional stages and understand the processes underlying this effect. We asked: (1) does the regeneration assemblage contain a high proportion of individuals conspecific with the isolated tree; (2) how does the landscape surrounding an isolated tree influence the properties of the regeneration assemblage; and (3) what is the respective importance of structural variables and functional traits of isolated trees for their influence on the properties of the regeneration assemblage?
   LocationThree pasture sites in Guanacaste Province, a tropical seasonally dry area, Costa Rica.
   MethodsNinety isolated trees were characterized by their position in the landscape relative to patches of trees, individual structural variables related to tree and crown size, and species functional traits. The assemblage of woody plants regenerating under their crowns was characterized by number of individuals and species, and taxonomic and functional composition. To understand the mechanisms underlying the facilitative effect of isolated trees on regeneration, correlations between their attributes and properties of the regeneration assemblage were assessed.
   ResultsWe found that a low proportion of regenerating individuals were conspecific with the isolated trees beneath which they have established. Landscape factors influenced the regeneration but their effects were site-dependent. The attributes of isolated trees correlated well with the functional composition of the regeneration assemblage: their structure and phenological habits with traits associated with drought tolerance, and their dispersal syndrome with the dispersal syndrome of the regeneration assemblage. However, isolated tree attributes correlated poorly with the regeneration assemblage's taxonomic composition.
   ConclusionsOur study shows that an approach based on functional composition can provide a better understanding of community assembly mechanisms than does a taxonomic approach. Two main mechanisms are suggested to explain the influence of isolated trees on the regeneration assemblage: modification of micro-scale environmental conditions (shade and moisture) and influence on dispersal agents. The effect of attributes of isolated trees on the properties of the regeneration assemblage predicts a long-term legacy of the early stages of succession.

AB Tail autotomy and regeneration are perhaps the most dramatic adaptations to enhance survival among lizards. In spite of much work on the subject, the ecological significance of tail autotomy rates in natural populations remains elusive, due to difficulties in controlling several confounding factors and the paucity of accurate demographic data. On the basis of a capture-recapture study, we investigate the ecological determinants of tail autotomy rates in Micrablepharus atticolus, a blue-tailed lizard from the South American Cerrado. We tested whether habitat (as a proxy of predation intensity), seasonality (as a proxy of intensity of social interactions), ontogeny and sex affected autotomy rates, and also whether autotomy rates affected body condition. We found that tail autotomy rates in M. atticolus are lower than in many other species with brightly colored tails, likely resulting from a small body size and fossorial habits. Autotomy rates were lower than expected by chance in the plot with lower mortality rates, suggesting a more prominent role of predation intensity instead of predator efficiency, and increased with age, suggesting cumulative effects of predation attempts along the ontogeny or age-specific differences in predation intensity. We also found no intersexual differences or any effect of breeding activity on autotomy rates. Our results indicate that energetic costs of tail autotomy are low, or that animals compensate tail loss with increased foraging rates. These characteristics of M. atticolus seem tightly associated with its small body size, fossorial lifestyle and very short life span, and suggest that the costs of tail regeneration should be low.

AB Aims Spatial aggregation of soil chemical properties, or nutrient patches, may be generated by topography and plants and can seasonally fluctuate because of climate. Whether nutrient patches maintain consistency (no change in ranking through sequential sampling), through temporal scales, and whether topography and litterfall contribute to the persistence of such ranking is rarely tested.
   Methods In a 1-ha tropical rainforest plot in Southwest China, we measured soil pH, total N, NH4-N, NO3-N, and available P and K for four times and assessed the patch structure (patterns of patch distribution) and their temporal consistency. We then tested how structure and consistency of chemical soil properties were affected by topography and chemical inputs from litterfall.
   Results All soil chemical properties showed significant seasonal fluctuations, but patch consistency was higher for soil pH, total N, and available P and K compared to NH4-N or NO3-N. Topography influenced pH patch consistency while annual litterfall input was important for maintaining patch consistency in total N and available P and K.
   Conclusions Fine-scale consistency of patches in soil pH, total N, and available P and K suggest they may exert stable selection pressures on species for niche differentiation, while consistency of soil NH4-N and NO3-N require further study.

AB The generation of quality climatic series is the first step in the analysis of climate characteristics and behaviour in any region of the world. This article approaches the construction of homogeneous average temperature series for the period 1982-2011, for the study of spatial distribution and temporal evolution in the Province of Santa Elena, in the most western point of continental Ecuador in South America. Despite the low variability registered in the temperatures of the Province, these were higher and more homogeneous in the inland region than on the coast and almost 3 degrees C higher in the trimesters of the rainy season December-January-February (DJF) and March-April-May (MAM) than in the trimesters of the dry season June-July-August (JJA) and September-October-November (SON). Trend analysis detected positive increasing rates for the temperature of the province, with values three times higher during DJF and MAM in comparison with SON and annual average trend of 0.33 degrees C decade(-1) in the region. The construction of homogeneous average temperature series in the Province of Santa Elena has been an important step towards the spatial-temporal characterization of this peculiar climatic zone. These series can also be employed as base scenarios for the development of climate change studies in the region.

AB The atmosphere is populated by a diverse array of dispersing insects and their predators. We studied aerial insect communities by tracking the foraging altitudes of an avian insectivore, the Purple Martin (Progne subis). By attaching altitude loggers to nesting Purple Martins and collecting prey delivered to their nestlings, we determined the flight altitudes of ants and other insects. We then tested hypotheses relating ant body size and reproductive ecology to flight altitude. Purple Martins flew up to 1,889 meters above ground, and nestling provisioning trips ranged up to 922 meters. Insect communities were structured by body size such that species of all sizes flew near the ground but only light insects flew to the highest altitudes. Ant maximum flight altitudes decreased by 60% from the lightest to the heaviest species. Winged sexuals of social insects (ants, honey bees, and termites) dominated the Purple Martin diet, making up 88% of prey individuals and 45% of prey biomass. By transferring energy from terrestrial to aerial food webs, mating swarms of social insects play a substantial role in aerial ecosystems. Although we focus on Purple Martins and ants, our combined logger and diet method could be applied to a range of aerial organisms.

AB Generally Early Triassic floras are believed to be depauperate, suffering from protracted recovery following the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Here we present palynological data of an expanded East Greenland section documenting recovered floras in the basal Triassic (Griesbachian) and a subsequent fundamental floral turnover, postdating the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction by about 500 kyrs. This event is marked by a swap in dominating floral elements, changing from gymnosperm pollen-dominated associations in the Griesbachian to lycopsid spore-dominated assemblages in the Dienerian. This turnover coincides with an extreme delta C-13(org) negative shift revealing a severe environmental crisis, probably induced by volcanic outbursts of the Siberian Traps, accompanied by a climatic turnover, changing from cool and dry in the Griesbachian to hot and humid in the Dienerian. Estimates of sedimentation rates suggest that this environmental alteration took place within some 1000 years. Similar, coeval changes documented on the North Indian Margin (Pakistan) and the Bowen Basin (Australia) indicate the global extent of this crisis. Our results evidence the first profound disruption of the recovery of terrestrial environments about 500kyrs after the Permian-Triassic extinction event. It was followed by another crisis, about 1myrs later thus, the Early Triassic can be characterised as a time of successive environmental crises.

TI Assessment of Habitat Suitability Is Affected by Plant-Soil Feedback:
   Comparison of Field and Garden Experiment

   SPECIALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; COMPETITION; LIMITATION; DIVERSITY
AB Background
   Field translocation experiments (i.e., the introduction of seeds or seedlings of different species into different localities) are commonly used to study habitat associations of species, as well as factors limiting species distributions and local abundances. Species planted or sown in sites where they naturally occur are expected to perform better or equally well compared to sites at which they do not occur or are rare. This, however, contrasts with the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and commonly reported intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback. The few previous studies indicating poorer performance of plants at sites where they naturally occur did not explore the mechanisms behind this pattern.
   Aims and Methods
   In this study, we used field translocation experiments established using both seeds and seedlings to study the determinants of local abundance of four dominant species in grass-lands. To explore the possible effects of intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback on our results, we tested the effect of local species abundance on the performance of the plants in the field experiment. In addition, we set up a garden experiment to explore the intensity of intraspecific as well as interspecific feedback between the dominants used in the experiment.
   Key Results
   In some cases, the distribution and local abundances of the species were partly driven by habitat conditions at the sites, and species performed better at their own sites. However, the prevailing pattern was that the local dominants performed worse at sites where they naturally occur than at any other sites. Moreover, the success of plants in the field experiment was lower in the case of higher intraspecific abundance prior to experimental setup. In the garden feedback experiment, two of the species performed significantly worse in soils conditioned by their species than in soils conditioned by the other species. In addition, the performance of the plants was significantly correlated between the two experiments, suggesting that plant-soil feedback is a likely explanation of the patterns observed in the field.
   Conclusions
   All of the results indicate that intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback, either biotic or abiotic, may be a key factor determining the performance of the plants in our field translocation experiment. The possible effects of negative feedback should thus be considered when evaluating results of translocation experiments in future studies.

AB Study background: The Amazon basin is a mosaic of different environments. Flooded riparian and upland forests play a significant role for the establishment of human settlements. Riparian communities in the Amazon have evolved depending on the use of plants applied for therapeutic purposes, thus developing important knowledge about their management and preparation.
   Aim of the study: This paper describes and analyzes the use and management of medicinal plants in order to establish links to environmental conservation. The categorization of habitats of occurrence and categories of diseases were held in five riparian communities at Rio Jauaperi, in the border between Roraima and Amazonas states in Brazil. The study sight is poorly investigated in terms of scientific research.
   Materials and methods: Quantitative and qualitative ethnobotanical field inquiries and analytical methods including observations, individual and focus group discussions, individual interviews, preference ranking by free listing tasks, guided tours and community mapping were applied. Sutrop's cognitive salience index was applied in order to check the most important ethnospecies and diseases. The survey was conducted from February to December 2012.
   Results: A total of 62 informants were interviewed, resulting in 119 botanical species documented. The most salient medicinal species are usually wide distributed and recognized transculturally. Arboreal habit was the most important corresponding to 47% of total species used. The most frequent accessed environments were terra-firme (upland forest), vargeado (flooded forest), poultry (regenerating forest) and restinga (seasonally flooded forest) which together provides 59% of the total medicinal plant species. Exotic species played a secondary role with only 20% of the total. Thirty seven percent of the species were cultivated. Plants at homegardens are usually associated with children's or women's disease. Xixuati is the community with improved ability to environmental preservation using more forestry species. The most worrying disease was malaria. Biomedical assistance is precarious in the region and many diseases and healing rituals are culturally built.
   Conclusions: Ethnobotanical surveys of medicinal plants can indicate the level of biodiversity conservation and human health by integrating social and ecological analytical elements. Considering a predominance of management for subsistence, the higher richness of native medicinal species availability indicates that biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge are better preserved.

AB Background: Modern cold-water coral and tropical coral environments harbor a highly diverse and ecologically important macrofauna of crustaceans that face elevated extinction risks due to reef decline. The effect of environmental conditions acting on decapod crustaceans comparing these two habitats is poorly understood today and in deep time. Here, we compare the biodiversity, eye socket height as a proxy for eye size, and body size of decapods in fossil cold-water and tropical reefs that formed prior to human disturbance.
   Results: We show that decapod biodiversity is higher in fossil tropical reefs from The Netherlands, Italy, and Spain compared to that of the exceptionally well-preserved Paleocene (Danian) cold-water reef/mound ecosystem from Faxe (Denmark), where decapod diversity is highest in a more heterogeneous, mixed bryozoan-coral habitat instead of in coral and bryozoan-dominated facies. The relatively low diversity at Faxe was not influenced substantially by the preceding Cretaceous/Paleogene extinction event that is not apparent in the standing diversity of decapods in our analyses, or by sampling, preservation, and/or a latitudinal diversity gradient. Instead, the lower availability of food and fewer hiding places for decapods may explain this low diversity. Furthermore, decapods from Faxe are larger than those from tropical waters for half of the comparisons, which may be caused by a lower number of predators, the delayed maturity, and the increased life span of crustaceans in deeper, colder waters. Finally, deep-water specimens of the benthic crab Caloxanthus from Faxe exhibit a larger eye socket size compared to congeneric specimens from tropical reefs, suggesting that dim light conditions favored the evolution of relatively large eyes.
   Conclusions: The results suggest a strong habitat control on the biodiversity of crustaceans in coral-associated environments and that the diversity difference between deep, cold-water reefs and tropical reefs evolved at least similar to 63 million years ago. Futhermore, body size and vision in crustaceans evolved in response to environmental conditions in the deep sea. We highlight the usefulness of ancient reefs to study organismal evolution and ecology.

AB Edge effects play key roles in the anthropogenic transformation of forested ecosystems and their biota, and are therefore a prime field of contemporary fragmentation research. We present the first empirical study to address edge effects on the population level of a widespread galling herbivore in a temperate deciduous forest. By analyzing edge effects on abundance and trophic interactions of beech gall midge (Mikiola fagi Htg.), we found 30% higher gall abundance in the edge habitat as well as lower mortality rates due to decreased top-down control, especially by parasitoids. Two GLM models with similar explanatory power (58%) identified habitat specific traits (such as canopy closure and altitude) and parasitism as the best predictors of gall abundance. Further analyses revealed a crucial influence of light exposure (46%) on top-down control by the parasitoid complex. Guided by a conceptual framework synthesizing the key factors driving gall density, we conclude that forest edge proliferation of M. fagi is due to a complex interplay of abiotic changes and trophic control mechanisms. Most prominently, it is caused by the microclimatic regime in forest edges, acting alone or in synergistic concert with top-down pressure by parasitoids. Contrary to the prevailing notion that specialists are edge-sensitive, this turns M. fagi into a winner species in fragmented temperate beech forests. In view of the increasing proportion of edge habitats and the documented benefits from edge microclimate, we call for investigations exploring the pest status of this galling insect and the modulators of its biological control.

AB Studies of forest dynamics plots (FDPs) have revealed a variety of negative density-dependent (NDD) demographic interactions, especially among conspecific trees. These interactions can affect growth rate, recruitment and mortality, and they play a central role in the maintenance of species diversity in these complex ecosystems. Here we use an equal area annulus (EAA) point-pattern method to comprehensively analyze data from two tropical FDPs, Barro Colorado Island in Panama and Sinharaja in Sri Lanka. We show that these NDD interactions also influence the continued evolutionary diversification of even distantly related tree species in these FDPs. We examine the details of a wide range of these interactions between individual trees and the trees that surround them. All these interactions, and their cumulative effects, are strongest among conspecific focal and surrounding tree species in both FDPs. They diminish in magnitude with increasing phylogenetic distance between heterospecific focal and surrounding trees, but do not disappear or change the pattern of their dependence on size, density, frequency or physical distance even among the most distantly related trees. The phylogenetic persistence of all these effects provides evidence that interactions between tree species that share an ecosystem may continue to promote adaptive divergence even after the species' gene pools have become separated. Adaptive divergence among taxa would operate in stark contrast to an alternative possibility that has previously been suggested, that distantly related species with dispersal-limited distributions and confronted with unpredictable neighbors will tend to converge on common strategies of resource use. In addition, we have also uncovered a positive density-dependent effect: growth rates of large trees are boosted in the presence of a smaller basal area of surrounding trees. We also show that many of the NDD interactions switch sign rapidly as focal trees grow in size, and that their cumulative effect can strongly influence the distributions and species composition of the trees that surround the focal trees during the focal trees' lifetimes.

AB Desertification, one of the most severe types of land degradation in the world, is of great importance because it is occurring, to some degree, on approximately 40% of the global land area and is affecting more than 1 billion people. In this study, we used a space-for-time method to quantify the impact of five different desertification regimes (potential (PD), light (LD), moderate (MD), severe (SD), and very severe (VSD)) on a desert steppe ecosystem in northern China to examine the relationship between the productivity of the vegetation and soil properties and to determine the mechanism underlying the effects of desertification on productivity. Our results showed that the effects of desertification on TP (total phosphorus) and AP (available phosphorus) were not significant, and desertification decreased productivity in the desert steppe as a result of direct changes to soil physical properties, which can directly affect soil chemical properties. Therefore, intensive grassland management to improve soil quality may result in the long-term preservation of ecosystem functions and services.

ID COMPETITIVE-EXCLUSION; NEUTRAL THEORY
AB The biodiversity paradox has been a long-standing enigma in theoretical ecology. It emerged as a contradiction between the competitive exclusion principle and the natural species richness. There are two competing ecological theories which try to explain this issue: niche theory and neutral theory. The problem is that both theories are based on nontransparent models which ignore local interactions between individuals and cannot provide an understanding of interspecific competition mechanisms. Mathematical models of complex systems may be of three general types: black-box, grey-box and white-box models. Classical ecological models - Malthusian, Verhulst and Lotka-Volterra models are of black-box type. Black-box models are nonmechanistic. They cannot help to create a mechanistic ecological theory as they do not provide a direct insight into individual-based mechanisms. Here we make some critical notes on the recent attempts to resolve the paradox by black-box and grey-box approaches. We critically discuss a contribution of the neutral theory and the attempts to solve the paradox by methods of the classical quantum mechanics. These attempts are rather ineffective due to the lack of mechanicalness and likely lead to more confusion than clarity in understanding of biodiversity mechanisms. We also discuss our solution to the biodiversity paradox through a verification of the competitive exclusion principle with using the white-box approach to mathematical modelling of competitive coexistence.

AB Understanding the response of species with differing life-history traits to habitat edges and habitat conversion helps predict their likelihood of persistence across changing landscape. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest, we evaluated frog richness and abundance by breeding guild at four distances from the edge of a reserve: i) 200 m inside the forest, ii) 50 m inside the forest, iii) at the forest edge, and iv) 50 m inside three different converted habitats (coffee plantation, non-native Eucalyptus plantation, and abandoned pastures, hereafter matrix types). By sampling a dry and a wet season, we recorded 622 individual frogs representing 29 species, of which three were undescribed. Breeding guild (i.e. bromeliad, leaf-litter, and water-body breeders) was the most important variable explaining frog distributions in relation to edge effects and matrix types. Leaf-litter and bromeliad breeders decreased in richness and abundance from the forest interior toward the matrix habitats. Water-body breeders increased in richness toward the matrix and remained relatively stable in abundance across distances. Number of large trees (i.e. DBH > 15 cm) and bromeliads best explained frog richness and abundance across distances. Twenty species found in the interior of the forest were not found in any matrix habitat. Richness and abundance across breeding guilds were higher in the rainy season but frog distributions were similar across the four distances in the two seasons. Across matrix types, leaf-litter species primarily used Eucalyptus plantations, whereas water-body species primarily used coffee plantations. Bromeliad breeders were not found inside any matrix habitat. Our study highlights the importance of primary forest for bromeliad and leaf-litter breeders. We propose that water-body breeders use edge and matrix habitats to reach breeding habitats along the valleys. Including life-history characteristics, such as breeding guild, can improve predictions of frog distributions in response to edge effect and matrix types, and can guide more effective management and conservation actions.

AB The contribution of local (e.g., competition) and regional (e.g., dispersal) processes in the structure of communities remains an unresolved issue. In general, a tendency to assume local processes to be deterministic and regional to be stochastic dominates, although it is challenged. Fortunately, it can be cast as a testable proposition: if correct, the degree of determinism in the final community structure might indicate which process is more prominent in the control of community structure. However, recent findings have also suggested that stochastic patterns can arise from local processes and that dispersal can homogenize communities, which would make them appear deterministic irrespective of the mechanism involved. To evaluate these competing expectations we conducted an experiment where the initial communities had the same composition and species abundances. We hypothesized that if local processes dominate, then arrays of communities will show divergence of community structures whether connected by dispersal or not (i.e., being fully isolated). Alternatively, if regional processes dominate, the dispersal connected communities should converge while isolated ones should not. We found, however, that both groups of experimental communities showed similar patterns of change - a decline in similarity and a tendency to diverge. This suggests that biological interactions, demographic stochasticity, or both, exert noticeable control over community structure such that they reduce similarity among replicate communities and diversify their final states. We speculate that these mechanisms enhance potential for species additions, particularly in conjunction with factors such as dispersal and the size of the regional species pool.

AB Significant proportion of crop lands have been abandoned as management strategies have changed in Central and Eastern Europe in the past decades. The study of insect versus plant communities in such areas could help us understand how these processes take place, and whether these communities return to a semi-natural state maintained by human activities. Amongst insects ants, as ecosystem engineers, are a perfect target group in this respect. We studied epigaeic ant and plant communities of abandoned old-fields in Romania. Contrary to our expectations, the total number of ant species did not increase with time during succession on old-fields contrary to plants, where an increase was registered in the total number. Disturbance-tolerant ant species dominated the ant communities throughout the successional gradient, while in the case of plants a transition was found from weed-dominated to semi-natural communities. The diversity of both ant and plant communities increased after the 1-year stage, but the patterns were different. While a return to semi-natural state could be observed in plants during old-field succession, such a definite change did not occur in ants. This might be caused by the landscape context: the lack of connectivity of old-fields to larger natural areas. While plant propagules of semi-natural and natural habitat species can still successfully colonize the old fields even under such conditions, ant colonizers are mainly disturbance-tolerant species typical for agricultural areas, which can be hardly replaced by typical grassland species. Our findings underline the existence of important discrepancies between plant and ant community succession, mostly treated as paralleling each other. This is the first study to handle the effect of abandonment on ant and plant communities simultaneously in Eastern Europe.

AB Benthic mobile invertebrates are important components of coral reef diversity and community structure, although in most cases their ecological contributions are poorly known. The objectives of this study were 1) to describe diversity and composition patterns of epibenthic mobile invertebrate assemblages in shallow-water coral reef communities in Florida and 2) to evaluate these animals' ecological roles by reviewing publications on their diet. Underwater surveys were conducted during the summer of 2013 at 40 sites distributed along the Florida Reef Tract from Broward County to the Dry Tortugas. The survey data included 618 records of 116 unique morphospecies, representing 83 species from 61 genera, 46 families, 19 orders, seven classes, and four phyla of mobile invertebrates comprising herbivores, detritivores, carnivores, omnivores, and suspension feeders. Of the identified taxa, six were recorded at the majority of the sites (a parts per thousand yen50 % of sites), while 43 taxa were encountered only once. Nearly ubiquitous taxa were the snapping shrimp Alpheus armatus, red reef hermit crab Paguristes cadenati, and long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum. Each reef type was characterized by assemblages of dominant taxa: echinoderms were the most diverse in patch reefs and the Southeast Florida Reef Complex, molluscs were most diverse in shallow bank reefs, and arthropods were most diverse in deep bank reefs and the Southeast Florida Reef Complex. These results suggest that reef habitats are characterized by distinct communities of fauna, and that individual phyla and feeding guilds possess mostly unique but overlapping habitat requirements. This study establishes a reference point for further research and monitoring of ecological changes to inform conservation strategies for the Florida reef systems.

AB Urban forests are more vulnerable to exotic species invasions than natural forests and are often a pathway for exotic invasions into natural areas. Investigating the mechanisms responsible for species coexistence in urban ecosystems is important to prevent forest invasions and conserve native biodiversity. In this experiment, we studied seedling recruitment for two exotic invasive (Acer platanoides and Rhamnus cathartica) and two native tree species (Acer saccharum and Betula papyrifera) in two urban forests. We measured the effects of distance from a mature tree on the growth of conspecific seedlings and their belowground interactions (mutualisms and pathogens). We expected that native seedlings growing in close proximity to a mature conspecific tree would more likely be damaged by co-specific pathogens than those growing further away. In contrast, considering that exotic invaders have not coevolved with the local soil pathogens, distance from the adult conspecific tree would not affect their seedlings. We collected undisturbed soil cores at five incremental distances from each adult tree and grew conspecific seeds in these cores. After three months of growth, we measured plant biomass, mycorrhizal root colonization and root lesions. We found that biomass increased with distance from the mature conspecific tree only for A. platanoides and no distance dependent signal was detected for other response variables. Our results show that distance from a conspecific mature tree may not determine exotic species invasibility in an urban forest and that, instead, this may contribute to promote native and invasive species coexistence in urban forest systems.

AB Microbial metabolism drives our planet's biogeochemistry and plays a central role in industrial processes. Molecular profiling in bioreactors has revealed that microbial community composition can be highly variable while maintaining constant functional performance. Furthermore, following perturbation bioreactor performance typically recovers rapidly, while community composition slowly returns to its original state. Despite its practical relevance, we still lack an understanding of the mechanisms causing the discrepancy between functional and compositional stability of microbial communities. Using a mathematical model for microbial competition, as well as simulations of a model for a nitrifying bioreactor, we explain these observations on grounds of slow non-equilibrium dynamics eventually leading to competitive exclusion. In the presence of several competing strains, metabolic niches are rapidly occupied by opportunistic populations, while subsequent species turnover and the eventual dominance of top competitors proceeds at a much slower rate. Hence, functional redundancy causes a separation of the time scales characterizing the functional and compositional stabilization of microbial communities. This effect becomes stronger with increasing richness because greater similarities between top competitors lead to longer transient population dynamics.

AB Changes in the physical environment are major drivers of evolutionary change, either through direct effects on the distribution and abundance of species or more subtle shifts in the outcome of biological interactions. To investigate this phenomenon, we built a fossil data set of drilling gastropod predation on bivalve prey for the last 11 Myr to determine how the regional collapse in Caribbean upwelling and planktonic productivity affected predator-prey interactions. Contrary to theoretical expectations, predation increased nearly twofold after productivity declined, while the ratio of drilling predators to prey remained unchanged. This increase reflects a gradual, several-fold increase in the extent of shallow-water coral reefs and seagrass meadows in response to the drop in productivity that extended over several million years. Drilling predation is uniformly higher in biogenic habitats than in soft sediments. Thus, changes in predation intensity were driven by a shift in dominant habitats rather than a direct effect of decreased productivity. Most previous analyses of predation through time have not accounted for variations in environmental conditions, raising questions about the patterns observed. More fundamentally, however, the consequences of large-scale environmental perturbations may not be instantaneous, especially when changes in habitat and other aspects of local environmental conditions cause cascading series of effects.

AB 1. Plant adaptation to gradients of light availability involves a well-studied functional trade-off, as does adaptation to gradients of nutrient availability. However, little is known about how these two major trade-offs interact, and thus, it remains unclear whether and how the nature of the growth-shade tolerance trade-off differs on soils of contrasting fertility.

We measured the growth of, and the range of light environments occupied by, juveniles (40-120 cm tall) of eight basalt specialists, six rhyolite specialists, and one generalist that was common on both substrates. In situ minimum light requirements were estimated from the 5th percentile of the distribution of naturally regenerated juveniles in relation to daily light transmittance. Stem growth was measured for 12-16 months across a wide range of light environments to estimate the light compensation point of growth of each species.
   4. Light compensation points of growth showed nearly a 1 : 1 correspondence with in situ minimum light requirements of species, indicating that whole-plant carbon balance is a key driver of ecological success in low light. Minimum light requirements were negatively correlated with relative growth rate in low light, but correlated positively with growth in high light. Soil type had no effect on either the slope or the elevation of this trade-off, all species aligning around a common growth-shade tolerance trade-off, but our results do show a wider range of growth rates and shade tolerance on the nutrient-rich basalt soil than on the nutrient-poor rhyolite.
   5. Our results suggest that adaptation to light availability involves fundamentally similar trade-offs on these two substrates of differing fertility. However, a wider range of growth rates and shade tolerance on the nutrient-rich basalt soil than on the nutrient-poor rhyolite may help to explain the higher species richness and greater structural complexity of forest stands on the former substrate.

AB 1. Investigating how climatic niches change over evolutionary timescales is a necessary step to understanding the current distribution of lineages, yet few studies have addressed this issue using comprehensive datasets. In this study, the evolution of ant climatic niches is investigated at a global scale based on bioclimatic data associated with 163 481 ant occurrence records. The resulting dataset was subjected to principal component analysis, and the scores obtained were used to characterise the main axes of ant climatic niche evolution.
   2. Principal component axis 1 (PC1) reflected variation in average temperature and seasonality consistent with typical tropical/temperate gradients whereas PC2 was associated with varying levels of aridity. Evolution along these two niche axes was markedly different: differences in the amount of explained variance between PC1 (65%) and PC2 (19%) suggest that climatic niche evolution was nearly three times more pronounced along a tropical temperate climate axis.
   3. There was statistically significant phylogenetic signal on PCE with genera occupying more tropical conditions diversifying at a faster rate, yet neither of these results is significant on PC2. In addition, most of the ancient ant lineages are associated with conditions of low seasonality and high temperatures.
   4. These results provide partial support for the tropical conservatism hypothesis as an explanation for geographical patterns of ant species richness.

AB The structure of assemblages may be determined by interspecific interactions or environmental factors (e.g. competition and habitat filtering). Since communication between conspecific and heterospecific affects fitness of individuals, habitat characteristics that prevent communication could determine habitat use and co-occurrence of species. However, at present there are few studies, most with birds, testing the relationship between sensory ecology and community ecology. Abiotic noise on streams could impede the detection and decoding of auditory signals by receivers through a process named auditory masking. Therefore, we tested the role of abiotic noise on streams as a habitat characteristic influencing the phenotypic and phylogenetic structure of Neotropical anuran assemblages. We tested this hypothesis using data of male body size, call frequency, calling place (alongside and away from streams), and phylogenetic relationship of 110 and 38 anuran species at regional and local scale, respectively. After we found quantitative evidence suggesting that call frequency and body size are conserved phenotypic traits, we found that assemblages alongside streams exhibit both phenotypic and phylogenetic clustering, while assemblages away from streams exhibit both phenotypic and phylogenetic overdispersion. These results offer quantitative evidence suggesting a role of noise on streams promoting a process of habitat filtering and affecting the structure of anuran assemblages alongside streams both at Neotropical and local scale. This is the first study using modern phylogenetic comparative metrics for covering potential causes of phenotypic and phylogenetic structure of anuran assemblages, and one of the few testing a link between community ecology and the evolutionary biology of acoustic communication to understand the processes mediating species co-occurrence in vertebrates.

ID MATO-GROSSO
AB Located in the southeastern limit of the Amazon biome, the Xingu State Park (PEX) was identified as a knowledge gap, leading to a floristic and vegetation survey of the area. During this work, 463 species distributed in 295 genera and 111 families of vascular plants were recorded, including dozens of new records for the state of Mato Grosso and at least five species new to science. Seven vegetation types were found, among which the Open Ombrophilous forest and the "Varzea'' (floodplain) and lake vegetation showed the highest species richness. The vegetation of the Alto Xingu River was hitherto undocumented although this area is subject to strong deforestation pressure for cattle ranching from the southwest and soybean cultivation from the southeast, and is currently a focus of international attention due to the plans for the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant downriver in the state of Para'. When compared with a survey of the neighbouring Cristalino State Park, there was remarkably little overlap in vegetation types and plant species, highlighting the importance of increasing the intensity of plant surveys and collections in the Amazon including protected areas, so as to address the many, vast lacunae in our understanding of this biodiverse and threatened biome. Historic and geographic factors have polarized research in Brazil such that the Amazonian biome lags behind the eastern part of the country in terms of plant knowledge, and this type of initiative helps in providing much needed data to address this situation.

AB With the increasing impact of human activities on the environment, the effects of mechanical disturbance on aquatic plants are increasingly evident. Mechanical perturbations at the upper layer and surface of water frequently damage floating leaved and caulescent submerged plants. Here, we co-cultivated floating-leaved Nymphoides peltata and submerged Myriophyllum spicatum in mesocosms and then subjected leaf laminas of N. peltata and stems of M. spicatum to different levels of mechanical damage. Similar experiments were conducted twice, the second with having an increased intensity and frequency of disturbance. Generally, mechanical disturbances impacted the growth of these species more significantly in the second experiment than in the first. In the second experiment, the total biomass of N. peltata was decreased and the biomass proportion to leaf laminas increased with increasing disturbance intensity; leaf area was maintained across treatments. For M. spicatum, all disturbance treatments decreased total biomass and the total length of stems, compared to non-damage controls. However, in M. spicatum the number of ramets were increased with increasing disturbance intensity. Our results indicate that N. peltata has a high capacity for foliage compensation, and vegetative reproduction of M. spicatum may be improved by intense mechanical disturbance, though severe damage will suppress growth. Mechanical disturbances in upper water layers may change the relative performance of co-existing submerged and floating-leaved species with a repressive effect on submerged species. Management of mechanical disturbance by human activities is urgently required to maintain the function of submerged plants when restoring contaminated wetlands.

AB This study investigates the changes of tree species composition and diversity along the gradient from fragment edge to interior, and between edge and interior habitats, on a regional scale, in nine Atlantic forest fragments (6-120 ha), in southeastern Brazil. A total of 1980 trees (dbh >= 5 cm) comprising 252 species, 156 genera and 57 families were surveyed using the point-centered quarter method. From the fragment edge towards the interior the proportion of shade-tolerant trees increased continuously. The majority of all trees within the first 100 m from the edge belonged to the pioneer-guild. Floristic dissimilarity was found to be higher among interior habitats of different fragments than among the corresponding edge areas or among different small fragments. Species diversity increased along the edge-interior gradient 1.5 times within the first 250 m. Our results support previous findings that the establishment of edge-affected habitats leads to tree species impoverishment and homogenization via the dominance and proliferation of pioneer species in the forest edges of severely fragmented tropical landscapes. We argue that conservation strategies which include the creation of buffer zones between forest edges and the matrix will be more efficient than the establishment of narrow corridors to connect fragments and protected areas.

AB Sacred forest groves are often located in some of the world's hottest hotspots of biodiversity, and consequently have high potential conservation value. Recent efforts to quantify their value have focused nearly exclusively on a single component of diversity, species diversity within communities, which may or may not be an effective proxy for a second fundamental component of diversity, genetic diversity within populations. We studied fruit feeding butterfly communities to simultaneously assess to what extent five small sacred groves have retained the level of species and genetic diversity found in two much larger forest reserves. We additionally evaluate whether measures correlate across habitat fragments to investigate how closely these two components of diversity mirror each other. We quantified the diversity and composition of the fruit-feeding butterfly communities at each site and also the haplotype diversity within three specific species that differ with respect to their sensitivity to habitat fragmentation. Of the multiple measures of species and genetic diversity computed, only rarefied species richness was correlated with forest fragment size and even in this case the relationship was weak. Importantly, the limited decline in species richness documented in the sacred groves was not due to species replacements, whereby common, broadly distributed, generalists supplanted more vulnerable species in these communities. Although similar processes are known to drive declines in both species and gene diversity, we found only limited evidence of positive species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs), and only in the species most sensitive to fragmentation. Thus, a conservation strategy that emphasizes species complementarity or richness may be ineffective at capturing other critical levels of biodiversity. Overall, our findings demonstrate that even very small forest patches can have a conservation value that rivals that of much larger forest reserves. The implementation of official national and international initiatives that preserve and strengthen existing community-based conservation practices is critically needed to ensure that indigenous conservation areas persist into the future.

AB Hatching plasticity has been documented in diverse terrestrial and freshwater taxa, but in few marine invertebrates. Anecdotal observations over the last 80years have suggested that intertidal neritid snails may produce encapsulated embryos able to significantly delay hatching. The cause for delays and the cues that trigger hatching are unknown, but temperature, salinity, and wave action have been suggested to play a role. We followed individual egg capsules of Nerita scabricosta in 16 tide pools to document the variation in natural time to hatching and to determine if large delays in hatching occur in the field. Hatching occurred after about 30d and varied significantly among tide pools in the field. Average time to hatching in each pool was not correlated with presence of potential predators, temperature, salinity, or pool size. We also compared hatching time between egg capsules in the field to those kept in the laboratory at a constant temperature in motionless water, and to those kept in the laboratory with sudden daily water motion and temperature changes. There was no significant difference in the hatching rate between the two laboratory treatments, but capsules took, on average, twice as long to hatch in the laboratory as in the field. Observations of developing embryos showed that embryos in the field develop slowly and continuously until hatching, but embryos in the laboratory reach the hatching stage during the first month of development and remain in stasis after that. Instances of hatching plasticity in benthic marine invertebrates, like the one in N. scabricosta, could greatly enhance our ability to investigate the costs and benefits of benthic versus planktonic development, a long-standing area of interest for invertebrate larval biologists.

AB Dardanus insignis is the most abundant hermit crab on sublittoral of soft bottoms along the southeastern coast of Brazil. It is among the Decapoda species that structure the macrobenthic community, from shallow regions to deeper areas up to 100 m. This study evaluated the distribution of D. insignis in a tropical-subtropical transition zone. In three bays (Ubatumirim, Ubatuba and Mar Virado), sampling was conducted monthly for two years, on four transects parallel to the coastline (at depths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 m), as well as one transect sheltered from wave action, and another in a more exposed area. Environmental variables were monitored in each sampling. The size fractions of coarse, medium and fine sand showed a positive correlation with the distribution of demographic groups on transects 15 and 20 m deep. On the other hand, the mean grain size (Phi) and silt+clay are negatively correlated with the distribution of the species. Adult males and females showed no environmental-specific relationship similar to the juveniles, and ovigerous females were negatively correlated by the bottom temperature. These results reveal that D. insignis is found in greater abundance on transects farther from the coastline, places that are less affected by the continual environmental oscillations in coastal regions and which, therefore, offer greater protection and stability for hermit crabs.

AB Most ecosystems are subject to both natural and human disturbances that can combine to influence populations and assemblages in complex ways. Assessing the relative influences and combined impacts of natural and human disturbance is crucial for managing human uses of ecosystems against the backdrop of their natural variability. We evaluated the separate and combined influences of disturbance from storm waves and disturbance associated with human trampling of rocky shores by conducting an experiment mimicking controlled levels of trampling at sites with different wave exposures, and before and after a major storm event in central California, USA. Results show that trampling and storm waves affected the same taxa and have comparable and additive effects on rocky shore assemblages. Both disturbance types caused significant reduction in percent cover of mussels and erect macroalgae, and resulted in significant re-organization of assemblages associated with these habitat-forming taxa. A single extreme storm event caused similar percent cover losses of mussels and erect macroalgae as did 6 12 months of trampling. Contrary to a predicted synergistic effect of trampling and storm damage, we found that impacts from each disturbance combined additively. Mussel beds in wave-exposed sites are more vulnerable to trampling impacts than algal beds at protected sites. Mussels and erect macroalgae recovered within five years after trampling stopped. These results suggest that impacts from local human use can be reversed in relatively short time frames, and that cumulative impacts can be reduced by setting recreational carrying capacities more conservatively when ecosystems are already exposed to frequent and/or intense natural disturbances.

DT Article
DE Green economy; Development; Carbon markets; Ecosystem services;
   Degrowth; Buen vivir; REDD
ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; PAYMENTS; LIMITS; PROGRAMS
AB Green economy aims to use economic rationality and market mechanisms to mute the most ecologically damaging effects of globalized capitalism while reviving economic growth in the global North, fostering development in the South, and decoupling economic growth from environmental decline. An archetypal application of green economy is transnational trade in ecosystem services, including reduced emissions for deforestation and degradation (REDD+). By compensating developing countries for maintaining forests as carbon sinks, this approach is meant to transcend politics and circumvent conflicts over the responsibilities of industrialized and 'less-developed' countries that have stymied global climate policy. However, carbon-offset trading is unlikely to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, much less combined conservation and development gains. The troubled record of payment for environmental services and other schemes or commodification of nature illustrates that living ecosocial systems do not fit the requirements of market contracts. Disputes over proto-REDD+ projects point to the dangers that REDD+ will disadvantage or dispossess rural communities and distract attention from underlying causes of forest and livelihood loss. Two decades of all-but-futile climate negotiations have shown that global warming cannot be managed by means of technocratic expertise nor dealt with separately from the politics of inequality and the paradox of economic growth. The deceptive promise of greening with growth can blind us to these realities. Counter-hegemonic discourses to growth-centered green economy under the headings of buen vivir, mainly in the global South, and degrowth, mainly in the global North, therefore merit attention.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY : Secondary succession is a worldwide phenomenon affecting plant communities. Studying functional variation during succession aids in understanding the mechanisms through which environmental shifts drive succession. We investigated changes in the functional space occupied by herbaceous communities during succession. Furthermore, since different traits are differently affected by environmental conditions, we asked how considering different sets of plant traits impacts those changes.
   METHODS : Using a chronosequence of Mediterranean old fields (2-42 yr after abandonment), we analyzed shifts of the occupied functional space during succession, how the volume of occupied functional space varies compared with null expectations, and the functional overlap between communities of different successional status. We repeated these analyses considering (1) the leaf-height-seed functional dimensions separately and together and (2) different sets of traits representing those dimensions.
   KEY RESULTS : From early to late succession, a shift toward nutrient conservative-light competitive species occurred. Functional strategies of mid-successional communities appeared more diverse than expected by chance and less diverse than expected for early and late communities. Early and middle stages overlapped the most. These patterns were generally robust to the choice of functional axes, though important trait-specific exceptions occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS : We showed evidence for a well-defined history of successive dominance of different assembly mechanisms along succession, resulting in a generally stronger functional diversification in mid-succession. We also demonstrated that different traits typically grouped under one functional dimension can substantially affect the results, discouraging the use of surrogate traits from the same dimension.

AB Research in ecological networks has developed impressively in recent years. A significant part of this growth has been achieved using networks to represent the complexity of mutualistic interactions between species of birds and plants, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Bird-plant networks are built from matrices whose cells account for the field-sampled magnitudes of interaction (e.g. the number of plant fruits consumed by birds) in bird-plant species pairs. The comparative study of mutualistic networks evidences three general patterns in network structure: they are highly heterogeneous (many species having just a few interactions, but a few species being highly connected), nested (with specialists interacting with subsets of species with which generalists interact) and composed of weak and asymmetric relationships between birds and plants. This type of structure emerges from a set of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms accounting for the probabilistic role of species abundances and the deterministic role of species traits, often constrained by species phylogenies. Although bearing structural generalities, bird-plant networks are variable in space and time at very different scales: from habitat to latitudinal and biogeographical gradients, and from seasonal to inter-annual contrasts. They are also highly sensitive to human impact, being especially affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, defaunation and biological invasions. Further research on bird-plant mutualistic networks should: 1) apply wide conceptual frameworks which integrate the mechanisms of interaction and the responses of species to environmental gradients, 2) enlarge the ecological scale of networks across interaction types and animal groups, and 3) account for the ultimate functional (i.e. demographic) effects of trophic interactions.

AB Trophic cascades occur when predators benefit plants by consuming herbivores, but the overall strength of a trophic cascade depends upon the way species interactions propagate through a system. For example, plant resistance to, or tolerance of, herbivores reduces the potential magnitude of a trophic cascade. At the same time, plants can also affect predator foraging or consumption in ways that either increase or decrease the strength of trophic cascades. In this study, we investigated the effects of plant variation on cascade strength by manipulating predator access to aphid populations on two species of milkweed: the slower-growing, putatively more-defended Asclepias syriaca and the faster-growing, putatively less-defended Asclepias incarnata. Predatory insects increased plant growth and survival for both species, but the strength of these trophic cascades was greater on A. incarnata, which supported more aphid growth early in the season than did A. syriaca. More predators were observed per aphid on A. incarnata, and cage treatments generated significant patterns consistent with predator aggregation on A. incarnata, but not A. syriaca. Although predators strongly affected aphids, this effect did not differ consistently between milkweed species. Plant tolerance to herbivory may therefore be the primary driver of the difference in trophic cascade strength observed. Importantly, we observed that the timing of predator exclusion affected plant growth and survival differently, indicating that measures of "cascade strength" may change with phenology and plant physiological responses. Together, our results suggest a mechanism by which differences in resource allocation patterns could explain differences in growth, phenology, and cascade strength between species.

AB The conservation of tropical forest carbon stocks offers the opportunity to curb climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and simultaneously conserve biodiversity. However, there has been considerable debate about the extent to which carbon stock conservation will provide benefits to biodiversity in part because whether forests that contain high carbon density in their aboveground biomass also contain high animal diversity is unknown. Here, we empirically examined medium to large bodied ground-dwelling mammal and bird (hereafter "wildlife") diversity and carbon stock levels within the tropics using camera trap and vegetation data from a pantropical network of sites. Specifically, we tested whether tropical forests that stored more carbon contained higher wildlife species richness, taxonomic diversity, and trait diversity. We found that carbon stocks were not a significant predictor for any of these three measures of diversity, which suggests that benefits for wildlife diversity will not be maximized unless wildlife diversity is explicitly taken into account; prioritizing carbon stocks alone will not necessarily meet biodiversity conservation goals. We recommend conservation planning that considers both objectives because there is the potential for more wildlife diversity and carbon stock conservation to be achieved for the same total budget if both objectives are pursued in tandem rather than independently. Tropical forests with low elevation variability and low tree density supported significantly higher wildlife diversity. These tropical forest characteristics may provide more affordable proxies of wildlife diversity for future multi-objective conservation planning when fine scale data on wildlife are lacking.

AB Salvage logging following windthrow is common throughout forests worldwide even though the practice is often considered inimical to forest recovery. Because salvaging removes trees, crushes seedlings, and compacts soils, many warn this practice may delay succession, suppress diversity, and alter composition. Here, over 8 yr following windthrow, we experimentally evaluate how salvaging affects tree succession across 11 gaps in Eastern deciduous forests of Pennsylvania, wherein each gap was divided into salvaged and control (unsalvaged) halves. Our gaps vary in size and windthrow severity, and we explicitly account for this variation as well as variation in soil disturbance (i.e., scarification) resulting from salvaging so that our results would be generalizable. Salvage logging had modest and ephemeral impacts on tree succession. Seedling richness and density declined similarly over time in both salvaged and unsalvaged areas as individuals grew into saplings. The primary impact of salvaging on succession occurred where salvaging scarified soils. Here, salvaging caused 41 to 82% declines in sapling abundance, richness, and diversity, but these differences largely disappeared within 5 yr. Additionally, we documented interactions between windthrow severity and scarification. Specifically, low-severity windthrow and scarification combined reinforced dominance by shade-tolerant and browse-tolerant species (Acer pensylvanicum, Fagus grandifolia). In contrast, high windthrow severity and scarification together reduced the density of a fast-growing pioneer tree (Prunus pensylvanica) and non-tree vegetation cover by 75% and 26%, respectively. This reduction enhanced the recruitment of two mid-successional tree species, Acer rubrum and Prunus serotina, by 2 and 3-fold, respectively. Thus, our findings demonstrate that salvaging creates novel microsites and mitigates competing vegetation, thereby enhancing establishment of important hardwoods and promoting tree species coexistence. Our results, coupled with an assessment of 27 published post-windthrow salvage studies, suggest short-term studies may overestimate the impact of salvaging on regeneration. We conclude that the ecological costs and benefits of salvaging depend upon the variation in canopy and soil disturbance severity as well as the timescale at which effects are evaluated. Thus, our findings are inconsistent with the view that salvaging inexorably undermines plant diversity; rather we suggest salvaging can promote tree species coexistence within various contexts.

AB Tropical forests currently play a key role in regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle and abating climate change by storing carbon in wood. However, there remains considerable uncertainty as to whether tropical forests will continue to act as carbon sinks in the face of increased pressure from expanding human activities. Consequently, understanding what drives productivity in tropical forests is critical. We used permanent forest plot data from the Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone) - one of the largest tracts of intact tropical moist forest in West Africa - to explore how (1) stand basal area and tree diversity, (2) past disturbance associated with past logging, and (3) underlying soil nutrient gradients interact to determine rates of aboveground wood production (AWP). We started by statistically modeling the diameter growth of individual trees and used these models to estimate AWP for 142 permanent forest plots. We then used structural equation modeling to explore the direct and indirect pathways which shape rates of AWP. Across the plot network, stand basal area emerged as the strongest determinant of AWP, with densely packed stands exhibiting the fastest rates of AWP. In addition to stand packing density, both tree diversity and soil phosphorus content were also positively related to productivity. By contrast, historical logging activities negatively impacted AWP through the removal of large trees, which contributed disproportionately to productivity. Understanding what determines variation in wood production across tropical forest landscapes requires accounting for multiple interacting drivers - with stand structure, tree diversity, and soil nutrients all playing a key role. Importantly, our results also indicate that logging activities can have a long-lasting impact on a forest's ability to sequester and store carbon, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding old-growth tropical forests.

AB Species can adjust their traits in response to selection which may strongly influence species coexistence. Nevertheless, current theory mainly assumes distinct and time-invariant trait values. We examined the combined effects of the range and the speed of trait adaptation on species coexistence using an innovative multispecies predator-prey model. It allows for temporal trait changes of all predator and prey species and thus simultaneous coadaptation within and among trophic levels. We show that very small or slow trait adaptation did not facilitate coexistence because the stabilizing niche differences were not sufficient to offset the fitness differences. In contrast, sufficiently large and fast trait adaptation jointly promoted stable or neutrally stable species coexistence. Continuous trait adjustments in response to selection enabled a temporally variable convergence and divergence of species traits; that is, species became temporally more similar (neutral theory) or dissimilar (niche theory) depending on the selection pressure, resulting over time in a balance between niche differences stabilizing coexistence and fitness differences promoting competitive exclusion. Furthermore, coadaptation allowed prey and predator species to cluster into different functional groups. This equalized the fitness of similar species while maintaining sufficient niche differences among functionally different species delaying or preventing competitive exclusion. In contrast to previous studies, the emergent feedback between biomass and trait dynamics enabled supersaturated coexistence for a broad range of potential trait adaptation and parameters. We conclude that accounting for trait adaptation may explain stable and supersaturated species coexistence for a broad range of environmental conditions in natural systems when the absence of such adaptive changes would preclude it. Small trait changes, coincident with those that may occur within many natural populations, greatly enlarged the number of coexisting species.

AB 1. A longstanding goal of ecology and conservation biology is to understand the environmental and biological controls of forest succession. However, the patterns and mechanisms that guide successional trajectories, especially within tropical forests, remain unclear.
   2. We collected leaf functional trait and abiotic data across a 110-year chronosequence within a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. Focusing on six key leaf functional traits related to resource acquisition and competition, along with measures of forest stand structure, we propose a mechanistic framework to link species composition, community trait distributions and forest structure. We quantified the community-weighted trait distributions for specific leaf area, leaf dry matter concentration, leaf phosphorus concentration, leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio and leaf stable isotopic carbon and nitrogen. We assessed several prominent hypotheses for how these functional measures shift in response to changing environmental variables (soil water content, bulk density and pH) across the chronosequence.
   3. Increasingly, older forests differed significantly from younger forests in species composition, above-ground biomass and shifted trait distributions. Early stages of succession were uniformly characterized by lower values of community-weighted mean specific leaf area, leaf stable nitrogen isotope and leaf phosphorus concentration. Leaf dry matter concentration and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio were lower during earlier stages of succession, and each trait reached an optimum during intermediate stages of succession. The leaf carbon isotope ratio was the only trait to decrease linearly with increasing stand age indicating reduced water use efficiency in older forests. However, in contrast with expectations, community-weighted trait variances did not generally change through succession, and when compared to null expectations were lower than expected.
   4. The observed directional shift in community-weighted mean trait values is consistent with the 'productivity filtering' hypothesis where a directional shift in water and light availability shifts physiological strategies from 'slow' to 'fast'. In contrast with expectations arising from niche based ecology, none of the community trait distributions were over-dispersed. Instead, patterns of trait dispersion are consistent with the abiotic filtering and/or competitive hierarchy hypotheses.

AB Hermit crabs respond to sensory cues that guide them toward limiting resources in marine and terrestrial environments. We examined the response of the common intertidal hermit crab Pagurus criniticornis (Dana, 1852) to simulated predation events on: (1) their principal shell donor Cerithium atratum (Born, 1778), (2) conspecifics, and (3) a sympatric bivalve; to test for the prevalence of olfactory specificity (i.e., attraction to a preferred gastropod species) or olfactory generality (i.e., attraction to a range of cues). Results showed that crabs were strongly attracted to gastropod baits but not to conspecifics or bivalves possibly reflecting greater motivation to acquire newly liberated resources than those more widely available (e.g., existing shells or food). We then examined the potential drivers of aggregative behavior by comparing the morphology and shell quality of attending individuals to an unbiased population. Although attending crabs were of a similar size and weight to the general population, their shells were of lower quality (adequacy, damage, and encrustation), suggesting that motivation to procure new shells is modulated by existing shell quality. The findings provide a clearer understanding of how hermit crabs acquire new resources and might have implications for the release and redistribution of other limiting resources within coastal environments.

AB The Atlantic Forest is one of the most important areas of biodiversity in the world, but it has been largely replaced with agropastoral areas and at the present only 12.5 % of the original cover remains. Despite the ecological importance of insects, few studies have been used in conservation approaches for the Atlantic Forest, mainly due to a great taxonomic impediment. A group quite ecologically important but deeply neglected includes parasitoid wasps that control a great number of invertebrates, like tiphiid wasps that are parasitoids of underground coleopteran larvae. The present study aimed to estimate Tiphiidae species richness and diversity in 15 patches of a highly fragmented Atlantic Forest region, using factors that drive the diversity pool from a metacommunity, such as immigration and speciation probabilities. The parameters were estimated using the Neutral Biodiversity Theory, which is based on the total ecological equivalence of species at the same trophic level. Diversity values were molded to the area size, the immigration probabilities, and/or the speciation probability. Eight genera and 460 individuals of Thynninae, Myzininae and Tiphiinae were collected. Variation in species richness, estimated by both rarefaction and first-order jackknife methods, was explained by patch size and by immigration and speciation probabilities. These variables also explained the variation in Shannon diversity and species evenness. Variations in species richness and diversity of Tiphiidae are strongly associated with neutral processes, but they are also influenced by forest fragmentation and intensive agricultural activities.

AB As old-growth forests are converted into edge-affected habitats, a substantial proportion of tropical biodiversity is potentially threatened. Here, we examine a comprehensive set of community-level attributes of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages inhabiting edge-affected habitats in a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape devoted to sugar cane production. We also explored whether the consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation can interact and cause cascading ecosystem changes, with the pervasive simplification of tree assemblages inhabiting edge-dominated habitats, altering fruit-feeding butterfly persistence. Butterflies were sampled in three forest habitats: small fragments, forest edges and patches of forest interior of a primary forest fragment. Assemblage attributes, including taxonomic composition, correlated to some patch (patch size) and landscape (such as forest cover) metrics as well as habitat structure (tree density and richness). Fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in the forest interior differed from those in small fragments due to an increased abundance of edge-specialist species. On the other hand, several forest-dependent species were missing in both small fragments and forest edges. Our results suggest that edge-affected habitats dominated by pioneer tree species support taxonomically distinct assemblages, including the presence of disturbance-adapted species, and butterfly community structure is highly sensitive to fragmentation- and plant-related variables, such as forest cover and pioneer tree species. In this way, while the establishment of human-modified landscapes probably results in the local extirpation of forest-dependent species, it allows the persistence of disturbance-adapted species. Thus, forest-dependent species conservation and the plant-animal interaction webs they support could be improved by retaining a significant amount of core forest habitat.

AB The mechanisms driving changes in dominant plant species are the key for understanding how grassland ecosystems respond to climate change. In this study, we examined plant functional traits (morphological characteristics: plant height, leaf area, and leaf number; biomasses: aboveground, belowground, and total; and growth indices: root-to-shoot ratio, specific leaf area, and leaf mass ratio) of four zonal Stipa species (S. baicalensis, S. bungeana, S. grandis, and S. breviflora) from Inner Mongolian grassland in response to warming (control, +1.5, +2.0, +4.0, and +6.0 degrees C), changing precipitation (-30%, -15%, control, +15%, and +30%), and their combined effects via climate control chambers. The results showed that warming and changing precipitation had significant interactive effects, different from the accumulation of single-factor effects, on functional traits of Stipa species. The correlation and sensitivity of different plant functional traits to temperature and precipitation differed. Among the four species, the accumulation and variability of functional traits had greater partial correlation with precipitation than temperature, except for leaf number, leaf area, and specific leaf area, in S. breviflora, S. bungeana, and S. grandis. For S. baicalensis, the accumulation and variability of plant height, aboveground biomass, and root-to-shoot ratio only had significant partial correlation with precipitation. However, the variability of morphological characteristics, biomasses, and some growth indices, was more sensitive to temperature than precipitation in S. bungeana, S. grandis, and S. breviflora-except for aboveground biomass and plant height. These results reveal that precipitation is the key factor determining the growth and changes in plant functional traits in Stipa species, and that temperature mainly influences the quantitative fluctuations of the changes in functional traits.

AB Density-dependent mortality (DDM) is major driver of species coexistence in tropical forests. We assessed the occurrence and strength of this mechanism among saplings (i.e. trees with a diameter of 1-4 cm) in the moist tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, over six inter-census periods (26 years), by using spatial point pattern analysis. We considered conspecific density-dependent mortality, but also total DDM (i.e. the effects of conspecific and heterospecific neighbours all together) upon saplings of all species (i.e. at the community level), and on saplings of light-demanding and shade-tolerant ones, separately (i.e. at the light-guild level). We also analysed the effects of conspecific DDM at the community and light-guild levels. Conspecific density-dependent mortality affected a lower proportion of species than was to be expected. Its strength was not significantly related with species abundance, and it had relatively weak effects at the community and light guild levels. Conversely, we detected a significant spatial signature of total DDM among all saplings, and among saplings of the light-demanding and shade-tolerant species, but its strength showed pronounced temporal variation. Total DDM among light-demanding saplings was stronger than among shade-tolerant ones and its effects were particularly marked 10-15 years after the occurrence of unusually severe droughts associated with El Nino events. Our study indicates that conspecific DDM is relatively unimportant among saplings in comparison with total DDM at community and light-guild levels. This finding contrasts strongly with the results for seedlings, where conspecific DDM was constituted the dominant process. The pronounced temporal variations observed in the occurrence and strength of total DDM among saplings indicate that time-varying events associated with climatic disturbances such as canopy openings or episodes of high recruit emergence might be important drivers of this process. They also emphasize the importance of considering time frames longer than one decade to study density-dependent effects among saplings in tropical forests.

AB Shade, in ecological sense, is not merely a lack of light, but a multi-faceted phenomenon that creates new and complex settings for community and ecosystem dynamics. Tolerating shade therefore affects plants' ability to cope with other stressors, and also shape its interactions with surrounding organisms. The aim of this broad review was to map our current knowledge about how shade affects plants, plant communities and ecosystems - to gather together knowledge of what we know, but also to point out what we do not yet know. This review covers the following topics: the nature of shade, and ecological and physiological complexities related to growing under a canopy; plants' capability of tolerating other stress factors while living under a shade - resource trade-offs and polytolerance of abiotic stress; ontogenetic effects of shade tolerance; coexistence patterns under the canopy - how shade determines the forest structure and diversity; shade-induced abiotic dynamics in understorey vegetation, including changing patterns of irradiance, temperature and humidity under the canopy; shade-driven plant-plant and plant-animal interactions - how shade mediates facilitation and stress, and how it creates differentiated environment for different herbivores and pollinators, including the role of volatile organic compounds. We also discuss the ways how vegetation in understorey environments will be affected by climate change, as shade might play a significant role in mitigating negative effects of climate change. Our review shows that living under a shade affects biotic and abiotic stress tolerance of plants, it also influences the outcomes of both symbiotic and competitive plant-plant and plant-animal interactions in a complex and dynamic manner. The current knowledge of shade-related mechanisms is rather ample, however there is much room for progress in integrating different implications of the multifaceted nature of shade into consistent and integral understanding how communities and ecosystems function.

AB Paleotropical islands are experiencing extensive land-use change, yet little is known about how such changes are impacting wildlife in these biodiversity hotspots. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized bat responses to forest conversion in a biodiverse, human-threatened coastal rainforest habitat on Makira, Solomon Islands. We analysed similar to 200 h of acoustic recordings from echolocating bats in the four dominant types of land use on Makira: intact forest, secondary forest, food gardens and cacao plantations. Bat calls were identified to the species level using a supervised classification model (where labelled data are used to train the system). We examined relative activity levels and morphological traits across habitats. Relative activity levels were highest in intermediately disturbed habitats and lowest in the most heavily disturbed habitat, although these differences were not significant. There were significant differences in the mean forearm length of bat assemblages across habitats, with the highest mean forearm length found in the most open habitat (Cacao). Overall, our study constitutes the first detailed exploration of anthropogenic effects on mammalian diversity in the Solomon Islands and includes the first acoustic and morphological information for many bat species in Melanesia. We use our experience to discuss the challenges of acoustic monitoring in such a remote and poorly studied region.

AB The most representative group among mammals are rodents for presenting high ratio to the total of species. However, rodents are considered a "taxonomic chaos" and some species such as Blarinomys breviceps, Bibimys labiosus, Akodon lindberghi and Pseudoryzomys simplex are little known. That can be explained because of low occurrence of small terrestrial mammals in wildlife inventories and/or reduced abundance. The objective is to describe the occurrence of these species and analyze these locations presenting descriptive comments about their biological aspects. Therefore, in addition to specimens collected in the field, some scientific collections were visited and reviews in relevant literature were conducted in order to obtain information about the locations and biological aspects. Akodon lindberghi was found in five sites, Bibimys labiosus was found in 15, Blarinomys breviceps in 39 and Pseudoryzomys simplex in 13. Each species has specific information and they are included in two threatened areas, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. The occurrences are disconnected and related to taxonomic and methodological problems.

ID SERVICES
AB Approaches and instruments focused on market mechanisms and private enterprises, including private protected areas, are promoted as ways to resolve global environmental and developmental problems. In Indonesia, Ecosystem Restoration Concessions (ERCs) have been developed as a new market-oriented governmental instrument to counter current deforestation processes and to restore forest ecosystems. Conservation and development organizations, along with state authorities, view ERCs as a highly promising instrument in Indonesia and in other countries as well. Experiences with ERCs are still limited, however, and their viability is uncertain. The implementation of ERCs in Indonesia has been controversial and the impact of ERCs on forests and forest-dependent communities has been fiercely disputed. This article explores these conflicts and disputes with a focus on the Harapan ERC and weighs the relevance of ERCs for German development cooperation. The improvement of the accountability of such projects and the implementation of mediation facilities are emphasized as prerequisites to establishing such market-oriented instruments according to international standards of nature conservation, the rights of indigenous and local populations, and sustainable development. The author concludes that decisions about strategies and instruments applied in forest-related development cooperation must involve a reconsideration of the mindsets that currently determine conservation approaches and development cooperation.

AB Spatially explicit planning is required to set focused conservation priorities and assessing future ecological implications. Spatial ecological modeling and hotspot analysis prioritizes the forest ecosystems and supports the conservation of species level biodiversity. In the present study, the hotspots of deforestation and forest fires were obtained using historical deforestation trends (1975-1985-1995-2005-2014) and fire history (2009-2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The priority areas were identified as deforestation and degradation hotspots using combined measures of threat from deforestation, fire hotspots and current level of forest fragmentation. The state of Andhra Pradesh represents an area of 25985 km(2) (16.2% of total geographical area) under forest cover in 2014. The net deforested area was estimated as 2390 km(2) (8.4%) from 1975 to 2014. We have calculated the region of influence in percentages and found deforestation hotspots covering an average of 40.2% forest, followed by 35.9% under high fragmentation and 19.2% under fire hotspots. Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types i.e., semi evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves, indicating ecosystem vulnerability. According to the results of prioritization, about 10.5% of existing forest had severe ecosystem collapse and categorized as deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Analysis of protected areas shows Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Sri Peninsula Narasimha sanctuary, Papikonda sanctuary and Sri Venkateshwara sanctuary are representing deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Deforestation and degradation hotspots identified in the study is an excellent surrogate for understanding anthropogenic disturbances and can be effectively useful in forest management to proceed for applicable restoration measures.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence is thought to maintain diversity by limiting abundances of common species. Yet the extent to which this mechanism can explain patterns of species diversity across environmental gradients is largely unknown. We examined density-dependent recruitment of seedlings and saplings and changes in local species diversity across a soil-resource gradient for 38 woody-plant species in a temperate forest. At both life stages, the strength of negative density dependence increased with resource availability, becoming relatively stronger for rare species during seedling recruitment, but stronger for common species during sapling recruitment. Moreover, negative density dependence appeared to reduce diversity when stronger for rare than common species, but increase diversity when stronger for common species. Our results suggest that negative density dependence is stronger in resource-rich environments and can either decrease or maintain diversity depending on its relative strength among common and rare species.

AB The pervasive pattern of aggregated tree distributions in natural communities is commonly explained by the joint effect of two clustering processes: environmental filtering and dispersal limitation, yet little consensus remains on the relative importance of the two clustering processes on tree aggregations. Different life stages of examined species were thought to be one possible explanation of this disagreement, because the effect of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation are expected to increase and decrease with tree life stages, respectively. However, few studies have explicitly tested these expectations. In this study, we evaluated these expectations by three different methods (species-habitat association test based on Poisson Clustering model and spatial point pattern analyses based on Heterogeneous Poisson model and the jointly modeling approach) using 36 species in a 20-ha subtropical forest plot. Our results showed that the percentage of species with significant habitat association increased with life stages, and there were fewer species affected by dispersal limitation in later life stages compared with those in earlier stages. Percentage of variance explained by the environmental filtering and dispersal limitation also increases and decreases with life stages. These results provided a promising alternative explanation on the existing mixed results about the relative importance of the two clustering processes. These findings also highlighted the importance of plant life stages for fully understanding species distributions and species coexistence.

AB Brazil currently contributes 42 % of all malaria cases reported in the Latin America and the Caribbean, a region where major progress towards malaria elimination has been achieved in recent years. In 2014, malaria burden in Brazil (143,910 microscopically confirmed cases and 41 malaria-related deaths) has reached its lowest levels in 35 years, Plasmodium falciparum is highly focal, and the geographic boundary of transmission has considerably shrunk. Transmission in Brazil remains entrenched in the Amazon Basin, which accounts for 99.5 % of the country's malaria burden. This paper reviews major lessons learned from past and current malaria control policies in Brazil. A comprehensive discussion of the scientific and logistic challenges that may impact malaria elimination efforts in the country is presented in light of the launching of the Plan for Elimination of Malaria in Brazil in November 2015. Challenges for malaria elimination addressed include the high prevalence of symptomless and submicroscopic infections, emerging anti-malarial drug resistance in P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax and the lack of safe anti-relapse drugs, the largely neglected burden of malaria in pregnancy, the need for better vector control strategies where Anopheles mosquitoes present a highly variable biting behaviour, human movement, the need for effective surveillance and tools to identify foci of infection in areas with low transmission, and the effects of environmental changes and climatic variability in transmission. Control actions launched in Brazil and results to come are likely to influence control programs in other countries in the Americas.

AB Forests with closed canopy are generally thought to resist invasion by other species because of the low light conditions under the canopy. However, moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is capable of invading adjacent intact forests, including Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forest, broad-leaved forest, and mixed broadleaf-conifer forest. How does moso bamboo manage to expand and grow under the deep shade of forest canopies? To test this question and explore the light conditions in which bamboo shoots survive, we experimented with shading treatments under field conditions. The levels of shading included total shading of young bamboo shoots, shading with light only to the tip of the shoots (tip light), and no shading (full light). Treatments were applied to shoots developing in pure stands of moso bamboo, and shoots that were invading Chinese fir stands. Shoot survivorship, height, and diameter at breast height (DBH) were measured weekly. Total shading of bamboo shoots led to mortality of all shoots, compared with >90% survival for shaded shoots with tip light and for unshaded shoots. Bamboo shoots elongated over a 60 day period, reaching heights of more than 10 m. Height growth was 8-13% higher for shaded shoots with tip light than for unshaded shoots, with no significant effect of stand type. The elongation of bamboo shoots is largely independent of the light environment that would influence current photosynthesis of the shoot, indicating that shoot elongation likely depends on supplies of carbohydrates from the clonal root system. The deep tolerance of shade that results from clonal of new shoots appears to be a key factor allowing its invasion of intact forest stands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Regarding woody plant responses on higher atmospheric inputs of the macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) on tropical forests in the future, an adaptive modification of wood anatomical traits on the cellular level of woody plants is expected. As part of an interdisciplinary nutrient manipulation experiment (NUMEX) carried out in Southern Ecuador, we present here the first descriptive and quantitative wood anatomical analysis of the tropical evergreen tree species Alchornea lojaensis (Euphorbiaceae). We sampled branch wood of nine individual trees belonging to treatments with N fertilization, N+P fertilization, and a control group, respectively. Quantitative evaluations of eleven different vessel parameters were conducted. The results showed that this endemic tree species will be able to adapt well to the future effects of climate change and higher nutrient deposition. This was firstly implied by an increase in vessel diameter and consequently a higher theo. area-specific hydraulic conductivity with higher nutrient availability. Secondly, the percentage of small vessels (0-20 mu m diameter) strongly increased with fertilization. Thirdly, the vessel arrangement (solitary vessels vs. multiple vessel groupings) changed toward a lower percentage of solitary vessel fraction (VS), and concurrently toward a higher total vessel grouping index (VG) and a higher mean group size of non-solitary vessels (VM) after N and N+P addition. We conclude that higher nutrient availability of N and N+P triggered higher foliage amount and water demand, leading to higher cavitation risk in larger vessels. This is counteracted by a stronger grouping of vessels with smaller risk of cavitation to ensure water supply during drier periods that are expected to occur in higher frequency in the near future.

AB Neotropical dry forests (TDFs) are characterized by a dry season which allows some tree species forming annual rings. In TDFs the study of tree rings using dendrochronology involves their identification, dating and measurement. In this way, we gain a retrospective view of tree growth at a temporal scale in agreement with tree longevity. Having a good knowledge of wood anatomy and phenology is necessary to perform dendrochronological studies in TDFs. For instance, most angiosperm tree species which have been studied in TDFs from a dendrochronological point of view present ring boundaries characterized by a band of marginal parenchyma. The information recorded in tree rings has allowed (i) quantifying how growth of TDF trees responds to climatic variables (mainly precipitation) and determining if it is related to large scale atmospheric patterns (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) (dendroclimatology); (ii) reconstructing the dynamics of many TDFs (dendroecology) by improving our knowledge of tree ages and growth rates. Dendroecology will provide forest managers with objective tools to quantify and forecast cutting cycles, making the management of TDFs more sustainable.

AB 1. Conspecific density may contribute to patterns of species assembly through negative density dependence (NDD) as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, or through facilitation (positive density dependence; PDD). Conspecific density effects are expected to be more negative in darker and wetter environments due to higher pathogen abundance and more positive in stressful, especially dry, environments (stress-gradient hypothesis). For NDD to contribute to maintaining diversity, it should be apparent at the community-wide scale as a negative correlation between seedling recruitment, growth or survival and conspecific adult abundance (community compensatory trend; CCT).
   2. We examined seedling survival in relation to con-and heterospecific adults within 10 m and con-and heterospecific seedlings within 1 m for 13 species within two 4-ha permanent plots located in dry and wet forests in Hawaii. We also examined interactions between conspecific density and light and species' commonness.
   3. For all species pooled, adult conspecific effects were positive (PDD) in both dry and wet forests, though they were stronger in the dry forest. In contrast, seedling conspecific effects were negative (NDD), though only significantly so in the wet forest.
   4. The strength and direction of density effects varied with understorey light such that seedlings had the highest survival where both adult conspecific density and light were high but the lowest survival where seedling conspecific density and light were high.
   5. In the wet forest, the most common species showed positive effects of adult conspecifics, but the less common species showed negative adult conspecific effects. We found mixed evidence for a CCT: seedling survival was positively correlated with basal area, but negatively correlated with tree density (stems ha(-1)). Thus, it remains unclear whether NDD is a diversity-maintaining mechanism in these forests.
   6. Synthesis. Overall, we found that positive conspecific effects influenced seedling mortality patterns more than negative interactions did, even in tropical wet forest where NDD is predicted to drive species' abundances. Additionally, the strength and direction of density effects varied with forest type, PAR, and species' abundance, underscoring the need to consider abiotic factors and species' life-history traits in tests of density dependence hypotheses.

AB The formation of annual growth rings has been confirmed for several mangrove species in the last decade, among which is the Rhizophora mangle. However, the record of annual rings for this species was made in a region with high hydric seasonality, a widely recognized induction factor of annual rings in tropical species. In this sense, the present study aimed to verify the occurrence of annual growth rings in R. mangle in the mangroves of Guaratiba (Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil), a region with low hydric seasonality. For this purpose, the crossdating technique was applied in ten trees collected with known age (seven years). The growth rings are characterized by alternating layers of low vessel density (earlywood) and high vessel density (latewood). Multiple regression analysis indicated that growth rings width variation is driven by precipitation, water surplus, water deficit and water storage. Crossdating analysis confirmed the existence of annual growth rings in the R. mangle in Guaratiba. This discovery in a region with low hydric seasonality increases the dendrocronological potential of this species and suggests the importance of biological factors (eg. phenological behavior) as complementary inductors for the formation of growth rings in this species.

AB All four chimpanzee sub-species populations are declining due to multiple factors including human-caused habitat loss. Effective conservation efforts are therefore needed to ensure their long-term survival. Habitat suitability models serve as useful tools for conservation planning by depicting relative environmental suitability in geographic space over time. Previous studies mapping chimpanzee habitat suitability have been limited to small regions or coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we used Random Forests regression to downscale a coarse resolution habitat suitability calibration dataset to estimate habitat suitability over the entire chimpanzee range at 30-m resolution. Our model predicted habitat suitability well with an r(2) of 0.82 (+/-0.002) based on 50-fold cross validation where 75% of the data was used for model calibration and 25% for model testing; however, there was considerable variation in the predictive capability among the four sub-species modeled individually. We tested the influence of several variables derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) that included metrics of forest canopy and structure for four three-year time periods between 2000 and 2012. Elevation, Landsat ETM+ band 5 and Landsat derived canopy cover were the strongest predictors; highly suitable areas were associated with dense tree canopy cover for all but the Nigeria-Cameroon and Central Chimpanzee sub-species. Because the models were sensitive to such temporally based predictors, our results are the first to highlight the value of integrating continuously updated variables derived from satellite remote sensing into temporally dynamic habitat suitability models to support near real-time monitoring of habitat status and decision support systems.

AB Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are fundamental components of drylands worldwide, and are of great importance for the regulation of ecosystem functioning. However, little is known on the role of species identify of biocrust-forming lichens in mediating the response of nitrogen (N) cycling to concurring global environmental change. Here, we conducted a microcosm study to evaluate how the species identity of biocrust-forming lichens (Diploschistes thunbergianus, Psora crystallifera and Xanthoparmelia reptans) regulate key processes of N cycling in response to simulated changes in rainfall frequency and N addition. We explicitly considered both direct and indirect effects (i.e. driven via microbial diversity and abundance) of global changes on N availability and losses using structural equation models. Our results showed that species of biocrust-forming lichens differentially mediated effects of N amendment and altered rainfall frequencies on belowground nitrate availability and N2O flux rate. For instance, soils under P. crystallifera species showed the highest increase in nitrate content in response to N amendment under low rainfall frequency. Moreover, soils under D. thunbergianus showed the highest N2O flux under high rainfall frequency without N addition. Interestingly, soils under X. reptans showed lowest and highest resistance in nitrate availability and N2O flux, respectively, in response to N addition regardless of different rainfall frequencies. Strikingly, we only found an indirect impact of either rainfall frequency or N amendment on the nitrate availability (but not N2O flux) driven via the ammonia-oxidizing community under X reptans. Our results provide evidence that the species identity of biocrust-forming lichens modulates the response of N cycling to global change drivers. These findings have implications for predicting the potential consequence of altered rainfall patterns and environmental N inputs in dryland ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In tropical plant communities with diverse species, many congeners are found to coexist. Do environment or biotic interactions structure the coexistence of congeners in tropical forest communities? In this paper, we aimed to disentangle the effect of environment (first-order effects) and species interactions (second-order effects) on the spatial distributions of tree species. We used a classification scheme and torus-translation to test the first-order interaction of 48 species from 17 genera in a fully mapped 20-ha dipterocarp tropical seasonal rain-forest plot in Xishuangbanna, south-west China. Then we used heterogeneous Poisson null models to reveal significant uni- and bivariate second-order interactions. The results demonstrated that (1) 34 of the 48 studied species showed a significant relation with at least one topographic variable. This confirmed that topographical heterogeneity is important for distribution of these congeners. Spatial segregation (36.6%) and partial overlap (34.8%) were the most common bivariate association types in Xishuangbanna plot, which indicated first-order effects (environment) were strong. (2) For small-scale associations, 51% saplings (1 to <= 5 cm) (68.8% for large trees with dbh > 5 cm) of the species showed non-significant associations. For large-scale associations, 61.6% saplings (81.2% for large trees) of the species showed non-significant associations. Lack of significant species interactions provides evidence for the unified neutral theory. In conclusion, both environment and biotic interactions structure congeneric species' coexistence in tropical seasonal rain forest in this region.

AB The ranges, spectra of habitat types, and food spectra of artiodactyls in the Far East have been studied. It has been supposed that the overlap of ranges and habitat-type spectra should decrease with an increase in the overlap of food spectra. However, all the three similarity indices have proved to be positively correlated with each other, suggesting that, on the regional scale, the negative role of trophic competition in artiodactyl communities is insignificant, probably because of their low abundance. Conversely, the similarity of food spectra may be regarded as a factor accounting for the overlap of ranges and habitat spectra and, on a large-region scale, for the maintenance of high species diversity.

AB Methods Seedling tolerance of simulated herbivory was tested in a diverse pool of ten Hawaiian plant species, including several lobeliad species (family Campanulaceae), a grass, a herb and common woody trees and shrubs. Tolerance was measured as the relative survival and growth of damaged plants receiving 50 % defoliation with simultaneous jasmonic acid application compared with undamaged control plants, assessed 1 center dot 5 and 5 weeks after damage. Putative mechanisms of tolerance were measured, including photosynthetic parameters, light use efficiency, and biomass allocation reflecting growth priorities, and analysed using species-level regression analyses on tolerance indices.
   Key Results No species fully tolerated 50 % defoliation at either harvest date, and simulated herbivory significantly reduced shoot as well as root biomass. Lobeliad species had particularly low tolerance. Species varied considerably in size, biomass allocation parameters and their constitutive (pre-damage) and induced (post-damage) photosynthetic parameters. However, only constitutive levels of non-photochemical quenching were significantly related to tolerance, indicating that species with more efficient light use (and less heat dissipation) are better at tolerating damage than species with high levels of heat dissipation.
   Conclusions Native Hawaiian plants expressed low tolerance to a conservative level of simulated herbivory. Root growth decreased in response to damage, but this was not associated with greater tolerance, suggesting this response may be due to allocation constraints following defoliation and not due to adaptive plasticity. Conservation of native island plants threatened by invasive herbivores should prioritize protection for seedlings for improved regeneration and the persistence of native plants in disturbed habitats.

AB It is important to detect and quantify deforestation to guide strategic decisions regarding environment, socioeconomic development, and climate change. In the present study, we conducted a field experiment to examine spectral reflectance and vegetation index changes in poplar and locust tree foliage with different leaf area indices over the course of three sunny days, following tree removal from the canopy. The spectral reflectance of foliage from harvested trees was measured using an ASD FieldSpec Prospectroradiometer; synchronous meteorological data were also obtained. We found that reflectance in short-wave infrared and red-edge reflectance was more time sensitive after tree removal than reflectance in other spectral regions, and that the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIRE) were the preferred indicators of these changes from several indices evaluated. Synthesized meteorological environments were found to influence water and chlorophyll contents after tree removal, and this subsequently changed the spectral canopy reflectance. Our results indicate the potential for such tree removal to be detected with NDWI or CIRE from the second day of a deforestation event.

AB A key question for food, biofuels, and bioproducts production is how agriculture affects the environment, and social and economic development. In Brazil, a large agricultural producer and among the biologically wealthiest of nations, this question is challenging and opinions often clash. The Brazilian parliament and several stakeholders have recently debated the revision of the Forest Act, the most important legal framework for conservation of natural vegetation on Brazilian private agricultural lands. Past decades have shown improvements in the agricultural sector with respect to productivity and efficiency, along with great reductions in deforestation and growth of environmentally certified production. However, the opposing sides in the debate have ignored this progress and instead continue to entrench their respective combative positions. A structured exchange involving nine experts associated with major producer interests (livestock, crops, planted forest, and charcoal) and environmental NGOs was moderated based on a framework that sorted viewpoints into four categories: (i) common ground - compatible interests considered to be high priority for Brazilian sustainable agricultural development; (ii) serving exclusive nature conservation interest; (iii) serving exclusive agricultural production interest; and (iv) mainly serving the purpose of sustaining dispute. We conclude that the majority of actions and expected future trends reflect achievements and ambitions to balance production and conservation, but much public opinion - and in turn decisions in the parliament and government for agriculture and conservation - is shaped by a perceived conflict between these objectives and a debate that has become, at least to some extent, an end in itself.

AB The environmental variables that define a species ecological niche should be associated with the evolutionary patterns present in the adaptations that resulted from living in these conditions. Thus, when comparing across species, we can expect to find an association between phylogenetically independent phenotypic characters and ecological niche evolution. Few studies have evaluated how organismal phenotypes might mirror patterns of niche evolution if these phenotypes reflect adaptations. Doing so could contribute on the understanding of the origin and maintenance of phenotypic diversity observed in nature. Here, we show the pattern of niche evolution of the pinyon pine lineage (Pinus subsection Cembroides); then, we suggest morphological adaptations possibly related to niche divergence, and finally, we test for correlation between ecological niche and morphology. We demonstrate that niche divergence is the general pattern within the clade and that it is positively correlated with adaptation.

AB In subtropical coastal dune forests of South Africa, the microenvironment of tree seedlings is largely influenced by a pervasive understorey woody herb, Isoglossa woodii. We examined whether the additional shading by I. woodii explains the competitive response of tree seedlings from these forests. Seedlings of four common mid-to late-successional tree species (Diospyros natalensis, Euclea racemosa, Sideroxylon inerme and Apodytes dimidiata) were grown at three densities of I. woodii in a common garden experiment under greenhouse conditions. The seedlings were grown at 1.6% and 13.5% of full sunlight and supplied with 1% and 10% nitrogen in half-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution. Total biomass and biomass allocation parameters were used to measure the competitive response of the seedlings. Seedlings attained maximum biomass at high light and high nutrient levels and showed species-and light-specific responses to biomass of I. woodii neighbours. Seedlings' allocation to roots increased with increasing light levels but decreased at higher nutrient levels. The leaf mass fraction (LMF) response to light and nutrient levels was opposite to that shown by root allocation. Specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) decreased with increasing light conditions but were not responsive to manipulation of nutrients. The presence of I. woodii neighbours reduced LMF whilst the responses of SLA to neighbours depended on the light level and species. Leaf trait responses to manipulation of light conditions, I. woodii neighbour density and soil nutrient concentration are complex but overall demonstrate an overwhelming role of light in influencing seedling establishment in coastal dune forests. The competitive response of these seedlings to low irradiance reiterates the notion of phenotypic clustering at the seedling stage amongst shade tolerant tree species, which promotes seedling persistence and gradual transition into the tree layer. Our results highlight the role of additional understorey shading by the herb stratum in influencing tree recruitment dynamics and ultimately tree community structure in many of Africa's tropical lowland forests.

AB Alpine ecosystems occur under extreme climatic conditions and, as a result, house a unique and vulnerable biota. They are very scarce at tropical latitudes; in Mexico occur mainly along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, where species richness is not high but narrow endemics stand out. We investigate the effects of climate change under hypothesized contrasting climate warming scenarios using ecological niche modeling of five microendemic alpine species. Occurrence data was obtained mainly from field trips, but herbaria were also examined. A total of 21 climatic and topographic variables, as well as individual selections of 12-16 variables were employed to construct models with Maxent and GARP. Depending on the number of occurrences, current models were validated with Partial-ROC or Jackknife procedures; and projections to 2050 and 2070 were made using two Representative Concentration Pathways and two Global Circulation Models. All species' models showed a clear pattern of contraction under the explored scenarios; over 58 % of contemporary climatic distribution disappeared, suggesting that analyzed species face imminent extinction due to climatic habitat loss. The models are useful in representing the endemic component of Mexican alpine grassland by reciprocal correspondence in geographic distribution, and we consider it as a highly endangered ecosystem due to climate change, which is probably applicable to other tropical alpine ecosystems. The Pico de Orizaba volcano seems the best option to preserve due to its extension and elevation. However, further studies at finer scales are needed to improve in situ preservation and conservation strategies that include translocation, assisted migration and seed banking.

AB Nonnative plants alter the composition of native plant communities, with concomitant effects on arthropods. However, plant invasions may not be the only disturbance affecting native communities, and multiple disturbances can have compounding effects. We assessed the effects of invasion and drought on plant and arthropod communities by comparing grasslands dominated by nonnative Old World bluestem grasses (OWBs, Dichanthium annulatum) to grasslands dominated by native plants during a period of decreasing drought severity (2011-2013). Native plant communities had more species of plants and arthropods (/m(2)) than areas dominated by OWBs during extreme drought, but richness was comparable as drought severity decreased. Abundance of arthropods was greater in native plant communities than in OWB communities during extreme drought, but OWB communities had more arthropods during moderate and non-drought conditions. We observed a shift in the arthropod community from one dominated by detritivores to one dominated by herbivores following plant invasion; the magnitude of this shift increased as drought severity decreased. Both plant communities were dominated by nonnative arthropods. A nonnative leafhopper (Balclutha rubrostriata) and native mites (Mochlozetidae) dominated OWB communities as drought severity decreased, and OWBs may serve as refugia for both taxa. Nonnative woodlice (Armadillidium vulgare) dominated native plant communities during extreme and non-drought conditions and abundance of this species may be associated with an increase in plant litter and available nutrients. Given the importance of arthropods for ecosystem services, incorporating arthropod data into conservation studies may demonstrate how changes in arthropod diversity alter ecosystem function where nonnative plants are dominant.

AB We used butterfly species lists available for a set of 125 Czech Republic National Nature Reserves and Monuments, the highest small-sized conservation category in the country encompassing practically all biotope types existing in central Europe, to test the validity of generally agreed reserve design rules using multivariate ordination analyses. Further, we used ordination analysis of butterfly life history traits to seek for biological mechanisms responsible for butterfly community responses to essentially geometric reserves characteristics. Reserve area, relative perimeter, within reserve habitat heterogeneity, and surrounding landscape compositional and configurational heterogeneity all affected the composition of butterfly assemblages after controlling for effects of geographical position and prevailing biotope type. Species inclining towards large reserves displayed low mobility and high local population density, probably because they require large habitat areas to maintain self-sustaining populations; such species tend to have restricted distribution in the country and threatened status. Reserves with relatively long boundaries hosted species with high mobility, broad trophic range and long adult period; faunas of such reserves contain high proportions of widespread generalists. Species with narrow trophic ranges inclined towards reserves containing diverse habitats, probably due to requirements for high floristic diversity. Species with short adult flight, low generations number and overwintering in early stages inclined towards reserves situated amidst diverse landscapes, perhaps because such species require finely-grained mosaics for metapopulation dynamics. Commonly agreed reserve design rules thus hold for Central European butterflies, but different design characteristics are important for individual species, depending on their life histories.

AB Conspecific effects of neighbours on small-tree survival may have a role in tree population dynamics and community composition of tropical forests. This notion was tested with data from two 4-ha plots in lowland forest at Danum, Sabah (Borneo), for a 21-year interval (censuses at 1986, 1996, 2001, 2007). Species with a parts per thousand yen45 focal trees 10 to < 100 cm stem girth per plot in 1986 were selected. Logistic regressions fitted mean focal tree size and mean inverse-distance-weighted basal area abundance of neighbours (within 20 m), for the periods over which each focus tree was alive. Coefficients of variation of neighbourhood basal area abundance, both spatially and temporally, quantified the changing environment of each focus tree. Fits were critically and individually evaluated, with corrections for spatial autocorrelation. Conspecific effects at Danum was generally very weak or non-existent: species' mortality rates varied also across plots. The main reasons appear to be that (1) species were not dense enough to interact despite frequent although weak spatial aggregation, and their neighbourhoods were highly differing in species composition; and (2) these neighbourhoods were highly variable temporally, meaning that focus trees experienced stochastically fluctuating neighbourhood environments. Only one species, Dimorphocalyx muricatus, showed strong conspecific effects (varying between plots) which can be explained by its distinct ecology. This understorey species is highly aggregated on ridges and is drought-tolerant. That this functionally and habitat-specialized species, has implied intraspecific density-dependent feedback in its dynamics is a remarkable indication of the overall processes maintaining stability of the Danum forest.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) has been recognized as a key mechanism underlying species coexistence, especially in tropical forests. Recently, some studies have reported that seedling survival is also negatively correlated with the phylogenetic relatedness between neighbors and focal individuals, termed phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD). In contrast to CNDD or PNDD, shared habitat requirements between closely related individuals are thought to be a cause of observed positive effects of closely related neighbors, which may affect the strength and detectability of CNDD or PNDD. In order to investigate the relative importance of these mechanisms for tropical tree seedling survival, we used generalized linear mixed models to analyze how the survival of more than 10 000 seedlings of woody plant species related to neighborhood and habitat variables in a tropical rainforest in southwest China. By comparing models with and without habitat variables, we tested how habitat filtering affected the detection of CNDD and PNDD. The best-fitting model suggested that CNDD and habitat filtering played key roles in seedling survival, but that, contrary to our expectations, phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD) had a distinct and important effect. While habitat filtering affected the detection of CNDD by decreasing its apparent strength, it did not explain the positive effects of closely related neighbors. Our results demonstrate that a failure to control for habitat variables and phylogenetic relationships may obscure the importance of conspecific and heterospecific neighbor densities for seedling survival.

AB The ant species Myrmica scabrinodis plays a markedly important ecological role through much of the humid grasslands of Eurasia. It hosts a species-rich community of pathogens and parasites, including Rickia wasmannii, an enigmatic member of entomoparasitic laboulbenialean fungi. This study provides a descriptive ecology of R. wasmannii by characterizing its prevalence and distribution across several hierarchical levels: colonies, individuals, and anatomic body parts. Infections were restricted to a single ant species, M. scabrinodis, and infected colonies occurred predominantly in wet habitats. Infections tended to be highly prevalent within infected colonies, often reaching 100% sample prevalence among workers. Individual infections exhibited an aggregated distribution typical to host-parasite systems. Workers from the aboveground part of nests (presumably older ones acting as foragers) were more infected than those from the belowground part. Fungal thalli could be found all over the body of the hosts, the head and the abdomen being the most infected parts of the body. The fungi's distribution among host body parts statistically differed between low versus high-intensity infections: the initial dominance of the head decreased with advancing infection. These findings may provide baseline data for future comparative or monitoring studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of plant-frugivore interactions provides a quantitative framework for integrating community structure and ecosystem function in terms of how the roles and attributes of individual species contribute to network structure and resilience. In this study, we used centrality metrics to rank and detect the most important species in a mutualistic network of fruit-eating birds and plants in a cloud forest in the Colombian Andes. We identified a central core of ten bird and seven plant species in a network of 135 species that perform dual roles as local hubs and connectors. The birds were mostly large forest frugivores, such as cracids, cotingas, and toucans, which consume fruits of all sizes. The plants were species of intermediate successional stages with small- to medium-sized seeds that persist in mature forest or forest borders (e.g., Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). We found the resilience of our network depends on super-generalist species, because their elimination makes the network more prone to disassemble than random extinctions, potentially disrupting seed-dispersal processes. At our study site, extirpation of large frugivores has already been documented, and if this continues, the network might collapse despite its high diversity. Our results suggest that generalist species play critical roles in ecosystem function and should be incorporated into conservation and monitoring programs.
   Resumen Las interacciones planta-frugivoro proveen un marco de referencia cuantitativo para integrar la estructura de las comunidades con las funciones ecosistemicas, al identificar los roles y atributos de especies individuales y su contribucion a la estructura y resiliencia de la red. En este estudio, clasificamos las especies usando indices de centralidad para detectar las especies mas importantes en una red de interacciones mutualista compuesta por aves frugivoras y plantas en un bosque nublado de los andes de Colombia. Identificamos un grupo central de diez aves y siete plantas en una red de 135 especies, que realizan la doble funcion de actuar como nodos locales y conectores. Las aves fueron en su mayoria frugivoras grandes como cracidos, cotingas y tucanes que consumen frutos de todos los tamanos. Las plantas fueron especies de etapas intermedias de sucesion con semillas pequenas a medianas que persisten en bosques maduros o bordes (ej. Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). Encontramos que la resiliencia de nuestra red depende de las especies super-generalistas, porque su eliminacion hace mas posible el colapso de la red que las extinciones aleatorias, irrumpiendo potencialmente los procesos de dispersion de semillas. En nuestro sitio de estudio ya se han documentado extinciones locales de grandes aves frugivoras, y si su perdida continua la red puede colapsar a pesar de ser altamente diversa. Nuestros resultados sugieren que las especies generalistas juegan roles importantes para el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas y deben ser incorporadas en programas de conservacion y monitoreo que prevengan la perdida de fauna y mantengan la conectividad del bosque a nivel del paisaje con un mosaico de estados sucesionales.

AB Invasive species pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. This study investigates the extent to which human disturbance to natural ecosystems facilitates the spread of non-native species, focusing on a small mammal community in selectively logged rain forest, Sabah, Borneo. The microhabitat preferences of the invasive Rattus rattus and three native species of small mammal were examined in three-dimensional space by combining the spool-and-line technique with a novel method for quantifying fine-scale habitat selection. These methods allowed the detection of significant differences for each species between the microhabitats used compared with alternative, available microhabitats that were avoided. Rattus rattus showed the greatest preference for heavily disturbed habitats, and in contrast to two native small mammals of the genus Maxomys, R.rattus showed high levels of arboreal behavior, frequently leaving the forest floor and traveling through the understory and midstory forest strata. This behavior may enable R.rattus to effectively utilize the complex three-dimensional space of the lower strata in degraded forests, which is characterized by dense vegetation. The behavioral flexibility of R.rattus to operate in both terrestrial and arboreal space may facilitate its invasion into degraded forests. Human activities that generate heavily disturbed habitats preferred by R.rattus may promote the establishment of this invasive species in tropical forests in Borneo, and possibly elsewhere. We present this as an example of a synergistic effect, whereby forest disturbance directly threatens biodiversity and indirectly increases the threat posed by invasive species, creating habitat conditions that facilitate the establishment of non-native fauna.
   Abstrak Spesies invasif merupakan satu daripada ancaman utama terhadap kepelbagian biologi. Kajian ini menyelidik sejauh mana gangguan terhadap ekosistem semulajadi oleh manusia memudahkan penyebaran spesies asing dengan memberi tumpuan kepada mamalia kecil di hutan hujan tropika yang telah dibalak secara terpilih di negeri Sabah, Borneo. Pemilihan habitat-mikro spesies invasif Rattus rattus dan tiga spesies mamalia kecil tempatan yang lain telah diselidik dalam ruang tiga dimensi dengan menggunakan gabungan kaedah spool-dan-benang dan satu kaedah baharu untuk menentukan secara kuantitatif pemilihan habitat pada skala kecil. Kaedah-kaedah ini memungkinkan pengesanan perbezaan yang signifikan dari segi habitat-mikro yang digunakan oleh setiap spesies mamalia kecil yang dikaji berbanding dengan habitat-mikro yang tidak digunakan oleh spesies-spesies yang berkenaan. Rattus rattus menunjukkan pemilihan paling ketara terhadap habitat yang sangat terganggu. Ini berbeza daripada dua spesies mamalia kecil tempatan yang lain iaitu dari genus Maxomys, yang mana R.rattus menunjukkan kelakuan arboreal yang sangat tinggi, dan spesies ini kerap meninggalkan bahagian lantai hutan dan bergerak melalui strata hutan bawah dan hutan pertengahan. Kelakuan ini membolehkan R.rattus menggunakan ruang tiga dimensi yang kompleks pada strata hutan bawah di habitat hutan yang terganggu, yang mana hutan ini adalah dicirkan oleh vegetasi yang sangat tebal. Fleksibiliti kelakuan R.rattus membolehkan spesies ini beroperasi di kedua-dua ruang terrestrial dan arboreal. Ini memudahkan penyebaran R.rattus di habitat hutan terganggu. Aktiviti manusia yang menghasilkan habitat yang teruk terganggu yang disukai oleh R.rattus mungkin akan mempromosi penyebaran spesies yang invasif ini di hutan tropika Borneo, dan juga tempat-tempat lain. Kami menunjukkan hasil kajian ini sebagai satu contoh kesan senergi, yang mana gangguan terhadap habitat akan mengancam kepelbagai biologi secara langsung, dan ini secara tidak langsung akan mengakibatkan peningkatan ancaman oleh spesies invasive iaitu dengan cara membina suatu keadaan habitat yang mempermudahkan penyebaran fauna asing.

AB QuestionsWhich factors affect the diversity and species composition of tropical secondary rain forests in a region with little information regarding their contribution to global biodiversity? Can older secondary forests approach the diversity and composition of mature forests following 100yr of pasture use?
   LocationTropical secondary rain forest, northeast Australia.
   MethodsWe identified trees, shrubs and vines 2.5cm DBH in a chronosequence comprising 33 sites, aged 3-60yr since the formation of closed canopy (9-69yr since pasture abandonment) and compared them with eight sites in nearby mature forest remnants.
   ResultsSpecies richness and community composition were strongly influenced by secondary forest age but did not attain values of mature forest. Sites in close proximity to mature forests had higher plant richness, whereas low soil fertility appeared to depress species recruitment. Thus, multiple factors operated in secondary forest community assembly. Unusual tree community patterns that suggest accelerated or slowed successional trajectories were observed at several sites.
   ConclusionsSecondary forests in our study region contained important plant diversity for conservation, particularly in older sites, however, even the oldest secondary forests (60yr) did not converge with the species composition and diversity of mature forests. The protection of mature forest tracts and remnants must be a priority if we are to maintain high levels of plant diversity in tropical landscapes, conserve rare species and facilitate the recruitment of plant species in recovering forests.

   APPROACH
AB Evolutionary paleoecologists have proposed many explanations for Phanerozoic trends in ecospace utilization, including escalation, seafood through time, filling of an empty ecospace, and tiering, among others. These hypotheses can be generalized into four models of functional diversification within a life-habit ecospace framework (functional-trait space). The models also incorporate concepts in community assembly, functional diversity, evolutionary diversification, and morphological disparity. The redundancy model produces an ecospace composed of clusters of functionally similar taxa. The partitioning model produces an ecospace that is progressively subdivided by taxa along life-habit gradients. The expansion model produces an ecospace that becomes progressively enlarged by the accumulation of taxa with novel life habits. These models can be caused by a wide range of ecological and evolutionary processes, but they are all caused by particular driven mechanisms. A fourth, neutral model also exists, in which ecospace is filled at random by life habits: this model can serve as a passive null model. Each model produces distinct dynamics for functional diversity/disparity statistics when simulated by stochastic simulations of ecospace diversification. In this first of two companion articles, I summarize the theoretical bases of these models, describe their expected statistical dynamics, and discuss their relevance to important paleoecological trends and theories. Although most synoptic interpretations of Phanerozoic ecological history invoke one or more of the driven models, I argue that this conclusion is premature until tests are conducted that provide better statistical support for them over simpler passive models.

AB We aimed to understand the effect of rock outcrops on the growth of Podocarpus lambertii within a microrefuge. Our hypothesis holds that the growth and survival of this species depend on the regional climate decoupling provided by rock outcrops. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the microclimate of (1) surrounding vegetation, (2) rock outcrop corridors, and (3) adjacencies. We assessed population structure by collecting data of specimen stem diameter and height. We also assessed differences between vegetation associated or not with outcrops using satellite imaging. For dendrochronological analyses, we sampled 42 individuals. Tree rings of 31 individuals were dated, and climate-growth relationships were tested. Rock outcrops produce a favorable microclimate by reducing average temperature by 4.9 degrees C and increasing average air humidity by 12 %. They also reduce the variability of atmospheric temperature by 42 % and air humidity by 20 % supporting a vegetation with higher leaf area index. Within this vegetation, specimen height was strongly constrained by the outcrop height. Although temperature and precipitation modulate this species growth, temperature-induced stress is the key limiting growth factor for this population of P. lambertii. We conclude that this species growth and survival depend on the presence of rock outcrops. These topography elements decouple regional climate in a favorable way for this species growth. However, these benefits are restricted to the areas sheltered by rock outcrops. Although this microrefuge supported P. lambertii growth so far, it is unclear whether this protection would be sufficient to withstand the stress of future climate changes.

AB Pitheciids are known for their frugivorous diets, but there has been no broad-scale comparison of fruit genera used by these primates that range across five geographic regions in South America. We compiled 31 fruit lists from data collected from 18 species (three Cacajao, six Callicebus, five Chiropotes, and four Pithecia) at 26 study sites in six countries. Together, these lists contained 455 plant genera from 96 families. We predicted that 1) closely related Chiropotes and Cacajao would demonstrate the greatest similarity in fruit lists; 2) pitheciids living in closer geographic proximity would have greater similarities in fruit lists; and 3) fruit genus richness would be lower in lists from forest fragments than continuous forests. Fruit genus richness was greatest for the composite Chiropotes list, even though Pithecia had the greatest overall sampling effort. We also found that the Callicebus composite fruit list had lower similarity scores in comparison with the composite food lists of the other three genera (both within and between geographic areas). Chiropotes and Pithecia showed strongest similarities in fruit lists, followed by sister taxa Chiropotes and Cacajao. Overall, pitheciids in closer proximity had more similarities in their fruit list, and this pattern was evident in the fruit lists for both Callicebus and Chiropotes. There was no difference in the number of fruit genera used by pitheciids in habitat fragments and continuous forest. Our findings demonstrate that pitheciids use a variety of fruit genera, but phylogenetic and geographic patterns in fruit use are not consistent across all pitheciid genera. This study represents the most extensive examination of pitheciid fruit consumption to date, but future research is needed to investigate the extent to which the trends in fruit genus richness noted here are attributable to habitat differences among study sites, differences in feeding ecology, or a combination of both.

AB Forests are naturally extensive tracts. However, in South Africa natural fires over many millennia have reduced forested areas into small remnants spread throughout a grassland matrix. Small patches, especially distant patches, are generally considered to be adverse for forest specialists, owing to decreased forest interior and increased edge. Here we test this assumption by determining the impact of forest interpatch distance and patch size on epigaeic arthropod diversity in this globally rare vegetation type. Forty patches were selected: ten large (100-435 m diameter) that are distant (500-645 m) from other patches, ten large that are close to other patches (38-97 m), ten small (30-42 m) that are distant, and ten small-close patches. Each patch had two plots: edge and interior. Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, Berlese-Tullgren funnels and active searches. Interiors and edges had similar species richness and composition, excluding spiders, which were richer in interiors. Patch size significantly influenced species richness of predatory beetles and arthropod assemblages, excluding spiders. Effect of the interaction between patch size and interpatch distance on species richness and composition varied among taxa. Furthermore, large patches supported similar assemblages regardless of interpatch distance. Arthropod response, particularly ants to patch size and interpatch distance, was partly shaped by the matrix type. The percentage of surrounding grassland had little effect on arthropod diversity. We can conclude that large and close patches are important for arthropod conservation. Nevertheless, it is also important to conserve a variety of patch sizes at various distances to maximize overall arthropod composition.

AB Quantifying and understanding the main drivers of biodiversity responses to human disturbances at multiple scales is key to foster effective conservation plans and management systems. Here we report on a detailed regional assessment of the response of ant communities to land-use change and forest disturbance in the Brazilian Amazon. We aimed to explore the effects of land-use intensification at both site and landscape scales, examining variation in ant species richness and composition, and asking which set of environmental variables best predict observed patterns of diversity. We sampled 192 sites distributed across 18 landscapes (each 50 km(2)) in Paragominas, eastern Brazilian Amazon, covering ca. 20,000 km(2). We sampled from undisturbed primary forest through varyingly disturbed primary forests, secondary forests, pastures and mechanised agriculture, following a gradient of decreasing total aboveground biomass. Irrespective of forest disturbance class, ant species richness was almost twice as high in forests when compared to production areas. In contrast, ant species composition showed continuous variation from primary forest to intensive agriculture, following a gradient of aboveground biomass. Ant species richness at all spatial scales increased with primary forest cover in the surrounding landscapes. We highlight the limited value of species richness as an indicator of changes in habitat quality, reinforcing calls to consider species composition in assessments of forest disturbance. Taken together, our results reveal the unique biodiversity value of undisturbed primary forests, but also show that disturbed primary forests and secondary forests have high conservation value, and thus play an important role in regional conservation planning.

AB Mutualistic relationships between organisms have long captivated biologists, and extrafloral nectaries, or nectar-producing glands, found on many plants are a good example. The nectar produced from these glands provides food for ants, which may defend the plant from potential herbivores in turn. However, relatively little is known about their impact on the long-term growth and survival of plants that produce them. To better understand the ecological significance of extrafloral nectaries, we examined their incidence on lowland tropical rain forest trees in Yasuni National Park in Amazonian Ecuador, and collated data from two other tropical lowland forest sites (Barro Colorado Island, Panama and Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia). At Yasuni, extrafloral nectaries were found on 137 of 1123 species censused (12.2%), widely distributed among different angiosperm families. This rate of incidence is high but consistent with other tropical locations. Furthermore, this study adds 18 new genera and two new families (Urticaceae and Caricaceae) to the list of taxa exhibiting extrafloral nectaries. Using demographic data from long-term forest dynamics plots at each site, we compared the growth and mortality rates of species with extrafloral nectaries to those without. After controlling for phylogeny, no general relationship between extrafloral nectary presence and demographic rates could be detected, suggesting little demographic signal from any community-wide ecological effects.
   Resumen La relaciones mutualistas entre especies siempre han cautivado el interes de los Biologos, y los nectarios extraflorales (EFNs) o el nectar producido por glandulas es un buen ejemplo de esto. El nectar producido por estas glandulas puede ser consumido por hormigas, las cuales en retorno defienden la planta de posible herbivoros. Sin embargo, pocos estudios han evaluado el impacto a largo plazo en crecimiento y supervivencia de especies que poseen estas estructuras. Para un mejor entendimiento sobre el significado ecologico de estos nectarios extraflorales, hemos examinado la incidencia en arboles de bosques humedos tropicales en tierras bajas en el Parque Nacional Yasuni, Amazonia Ecuatoriana, y comparado con bosques tropicales en La Isla de Barro Colorado, Panama y La Reserva Forestal Pasoh, Malasya. Se registraron nectarios extraflorales 137 de las 1123 especies en Yasuni (12.2%), los cuales se presentaron en diferentes familias a lo largo de las angiospermas. Esta alta incidencia fue encontrada igualmente en otras localidades. Adicionalmente, en este estudio se reporta la presencia de nectarios extraflorales en 18generos y dos 2 familias (Urticaceae and Caricaceae) no citados en estudios previos. Informacion demografica de las parcelas de dinamica forestal permitio comparar las tasas de crecimiento y mortalidad de especies con presencia o sin ella de nectarios extraflorales. Aislando las relaciones filogeneticas entre estas especies, no se encontraron relaciones demograficas asociadas con la presencia de nectarios extraflorales, sugiriendo que factores demograficos influyen poco en el efecto ecologico a nivel de poblaciones.Resumen a traves de la comparacion de nuestro estudio sobre la presencia de nectarios extraflorales en bosques tropicales, se pudo observar que familias de arboles con nectarios son abundantes y poseen alto numero de especies, sugiriendo que el exito evolutivo de estos clados puede estar influenciado por beneficios asociados a la presencia de los nectarios extraflorales. Este estudio no pudo detectar un impacto positivo o negativo de estos beneficios en individuos con 1cm>DAP, pero se sugiere que cualquier beneficio en el rendimiento de estas especies debe ser mayor en los estadios de plantulas y juveniles donde los impactos negativos por herbivoria son mayores.

AB The Black Curassow (Crax alector) is a large game bird with Vulnerable conservation status found in north-central South America. We examined its distributional pattern across French Guiana using a large number of environmental descriptors at 3 scales of analysis: landscape, forest type, and microhabitat. We used a hierarchical model with temporary emigration and imperfect detection for data collected by standard distance sampling methods at 35 study sites. At the landscape scale, Black Curassow density decreased with hunting pressure and increased with steeper slopes in both hunted and unhunted areas. Topography appeared to be a good proxy for Black Curassow ecological requirements and probably reflected habitat quality. At the forest scale, population density was negatively correlated with the abundance of palms and Mimosoideae and positively correlated with the abundance of Lauraceae. Botanical families did not directly influence Black Curassow distribution, but rather determined spatial patterns by being markers of a particular forest type. At the microhabitat scale, Black Curassows used hilltops more frequently than other parts of the local topographical gradient. Our multiscale analysis shows that this species' distribution can be explained by biotic or abiotic conditions, regardless of the scale. For conservation, we recommend maintaining connectivity between Black Curassow populations separated by hunted areas. Our predicted densities could be used to adapt hunting quotas across French Guiana's forests. We show that combining field and remote sensing data helps to understand the ecological processes responsible for Black Curassow habitat relationships.

AB Seed predation is an important ecological process that affects the abundance, diversity and distribution of plant species, and it is known to be influenced by defaunation and forest fragmentation. Most studies on seed predation in human-modified landscapes do not take into account the different spatial scales in which this process operates. In this study, we evaluated how variables at three distinct spatial scales affected the seed predation of a palm that provides a keystone resource to the frugivore community, the queen palm Syagrus romanzoffiana. Thirteen landscapes that vary in forest cover, number of fragments and patch sizes were sampled in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We also evaluated the contribution of the three main groups of seed predators: squirrels, terrestrial rodents and invertebrates. Our results indicate that seed predation is more affected by fragment and local variables than by landscape influences. In addition, the size of the fragment, its shape and the distance from the nearest forest edge were the main predictors of the proportion of predated seeds. Moreover, the two main seed predators (squirrels and invertebrates) responded to the same fragment and local variables. Because most of the Atlantic forest consists of small fragments, we expect that the seed predation of this keystone palm should be high in most of its distribution, with potential consequences for the frugivore community.

AB Tropical forests have long been thought to be in stable state, but recent insights indicate that global change is leading to shifts in forest dynamics and species composition. These shifts may be driven by environmental changes such as increased resource availability, increased drought stress, and/or recovery from past disturbances. The relative importance of these drivers can be inferred from analyzing changes in trait values of tree communities. Here, we evaluate a decade of change in species and trait composition across five old-growth Neotropical forests in Bolivia, Brazil, Guyana, and Costa Rica that cover large gradients in rainfall and soil fertility. To identify the drivers of compositional change, we used data from 29 permanent sample plots and measurements of 15 leaf, stem, and whole-plant traits that are important for plant performance and should respond to global change drivers. We found that forests differ strongly in their community-mean trait values, resulting from differences in soil fertility and annual rainfall seasonality. The abundance of deciduous species with high specific leaf area increases from wet to dry forests. The community-mean wood density is high in the driest forests to protect xylem vessels against drought cavitation, and is high in nutrient-poor forests to increase wood longevity and enhance nutrient residence time in the plant. Interestingly, the species composition changed over time in three of the forests, and the community-mean wood density increased and the specific leaf area decreased in all forests, indicating that these forests are changing toward later successional stages dominated by slow-growing, shade-tolerant species. We did not see changes in other traits that could reflect responses to increased drought stress, such as increased drought deciduousness or decreased maximum adult size, or that could reflect increased resource availability (CO2, rainfall, or nitrogen). Changes in species and trait composition in these forests are therefore most likely caused by recovery from past disturbances. These compositional changes may also lead to shifts in ecosystem processes, such as a lower carbon sequestration and "slower" forest dynamics.

AB The growth, morphology and biomass allocation of 11 liana species (six light-demanding and five shade-tolerant) were investigated by growing plants in three contrasting light environments (i.e., field, forest edge and forest interior). Our objectives were to determine: (1) changes in plant traits at the species level; and (2) differences in light-demanding and shade-tolerant species in response to altered light environment. We found that all seedlings of liana species increased in total biomass, total leaf area, relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), height, basal diameter, root length, leaf number, root mass/total plant mass (RMR) and root-to-shoot dry biomass (R/S ratio), and decreased in leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf size, stem mass-to-total plant mass ratio (SMR) and leaf mass-to-total plant mass ratio (LMR) with increasing light availability. Under the three light environments, the two types of species differed significantly in total biomass, total leaf area, RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and leaf number, and not in leaf area. Only light-demanding species differed significantly in height, root length, basal diameter, RMR, SMR, LMR and R/S ratio. The mean plasticity index of growth and biomass allocation were relatively higher than the morphological variables, with significant differences between the two groups. Our results showed that liana species respond differently to changing light environments and that light-demanding species exhibit higher plasticity. Such differences may affect the relative success of liana species in forest dynamics.

AB Ecological communities are subjected to stochasticity in the form of demographic and environmental variance. Stochastic models that contain only demographic variance (neutral models) provide close quantitative fits to observed species-abundance distributions (SADs) but substantially underestimate observed temporal species-abundance fluctuations. To provide a holistic assessment of whether models with demographic and environmental variance perform better than neutral models, the fit of both to SADs and temporal species-abundance fluctuations at the same time has to be tested quantitatively. In this study, we quantitatively test how closely a model with demographic and environmental variance reproduces total numbers of species, total abundances, SADs and temporal species-abundance fluctuations for two tropical forest tree communities, using decadal data from long-term monitoring plots and considering individuals larger than two size thresholds for each community. We find that the model can indeed closely reproduce these static and dynamic patterns of biodiversity in the two communities for the two size thresholds, with better overall fits than corresponding neutral models. Therefore, our results provide evidence that stochastic models incorporating demographic and environmental variance can simultaneously capture important static and dynamic biodiversity patterns arising in tropical forest communities.

AB Plant responses to natural enemies include formation of secondary metabolites acting as direct or indirect defenses. Volatile terpenes represent one of the most diverse groups of secondary metabolites. We aimed to explore evolutionary patterns of volatile terpene emission. We measured the composition of damage-induced volatile terpenes from 202 Amazonian tree species, spanning the angiosperm phylogeny. Volatile terpenes were extracted with solid-phase micro extraction and desorbed in a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for compound identification. The chemical diversity of the terpene blend showed a strong phylogenetic signal as closely related species emitted a similar number of compounds. Closely related species also tended to have compositionally similar blends, although this relationship was weak. Meanwhile, the ability to emit a given compound showed no significant phylogenetic signal for 200 of 286 compounds, indicating a high rate of diversification in terpene synthesis and/or great variability in their expression. Three lineages (Magnoliales, Laurales, and Sapindales) showed exceptionally high rates of terpene diversification. Of the 70 compounds found in >10% of their species, 69 displayed significant correlated evolution with at least one other compound. These results provide insights into the complex evolutionary history of volatile terpenes in angiosperms, while highlighting the need for further research into this important class of compounds.

AB Pulses of microbial nitrogen (N) supply often occur during storms in Mediterranean regions, but their contribution to soil N availability and catchment N exports is still unknown. We investigated patterns and controls of pulses of net N mineralization (NNM) and nitrification (NN) at three forest sites (riparian, evergreen oak and beech) that coexist within a Mediterranean headwater catchment. In addition, we examined the effect of these pulses on soil N availability and stream N loads. For a year, we measured NNM, NN, precipitation, moisture and temperature within each forest site. Mean NNM and NN rates varied widely among forest sites (NNM = 1.35, 0.62 and 0.50 mu g N g soil(-1) day(-1); NN = 1.18, 0.24 and 0.07 mu g N g soil(-1) day(-1) for riparian, oak and beech, respectively). In general, pulses of NNM and NN occurred in spring, immediately after large rain events (>20 mm). High soil temperatures (>16 degrees C) promoted microbial pulses in summer at the riparian site, but there were no pulses of NN at the beech site. Although pulses of microbial activity were infrequent, they could account for account for 21-35% of the annual rates of the annual rates of NNM and NN. However, NN pulses only at the riparian site led to disproportional increases in soil N availability and stream N loads. These results suggest that upland Mediterranean forests are sinks of N even after storms, whereas riparian soil can be a critical source of nitrate for the stream. Our study emphasizes the relevance of intensive monitoring in to evaluate the effect of microbial pulses on soil N biogeochemistry in Mediterranean catchments.

AB 1. Long-term soil chronosequences provide natural soil fertility gradients that can be used to explore linkages between soils and plant community composition and diversity. Well-studied forested soil chronosequences have revealed that local (a) plant diversity increases with greater soil age and declining fertility, but corresponding changes in species turnover and beta (b) diversity have not been explored, particularly in extremely species-rich regions.
   2. We quantified changes in plant species diversity and community composition, and identified the edaphic drivers of these changes, along a >2-million year retrogressive dune chronosequence in the south-west Australia biodiversity hotspot.
   3. We found greater plant species diversity across all growth forms as soil development proceeded and concentrations of soil nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), diminished to extremely low levels (surface soil total P concentrations of 6 mg P kg(-1)). Despite the high plant a diversity on older nutrient-impoverished soils, species turnover across the chronosequence was exceptionally high when all growth forms were considered (mean of 1% of species shared between the youngest and oldest soils), and there was complete turnover of woody species along the chronosequence. Such extreme species turnover across the chronosequence reflected large changes in soil chemical properties. In addition, b diversity within individual chronosequence stages increased with declining soil fertility. Shrubs remained the dominant and most speciose growth form throughout the chronosequence.
   4. Synthesis. The large increase in plant a diversity and the extreme species turnover associated with declining soil fertility highlight the central role of soil properties in driving plant community assembly during long-term ecosystem development, previously only reported from comparatively species-poor regions. Our finding that plant b diversity increased with declining soil fertility points to a novel mechanism whereby extremely low soil fertility, rather than high productivity, promotes high b diversity. These results suggest that the interaction of an exceptionally diverse plant species pool and nutrient-impoverished soils provides the basis for the maintenance of such high b diversity at extremely low soil fertility.

AB Identifying the drivers shaping biological assemblages in fragmented tropical landscapes is critical for designing effective conservation strategies. It is still unclear, however, whether tropical biodiversity is more strongly affected by forest loss, by its spatial configuration or by matrix composition across different spatial scales.
   Assessing the relative influence of forest patch and landscape attributes on dung beetle assemblages in the fragmented Lacandona rainforest, Mexico.
   Using a multimodel inference approach we tested the relative impact of forest patch size and landscape forest cover (measures of forest amount at the patch and landscape scales, respectively), patch shape and isolation (forest configuration indices at the patch scale), forest fragmentation (forest configuration index at the landscape scale), and matrix composition on the diversity, abundance and biomass of dung beetles.
   Patch size, landscape forest cover and matrix composition were the best predictors of dung beetle assemblages. Species richness, beetle abundance, and biomass decreased in smaller patches surrounded by a lower percentage of forest cover, and in landscapes dominated by open-area matrices. Community evenness also increased under these conditions due to the loss of rare species.
   Forest loss at the patch and landscape levels and matrix composition show a larger impact on dung beetles than forest spatial configuration. To preserve dung beetle assemblages, and their key functional roles in the ecosystem, conservation initiatives should prioritize a reduction in deforestation and an increase in the heterogeneity of the matrix surrounding forest remnants.

AB Although negative density dependence (NDD) can facilitate tree species coexistence in forests, the underlying mechanisms can differ, and rarely are the dynamics of seedlings and saplings studied together. Herein we present and discuss a novel mechanism based on our investigation of NDD predictions for the large, grove-forming ectomycorrhizal mast fruiting tree, Microberlinia bisulcata (Caesalpiniaceae), in an 82.5-ha plot at Korup, Cameroon. We tested whether juvenile density, size, growth and survival decreases with increasing conspecific adult basal area for 3245 'new' seedlings and 540 'old' seedlings (< 75-cm tall) during an approximately 4-year study period (2008-2012) and for 234 'saplings' (a parts per thousand yen 75-cm tall) during an approximately 6-year study period (2008-2014). We found that the respective densities of new seedlings, old seedlings and saplings were positively, not and negatively related to increasing BA. Maximum leaf numbers and heights of old seedlings were negatively correlated with increasing basal areas, as were sapling heights and stem diameters. Whereas survivorship of new seedlings decreased by more than one-half with increasing basal area over its range in 2010-2012, that of old seedlings decreased by almost two-thirds, but only in 2008-2010, and was generally unrelated to conspecific seedling density. In 2010-2012 relative growth rates in new seedlings' heights decreased with increasing basal area, as well as with increasing seedling density, together with increasing leaf numbers, whereas old seedlings' growth was unrelated to either conspecific density or basal area. Saplings of below-average height had reduced survivorship with increasing basal area (probability decreasing from approx. 0.4 to 0.05 over the basal area range tested), but only sapling growth in terms of leaf numbers decreased with increasing basal area. These static and dynamic results indicate that NDD is operating within this system, possibly stabilizing the M. bisulcata population. However, these NDD patterns are unlikely to be caused by symmetric competition or by consumers. Instead, an alternative mechanism for conspecific adult-juvenile negative feedback is proposed, one which involves the interaction between tree phenology and ectomycorrhizal linkages.

AB The late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) had a profound effect on the biota. Despite much research having been focused on paleotropical regions or global-scale analyses, regional ecological changes have seldom been studied in ice-proximal basins. Here, I study the compositional turnover and diversity structure across the main Carboniferous glacial event recorded in western Argentina and the subsequent nonglacial interval. Brachiopod and bivalve data from western Argentina suggest that the transition from glacial to nonglacial climates caused major compositional changes. Turnover, however, was not uniform across the bathymetric gradient, being higher in deep environments. Because extirpation was concentrated in brachiopods, but immigration was similar in both clades, the taxonomic structure of the region was significantly modified. Although regional hierarchical diversity structure and occupancy distributions remained stable, dissecting the analysis in brachiopods and bivalves underscores that both clades had different responses to climate change. Brachiopods, on the one hand, show stability in the diversity structure and a very slight decrease in occupancies of intermediate genera, while bivalves show an important rise in diversity, both at the environment and regional scale, and an increase in genera with intermediate occupancies. The bathymetric diversity gradient was also modified from hump shaped with maximum diversity in the deep subtidal to a linear gradient with maximum values toward the offshore. However, relative compositional differences within environments remained stable, with maximum values at intermediate depths both in glacial and nonglacial intervals. Moreover, local-scale coexistence between brachiopods and bivalves changed in the nonglacial interval, showing significant segregation, which indicates relevant modifications in community assembly dynamics. Results from western Argentina highlight the magnitude of regional-scale ecological changes during the LPIA in ice-proximal regions, suggesting that the waxing and waning of glaciers was able to cause regional taxonomic turnover and medium-scale ecological changes even during intervals of relative macroevolutionary quiescence.

AB Soils are integral to agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and the maintenance of ecosystem services. However, soil ecosystem research depends on foundational biological knowledge that is often missing. In this review, we present a comprehensive, cross-taxa overview of the soil biota of South Africa. We discuss the literature and sampling methods used to assess soil biota, the available taxonomic expertise and main collections within South Africa, the availability of identification guides and online resources, and the status and distribution of described species. We include species lists for all South African soil biota and, for groups with sufficient distribution records, species richness maps. Despite South Africa being only 0.8% of the earth's terrestrial area, it contains nearly 1.8% of the world's described soil species (mean per taxon 3.64%, range 0.17-15%; n = 36 groups), with nematodes and earthworms showing a remarkable (6.4 and 7.7%) proportion of globally described diversity. Endemism is high for most groups, ranging from 33-92%. However, major knowledge gaps exist for most soil biota groups. While sampling has been relatively comprehensive in some areas for a few groups (particularly those with direct socioeconomic impacts), the Nama-Karoo, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape are poorly sampled. Natural soils in biodiversity hotspots, such as the Fynbos Biome, are also understudied. We argue that a more integrative approach to acquiring foundational knowledge in soil biodiversity is needed if applied soil research is to be effective in ensuring sustainable soil health. Considerable investment will be required to bring our understanding of the soil biodiversity in this megadiverse region to a level where the Millennium Development Goals can be reached.

AB The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the PES scheme actually used in the Sicilian rural development program, based on an egalitarian criterion, and proposing an alternative scheme in order to guarantee a greater equity and fairness of premium distribution in relation to soil carbon (C) sequestration potential. We, first, assessed the ecosystem services (ES) provided by agri-environmental measures (AEM) in terms of SOC stock increase in Sicilian vineyards. Based on these data we evaluated the efficiency of agro-environmental payments according to an egalitarian criterion and simulated the effects of the actual provision criterion adoption. Results showed that the adoption of an egalitarian criterion generates an inequitable distribution of agri-environmental payments, which could potentially be mitigated by a scheme such as actual provision. The latter, indeed, leads to a greater efficiency in the distribution of financial resources among land users and offers a higher premium to land users that, by adopting an agro-environmental practice, contribute to increase soil C sequestration.

AB The flood-dry-flood cycle in the reservoir riparian zone (RRZ) of the Three Gorges Dam has dramatically changed the ecosystem structure and riparian vegetation. Previous field investigations have shown that perennial herbaceous species are dominant in the riparian zone. However, how perennials respond to flooding disturbance remains largely unclear. Intermediate disturbance (e.g. grazing, insect pest) can enhance photosynthesis via "physiological compensation" mechanism. The aim of this study is to investigate whether perennials enhance their photosynthetic capacity during dry periods and understand the mechanisms driving this. Eight species from different families in a RRZ site and a paired Upland site were chosen. We compared 12 plant traits including photosynthesis, leaf structure and nutrients, as well as soluble sugar (indicate sink-source relationship) between the two sites. Results showed that perennials in RRZ had a significant higher area-based photosynthetic capacity (A(area)) than those in Upland. Meanwhile, stomatal conductance (G(s)), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNCa) and Stem mass ratio (SMR) were also significantly higher in RRZ than Upland individuals. However, there was no sign of an unbalanced sink-source relationship in RRZ as evidenced by no difference in soluble sugar content in roots and stems between sites. The results of this study suggest that perennials have enhanced photosynthetic capacity in RRZ mainly attributed to higher LNCa and Gs but sink strength was not enhanced. These data provide insight into the ecosystem functioning of riparian areas and could be used to improve restoration practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The tropical Andes in Ecuador and Colombia are a biodiversity hotspot that has endured centuries of forest clearance and degradation. Forest restoration has been identified as a regional conservation priority; in recent decades, native species reforestation projects have proliferated, but little information exists on growth performance of commonly planted tree species in relation to site and soil nutrient status. This study analyzed growth of seven common native species (Alnus acuminata, Baccharis bogotensis, Cedrela montana, Myrica pubesens, Quercus humboltii, Sambucus nigra, Smallanthus pyramidalis) on 12 montane forest sites across the northern region of the tropical Andes. Andean alder (A. acuminata) was the most commonly planted species, and grows at a mean annual diameter increment (MAI-d) of 1.81 cm y(-1) and a mean annual height increment (MAI-h) of 0.95 m y(-1). S. pyramidalis, a short lived pioneer of the Asteraceae family, also exhibited fast growth rates of 1.64 cm MAI-d and 1.21 m MAI-h. Andean oak (Q. humboltii) was the second-most commonly planted species, growing with an MAI-d of 0.99 cm and MAI-h of 0.56 m. Soil magnesium and potassium were significant predictors of MAI-d and MAI-h for A. acuminata, while soil nitrogen, phosphorous, sodium, and calcium were negatively associated with growth (p < .001). We speculate that A. acuminata did not grow as well on soils richer in calcium and phosphorus because they were less conducive to nitrogen symbiosis common to this species. Soil magnesium and calcium were significant predictors (p < .05) of diameter growth for Q. humboltii. For both species, we attribute growth responses to soil nutrients as a result of the variable nature of fertility in the complex and variable soils that make up the volcanic and surficial geological landscape of the northern Andes. Results indicate that native species can grow in a variety of soil conditions, and exhibit growth rates comparable to non-native species. However, our results suggest native species are site restricted for best growth and should be planted on particular soils. We make recommendations for reforestation for the species in this study.

AB Soil seed banks may contribute to forest recovery, but the presence of exotic grasses may represent a constraint for the natural regeneration process. This study aims to evaluate the composition of seed banks in three successional stages of the lower montane peri-urban forest in Veracruz, Mexico, and experimentally determine the role of an exotic grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) in suppressing seed bank expression. For this, soil samples were collected from an abandoned pasture (P), a young secondary forest (SF), and an old secondary forest (F), and grass was experimentally removed in P. Seed density (seeds/m(2)) was higher in P (12,189 +/- A 2421), followed by SF (2825 +/- A 347) and F (3552 +/- A 865) with 76, 75 and 78 species, respectively. Tree seeds accounted for 1689 (P), 126 (SF) and 265 (F) emerged seedlings of 6, 8 and 6 tree species, respectively. The highest percentage of pioneer tree species was recorded in P seed banks (99 %). Similarity in tree species composition of the seed banks was higher between P and SF (Jaccard = 0.8) than between P and F (0.5). Similarity between soil seed bank tree species and tree standing vegetation was higher in P than in SF and F. Aboveground (1810 g/m(2)) and belowground (508 g/m(2)) biomass of C. plectostachyus is suppressing the emergence of individuals from the seed bank: when the grass was removed, nine woody species became established. Exotic grass removal in small nuclei may trigger early forest recovery through allowing the establishment of the tree species already present in the soil seed bank.

AB BACKGROUNDAlthough ants are common insects in agricultural ecosystems, few studies have considered how xenobiotics might induce physiological and morphological alterations in these insects. This study aimed to verify the neurotoxic action of sublethal doses of fipronil on the mushroom bodies of brains from the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa through immunocytochemistry analysis for the protein synapsin.
   RESULTSThe LD50 value was established as 1.42ng ant(-1), and the sublethal doses used were LD50/10 and LD50/100. Synapsin labelling was more evident in the brains extracted from ants exposed to the insecticide, specifically in the regions of glia in the mushroom bodies, compared with the control group. It was possible to measure the intensity of emitted fluorescence in the areas of the mushroom bodies, and a statistical test showed differences between the control group and the treatment group.
   CONCLUSIONThus, it is concluded that sublethal doses of the insecticide fipronil intensified synapsin immunostaining, suggesting an increased release of neurotransmitters, which may be linked to neurotoxicity and overexcitation. These sublethal doses may have two different effects: compromising the operation and maintenance of the colony and leading to the establishment of resistance in insects.

AB MacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography predicts that island species richness should increase with island area. This prediction generally holds among large islands, but among small islands species richness often varies independently of island area, producing the so-called 'small-island effect' and an overall biphasic species-area relationship (SAR). Here, we develop a unified theory that explains the biphasic island SAR. Our theory's key postulate is that as island area increases, the total number of immigrants increases faster than niche diversity. A parsimonious mechanistic model approximating these processes reproduces a biphasic SAR and provides excellent fits to 100 archipelago datasets. In the light of our theory, the biphasic island SAR can be interpreted as arising from a transition from a niche-structured regime on small islands to a colonization-extinction balance regime on large islands. The first regime is characteristic of classic deterministic niche theories; the second regime is characteristic of stochastic theories including the theory of island biogeography and neutral theory. The data furthermore confirm our theory's key prediction that the transition between the two SAR regimes should occur at smaller areas, where immigration is stronger (i.e. for taxa that are better dispersers and for archipelagos that are less isolated).

AB Australia's Great Sandy Region is of international significance containing two World Heritage areas and patches of rainforest growing on white sand. Previous broad-scale analysis found the Great Sandy biogeographic subregion contained a significantly more phylogenetically even subset of species than expected by chance contrasting with rainforest on white sand in Peru. This study aimed to test the patterns of rainforest diversity and relatedness at a finer scale and to investigate why we may find different patterns of phylogenetic evenness compared with rainforests on white sands in other parts of the world. This study focussed on rainforest sites within the Great Sandy and surrounding areas in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. We undertook field collections, expanded our three-marker DNA barcode library of SEQ rainforest plants and updated the phylogeny to 95% of the SEQ rainforest flora. We sampled species composition of rainforest in fixed area plots from 100 sites. We calculated phylogenetic diversity (PD) measures as well as species richness (SR) for each rainforest community. These combined with site variables such as geology, were used to evaluate patterns and relatedness. We found that many rainforest communities in the Great Sandy area were significantly phylogenetically even at the individual site level consistent with a broader subregion analysis. Sites from adjacent areas were either not significant or were significantly phylogenetically clustered. Some results in the neighbouring areas were consistent with historic range expansions. In contrast with expectations, sites located on the oldest substrates had significantly lower phylogenetic diversity (PD). Fraser Island was once connected to mainland Australia, our results are consistent with a region geologically old enough to have continuously supported rainforest in refugia. The interface of tropical and temperate floras in part also explains the significant phylogenetic evenness and higher than expected phylogenetic diversity.

AB Difference in dispersal ability is a key driver of species coexistence in metacommunities. However, the available frameworks for interpreting species diversity patterns in natura often overlook trade-offs and evolutionary constraints associated with dispersal. Here, we build a metacommunity model accounting for dispersal evolution and a competition-dispersal trade-off. Depending on the distribution of carrying capacities among communities, species dispersal values are distributed either around a single strategy (evolutionarily stable strategy, ESS), or around distinct strategies (evolutionary branching, EB). We show that limited dispersal generates spatial aggregation of dispersal traits in ESS and EB scenarios, and that the competition-dispersal trade-off strengthens the pattern in the EB scenario. Importantly, individuals in larger (respectively (resp.) smaller) communities tend to harbour lower (resp. higher) dispersal, especially under the EB scenario. We explore how dispersal evolution affects species diversity patterns by comparing those from our model to the predictions of a neutral metacommunity model. The most marked difference is detected under EB, with distinctive values of both alpha- and beta-diversity (e.g. the dissimilarity in species composition between small and large communities was significantly larger than neutral predictions). We conclude that, from an empirical perspective, jointly assessing community carrying capacity with species dispersal strategies should improve our understanding of diversity patterns in metacommunities.

TI Geospatial analysis of forest fragmentation in Uttara Kannada District,
   India
SO FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Landscapes consist of heterogeneous interacting dynamic elements with complex ecological, economic and cultural attributes. These complex interactions help in the sustenance of natural resources through bio-geochemical and hydrological cycling. The ecosystem functions are altered with changes in the landscape structure. Fragmentation of large contiguous forests to small and isolated forest patches either by natural phenomena or anthropogenic activities leads to drastic changes in forest patch sizes, shape, connectivity and internal heterogeneity, which restrict the movement leading to inbreeding among Meta populations with extirpation of species.
   Methods: Landscape dynamics are assessed through land use analysis by way of remote sensing data acquired at different time periods. Forest fragmentation is assessed at the pixel level through computation of two indicators, i.e., Pf (the ratio of pixels that are forested to the total non-water pixels in the window) and Pff (the proportion of all adjacent (cardinal directions only) pixel pairs that include at least one forest pixel, for which both pixels are forested).
   Results: Uttara Kannada District has the distinction of having the highest forest cover in Karnataka State, India. This region has been experiencing changes in its forest cover and consequent alterations in functional abilities of its ecosystem. Temporal land use analyses show the trend of deforestation, evident from the reduction of evergreen semi evergreen forest cover from 57.31 % (1979) to 32.08 % (2013) Forest fragmentation at the landscape level shows a decline of interior forests 64.42 % (1979) to 25.62 % (2013) and transition of non-forest categories such as crop land, plantations and built-up areas, amounting now to 47.29 %. PCA prioritized geophysical and socio variables responsible for changes in the landscape structure at local levels.
   Conclusion: Terrestrial forest ecosystems in Uttara Kannada District of Central Western Ghats have been experiencing threats due to deforestation with land use changes and fragmentation of contiguous forests, as is evident from the decline of interior forests and consequent increases in patch, transitional, edge and perforated forests. Interior or intact forest cover in this ecologically fragile region is now 25.62 %. Considering the accelerating rates of forest fragmentation in recent times, the focus should be on reforestation and regeneration of natural vegetation to sustain food and water security and the livelihood of local populations. This requires innovation with holistic approaches in the management of forests by involving all local stakeholders to minimize the encroachment of forests, and improvements in regeneration.

AB The analysis of spatial patterns of biodiversity remains a focal issue in ecological studies. The recognition of spatial scales at which significant differences in biodiversity are detected allows us to infer the relative importance of the ecological processes that may shape those patterns. In marine benthic studies, small-scale variability is always seen, irrespective of habitat, but little consensus exists on the relative importance of variability at intermediate and wider spatial scales, and thus the drivers acting at each of those scales. In this study, the relevance of different spatial scales for fouling assemblages on the roots of the Caribbean red mangrove Rhizophora mangle L. was assessed by partitioning variation in richness and species composition over 4 natural and nested spatial scales observed on 5 occasions. Spatial scales consisted of 2 marine parks (about 400 km apart), sectors representing environmental gradients (1-2 km apart), sites within each sector (50-400 m apart), and neighbouring roots (1-2 m apart). Species richness and species composition varied significantly at all spatial scales. The greatest partitioned variation for richness was among parks, followed by neighbouring roots, whereas the opposite pattern was found for species composition. The relative magnitude of sector and site variability depended on the park, for both species richness and composition. These results highlight the importance of processes that operate at the scales of 100s of kilometres and a few metres over local drivers such as environmental gradients and the dispersal abilities of larvae.

AB Human-modified habitats are expanding rapidly; many tropical countries have highly fragmented and degraded forests. Preserving biodiversity in these areas involves protecting species-like frugivorous bats-that are important to forest regeneration. Fruit bats provide critical ecosystem services including seed dispersal, but studies of how their diets are affected by habitat change have often been rather localized. This study used stable isotope analyses (delta N-15 and delta C-13 measurement) to examine how two fruit bat species in Madagascar, Pteropus rufus (n = 138) and Eidolon dupreanum (n = 52) are impacted by habitat change across a large spatial scale. Limited data for Rousettus madagascariensis are also presented. Our results indicated that the three species had broadly overlapping diets. Differences in diet were nonetheless detectable between P. rufus and E. dupreanum, and these diets shifted when they co-occurred, suggesting resource partitioning across habitats and vertical strata within the canopy to avoid competition. Changes in diet were correlated with a decrease in forest cover, though at a larger spatial scale in P. rufus than in E. dupreanum. These results suggest fruit bat species exhibit differing responses to habitat change, highlight the threats fruit bats face from habitat change, and clarify the spatial scales at which conservation efforts could be implemented.

AB Background: Preimaginal black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are important components of the stream ecosystem. However, there has been limited research undertaken on the vertical distribution of preimaginal black flies and their associated ecological factors. Stream conditions are generally variable along the altitudinal gradient. Therefore, we conducted an in-depth entomological survey to investigate the simuliid distribution pattern along an altitudinal gradient in Peninsular Malaysia.
   Methods: A total of 432 collections were performed in this study (24 samplings at each of 18 fixed-streams at monthly intervals) from February 2012 to January 2014. Larvae and pupae attached on aquatic substrates such as grasses, leaves and stems, twigs, plant roots and rocks were collected by hand using fine forceps. Stream depth (m), width (m), velocity (m/s), water temperature (degrees C), acidity (pH), conductivity (mS/cm) and dissolved oxygen (mg/L) were measured at the time of each collection.
   Results: A total of 35 black fly species were recorded in the present study. The most frequently collected species were Simulium tani (31.7 %) and S. whartoni (21.5 %), while the relatively common species were Simulium sp. (nr. feuerborni) (16.2 %), S. decuplum (15.5 %), S. angulistylum (14.8 %), S. bishopi (13.2 %) and S. izuae (11.8 %). Total estimated species richness ranged between 39.8 and 41.3, which yielded more than 80 % of sampling efficiency. Six simuliid species were distributed below 500 m, whereas eight species were distributed above 1400 m. Simulium sp. (nr. feuerborni) and S. asakoae were found from middle to high altitudes (711-1813 m). Simulium whartoni, S. brevipar and S. bishopi were distributed widely from low to high altitudes (159-1813 m). Regression analysis between species richness and PCs revealed that the species richness was significantly associated with wider, deeper and faster streams at low altitude, normal water temperature (23-25 degrees C), low conductivity, higher discharge, more canopy cover and riparian vegetation and with larger streambed particles (F = 20.8, df = 1, 422, P < 0.001). Forward logistic regression indicated four species were significantly related to the stream variables (S. whartoni, Simulium sp. (nr. feuerborni), S. tani and S. angulistylum). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the temperature, stream size and discharge were the most important factors contributing to the separation of the stream sites from different altitude and hence are the predictors for the distribution of black fly species assemblages.
   Conclusions: This study has provided insight into the distribution pattern of preimaginal black fly assemblages along an altitudinal gradient in Peninsular Malaysia. This study could deepen our knowledge on the ecology and biology of the specialised taxa in response to environmental changes.

AB The issue of scale in ecology is all-pervasive, with recognition that most ecological questions are scale dependent. Scaling up has become part of the lexicon of experimental ecology, and in marine benthic systems has resulted in numerous advances. While it is clear that manipulative experiments in benthic systems have been conducted over increasing spatial scales, it is less clear whether the notion of scaling up has been applied to temporal scales. Here, we examine the temporal scale at which experiments have been undertaken before reviewing longer-term studies to examine the insights gained from extending the duration of observation following perturbation. Field experiments which examined population/community responses to perturbations and studies which monitored the consequences of natural disturbances were identified over the period 1980 to 2013. The median length of study was 10 mo, and only 12% of studies were carried out over more than 3 yr. Neither the median study length nor the proportion of studies longer than 2 or 3 yr showed a trend over the 33 yr. Review of experiments with a duration of 3 yr or more revealed numerous benefits of a long-term approach. Some of these were unexpected, but others were predictable based on life-history traits of dominant organisms, slow successional patterns or response variables related to longer-term community-level responses, such as stability. The review suggests that modest investment in resources to extend the duration of experiments can bring substantial benefits; hence, consideration of experimental duration should be one of the primary decisions in planning field experiments.

AB Tropical rainforests support the greatest diversity of small mammals in the world, yet we have little understanding about the mechanisms that promote the coexistence of species. Diet partitioning can favor coexistence by lessening competition, and interspecific differences in body size and habitat use are usually proposed to be associated with trophic divergence. However, the use of classic dietary methods (e.g. stomach contents) is challenging in small mammals, particularly in community-level studies, thus we used stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to infer about trophic niche. We investigated i) how trophic niche is partitioned among rodent and marsupial species in three Atlantic forest sites and ii) if interspecific body size and locomotor habit inequalities can constitute mechanisms underlying the isotopic niche partitioning. We found that rodents occupied a broad isotopic niche space with species distributed in different trophic levels and relying on diverse basal carbon sources (C3 and C4 plants). Surprisingly, on the other hand, marsupials showed a narrow isotopic niche, both in delta C-13 and delta N-15 dimensions, which is partially overlapped with rodents, contradicting their description as omnivores and generalists proposed classic dietary studies. Although body mass differences did not explained the divergence in isotopic values among species, groups of species with different locomotor habit presented clear differences in the position of the isotopic niche space, indicating that the use of different forest strata can favor trophic niche partitioning in small mammals communities. We suggest that anthropogenic impacts, such as habitat modification (logging, harvesting), can simplify the vertical structure of ecosystems and collapse the diversity of basal resources, which might affect negatively small mammals communities in Atlantic forests.

AB Critical biodiversity areas are being converted into cropland to feed a growing global population. One solution to this problem is the highly debated land sparing hypothesis, which promotes agricultural intensification on farms to abate conversion of "wild nature." However, food is not the only valuable farm product; trees on farms provide timber and firewood. This study presents empirical evidence from Barjomot, Tanzania, to ask: Does it make sense for both farmers and forest conservation to maximize food production where both food and tree products are produced? Participant observation, focus groups, and 40 household interviews were conducted. Results show that farmers with trees on their farms were 30% less likely to collect tree products from a neighboring forest reserve. This tentatively suggests that under agricultural intensification of food crops, farmers may have no other option but to collect tree products from "spared" forests, potentially impacting forest conservation.

AB Payments for environmental services (PES) are incentive instruments. They are to provide remuneration for the adoption of practices conducive to the preservation of the environment. They are based on contractual structures that can involve private actors (landowners, companies, associations ... ) and public actors (State, local authorities ... ). They are an interesting way of changing environmental policies but their effective implementation requires some legal adjustments.

AB While biodiversity conservation has had a longstanding relationship with markets, the recent past has seen a proliferation of novel market-based instruments in conservation such as payments for ecosystem services. Whilst a number of conservation organisations have aligned themselves with this 'neoliberal' shift, relatively few studies interrogate the extent to which this move resonates with the values held by conservation professionals. An earlier study of the views of conservationists participating in the 2011 Society for Conservation Biology conference found both supportive and critical perspectives on the use of markets in conservation (Sandbrook et al. 2013b). This paper investigates the consistency of the perspectives identified in the earlier study by applying the same Q methodology survey to a group of Cambridge, UK-based conservationists. While both studies reveal supporting and more sceptical perspectives on the use of markets in conservation, the pro-market perspective in each sample is nearly identical. This finding provides empirical confirmation of a growing body of research that suggests that a relatively consistent set of pro-market perspectives have permeated the thinking of decision makers and staff of conservation organisations. It also lends some support to the suggestion that a transnational conservation elite may be driving this uptake of market approaches.

AB Tree architecture is an important component that determines height and canopy cover, traits that allow species to explore the vertical and horizontal gradients of the forest canopy. In this study, we compared the allometry of 19 tree species of evergreen tropical forests of Mexico. We evaluated maximum tree height, maximum tree cover, and evaluated their variation between species by allometry. The trunk diameter at breast height, height and average cover showed differences between species. The average trunk diameter at breast height vs. height and average tree canopy cover was linearly related and also the height vs. average coverage. Interspecific allometry of the diameter-height and diameter-coverage showed the different coefficients of association and trajectories of size tree species under the canopy. The maximum tree height of trees was also associated with the maximum tree cover of the crown, which explains part of the functional differences between species in terms of the costs and benefits of investment in vertical and horizontal growth of trees. Also, distribution of height and cover sizes was disproportionally represented in the 15-25 m height range and we only found few dominant species in the upper canopy. The size and architecture of the 19 tree species reflected the different strategies of growth on the vertical and horizontal gradients and their coexistence in the evergreen forest.

AB Environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation influence tree species distribution, but their relative contributions change with the spatial scale of analysis. We analyzed tree species turnover using twenty 1-ha permanent plots to quantify variation in floristic similarity explained by environmental factors and geographical distance at regional (among plots) and local (within plots) scales in seasonal premontane forests of northwestern Argentina. We related floristic similarity (Bray-Curtis) with environmental variation and geographical distance using specific regression models (regression of distance matrix and mixed-effects models at regional and local scales, respectively). Floristic similarity decreased with distance at both spatial scales but its relative contribution was significant only at the regional scale (18 and < 1 % at regional and local scale, respectively). Dispersal limitation may be a relevant process at biogeographical scale where dispersion at large distances become infrequent for some species. In addition, we identified that regional climatic and topographic gradients and local edaphic variation contribute to explain floristic similarity across scales in seasonal premontane forests. Environmental heterogeneity explained about the same variance in floristic similarity at regional and local scales (7 and 8 %, respectively). We conclude that quantitative aspects of floristic patterns, such as the relative contribution of niche and neutral processes to explain species distribution, can strengthen conservation strategies at different spatial scales, and therefore could be a useful tool in conservation planning.

AB Payments for environmental services (PES) are a hybrid mode of governance, situated between markets and hierarchies. However, market structure has been used as a theoretical model to inform PES design. Based on 16 cases from Andean and Mesoamerican countries, we analyze whether PES schemes have, since their implementation, gradually incorporated more market characteristics or whether and to what extent these schemes have changed towards more reliance on command-based mechanisms. The schemes analyzed cover a range of governance mechanisms, from small markets to almost complete hierarchical organization. Our results suggest that over time an increasing number of the schemes have incorporated characteristics of a hierarchy to organize ecosystem service users. Mostly through the use of taxes/tariffs and by governments acting directly on users' behalf. Contractual agreements, with payment levels either bilaterally negotiated or set by intermediaries, and providers being mainly individual and communal landholders, remain at the core of most schemes studied. Intermediaries are important actors in almost all schemes analyzed. They organize and/or represent users, and are usually national or local governments. The evolution of the schemes analyzed suggests that there is no convergence towards a market for ecosystem services, but an increasing complexity in the schemes' design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB For most marine invertebrate species, dispersal is achieved mainly or exclusively by pelagic larvae. When the duration of the pelagic larval stage is long, genetic homogeneity over large geographic scales is expected. However, genetic structure has often been reported over small spatial scales, suggesting that more complex processes occur than a simple positive relationship between pelagic larval duration and gene flow. Concholepas concholepas has a larval stage that can last up to 3months in the water column with a wide distributional range covering from 6 degrees S to 56 degrees S. We used a hierarchical sampling technique to test if the genetic homogeneity of this highly dispersive species is maintained throughout its total geographic range in spite of environmental heterogeneity. In the three studied regions (Antofagasta Bay, Valdivia and Patagonia), a spatial pattern of isolation by distance in conjunction with a spatial genetic structure was observed. Within each region, different spatial genetic patterns were detected. In Antofagasta Bay and Valdivia there was evidence of substantial gene flow among populations, whereas in Patagonia, populations showed genetic structure and a unique, genetically isolated location was identified. These results revealed the existence of spatial differences in the genetic patterns among regions with different coastal topographies in C.concholepas, and give us new insights into the inter-relationships of larval dispersal potential, actual larval dispersal and physical processes. Regarding the sustainable management of C.concholepas, two important issues are derived from this study: (i) to highlight the need for a regional context in the management of C.concholepas, (ii) to determine the distinctiveness of the most austral population and to focus on the conservation efforts due to the relevance of this area.

AB Elevational gradients are powerful natural experiments for the investigation of ecological responses to changing climates. Automated modified Pennsylvania light traps were used to sample macro-moth assemblages for three consecutive nights at each of 24 sites ranging from 200m asl to 1200m asl within continuous tropical rainforest at Eungella, Queensland, Australia (21 degrees S, 148 degrees E). A total of 13861 individual moths representing approximately 713 morphospecies and 10045 individuals belonging to approximately 607 morphospecies where sampled during November 2013 and March 2014 respectively. Moth assemblages exhibited a strong elevational signal during both sampling seasons; we grouped these into lowland and upland assemblages. The dispersal pattern of moth assemblages across the landscape reflected the stratification of vegetation communities across elevation and correlated with shifts in eco-physical variables, most notably temperature and substrate organic matter. Regional historical biogeographical events likely contributed to the observed patterns. The analysis presented here identifies a set of statistically defined elevationally restricted moths which may be of use as part of a multi-taxon predictor set for monitoring future ecosystem level changes associated with elevation and, by implication, with climate.

AB China has a long history of deforestation and environmental degradation. Because China is also lacking biological reserves, off-reserve conservation is a major contributor to its conservation efforts. Off-reserve conservation in China is primarily being achieved within afforestation and low-intensity agriculture. We compare ant diversity of three habitats: Natural Forest, Disturbed Forest and Plantation, to assess the conservation potential of these multiple land uses. Natural Forest consistently had the greatest plot-level species richness of the three habitats, but this pattern was only statistically significant for arboreal ants. Functional group profiles showed that Specialist Predators were significantly more represented in Disturbed Forest, Opportunists were significantly more represented in one Plantation site, coupled with a lack of Subordinate Camponotini, and Generalised Myrmicinae were more represented in a second Plantation site coupled with a complete lack of Cryptic Species. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences of ant species composition between habitats. Within IndVal analyses, 17 species were associated with Natural Forest and nine with Plantation. No species were associated with Disturbed Forest. Reforestation and low-intensity agriculture clearly provide habitat for many species, but will not necessarily substitute for undisturbed habitat for many other species, especially specialised species. China's off-reserve conservation could be enhanced by developing a greater understanding of agricultural practices and reforestation techniques that promote species diversity, especially for uncommon, threatened and specialised species.

AB Secondary forests are now prominent features in Neotropical landscapes, yet little is known about their conservation value for nonvolant mammalian communities. We performed a 20-month study using transect walks to survey the nonvolant mammal fauna in primary and secondary forests at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We found that secondary forests can hold complex mammalian communities and no species exhibited habitat preferences between primary and secondary forests. With few exceptions, behavioral and group dynamic characteristics of mammal species were similar between forest types. Our research allows us to address methodological questions and assess the effectiveness of transect sampling. Monthly detection rates vary widely by species and likely reflect short-term changes in behavior rather than population fluctuations. Air temperature and rainfall are the factors most associated with monthly detection rates for various species. Small-scale areas of higher and lower use are evident for several species. Neither time of morning for surveys nor number of observers per trail affects detection rate. We report current abundances for the most commonly observed species and note generally lower densities in the Caribbean lowlands than elsewhere in the Neotropics. This research highlights that in less seasonal, evergreen forests climatic factors can still affect mammalian behavior. Overall, we find that secondary forests are of high conservation value and that transect walks are an effective methodology to sample many nonvolant mammal species, and we present recommendations on how to sample properly to conduct rigorous and long-term studies.

AB The vast majority of the phytoplankton communities in surface mixed layer of the oligotrophic ocean are numerically dominated by one of two ecotypes of Prochlorococcus, eMIT9312 or eMED4. In this study, we surveyed large latitudinal transects in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean to determine if these ecotypes discretely partition the surface mixed layer niche, or if populations exist as a continuum along key environmental gradients, particularly temperature. Transitions of dominance occurred at approximately 19-21 degrees C, with the eMED4 ecotype dominating the colder, and eMIT9312 ecotype dominating the warmer regions. Within these zones of regional dominance, however, the minority ecotype was not competed to extinction. Rather, a robust log-linear relationship between ecotype ratio and temperature characterized this stabilized coexistence: for every 2.5 degrees C increase in temperature, the eMIT9312:eMED4 ratio increased by an order of magnitude. This relationship was observed in both quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in pyrosequencing assays. Water column stratification also contributed to the ecotype ratio along the basin-scale transects, but to a lesser extent. Finally, instances where the ratio of the eMED4 and eMIT9312 abundances did not correlate well with temperature were identified. Such occurrences are likely due to changes in water temperatures outpacing changes in community structure.

AB The objective of this research was to analyze how population dynamics affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We assessed the effects of population redistribution resulting from the South Korean government's decentralization efforts on GHG emissions. Simulation results suggest that the direction of change in total GHG emissions depends on the share of the population redistributed from higher to lower population density regions. If the entire redistributed population of 877,000 persons expected from the government's decentralization project were from the Seoul Area, annual carbon dioxide emission (CO(2)e) would increase by 1.72 percent to 2.25 percent compared to benchmark levels. Alternatively, more balanced migration between higher and lower population density regions, that is, 65 percent of the 877,000 persons from higher-density locations to lower-density destinations and 35 percent from lower-density to higher-density regions, decreases CO(2)e by 1.68 percent to 2.50 percent.

AB An analysis of data on property size and type as well as land use reveals the distribution of deforestation, remaining forest cover and carbon stocks in Mato Grosso, Brazil's third largest state. Nearly two-thirds of remaining forests and carbon reserves, equating to between 2 and 3 Pg of carbon, are located on private properties. Around 80% of forests and carbon reserves are on properties larger than 1,000 ha, with smallholder farms and public land reform settlements controlling only a tiny fraction of the state's remaining forest and carbon reserves. Efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation must target owners controlling most of the remaining forest and land types with the highest deforestation rates. We thus suggest that policymakers seeking to protect the remaining forest should focus both incentives and enforcement of anti-deforestation laws in the larger properties where most of these forests are located.

AB Evaluating community assembly through the use of functional traits is a promising tool for testing predictions arising from Niche and Coexistence theories. Although interactions among neighboring species and their inter-specific differences are known drivers of coexistence with a strong spatial signal, assessing the role of individual species on the functional structure of the community at different spatial scales remains a challenge. Here, we ask whether individual species exert a measurable effect on the spatial organization of different functional traits in local assemblages. We first propose and compute two functions that describe different aspects of functional trait organization around individual species at multiple scales: individual weighted mean area relationship and individual functional diversity area relationship. Secondly, we develop a conceptual model on the relationship and simultaneous variation of these two metrics, providing five alternative scenarios in response to the ability of some target species to modify its neighbor environment and the possible assembly mechanisms involved. Our results show that some species influence the spatial structure of specific functional traits, but their effects were always restricted to the finest spatial scales. In the basis of our conceptual model, the observed patterns point to two main mechanisms driving the functional structure of the community at the fine scale, "biotic" filtering meditated by individual species and resource partitioning driven by indirect facilitation rather than by competitive mechanisms.

AB Conditions experienced in early developmental stages can have long-term consequences for individual fitness. High intraspecific density during the natal period can affect juvenile and eventually adult growth rates, metabolism, immune function, survival, and fecundity. Despite the important ecological and evolutionary effects of early developmental density, the form of the relationship between natal density and resulting juvenile phenotype is poorly understood. To test competing hypotheses explaining responses to intraspecific density, we experimentally manipulated the initial larval density of ringed salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum), a pond-breeding amphibian, over 11 densities. We modeled the functional form of the relationship between natal density and juvenile traits, and compared the relative support for the various hypotheses based on their goodness of fit. These functional form models were then used to parameterize a simple simulation model of population growth. Our data support non-additive density dependence and presents an alternate hypothesis to additive density dependence, self-thinning and Allee effects in larval amphibians. We posit that ringed salamander larvae may be under selective pressure for tolerance to high density and increased efficiency in resource utilization. Additionally, we demonstrate that models of population dynamics are sensitive to assumptions of the functional form of density dependence.

AB Herbivory can negatively affect several components of plant reproduction. Yet, because of a lack of experimental studies involving multiple populations, the extent to which differences in herbivory contribute to among-population variation in plant reproductive success is poorly known. We experimentally determined the effects of insect herbivory on reproductive output in nine natural populations of the perennial herb Lythrum salicaria along a disturbance gradient in an archipelago in northern Sweden, and we quantified among-population differentiation in resistance to herbivory in a common-garden experiment in the same area. The intensity of leaf herbivory varied > 500-fold and mean female reproductive success > 400-fold among the study populations. The intensity of herbivory was lowest in populations subject to strong disturbance from ice and wave action. Experimental removal of insect herbivores showed that the effect of herbivory on female reproductive success was correlated with the intensity of herbivory and that differences in insect herbivory could explain much of the among-population variation in the proportion of plants flowering and seed production. Population differentiation in resistance to herbivory was limited. The results demonstrate that the intensity of herbivory is a major determinant of flowering and seed output in L. salicaria, but that differences in herbivory are not associated with differences in plant resistance at the spatial scale examined. They further suggest that the physical disturbance regime may strongly influence the performance and abundance of perennial herbs and patterns of selection not only because of its effect on interspecific competition, but also because of effects on interactions with specialized herbivores.

AB The Brazilian Cerrado is the richest savanna in the world. It is also one of the biomes more threatened in the country and a hotspot for conservation priorities. The main causes of deforestation in Cerrado are agricultural practices, livestock and charcoal production. Although charcoal has a minor impact, its consumption represents the deforestation of 16.000 Km(2) of the Cerrado. To contribute for the biomes's conservation it is very important to improve forestry supervision. Thus, in this work we present the macroscopic characterization of charcoal from 25 Cerrado's species. We simulate the real conditions of forest controllers by using the magnifi cations of 10x, 25x and 65x. Likewise, the charcoals micrographs are all of transverse sections due to the larger amount of anatomical information. We also analyzed texture, brightness, vitrifi cation, ruptures and some special features. The species present several differences in their anatomical structure. Although some of them are very unique, this work does not intent to identify charcoals only by macroscopic analyses. But it might give directions to future identifi cation of genera or species. It also provides knowledge for government agents to verify the documents of forestry origin by fast analyzing a sample of charcoal itself.

AB Herbivory is a major factor affecting both the performance and the fitness of the species composing a plant community and, ultimately, conditioning its temporal and spatial dynamics. Coastal dunes are a typical example of primary succession where different biotic and abiotic factors determine plant species occurrence; however, the effect of insect herbivory herein has remained little explored. To address this matter, we combined an observational study along a successional gradient with a green-house experiment to determine the occurrence and the impact of plant-aphid interactions. We focused on the species Schizaphis rufula, a widespread and abundant aphid associated with dune grasses in early stages of primary succession in Europe. Firstly, we studied aphid infestation rates on the dune grass Ammophila arenaria along a succession gradient in three locations of the North Sea coast to address the relationship between plant community composition and aphid occurrence; secondly, we tested the effect of aphid herbivory on a set of dune species typical for the different stages of succession. We found that the degree of aphid infestation was inversely correlated with the degree of dune fixation. The results of the experiment showed that aphid multiplication was significantly higher and its effect more pronounced on two early successional grass species, i.e. A. arenaria and Leymus arenarius. Here aphid multiplication resulted in a severe decrease in plant biomass; in late successional grass species, there was limited multiplication and no effect on biomass. The results of the field survey and the green-house experiment indicate that aphids show a clear preference for plants from early successional stages and, moreover, they have a greater impact on these plant species. All this supports the hypothesis of aphid herbivory as a driving factor of primary succession in coastal dunes.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible correlations between the socioeconomic development indicators of the municipalities of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and the presence of both sustainable use and full protection conservation areas (CAs). The Human Development Index (HDI) and Gini Index (GI) values were compared between municipalities with and without CAs using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The correlations between the HDI and GI of each municipality and its areas occupied by CAs were analyzed using the non-parametric Spearman correlation test. A total of 560 CAs were identified in the 853 municipalities of the state. The HDI values of municipalities with CAs were not significantly different from those of other areas, but significant differences were found in the GI values, which were higher in municipalities with CAs. No significant correlations were found between the HDI of municipalities and their areas occupied by CAs. However, significant correlations were found between the GI and areas occupied by CAs, suggesting that the CAs are associated with greater socioeconomic inequalities. Populations should be included in conservation efforts through programs that benefit these individuals, such as payment for environmental services and other conservation strategies.

AB The interplay between evolution and ecological communities is critical for the integration of different levels of biological organization. Recent work has begun to unveil the importance of plant phenotypic plasticity and plant-herbivore (co) evolution to link plant evolution and associated insect communities. Specifically, herbivore-induced plant traits (i.e., plastic phenotypes) have significant effects on the structure and diversity of herbivore communities, which can in turn promote the evolution of not only the focal plant but also insect community members. Here, I will provide a conceptual framework on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant-herbivore communities to understand how biological organizations are integrated in plant-insect interactions. Research on eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant-herbivore communities will undoubtedly enrich understanding of a wide range of plant-insect interactions.

AB In occupying an intermediate trophic position, herbivorous insects serve a vital link between plants at the base of the food chain and parasitoids at the top. Although these herbivore-mediated indirect plant-parasitoid interactions are well-documented, new studies have uncovered previously undescribed mechanisms that are fundamentally changing how we view tri-trophic relationships. In this review we highlight recent advances in this field focusing on both plant-driven and parasitoid-driven outcomes that flow up and down the trophic web, respectively. From the bottom-up, plant metabolites can impact parasitoid success by altering host immune function; however, few have considered the potential effects of other plant defense strategies such as tolerance on parasitoid ecology and behavior. From the top-down, parasitoids have long been considered plant bodyguards, but in reality the consequences of parasitism for herbivory rates and induction of plant defensive chemistry are far more complicated with cascading effects on community-level interactions.

AB Tropical forests are renowned for their high diversity, yet in many sites a single tree species accounts for the majority of the individuals in a stand. An explanation for these monodominant forests remains elusive, but may be linked to mycorrhizal symbioses. We tested three hypotheses by which ectomycorrhizas might facilitate the dominance of the tree, Oreomunnea mexicana, in montane tropical forest in Panama. We tested whether access to ectomycorrhizal networks improved growth and survival of seedlings, evaluated whether ectomycorrhizal fungi promote seedling growth via positive plant-soil feedback, and measured whether Oreomunnea reduced inorganic nitrogen availability. We found no evidence that Oreomunnea benefits from ectomycorrhizal networks or plant-soil feedback. However, we found three-fold higher soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations outside than inside Oreomunnea-dominated forest and a correlation between soil nitrate and Oreomunnea abundance in plots. Ectomycorrhizal effects on nitrogen cycling might therefore provide an explanation for the monodominance of ectomycorrhizal tree species worldwide.

AB The increment zones width in the xylem of Swietenia macrophylla King was investigated by dendrochronological methods in an undisturbed and a strongly disturbed tropical site near Aripuana, Mato Grosso, Brazil (10 degrees 09' S, 59 degrees 26' W). The study aimed to assess the impact of forest disturbance on the relationship between precipitation and the cambial growth of this species. Tree-ring width chronologies were developed for both sites from cross-dated increment curves. Simple correlations were computed between monthly precipitation records and the annual increment of Swietenia for the period between 1870 and 2000. Logging activities and altered land use caused a significant decrease of the water supply of the Swietenia trees grown in the disturbed area compared to trees grown in the undisturbed area. Consequently, the precipitation of almost the total growing season had a significant influence on the tree ring width of Swietenia grown in the disturbed area, while in the undisturbed forest area the significant correlation between monthly precipitation and the tree ring width of Swietenia was restricted to the beginning of the growing season (November to January). However, the reconstruction of monthly precipitation data from the tree ring width records was more precise using the chronology developed from tree ring width records of undisturbed trees compared to the chronology developed from tree ring widths from the disturbed area. It was concluded that the use of the tree ring widths of Swietenia as climate proxies is restricted to certain months of the year and requires tree ring width chronologies developed from trees grown in undisturbed or only slightly disturbed forest areas without severe anthropogenic changes in microclimate.

AB AimSpecies distribution modelling typically relies completely or partially on climatic variables as predictors, overlooking the fact that these are themselves predictions with associated uncertainties. This is particularly critical when such predictors are interpolated between sparse station data, such as in the tropics. The goal of this study is to provide a new set of satellite-based climatic predictor data and to evaluate its potential to improve modelled species-climate associations and transferability to novel geographical regions.
   LocationRain forests areas of Central Africa, the Western Ghats of India and South America.
   MethodsWe compared models calibrated on the widely used WorldClim station-interpolated climatic data with models where either temperature or precipitation data from WorldClim were replaced by data from CRU, MODIS, TRMM and CHIRPS. Each predictor set was used to model 451 plant species distributions. To test for chance associations, we devised a null model with which to compare the accuracy metric obtained for every species.
   ResultsFewer than half of the studied rain forest species distributions matched the climatic pattern better than did random distributions. The inclusion of MODIS temperature and CHIRPS precipitation estimates derived from remote sensing each allowed for a better than random fit for respectively 40% and 22% more species than models calibrated on WorldClim. Furthermore, their inclusion was positively related to a better transferability of models to novel regions.
   Main conclusionsWe provide a newly assembled dataset of ecologically meaningful variables derived from MODIS and CHIRPS for download, and provide a basis for choosing among the plethora of available climate datasets. We emphasize the need to consider the method used in the production of climate data when working on a region with sparse meteorological station data. In this context, remote sensing data should be the preferred choice, particularly when model transferability to novel climates or inferences on causality are invoked.

AB Conservation biology is conceived as a discipline that must balance the short-term aim of gathering data on pressing conservation issues with the long-term vision of protecting populations, species, and functional ecosystems. Asian wildlife face imminent threats ranging from hunting to loss of critical habitats, but there are few examples of detailed longitudinal wildlife research in the region. Longitudinal research is essential for protecting populations especially in light of the high volumes of legal and illegal trade, understanding basic population dynamics, notably with respect to long-lived species, as well as accommodating the spatial needs of animals. It is also critical for evaluating the success of conservation or management interventions and adaptively improving outcomes. Such studies, particularly when requiring sustained field work, are impeded by mismatches between needs on the ground vs. the priorities of different stakeholders, the ephemeral and inefficient nature of funding mechanisms, and by the logistics of maintaining sites and personnel. Yet we cannot adequately protect biodiversity in Asia unless the magnitude of human impacts on its species is quantitatively understood and used to inform management. (C) 2016 The Author.

AB Habitat disturbance alters plant diversity and food resource availability, affecting the ecology, and ultimately the survival and reproduction, of species depending on those plants. Studies in degraded areas serve to improve our understanding of the consequences of habitat modification for endangered species and to guide conservation actions. We studied diet composition, monthly variation in feeding behavior and fruit feeding time, and dietary diversity in two golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) groups ranging in a degraded area of the Atlantic Forest in South-Bahia, Brazil, over a 12-mo period. We recorded feeding behavior and food items consumed through continuous observations and focal animal sampling, and performed dietary analyses on samples from consumed fruits. Substrate manipulation to search for animal prey was the feeding activity most frequently observed, followed by fruit consumption. We observed nectar drinking and exudate feeding at low frequencies from April through July. Bromeliads were the principal foraging substrate. We observed the use of 114 plant species, confirming the large dietary diversity reported for the species. Individual trees from the family Melastomataceae, common in degraded forests, accounted for the highest visiting frequencies (40%). Fruit availability was the main factor explaining variation in monthly fruit feeding time, despite the absence of climatic seasonality. Nutritional or energetic characteristics did not affect fruit choice. Differences in floristic composition appear to be a major determinant of the species' diet in different study areas. Regional forest restoration programs should consider including advanced forest species, to improve both forest quality and animal mobility between fragments.

AB Phosphorus is one of the major limiting factors of primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems and, thus, the P demand of plants might be among the most important drivers of soil and ecosystem development. The P cycling in forest ecosystems seems an ideal example to illustrate the concept of ecosystem nutrition. Ecosystem nutrition combines and extents the traditional concepts of nutrient cycling and ecosystem ecology. The major extension is to consider also the loading and unloading of nutrient cycles and the impact of nutrient acquiring and recycling processes on overall ecosystem properties. Ecosystem nutrition aims to integrate nutrient related aspects at different scales and in different ecosystem compartments including all processes, interactions and feedbacks associated with the nutrition of an ecosystem. We review numerous previous studies dealing with P nutrition from this ecosystemnutrition perspective. The available information contributes to the description of basic ecosystem characteristics such as emergence, hierarchy, and robustness. In result, we were able to refine Odum's hypothesis on P nutrition strategies along ecosystem succession to substrate related ecosystem nutrition and development. We hypothesize that at sites rich in mineral-bound P, plant and microbial communities tend to introduce P from primary minerals into the biogeochemical P cycle (acquiring systems), and hence the tightness of the P cycle is of minor relevance for ecosystem functioning. In contrast, tight P recycling is a crucial emergent property of forest ecosystems established at sites poor in mineral bound P (recycling systems). We conclude that the integration of knowledge on nutrient cycling, soil science, and ecosystem ecology into holistic ecosystemnutrition will provide an entirely new view on soil-plant-microbe interactions.

AB Ants have been used to assess land use conversion, because they reflect environmental change, and their response to these changes have been useful in the identification of bioindicators. We evaluated ant diversity and composition associated to different land use change in a temperate forest (above 2000 m asl) in Mexico. The study was carried out in "Flor del Bosque" Park a vegetation mosaic of native Oak Forests and introduced Eucalyptus and grasslands. Species richness, dominance and diversity rarefaction curves, based on ant morphospecies and functional groups, were constructed and compared among the three vegetation types, for the rainy and the dry seasons of 2008-2009. Jaccard and Sorensen incidence-based indices were calculated to obtain similarity values among all the habitats. The Oak Forest was a rich dominant community, both in species and functional groups; the Eucalyptus plantation was diverse with low dominance. The most seasonality habitat was the grassland, with low species and high functional group diversity during the dry seasons, but the reverse pattern during the wet season. The Oak Forest was more similar to the Eucalyptus plantation than to the grassland, particularly during the dry season. Oak Forests are dominated by Cold Climate Specialists, specifically Prenolepis imparis (Say). The Eucalyptus and the grassland are characterized by generalized Myrmicinae, as Pheidole spp. and Monomorium ebenium (Forel). The conservation of the native Oak Forest is primordial for the maintenance of Cold Climate Specialist ant communities. The microclimatic conditions in this forest, probably, prevented the invasion by opportunistic species.

AB Heteroblasty, the temporal development of the meristem, can produce diverse leaf shapes within a plant. Gevuina avellana, a tree from the South American temperate rainforest shows strong heteroblasty affecting leaf shape, transitioning from juvenile simple leaves to highly pinnate adult leaves. Light availability within the forest canopy also modulates its leaf size and complexity. Here we studied how the interaction between the light environment and the heteroblastic progression of leaves is coordinated in this species. We used RNA-seq on the Illumina platform to compare the range of transcriptional responses in leaf primordia of G.avellana at different heteroblastic stages and growing under different light environments. We found a steady up-regulation of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL), NAC, YUCCA and AGAMOUS-LIKE genes associated with increases in age, leaf complexity, and light availability. In contrast, expression of TCP, TPR and KNOTTED1 homeobox genes showed a sustained down-regulation. Additionally, genes involved in auxin synthesis/transport and jasmonate activity were differentially expressed, indicating an active regulation of processes controlled by these hormones. Our large-scale transcriptional analysis of the leaf primordia of G.avellana sheds light on the integration of internal and external cues during heteroblastic development in this species.

AB Microclimatic forest influence (edge effects into open or regenerating areas) occurs within harvested forest, but the depth and magnitude may change depending on the design of the harvested area. This is an important consideration for managers, because gradients in microclimate can significant affect the ability of species to recolonise following disturbance. One harvesting method that can increase the amount of forest influence is aggregated retention. This technique involves leaving groups of trees (aggregates) within the harvested area, thus increasing the amount of regenerating forest that is near to an edge and therefore under forest influence. However, differences in the scale of forest influence generated from aggregates compared to unlogged forests surrounding harvested areas have not been tested. Understanding the ability of retained aggregates to generate forest influence is important in designing and implementing aggregated retention harvesting practices.
   This study tested whether retained aggregates generated similar levels of forest influence as mature forest surrounding harvested areas. Microclimatic forest influence was examined by monitoring spatial changes in air temperature and relative humidity along transects running from within standing mature forest into harvested forest. Intact forest and aggregate transects were located in the direction of maximum expected forest influence (south-facing edges). Results showed that forest influence was mostly similar in both depth and magnitude regardless of the type of forest from which it was generated. Temporal examination of forest influence showed that it changed throughout the day and across the year, with peaks in magnitude occurring during the middle of the day, and in months close to the equinoxes. Shade derived from standing trees was a potential driver of temporal patterns in microclimatic forest influence.
   At its peak magnitude, the microclimatic forest influence observed will likely have significant impacts on habitat suitability and thus, presumably, species recolonisation after disturbance. Results indicated that aggregated retention is an effective method for generating forest influence within harvested areas. Therefore, aggregated retention has the potential to be a valuable harvesting technique to alter microclimate and have beneficial impacts on the recovery of harvested forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Little is known about sustainable forest management and tree growth in the Amazon forest. Reliable growth data from trees are very important in the context of forest management. Tree-characteristics such as architecture and competition are associated with diameter growth. Previous studies analyzing tree growth have indicated that these variables can describe these effects for temperate and boreal forests. However, the role of these effects for the growth of tropical trees needs to be enhanced for forest management practices. Here, we reconstructed the periodic annual basal area increment (BAI(i) cm(2) yr(-1)) of four long-lived timber species from the Amazon forest of Brazil: (i) Cedrela odorata, (ii) Amburana cearensis, (iii) Copaifera pauper and (iv) Swietenia macrophylla to investigate the growth development. The study focuses on (i) drivers important for individual tree growth, (ii) calibration of an individual tree basal area increment model for each of the four species, and (iii) assessing the practical implementation of our findings for enhancing sustainable forest management of these four tree species in the Amazon rainforest. The results exhibit a significant relationship between increasing basal area increment versus increasing crown length and decreasing competition expressed by Hegyi's index. Trees sampled in densities greater than 25 m(2) ha(-1) had their BAI% significantly reduced. For Cedrela an additional negative impact on basal area increment from liana load is evident. Our findings reinforce the importance of release trees to obtain better crown exposure. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Ocean Acidification and Increased Temperature Have Both Positive and

AB The combined effect of ocean acidification and warming is expected to have significant effects on several traits of marine organisms. The gastropod Concholepas concholepas is a rocky shore keystone predator characteristic of the south-eastern Pacific coast of South America and an important natural resource exploited by small-scale artisanal fishermen along the coast of Chile and Peru. In this study, we used small juveniles of C. concholepas collected from the rocky intertidal habitats of southern Chile (39 degrees S) to evaluate under laboratory conditions the potential consequences of projected near-future levels of ocean acidification and warming for important early ontogenetic traits. The individuals were exposed long-term (5.8 months) to contrasting pCO(2) (ca. 500 and 1400 mu atm) and temperature (15 and 19 degrees C) levels. After this period we compared body growth traits, dislodgement resistance, predator-escape response, self-righting and metabolic rates. With respect to these traits there was no evidence of a synergistic interaction between pCO(2) and temperature. Shell growth was negatively affected by high pCO(2) levels only at 15 degrees C. High pCO(2) levels also had a negative effect on the predator-escape response. Conversely, dislodgement resistance and self-righting were positively affected by high pCO(2) levels at both temperatures. High tenacity and fast self-righting would reduce predation risk in nature and might compensate for the negative effects of high pCO(2) levels on other important defensive traits such as shell size and escape behaviour. We conclude that climate change might produce in C. concholepas positive and negative effects in physiology and behaviour. In fact, some of the behavioural responses might be a consequence of physiological effects, such as changes in chemosensory capacity (e.g. predator-escape response) or secretion of adhesive mucous (e.g. dislodgement resistance). Moreover, we conclude that positive behavioural responses may assist in the adaptation to negative physiological impacts, and that this may also be the case for other benthic organisms.

AB Global marine biodiversity peaks within the Coral Triangle, and understanding how such high diversity is maintained is a central question in marine ecology. We investigated broad-scale patterns in the diversity of clownfishes and their host sea anemones by conducting 981 belt-transects at 20 locations throughout the Indo-Pacific. Of the 1508 clownfishes encountered, 377 fish occurred in interspecific cohabiting groups and cohabitation was almost entirely restricted to the Coral Triangle. Neither the diversity nor density of host anemone or clownfish species alone influenced rates of interspecific cohabitation. Rather cohabitation occurred in areas where the number of clownfish species exceeds the number of host anemone species. In the Coral Triangle, cohabiting individuals were observed to finely partition their host anemone, with the subordinate species inhabiting the periphery. Furthermore, aggression did not increase in interspecific cohabiting groups, instead dominant species were accepting of subordinate species. Various combinations of down fish species were observed cohabiting (independent of body size, phylogenetic relatedness, evolutionary age, dentition, level of specialization) in a range of anemone species, thereby ensuring that each clownfish species had dominant reproductive individuals in some cohabiting groups. Clownfishes are obligate commensals, thus cohabitation is an important process in maintaining biodiversity in high diversity systems because it supports the persistence of many species when host availability is limiting. Cohabitation is a likely explanation for high species richness in other obligate commensals within the Coral Triangle, and highlights the importance of protecting these habitats in order to conserve unique marine biodiversity.

AB Novel solutions to conserve biodiversity whilst allowing for resource harvesting are urgently needed. In marine systems, Territorial User Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) are promoted to enable sustainable use of resources. We investigate the potential for synergies between nature-based tourism and TURFs on Chile's central coast. Of 135 recreational divers surveyed, 77% indicated that the fish species they preferred sighting were declining and 80% indicated that they would dive more often in TURFs, which have higher abundance of favoured species. Regression analysis shows that respondents that perceive that TURFs fulfil a conservation function are more willing to pay to dive in a TURF. However, respondents who understand the bureaucratic functioning of a TURF are less willing to pay, and there is diversity in how divers feel payments should be made. A participatory approach is required to navigate these complexities to achieve synergies between nature-based tourism and resource harvesting in TURFs.

AB Forest communities are mosaic systems composed of patches classified into four different developmental patch types: gap patch (G), building patch (B), mature patch (M) and degenerate patch (D). To study the mechanisms maintaining diversity in subalpine coniferous forests, species presence frequency and diversity in the four distinct patch types (G, B, M and D) of Larix chinensis conifer forests at three altitudinal gradients in the Qinling Mountains were analyzed. Our results were as follows: (1) Different species (or functional groups) had distinct presence frequencies in the four different patch types along the altitudinal gradient; (2) Some species or functional groups (species groups sharing similar traits and responses to the environment) only occurred in some specific patches. For seed dispersal, species using wind mainly occurred in G and D, while species using small animals mainly occurred in B and M; (3) Species composition of adjacent patch types was more similar than non-adjacent patch types, based on the lower beta diversity index of the former; (4) The maximum numbers of species and two diversity indices (D' and H') were found in the middle altitudes. Various gap-forming processes and dispersal limitation may be the two major mechanisms determining species diversity in Larix chinensis coniferous forests at the patch scale.

AB Developing and improving methods to monitor forest carbon in space and time is a timely challenge, especially for tropical forests. The next European Space Agency Earth Explorer Core Mission BIOMASS will collect synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data globally from employing a multiple baseline orbit during the initial phase of its lifetime. These data will be used for tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) processing, with a vertical resolution of about 20 m, a resolution sufficient to decompose the backscatter signal into two to three layers for most closed-canopy tropical forests. A recent study, conducted in the Paracou site, French Guiana, has already shown that TomoSAR significantly improves the retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a high biomass forest, with an error of only 10% at 1.5-ha resolution. However, the degree to which this TomoSAR approach can be transferred from one site to another has not been assessed. We test this approach at the Nouragues site in central French Guiana (ca 100 km away from Paracou), and develop a method to retrieve the top-of-canopy height from TomoSAR. We found a high correlation between the backscatter signal and AGB in the upper canopy layer (i.e. 20-40 m), while lower layers only showed poor correlations. The relationship between AGB and TomoSAR data was found to be highly similar for forests at Nouragues and Paracou. Cross validation using training plots from Nouragues and validation plots from Paracou, and vice versa, gave an error of 16-18% of AGB using 1-ha plots. Finally, using a high-resolution LiDAR canopy model as a reference, we showed that TomoSAR has the potential to retrieve the top-of-canopy height with an error to within 2.5 m. Our analyses show that the TomoSAR-AGB retrieval method is accurate even in hilly and high-biomass forest areas and suggest that our approach may be generalizable to other study sites, having a canopy taller than 30 m. These results have strong implications for the tomographic phase of the BIOMASS spaceborne mission. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

ID HOME-RANGE; REEF FISH; MORTALITY; IMPACT; HOST; SIZE
AB A major difficulty in managing wildlife trade is the reliance on trade data (rather than capture data) to monitor exploitation of wild populations. Collected organisms that die or are rejected before a point of sale often go unreported. For the global marine aquarium trade, identifying the loss of collected fish from rejection, prior to export, is a first step in assessing true collection levels. This study takes a detailed look at fish rejections by buyers before export using the Papua New Guinea marine aquarium fishery as a case study. Utilizing collection invoices detailing the species and quantity of fish (Actinopteri and Elasmobranchii) accepted or rejected by the exporting company it was determined that, over a six month period, 24.2% of the total fish catch reported (n = 13,886) was rejected. Of the ten most collected fish families, rejection frequency was highest for the Apogonidae (54.2%), Chaetodontidae (26.3%), and Acanthuridae (18.2%) and lowest for Labridae (6.6%) and Hemiscylliidae (0.7%). The most frequently cited reasons for rejection were fin damage (45.6% of cases), undersized fish (21.8%), and fish deemed too thin (11.1%). Despite fishers receiving feedback on invoices explaining rejections, there was no improvement in rejection frequencies over time (r = -0.33, P = 0.15) with weekly rejection frequencies being highly inconsistent (range: 2.8% to 79.4%; s = 16.3%). These findings suggest that export/import statistics can greatly underestimate collection for the marine aquarium trade as additional factors such as fisher discards, escapees, post-collection mortalities, and unregulated domestic trade would further contribute to this disparity.

AB A key challenge for ecologists is to quantify, explain and predict the ecology and behaviour of animals from knowledge of their basic physiology. Compared to our knowledge of many other types of distribution and behaviour, and how these are linked to individual function, we have a poor level of understanding of the causal basis for orientation behaviours. Most explanations for patterns of animal orientation assume that animals will modify their exposure to environmental factors by altering their orientation. We used a keystone grazer on rocky shores, the limpet Cellana tramoserica, to test this idea. Manipulative experiments were done to evaluate whether orientation during emersion affected limpet desiccation or body temperature. Body temperature was determined from infrared thermography, a technique that minimises disturbance to the test organism. No causal relationships were found between orientation and (i) level of desiccation and (ii) their body temperature. These results add to the growing knowledge that responses to desiccation and thermal stress may be less important in modifying the behaviour of intertidal organisms than previously supposed and that thermoregulation does not always reflect patterns of animal orientation. Much of what we understand about orientation comes from studies of animals able to modify orientation over very short time scales. Our data suggests that for animals whose location is less flexible, orientation decisions may have less to do with responses to environmental factors and more to do with structural habitat properties or intrinsic individual attributes. Therefore we suggest future studies into processes affecting orientation must include organisms with differing levels of behavioural plasticity.

AB Climate changes are predicted to increase extreme rainfall events in semiarid and arid region in Northern Hemisphere. Nutrient cycles will be affected by the precipitation changes but so far only very little is known how soil N transformations may respond. Here we investigated gross soil N transformation rates and their response to simulated rainfall events across Northeast China Transect (NECT). The results showed that gross N mineralisation rate, nitrification rate and nitrification to mineralisation ratio significantly increased as the humidity index decreased along NECT, resulting in NO3- as the predominant inorganic N form. These characteristics could increase the risk of NO3- losses but at the same time reduce the risk of N losses via volatilization in the semiarid and arid region. The soil-plant ecosystems have developed effective N conservation strategies in the long term with respect to the prevailing climate in arid region. However, compared to humid soils more dramatic changes of soil N transformation rates are likely to occur in arid soils, after sudden soil moisture increases. Soil N conservation mechanisms in arid regions were drastically affected when the heavy rainfall frequently occurred. Arid ecosystems are expected to be more vulnerable than humid ecosystems in response to extreme rainfall events.

AB The gray fox, Urocyon cinereoargenteus, is a medium-size canid widely distributed in Mexico. Most studies on this species focus on habitat use, home range, diet, intraguild competence, and lanscape distribution between urban and rural sites. In central Veracruz, gray foxes are present in fragments of cloud forest and in shaded coffee plantations; nevertheless, its abundance has not yet been compared among other vegetation types found in the area, such as sugarcane plantations. In this study we described gray foxes abundance variations using 500 m transects, among sugarcane plantations, shaded coffee plantations, and cloud forest fragments throughout eight months, by scat counting in three sites of each cover type. We reported the relative abundance index for each cover type and each month, and evaluated its relationship with four landscape features: (a) shade percent, (b) trail density, (c) human population density, and (d) habitat juxtaposition, in influence areas of 450 ha around sampling sites. Abundance comparison among cover types showed lower abundances in cloud forest fragments and higher abundances in coffee and sugarcane plantations. No significant differences were found throughout months (p = 0.476). We proposed that higher abundances in plantations may be related to the presence of rodent plagues and fruit trees which offer food resources to gray foxes. The evaluation of landscape features showed that only medium-impact trail density and human population density were positively correlated with gray fox abundance; fact that demonstrates that this canid can coexist with humans in rural sites. We highlight the gray fox capacity to take advantage of heterogeneous landscapes.

AB Barrier islands represent unusual and fragile ecosystems, influenced by multiple physical stressors and populated by organisms that are resource and habitat specialists. Dung beetles (Coleoptera) provide essential ecosystem services through the removal of dung from the environment. Their role in the unique environment of a barrier island dominated by a large non-native grazing species has not been widely investigated. Using linear transects of pitfall traps baited with human dung, we examined the species diversity of dung beetles found in three habitats (marsh, dunes, and forest) of Assateague Island, a barrier island off the coast of Maryland and Virginia, USA. Fifteen species (13,626 individuals) were collected. Estimates of species richness suggest there may be an additional 3-6 species on the island that were not sampled in this study. Heterotrophic succession of dung beetles attracted to horse dung was also examined and compared between Assateague Island and mainland horse farms. Observations were made at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days without replacement of bait. Significantly fewer dung beetles were attracted to Assateague Island horse dung placed on the island compared to mainland horse dung placed on two horse farms, 80 and 748 beetles, respectively. No beetles were collected after seven days of the study. When the horse bait was switched with island-origin horse dung placed on two mainland horse farms and dung from horse farms placed on the island, there was no significant difference in the number of individuals collected. To our knowledge, this is the first research that has examined the attraction of dung beetles to feral horse dung.

AB Although seasonality is less evident in the tropics than in temperate ones, many tropical species present rhythmic growth. The stem circumference growth (SCG) evaluation will provide information on the development of tree species in this region. This study aimed to evaluate the SCG of 11 tree species of a tropical semi-deciduous forest in Southern Brazil. Two hypotheses were advanced: (i) seasonality of the trees SCG exist and it is related to climatic variations of the study area; (ii) individual characteristics (tree height, degree of occupancy by lianas, sociological position, deciduousness and diameter at breast height) influence the circumference cumulative growth. To detect the SCG periodicity, permanent dendrometric bands were fixed around the stem (diameter at breast height, or DBH) of 156 individuals. Growth was monitored monthly for a period of 18 months. Correlations of monthly SCG with precipitation, temperature and photoperiod were made to verify the environmental parameters' influence and a covariance analysis was performed to enquire if individual characteristics also affected cumulative increase in circumference., The species showed a seasonal pattern of SCG with higher growth rates from October to December and, environmental parameters operate jointly - especially photoperiod and the temperature - to promote growth seasonality, confirming the first hypothesis. Considering the individuals characteristics, only the trunk diameter was negatively correlated with increasing cumulative circumference (b= -0.32; p=0.02), partially accepting the second hypothesis.

AB Typical ecological gradient analysis for plant species considers variation in the response along a gradient of covariate values, for example, temperature or precipitation. Response is customarily modeled through the presence/absence or a suitable measure of abundance or both. Such analysis enables the creation of a climate niche or range limits for the species using this covariate. Interest often extends to two climate covariates, thus seeking a climate niche in two-dimensional space. It also seeks to learn whether the niche changes over life stages of the species. For instance, is the niche for juveniles different from that for adults? Across the climate domain, where are seedlings relatively more or less abundant than adults? Adult abundance is measured through basal area, juvenile abundance through seedling counts. Our contribution is to describe a coherent modeling approach to address the foregoing objectives. We construct a hierarchical stochastic specification that jointly models juveniles and adults with regard to their two-dimensional climate niches. Joint modeling of the abundance response surfaces is proposed because seedlings and adults are living jointly, competitively and is justified through exploratory analysis. Joint modeling can be challenging when one response is counts and the other is area. We model adult abundance and then juvenile abundance driven by adult abundance. Due to excess zeroes over our study plots, we employ zero-inflated models for both adult and seedling abundance. We demonstrate the benefits of the joint modeling through out-of-sample predictive performance. Our abundance data come from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis dataset. Our climate data come from the 800 m resolution Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model dataset. In order to extract a response to climate, we aggregate FIA plots to ecological subsections. At plot scale, micro-scale covariates explain variation in abundance; at a larger spatial scale, climate covariates can explain variation in abundance.

AB We investigated forest edge effects on the composition, abundance and species richness of epiphyllous (leaf-inhabiting) bryophytes in tropical cloud-forest fragments in the Taita Hills (Eastern Arc Mountains, Kenya). Six sample plots each of 0.04 ha (20 x 20 m) were established along a disturbance gradient extending in 200 m from the forest edge at three sites. Four leaves were collected from each phorophyte species and the diversity of epiphyllous bryophytes examined. Relative humidity and temperature readings were recorded using time-calibrated data loggers and a digital hygrometer. The epiphyllous species composition among localities and forest-edge distance classes were analysed using multivariate procedures. Overall, 1387 leaves distributed across 489 phorophytes were studied, and 95 species of bryophyte epiphylls were found in the 18 0.04-ha plots selected. The richness and distribution of epiphyllous bryophyte species did not change with the forest-edge distance, but rather depended on phorophyte species composition and (micro-) environmental variables such as sunlight exposure and spatial and dimensional canopy structure. The differences in epiphyll diversity among forest fragments were thus influenced by site-specific characteristics. Our findings suggest that management policies addressed to preserve ancient uncut stands that exhibit as much original phorophyte diversity as possible, need to be urgently achieved to protect epiphyll communities in African tropical cloud forests.

DE Allometric equations; Bayesian hierarchical model; Cumulative
   uncertainty; Forest biomass
ID CARBON; PATTERNS
AB Predictions of above-ground biomass and the change in above-ground biomass require attachment of uncertainty due the range of reported predictions for forests. Because above-ground biomass is seldom measured, there have been no opportunities to obtain such uncertainty estimates. Standard methods involve applying an allometric equation to each individual tree on sample plots and summing the individual values. There is uncertainty in the allometry which leads to uncertainty in biomass at the tree level. Due to interdependence between competing trees, the uncertainty at the plot level that results from aggregating individual tree biomass in this way is expected to overestimate variability. That is, the variance at the plot level should be less than the sum of the individual variances. We offer a modeling strategy to learn about change in biomass at the plot level and model cumulative uncertainty to accommodate this dependence among neighboring trees. The plot-level variance is modeled using a parametric density-dependent asymptotic function. Plot-by-time covariate information is introduced to explain the change in biomass. These features are incorporated into a hierarchical model and inference is obtain within a Bayesian framework. We analyze data for the eastern United States from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program of the US Forest Service. This region contains roughly 25,000 FIA monitored plots from which there are measurements of approximately 1 million trees spanning more than 200 tree species. Due to the high species richness in the FIA data, we combine species into plant functional types. We present predictions of biomass and change in biomass for two plant functional types.

AB Plants can acclimate to environmental changes by physiological and morphoanatomical responses. We aimed to evaluate the influence of high-light acclimation on the hardiness of neotropical tree species seedlings, through analysis of the gas exchange, morphology and anatomy of Aegiphila integrifolia (Jacq.) Moldenke, Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. and Heliocarpus popayanensis Kunth. Seedlings were grown in a shaded sector (40 % of photosynthetic photon flux density) of a nursery. After the growing period, part of the seedlings was kept in the shaded sector (shade) and another part was transferred to full sunlight (sun). The seedlings remained in the respective sectors for 168 days. H. popayanensis sun seedlings presented increases in net photosynthesis together with reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration, resulting in higher water-use efficiency. In contrast, the transfer to full sunlight led to a decrease in net photosynthesis of A. integrifolia and G. ulmifolia seedlings, but this parameter was recovered after development of new leaves in the sun. The hardening process under high irradiation levels induced morphoanatomical responses in all species, such as increased palisade parenchyma thickness and lower total leaf area (all species), higher stomatal density (A. integrifolia and G. ulmifolia), higher biomass allocation to roots (H. popayanensis and G. ulmifolia), and higher Dickson quality index (H. popayanensis). Thus, when submitted to a high radiation environment, the physiological and morphoanatomical acclimation increased seedlings hardiness and, in consequence, the probability of survival after planting in the field.

AB Annonaceae is one of the richest families of the wood components of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). Annona coriacea Mart., Annona crassiflora Mart., Duguetia furfuracea (A. St.-Hil.) Saff. and Xylopia aromatica L. are common species in this region. The main goal of our study was to determine biological activities of these species. Therefore, we evaluated phytotoxic effects of ethanolic extracts of leaves and stems of these species in the laboratory. In addition, toxicity to animal targets was also evaluated. Lettuce was the less affected target species, with discreet effects over germination rate and initial root development observed using the highest concentration (0.8 mg mL(-1)) of extracts of A. coriacea. Notwithstanding, tomato was the most affected target species by these annonaceous extracts, with an expressive decrease in germination rate, shoot and root growth even with the lowest extract concentrations. Onion germination was affected mainly by X. aromatica and A. coriacea leaf extracts, with significant results for all concentrations. Effects on shoot and root growth were also observed for this species. In general, the strongest phytotoxic activities were detected for the extracts of A. coriacea and X. aromatica. These extracts also inhibited growth of Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R.D. Webster. The extracts of A. coriacea were also very toxic to brine shrimp nauplii. No antibacterial or antifungal effects were detected with the extracts of these four species of Annonaceae. Among the four species, X. aromatica and A. coriacea exhibited strong biological activities and the results could be useful in agricultural fields in Brazil. These extracts were also promising for isolation and identification of commercial valuable metabolites.

AB We examined the structural and distribution patterns of woody species in the understory community of a Brazilian tropical rain forest in relation to two different soil types having distinct textures and chemical compositions. Plots were installed in five areas with clayey and in five with sandy soils, representing the main soil types in the region of the Una Biological Reserve, BA-Brazil (15 degrees 00'-15 degrees 20'S and 39 degrees 00'-39 degrees 15'W). Plant assemblages growing on those two soil types were sampled using the RAPELD methodology. A total of 1233 individuals were found on clayey soils (belonging to 303 species) and 1293 individuals on sandy soils (belonging to 320 species). No significant differences were observed among these two sets of plants in relation to their species compositions, abundances, species richness, heights, densities, or maximum diameter. Both plant communities had high alpha and beta diversity levels. Despite the apparent unstructured organizations of the communities and the lack of strong niche differentiation, we did not find evidence of ecological drift through processes such as random differentiation or increased dissimilarity with increasing distances. A combination of high species richness and high turnover rates as part of a much larger community may explain the results. The four most abundant species were likewise the most abundant on both soil types. This study contributed in identifying sets of species that respond well to local edaphic conditions and can be considered for restoration projects.

AB Although genetics in a single species is known to impact whole communities, little is known about how genetic variation influences species interaction networks in complex ecosystems. Here, we examine the interactions in a community of arthropod species on replicated genotypes (clones) of a foundation tree species, Populus angustifolia James (narrowleaf cottonwood), in a long-term, common garden experiment using a bipartite genotype-species network perspective. We combine this empirical work with a simulation experiment designed to further investigate how variation among individual tree genotypes can impact network structure. Three findings emerged: (1) the empirical genotype-species network exhibited significant network structure with modularity being greater than the highly conservative null model; (2) as would be expected given a modular network structure, the empirical network displayed significant positive arthropod co-occurrence patterns; and (3) furthermore, the simulations of genotype-species networks displayed variation in network structure, with modularity in particular clearly increasing, as genotypic variation increased. These results support the conclusion that genetic variation in a single species contributes to the structure of ecological interaction networks, which could influence ecological dynamics (e.g., assembly and stability) and evolution in a community context.

AB Numerous grassland experiments have found evidence for a complementarity effect, an increase in productivity with higher plant species richness due to niche partitioning. However, empirical tests of complementarity in natural forests are rare. We conducted a spatially explicit analysis of 518433 growth records for 274 species from a 50-ha tropical forest plot to test neighborhood complementarity, the idea that a tree grows faster when it is surrounded by more dissimilar neighbors. We found evidence for complementarity: focal tree growth rates increased by 39.8% and 34.2% with a doubling of neighborhood multi-trait dissimilarity and phylogenetic dissimilarity, respectively. Dissimilarity from neighbors in maximum height had the most important effect on tree growth among the six traits examined, and indeed, its effect trended much larger than that of the multi-trait dissimilarity index. Neighborhood complementarity effects were strongest for light-demanding species, and decreased in importance with increasing shade tolerance of the focal individuals. Simulations demonstrated that the observed neighborhood complementarities were sufficient to produce positive stand-level biodiversity-productivity relationships. We conclude that neighborhood complementarity is important for productivity in this tropical forest, and that scaling down to individual-level processes can advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stand-level biodiversity-productivity relationships.

   Administrative Sanctions in Mato Grosso State
SO FORESTS
LA English

DE regulation enforcement; Amazon; deforestation
ID PROTECTED AREAS; BIODIVERSITY; ENFORCEMENT; PLANTATIONS; POLICIES
AB Forest conservation efforts through regulatory enforcement routinely failed to prevent large scale deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. However, a turning point occurred in 2005, when a combination of unfavorable economic conditions and an unprecedented coordinated effort between governmental institutions resulted in a gradual slowdown in deforestation. The continuation of this deforestation slowdown in an environment of economic recovery and expansion after 2009 suggests that regulatory enforcement achieved a measure of success not experienced before. In this study, the impact of fines, embargoes on rural private properties, and confiscation of means of production and produce on deforestation in the Southern Amazon state of Mato Grosso was considered through regression and GIS-based analyses. It was found that while all three sanctions were negatively correlated with deforestation, there were important differences in their level of enforcement. Embargoes were effectively implemented and showed high deforestation deterrence effectiveness, but the actual collection of the values of fines issued was extremely low, which casts doubts on their actual effectiveness as a deforestation deterrence mechanism. The results suggest that while sanctions for illegal deforestation have played an important role in the slowdown in deforestation, measures to increase the collection of fines issued are urgently needed.

AB Biotic interactions play an important role in structuring community spatial pattern, which is also influenced by species resource use and reproductive success. Since plants are sessile organisms, biotic interactions may be reflected in the pattern of species co-occurrence. The pattern of species co-occurrence may change with the predominance of positive or negative interactions among the species along evolutionary history and environmental gradients. Considering the relative influence of phylogeny and environmental gradients, we expected lianas co-occurring on the same host tree (phorophyte) to (1) be phylogenetically more related than expected by chance; and (2) respond to abiotic variation along a gradient. We sampled 1 ha with 100 plots of 10 x 10 m each in a tropical semideciduous forest in SE Brazil. We investigated the presence of phylogenetic signal in climbing traits of lianas co-occurring on the same phorophyte and tested for the co-occurrence of liana-phorophyte pairs across the space and environmental gradients. Closely related liana species co-occurred more frequently than expected by chance on the same phorophyte species. Climbing traits of liana species showed a significant phylogenetic signal. Canopy openness had a high influence on the co-occurrence of lianas. We assume that stochastic processes, such as dispersal limitation, fragment history in relation with canopy openness, are the main drivers of the number of lianas co-occurrence on microscale.

AB The structure and underlying functions of the majority of the world's tropical forests have been disrupted by human impacts, but the potential biodiversity and conservation value of regenerating forests is still debated. One review suggests that on average, regenerating tropical forests hold 57% (+/- 2.6%) of primary forest species richness, raising doubt about a viable second chance to conserve biodiversity through rainforest regeneration. Average values, however, likely underestimate the potential benefit to biodiversity and conservation because they are drawn from many studies of short-term regeneration and studies confounded by ongoing human disturbance. We suggest that the true potential biodiversity and conservation value of regenerating rainforest could be better assessed in the absence of such factors and present a multi-taxa case study of faunal biodiversity in regenerating tropical forest in lowland Amazonia. We found that biodiversity of this regenerating site was higher than might have been expected, reaching 87% (+/- 3.5%) of primary forest alpha diversity and an average of 83% (+/- 6.7) of species estimated to have occurred in the region before disturbance. Further, the regenerating forest held 37 species of special conservation concern, representing 88% of species of highest conservation importance predicted to exist in primary forest from the region. We conclude that this specific regenerating rainforest has high biodiversity and conservation value, and that whilst preserving primary forest is essential, our results suggest that under a best-case scenario of effective conservation management, high levels of biodiversity can return to heavily disturbed tropical forest ecosystems.

AB The Brazilian cerrado, a hotspot of biodiversity, has suffered intense fragmentation in the last decades with an associated increase in areas subjected to edge effects. Plant phenology may be influenced by abiotic changes induced by edge effects, such as increases in temperature and light. We studied the phenology of the guamirim (Myrcia guianensis, Myrtaceae) and its relation to local abiotic factors in a Brazilian cerrado area between 2005 and 2011, aiming to answer: (i) whether M. guianensis phenology differs between the edge and the interior and/or between cardinal orientations at the study site, given that environments facing east are lighter and warmer than environments facing south; and (ii) how microenvironmental factors influence the observed phenological patterns. We sampled 92 individuals in 36 transects (25m x 2m), distributed along the edge and in the interior (100m from the edge) of the east and south faces. Myrcia guianensis presented seasonal patterns of leafing and reproduction, but only reproduction was influenced by microenvironmental conditions. Individuals on the east edge - the warmest and driest environment with the most light - presented with the highest synchrony and intensity of reproductive phenophases, followed by the east interior, south interior and south edge. Flowering and fruiting onset and peak dates occurred around 20 days earlier on the east edge than the south face. Edge conditions, primarily cardinal orientation, and associated higher temperatures and light incidence influenced the reproductive phenology of M. guianensis and the onset of flowering and fruiting. We suggest that edges could be used to evaluate plant responses to the temperature increases predicted for future climate change scenarios.

AB Increasing numbers of cities are currently developing sustainable policies aimed at promoting urban biodiversity and ecological dynamics through the planning of green networks and the implementation of more sustainable management practices. These human activities can strongly influence environmental factors on which the organization of ecological communities at different scales depends. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand the relative impact of local management, green space design and landscape features on the distribution and the abundance of species in urban areas. On the basis of 2 years of butterfly surveys in urban public parks within an extensive Mediterranean metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France), the aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the effect of these three environmental scales (plot, park, landscape) on the composition and organization of species assemblages. Using variation partitioning and nestedness analysis on ecological data aggregated at plot-level and park-level respectively, we demonstrate the preponderant effect of landscape scale features on urban butterfly assemblages. Our results also highlight an important co-variation of plot management, park layout and urban landscape features, in their interaction with the community structure of urban butterflies. Although there is no significant species-area relationship, significantly nested patterns arise in species composition. Selective colonization appears as a driving force constraining the constitution of species assemblages within the city. However, a prospective study on adjacent more natural areas suggests that biotic limitations, interspecific competition and habitat filtering may play an important role if a larger portion of the urbanization gradient is explored, which remains to be investigated.

AB The role of canopy gaps in tropical dry forest (TDF) dynamics remains unclear. Here, 75 canopy gaps, mostly formed by the fall of Bursera spp. and Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum individuals, are described, and their potential consequences for forest regeneration are analysed in a Mexican TDF. In 50 randomly selected gaps, understorey vegetation was sampled with apaireddesign (inside and outside gaps) and by distinguishing two plant height categories. In total, 1940plants were recorded(63% in gaps and 37% innon-gap plots). Community attributes (density, community cover, taxonomic richness and Shannon diversity) were significantly higher for both height categories in gap plots. Conversely, neither an NMDS ordination nor a multinomial classification of 187 species by habitat affinities revealed floristic segregation between gaps and non-gaps; almost all species were classified as habitat generalists, with only a few opportunistic forbs (but no single tree species) being classified as gap specialists. The most important effects of gap formation are significant increases in plant abundance and species richness, but not a different species composition. Against earlier views that gap-phase dynamics is inconsequential for TDF dynamics, these results suggest a more active, albeit modest, role of treefall gaps in TDF, through promoting an abundant establishment.

AB Context Tropical forest regeneration is increasingly prominent as agro-pastoral lands are abandoned. Regeneration is characterised as favouring 'marginal' lands; however, observations of its drivers are often coarse or simple, leaving doubt as to spatial dynamics and causation.
   Objectives We quantified the spatial dynamics of forest regeneration relative to marginality and remnant forest cover in a 3000 km(2) pastoral region in northern tropical Australia.
   Methods Classification and regression trees related the extent and distribution of regeneration to soil agricultural potential, land-cover history, terrain slope, distance to primary forest, and primary forest fragment size, as defined by aerial photography.
   Results Secondary forest extent and distribution overwhelmingly reflect the proximity and size of primary forest fragments. Some 85 % of secondary forest area occurs < 1 km of primary forest, and 86 % of secondary forest patches >50 ha are < 400 m from primary forest and coincident with historic primary forest fragments. Where primary forest fragments are >8.5 ha, secondary forest area declines less rapidly with increasing distance from primary forest up to 1.5 km. Marginality inferred by soil potential and slope had no bearing on regeneration, except at the coarsest of spatial scales where regeneration is a proxy for primary forest cover.
   Conclusion Findings underline the need to conserve even modest rainforest patches as propagule reservoirs enabling regeneration. Marginality per se may have a limited role in regeneration. As most secondary forest was an extension of primary forest, its unique conservation value relative to that of primary forest may likewise merit reconsideration.

ID ATLANTIC FOREST; OCCUPANCY
AB We provide the first estimates of density and population size of two sympatric species of armadillos (Euphractus sexcinctus and Dasypus novemcinctus) for the Vale Natural Reserve, evaluating how poaching would be affecting their habitat use (i.e. detectability and occupancy probability) and also describing their activity patterns. Abundance and density were estimated using a distance sampling technique. Occupancy, detectability, and activity patterns were assessed using camera-trapping during a one-year period. Estimated population densities were 0.06 individuals per hectare (ind/ha) and 0.05 ind/ha for D. novemcinctus and E. sexcinctus, respectively. Occupancy probability of both species was affected by the distance to forest edge. D. novemcinctus showed a positive relationship with increasing distance from the edge, whereas E. sexcinctus showed an opposite relationship. D. novemcinctus also showed higher occupancy rates in sites closer to a water resource. Additionally, occupancy and detectability of both species were negatively affected by historical poaching intensity in the reserve. Activity patterns varied between species, with D. novemcinctus being mostly nocturnal and E. sexcinctus being diurnal. We conclude that despite the two armadillo species sharing several niche dimensions, they showed spatial and temporal segregation. These differences may be an adaptation to reduce interspecific competition but may also be affected by the need to avoid poaching pressures. This study contributes to increase the knowledge and conservation of these two little-studied species. (C) 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

ID MODEL SELECTION; META-MENARDI; CAVE; DIVERSITY; ARANEAE
AB Hypogean habitats offer unique opportunities for ecological studies because they are characterized by low abundance and diversity of organisms, they receive low energy inputs, they are relatively stable from a climatic point of view, and they are quite easily modeled. However, given the harsh conditions of the working environment and difficulty of access, very few studies have investigated in detail the ecology of subterranean species directly in the field. In this study, we describe the ecological niche of the subterranean spider Troglohyphantes vignai (Araneae, Linyphiidae). We monitored the population of T. vignai in a disused graphite mine in the Western Italian Alps over 1year, and recorded the main biotic and abiotic parameters characterizing each sampling plot (i.e., temperature, humidity, prey availability, illuminance, and structural complexity). The ecological niche of T. vignai was modeled through polynomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and illustrated graphically by means of three-dimensional plots and GIS techniques. The environmental range in which the probability of presence of T. vignai was higher was consistent with a trade-off between climatic stability and food availability. Neither temporal nor spatial variation of the niche of T. vignai was detected through the year. The methodology used here may be easily adapted to other hypogean sites, paving the way to a novel understanding of niche partitioning in subterranean ecosystems.

AB Understanding how diversity is maintained in species-rich communities, such as tropical forests, remains a challenge in ecology. Recent work suggests that the controversy between competing theories could be better resolved by considering the spatial scale at which different processes rule community assembly. Here we use individual species-area relationships (ISAR) to evaluate the spatial organization of tree diversity around individuals of different species in a completely-mapped tropical dry forest in south Ecuador. We test two hypotheses. First, stressful environmental conditions promote facilitative interactions that will generate spatial signals of accumulation of diversity around individual trees - contrary to what has been reported in humid tropical forests. Second, spatial signals will shift through ontogeny. As, as larger, older trees generate new microsite conditions that affect the recruitment of younger, smaller trees. We compute ISAR functions for adult trees, for young trees and a new crossed-ISAR function measuring the accumulation of diversity of young trees around the old trees. We compare observed ISARs to the expectations of inhomogeneous Poisson (i.e. null) models controlling for the effects of environmental variation and habitat association on tree distribution. Although the prevalent response among adult trees was not different from null expectations, which means that the organization of diversity in this size class could be explained by environmental heterogeneity alone, most species accumulated more diversity than expected over short spatial scales in the small stem size class. Only two species accumulated significant diversity in the crossed-ISARs. Our study indicates the role of facilitation in the organization of plant diversity in this dry forest, but that facilitation is limited to some key species acting on early life stages and accumulating diversity around them. Our results demonstrate the benefit of considering different life-stages and crossed analyses to disentangle the processes affecting community assembly in tropical dry forests.

AB In Amazonian non-flooded forests with a moderate dry season, many trees do not form anatomically definite annual rings. Alternative indicators of annual rings, such as the oxygen (delta O-18(wc)) and carbon stable isotope ratios of wood cellulose (delta C-13(wc)), have been proposed; however, their applicability in Amazonian forests remains unclear. We examined seasonal variations in the delta O-18(wc) and delta C-13(wc) of three common species (Eschweilera coriacea, Iryanthera coriacea, and Protium hebetatum) in Manaus, Brazil (Central Amazon). E. coriacea was also sampled in two other regions to determine the synchronicity of the isotopic signals among different regions. The annual cyclicity of delta O-18(wc) variation was cross-checked by C-14 dating. The delta O-18(wc) showed distinct seasonal variations that matched the amplitude observed in the delta O-18 of precipitation, whereas seasonal delta C-13(wc) variations were less distinct in most cases. The delta O-18(wc) variation patterns were similar within and between some individual trees in Manaus. However, the delta O-18(wc) patterns of E. coriacea differed by region. The ages of some samples estimated from the delta O-18(wc) cycles were offset from the ages estimated by C-14 dating. In the case of E. coriacea, this phenomenon suggested that missing or wedging rings may occur frequently even in well-grown individuals. Successful cross-dating may be facilitated by establishing delta O-18(wc) master chronologies at both seasonal and inter-annual scales for tree species with distinct annual rings in each region.

DE Land reclamation; Shoreline change; Vegetation growth boundary; Shape
   entropy; Yangtze River Estuary
ID TOPOGRAPHY
AB Land reclamation directly changes the local coastal morphology, causing potential ecological consequences. To quantify how land reclamation influences the shoreline change, we employed shape entropy, in addition to traditional parameters, including shoreline length, land area change rate, and fractal dimension, extracted from SPOT satellite images from a number of representative years throughout two decades (1987-2012) to describe shoreline changes in Yangtze River Estuary, China. The vegetation growth boundary, representing the nearshore vegetation distribution as an ecological indicator, was also extracted and compared with the shoreline result. This comparison indicated that both vegetation growth boundary and shoreline evolve in a more complex and yet more orderly pattern partly because of land reclamation. Vegetation growth boundary changes more dramatically than shoreline, due to the combined effects of agricultural development and artificial beach nourishment, as well as the alternation of tidal creeks. These results have important implications for coastal wetland conservation and utilization in regions with intensive land reclamation such as the Yangtze River Estuary.

AB 1. Grazing by livestock is a major ecological disturbance, with potential effects on vegetation, soil, and insect fauna. Ants are a diverse and functionally important insect group with many associations with the ground layer, yet recent global syntheses question the importance of grazing effects on ant communities relative to vegetation or soil.
   2. We examined the effects of vegetation, soil and grazing on the whole ant community, ant functional groups, and abundant species in temperate eucalypt woodlands, southeastern Australia.
   3. We found limited influence of grazing on our vegetation and soil measures, except for a positive association between grazing and exotic perennial grass cover. We also found that exotic grass cover had a negative effect on overall ant abundance and richness, but not functional groups or individual species. Soil C:N ratio had a positive effect on the subdominant Camponotini, and leaf litter cover had a positive effect on the abundance of cryptic species. Partial Mantel tests revealed an effect of both environmental and grazing measures on ant assemblage composition, but constrained ordination showed that leaf litter cover, grass biomass, and native and exotic perennial grass cover had stronger correlations with ant community structure than grazing.
   4. Our study shows that both environmental variation and grazing play a role in driving ant community structure, but that key environmental variables such as grass biomass and leaf litter cover are particularly important in temperate eucalypt woodlands. Monitoring of ant communities to measure the benefits of changed grazing regimes for biodiversity should consider contemporary grazing pressure as well as the underlying effects of variation in plants and soils.

AB The dynamics of structured plant populations in variable environments can be decomposed into the asymptotic' growth contributed by vital rates, and transient' growth caused by deviation from stable stage structure. We apply this framework to a large, global data base of longitudinal studies of projection matrix models for plant populations. We ask, what is the relative contribution of transient boom and bust to the dynamic trajectories of plant populations in stochastic environments? Is this contribution patterned by phylogeny, growth form or the number of life stages per population and per species? We show that transients contribute nearly 50% or more to the resulting trajectories, depending on whether transient and stable contributions are partitioned according to their absolute or net contribution to population dynamics. Both transient contributions and asymptotic contributions are influenced heavily by the number of life stages modelled. We discuss whether the drivers of transients should be considered real ecological phenomena, or artefacts of study design and modelling strategy. We find no evidence for phylogenetic signal in the contribution of transients to stochastic growth, nor clear patterns related to growth form. We find a surprising tendency for plant populations to boom rather than bust in response to temporal changes in vital rates and that stochastic growth rates increase with increasing tendency to boom.Synthesis. Transient dynamics contribute significantly to stochastic population dynamics but are often overlooked in ecological and evolutionary studies that employ stochastic analyses. Better understanding of transient responses to fluctuating population structure will yield better management strategies for plant populations, and better grasp of evolutionary dynamics in the real world.

AB Canopy height is a key factor that affects carbon storage, vegetation productivity and biodiversity in forests, as well as an indicator of key processes such as biomass allocation. However, global variation in forest canopy height and its determinants are poorly known. We used global data on Light Detection and Ranging-derived maximum forest canopy height (H-max) to test hypotheses relating H-max to current climate (water availability, ambient energy and water-energy dynamics), regional evolutionary and biogeographic history, historical climate change, and human disturbance. We derived H-max for 32304 forested 55-km grid cells using 1-km global canopy height data(maximum height of 1-km cells within a 55-km grid). Variation in H-max was related to latitude and biomes, along with environmental and historical variables. Both spatial and non-spatial linear models were used to assess the relative importance of the different hypothesized factors.H-max was inversely related to latitude (i.e. tall canopies at the equator), but with high geographical variability. Actual evapotranspiration and annual precipitation were the factors most correlated to H-max globally, thus supporting the water-energy dynamics hypothesis. However, water limitation emerged as a key factor in tropical and temperate biomes within specific geographic regions, while energy limitation was a more important factor in boreal regions where temperature is more limiting to trees than water.H-max exhibited strong variation among biogeographic regions, supporting the role of regionalevolutionary and biogeographic history in structuring broad-scale patterns in canopy height. Furthermore, there were divergent relationships between climate and H-max between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, consistent with historical evolutionary contingencies modulating these relationships. Historical climate change was also related to H-max, albeit not as strongly, with shorter canopy heights where late-Quaternary climate has been less stable. In contrast, human disturbance was only weakly related to H-max at the scale (55km) examined here.Synthesis. This study confirms that forest canopy height is strongly controlled by current climate, but also provides evidence for an important supplementary role for regional-historical factors. This highlights the importance of considering evolutionary and biogeographic history for achieving a comprehensive understanding of forest ecosystem properties.

AB We provide a summary overview of the diversity of trematode parasites in freshwater fishes of the 'New World', i.e. the Americas, with emphasis on adult forms. The trematode fauna of three regions, South America, Middle America, and USA and Canada (North America north of Mexico), are considered separately. In total, 462 trematode species have been reported as adults from the Americas. The proportion of host species examined for parasites varies widely across the Americas, from a high of 45% in the Mexican region of Middle America to less than 5% in South America. North and South America share no adult species, and one exclusively freshwater genus, Creptotrema Travassos, Artigas & Pereira, 1928 in the Allocreadiidae Looss, 1902 is the most widely distributed. Metacercariae of strigeiforms maturing in fish-eating birds (e.g. species of the Diplostomidae Poirier, 1886) are common and widely distributed. The review also highlights the paucity of known life-cycles. The foreseeable future of diversity studies belongs to integrative approaches and the application of molecular ecological methods. While opportunistic sampling will remain important in describing and cataloguing the trematode fauna, a better understanding of trematode diversity and biology will also depend on strategic sampling throughout the Americas.

AB AimOligarchic patterns can vary from weak (i.e. little difference between rare and common species) to strong (i.e. a set of dominant species is immediately evident). Our aim was to understand the relationships between the strength of the oligarchic patterns, diversities (alpha, beta and gamma), and five potential causes (elevational variability, soil heterogeneity, elevation, soil conditions and geographical extent).
   LocationThe Amazon-Andes transition in the Madidi region (Bolivia).
   MethodsWe established 398 plots of 0.1ha each, containing 121,183 individual woody plants belonging to 2390 species. Then we defined 500 sub-regions (= unique overlapping subsets of 50 plots from the pool of 398 plots) so they varied in extent from 220 to 17,700km(2) within the study area. We employed two independent path analyses to relate environmental characteristics and geographical extent of sub-regions to (1) oligarchic strength and (2) alpha, beta and gamma diversities. We used generalized linear models to relate diversities to different measures of oligarchic strength.
   ResultsOligarchies at larger extents were weaker, a trend strongly driven by the pure effect of area and, secondarily, by environmental heterogeneity. Oligarchies at higher elevations were weaker than expected, and oligarchies in acidic and nutrients-poor soils were not stronger than those in less stressful soils. Trends in oligarchic strength were inversely correlated with those of gamma and beta diversity: weaker oligarchies were found in species-rich and heterogeneous communities.
   Main conclusionsEnvironmental heterogeneity and low landscape connectivity limit the strength of the oligarchic pattern. Although diversities (particularly beta diversity) and oligarchic strength are closely related, they are somewhat differently driven by external factors. In particular, oligarchic strength is more sensitive to spatial extent and less sensitive to environmental heterogeneity than beta diversity. Finally, the study of oligarchic patterns should consider a priori expectations based on species richness and turnover.

AB QuestionsWhat are the prevailing types of intraspecific spatial distributions and interspecific association patterns at species and life stage levels of trees in a tropical rain forest? Which ecological processes could structure these patterns? Possible processes include dispersal limitation, self-thinning, facilitation and competition between species and life stages.
   LocationA tropical broad-leaved forest in north-central Vietnam.
   MethodsWe used univariate and bivariate pair-correlation functions to investigate the spatial distribution and association patterns of 18 abundant tree species. To disentangle first- and second-order effects, we used a scale separation approach with the heterogeneous Poisson process as null model.
   Results(1) Sixteen of 18 species had aggregated patterns at various scales and regardless of their abundance. (2) Significant and aggregated patterns were found in 64% of all specific life stages. (3) At scales up to 15m, 12.4% species pairs showed significant associations, among that 71% were spatial attractions, 5% were spatial repulsions and 24% were non-essential interactions. (4) In different life stage associations, attractions (81%) predominated over repulsions (19%) at small scales of up to 15m.
   ConclusionsOur findings provide evidence that dispersal limitation may regulate the spatial patterns of tree species. Moreover, positive spatial associations between tree species and life stages suggest the presence of species herd protection and/or facilitation in this forest stand, while the persistence of intraspecific aggregation through life stages suggests a very late onset or even absence of self-thinning. Habitat heterogeneity plays an important role for species distribution patterns, and the spatial segregation occurs at a scale around 15m in this forest.

AB The conservation of forests in expanding frontier landscapes is critically important to maintain intact forest ecosystems and support forest dependent communities. To conserve frontier forests, policy approaches are needed that conserve forests and advance the well-being of local resource dependent communities. To identify such approaches, the forest conservation and development framework (FCDF) was designed to find place-based conservation-development policies that target system leverage-points influencing land-use practices. To demonstrate the utility of the FCDF, a portfolio of conservation-development policies were identified for Peru's Manu-Tambopata Corridor (MAT) and evaluated by local land-users. Results of the MAT case study show high levels of interest in the proposed policies, but a wide variation in interest levels relative to personal circumstances and policies proposed. Barriers to implementing conservation-development policies in frontier environments were also identified, including high value land-use alternatives generating high opportunity costs for accepting PES payments (e.g., REDD+), insecure land tenure and conflicting authorizations limiting land-users policy choices, and broad demographic diversity among local land-users. Collectively, this research suggests the FCDF is a useful approach for identifying policies matched to local conditions that advance conservation and human development. This research also indicates policy design in frontier environments is most effective when adapted to local conditions, seeks to identify a mix of complementary policies, and is targeted at key system variables influencing land-use practices (i.e., system leverage-points). Importantly, the MAT case study also highlights how even in rapidly changing frontier landscapes, land-users are interested in policies that advance conservation and development goals.

AB The avifauna of Chile is relatively depauperate, comprising 469 extant species, of which 213 are terrestrial. However, the Coquimbo Region presents a broad ecological transition from the hyperarid Atacama Desert to the north, and the more mesic Chilean Mediterranean region of central Chile, resulting in relatively high species diversity. Approximately 130 species are found here, 8 of which are endemic to Chile although not to this region. Bosque Fray Jorge National Park is a 9959 ha Biosphere Reserve dominated by matorral habitat and hosting up to 123 bird species. Through avian surveys and banding over nearly a decade we have documented 63 terrestrial species and discerned predictable seasonal and interannual structure to avian assemblages, at least through an extended dry period. Recent studies in the matorral habitats of the park indicate seasonal patterns that fall into 4 patterns: year-round residents, winter visitors, summer breeders, and transients. Short-term banding studies demonstrate cooccurring wintering and breeding cohorts among species of Sierra-finches (Phrygilus) in the park; such assemblages and dynamics are reminiscent of North American Mediterranean avian assemblages and pose interesting ecological comparisons. In this period of surveys there appears to have been a gradual transition of the avifauna that may be a response to anthropogenic influence and/or climate change. Research on the foraging behavior of 2 insectivorous species indicate that one of these is convergent on better-known North American taxa while the other clearly is not; these efforts suggest useful avenues for further comparative research. A remarkable coevolutionary association between the Chilean Mockingbird (Mimus thence) and endoparasitic mistletoes (Tristerix) provides insight into potential convergent ecologies in desert regions with different evolutionary histories.
   Less than 1% of the park comprises temperate forest remnants that subsist due to extensive water input from fog. Research in these remnants has emphasized the role of habitat fragmentation on avian assemblage composition and on reproductive ecology by forest-dependent species. The avifauna here comprises a subset of that found in intact Valdivian rainforest to the south, and forest remnant size alone explains over 90% of the variation in species numbers. One species has been particularly well studied; the Thorn-tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda) is more abundant and has higher nestling survival in larger fragments. We summarize other work on stress responses and variation in song structure in this species. Finally, the role of birds in tree recruitment here has important implications in the face of a recent history of reduction in sizes of forest remnants; numerous birds consume the fruit of the dominant tree, olivillo (Aextoxicon punctatum), but they fail to promote successful recruitment because they defecate viable seeds in locations that provide poor survival of seedlings.
   Ornithological research in Chile is undergoing a modest renaissance, and while dryland avifaunas are characterized more by what is not known and has yet to be studied than by actual ecological understanding, they provide a baseline for many exciting studies ranging from natural history to the role of migration to comparative dynamics of independent lineages in North and South America.

AB Patterns in rainfall and soil water availability are considered to be the main drivers governing arid and semiarid ecosystems. While the mechanisms by which water limits aboveground net primary production has been widely explored, few long-term studies have examined interactions between precipitation, soil resources, plant communities, and soil microbial communities; these may be critical to understanding soil biogeochemical cycles and above- and belowground interactions. We capitalized on a long-term biotic manipulation (exclusion of small mammal herbivores from replicate plots) and long-term variation in rainfall to assess how precipitation, small mammals, and shrub cover act directly and interactively to influence the spatial and temporal distribution of soil microorganisms, a key first step to understanding soil biogeochemical cycles. We measured the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), soil fungi, soil bacteria, and soil physicochemical characteristics over 10 consecutive years in a semiarid thorn scrub community in north central Chile; we sampled two microhabitats (under shrub cover, and in open spaces between shrubs colonized by ephemeral plants), and in plots with or without the presence of native small mammals, the main herbivores in this environment. Annual rainfall ranged widely (11 356 mm) in this period and was the primary factor affecting abundance of AM root colonization and soil microbes. While the percentage of root length with AM was higher in dry compared to wet years, free-living soil bacteria and fungi were more abundant during wet years. All microorganisms were more abundant in the resource islands beneath the shrubs compared to open microhabitat between shrubs, although the relation between soil biota and the concentration of some particular nutrients was negative. These patterns were modulated by the presence of small mammals, which enhanced root colonization by AM fungi, particularly for ephemeral plants, but which were negatively associated with soil fungi abundance. The abundance of soil bacteria showed a more complex response to the presence of small mammals and was dependent on microhabitat and year. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil resources and the activity of small mammals are important modulators of subterranean biotic responses to rainfall, the primary factor affecting soil microbiota abundance in this semiarid ecosystem.

AB In 1989, we initiated a long-term field experiment in a semiarid thorn scrub community in north-central Chile. We posited that biotic interactions, particularly predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory assumed a primary top-down role in affecting small mammals and annual plants here. Using a multi factorial design we selectively excluded vertebrate predators (principally carnivores and raptors) and a large small mammal herbivore, the degu (Octodon degus), from replicated 0.56 ha exclosures located in a valley near the coast in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park. Evidence initially supported effects of predator exclusion on O. degus but not for other small mammals in the assemblage (e.g., Phyllotis darwini, Abrothrix olivaceus). Subsequent years of monitoring have documented that predation has temporary effects on degu numbers, but that populations of this and other small mammals are much more strongly influenced by environmental bottom-up factors (i.e., rainfall). Further, our experimental manipulation has provided no evidence for negative interspecific competition effects on numbers of any small mammal in this assemblage. Degu exclusions, however, have had negative indirect effects on exotic annuals; native annuals appear to outcompete exotics especially during drought years The effect is magnified in all-small mammal exclusions. Since about 2002, selective exclusions of lagomorphs and small mammals have resulted in changes in cover of some perennial shrubs. Also notable has been a fundamental shift in the small mammal composition following the last major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event in 2000 2002; degus now comprise a majority of small mammal biomass in the assemblage, and their numbers have become more stable and less temporally variable. This appears to have been caused by a shift in rainfall periodicity from strong interannual fluctuations in response to periodic ENSOs, to a more equitable pattern with more consistent annual rainfall. This represents one of the first documented cases of system-wide biotic phase shifts to a relatively modest change in rainfall regime. This may be indicative of ongoing climate change in the Chilean semiarid region, and we expect that further changes in the community will occur if those trends continue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A plant's compensatory performance refers to its ability to maintain or increase its reproductive output following damage. The ability of a plant to compensate depends on numerous factors including the type, severity, frequency and timing of damage, the environmental conditions and the plant's genotype. Upon apical damage, a cascade of hormonal and genetic responses often produces dramatic changes in a plant's growth, development, architecture and physiology. All else being equal, this response is largely dependent on a plant's genotype, with different regrowth patterns displayed by different genotypes of a given species. In this study, we compare the architectural and growth patterns of two Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes following apical damage. Specifically, we characterise regrowth patterns of the genotypes Columbia-4 and Landsberg erecta, which typically differ in their compensation to apical meristem removal. We report that Landsberg erecta suffered reductions in the number of stems produced, maximum elongation rate, a delay in reaching this rate, lower average rosette quality throughout the growing period, and ultimately, less aboveground dry biomass and seed production when damaged compared to undamaged control plants. Columbia-4 had no reductions in any of these measures and maintained larger rosette area when clipped relative to when unclipped. Based on the apparent influence of the rosette on these genotypes' compensatory performances, we performed a rosette removal experiment, which confirmed that the rosette contributes to compensatory performance. This study provides a novel characterisation of regrowth patterns following apical damage, with insights into those measures having the largest effect on plant performance.

AB Background Phosphorus (P), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are essential elements for plant growth and development, but their availability in soil is often limited. Intercropping contributes to increased P, Fe and Zn uptake and thereby increases yield and improves grain nutritional quality and ultimately human health. A better understanding of how intercropping leads to increased plant P, Fe and Zn availability will help to improve P-fertilizer-use efficiency and agronomic Fe and Zn biofortification.
   Scope This review synthesizes the literature on how intercropping of legumes with cereals increases acquisition of P, Fe and Zn from soil and recapitulates what is known about root-to-shoot nutrient translocation, plant-internal nutrient remobilization and allocation to grains.
   Conclusions Direct interspecific facilitation in intercropping involves below-ground processes in which cereals increase Fe and Zn bioavailability while companion legumes benefit. This has been demonstrated and verified using isotopic nutrient tracing and molecular analysis. The same methodological approaches and field studies should be used to explore direct interspecific P facilitation. Both niche complementarity and interspecific facilitation contribute to increased P acquisition in intercropping. Niche complementarity may also contribute to increased Fe and Zn acquisition, an aspect poorly understood. Interspecific mobilization and uptake facilitation of sparingly soluble P, Fe and Zn from soil, however, are not the only determinants of the concentrations of P, Fe and Zn in grains. Grain yield and nutrient translocation from roots to shoots further influence the concentrations of these nutrients in grains.

AB Descriptions of biodiversity from ecotonal regions are lacking. This knowledge gap results from the difficulty of identifying elements from both biomes/domains and the advancement of human activities that generate small forest fragments. Here it is shown that small forest fragments in an ecotonal region have species richness and abundance in line with other inventories in preserved and non-preserved areas as well as composition and structure differentiated by the presence of species from both domains. The beta diversity among fragments reflects a high turnover supported by the formation of centers of dominance among the most abundant species. Finally, functional diversity favors the group that is tolerant of a wide range of environmental variables and is associated with faunal components. The results indicate that these fragments are important from a conservation standpoint because of the intersection of elements from threatened biomes, which must be managed coherently. However, Brazilian legislation is constantly modified and still allows anthropogenic changes that prevent the persistence of species.

AB The mechanisms that allow species to evolve, coexist, compete, cooperate or become extinct are becoming always more understood. At the same time, the factors that allow species to coexist in a given time within the same environment are still debated. Many theories and hypotheses suggest that competition tends to differentiate the ecological requirements after repeated interactions and to allow the presence of many different species in the same area (i.e. biodiversity). After all, a thorough understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of biodiversity, which could somehow explain the current distribution patterns and mechanisms of coexistence, must consider the biogeographic and phylogenetic approaches. Here I propose a new graphic model that reviews the past and present, and sometimes debated, trends in biodiversity and evolutionary science, pointing out the importance of the avoidance of competition, the biological history, the endogenosymbiosis and the three-dimensionality as the main forces that structure ecosystems and allow the evolution of biological diversity. This model is an attempt to explain and summarize some of the mechanisms that underlie the current presence of the awesome number of species that currently inhabit our planet.

AB Phenology has achieved a prominent position in current scenarios of global change research given its role in monitoring and predicting the timing of recurrent life cycle events. However, the implications of phenology to environmental conservation and management remain poorly explored. Here, we present the first explicit appraisal of how phenology a multidisciplinary science encompassing biometeorology, ecology, and evolutionary biology can make a key contribution to contemporary conservation biology. We focus on shifts in plant phenology induced by global change, their impacts on species diversity and plant-animal interactions in the tropics, and how conservation efforts could be enhanced in relation to plant resource organization. We identify the effects of phenological changes and mismatches in the maintenance and conservation of mutualistic interactions, and examine how phenological research can contribute to evaluate, manage and mitigate the consequences of land-use change and other natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as fire, exotic and invasive species. We also identify cutting-edge tools that can improve the spatial and temporal coverage of phonological monitoring, from satellites to drones and digital cameras. We highlight the role of historical information in recovering long-term phenological time series, and track climate-related shifts in tropical systems. Finally, we propose a set of measures to boost the contribution of phonology to conservation science. We advocate the inclusion of phenology into predictive models integrating evolutionary history to identify species groups that are either resilient or sensitive to future climate-change scenarios, and understand how phenological mismatches can affect community dynamics, ecosystem services, and conservation over time.

AB 1. Plants evolved strategies to attract pollinators that are essential for reproduction. However, plant defence against herbivores may trade off with pollinator attraction. 2. Here, we investigated the role of inducible plant secondary metabolites in such a trade-off. Our objective was to reveal the mechanisms underlying the effects of induced plant responses to pollination and herbivory. We assessed how responses of plants to pollination and insect herbivory affect the behaviour of flower visitors. Subsequently, we investigated how the production of volatile and non-volatile compounds changes after pollination and herbivory. 3. Both herbivores and pollinators induced important phenotypic changes in flowers. Brassica nigra plants respond to pollination and herbivory with changes in the profile of volatiles and non-volatiles of their flowers. Our results show that butterflies use different cues when searching for an oviposition site or a nectar source. Pollination status influenced the behaviour of butterflies, but not that of syrphid flies. 4. We discuss the results in the context of the trade-off between defence and reproduction in plants and suggest that systemic responses to herbivores can interfere with local responses to pollination. Therefore, these responses must be addressed in an integrated way because, in nature, plants are simultaneously exposed to herbivores and pollinators.

AB 1. Climate change and deforestation are suggested to be the main drivers of decline in pollinators. Forest-dependent species are expected to be the most affected and Euglossa marianae Nemesio (Hymenoptera: Apidae), an endemic species of the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF), is believed to be declining as a consequence of human impact.
   2. Over the last 17 years, we carried out field surveys to unveil its distribution, allowing us to investigate the potential effects of global climate change on this species, from the last glacial maximum into the future, using species distribution models. Our main goals were to: (i) identify populations potentially under risk of extinction given future climate change; (ii) quantify the amount of climatically suitable and climatically stable areas for E. marianae within AF; (iii) evaluate the area that are available as natural habitat and under legal protection, in an attempt to indicate priority areas to preserve this species.
   3. The most stable areas for maintaining populations of E. marianae were located in southern Bahia and northern Espirito Santo states, a region severely affected by deforestation and with several protected areas. Climate change per se does not seem to be the major problem for E. marianae. It may constitute an indirect problem given the limited dispersal abilities of this species, however.
   4. Climatically suitable areas will probably increase southwards in the future, but the extreme fragmentation of AF adds great uncertainty as to whether the species will disperse southwards, to regions such as the 'Serra do Mar' in northeastern Sao Paulo.

AB QuestionsHow do spatial patterns of tree distribution and species co-occurrence differ between primary and secondary tropical rain forests? What signatures of ecological processes might be discerned by comparing the spatial patterns of trees between primary and secondary forest plots?
   LocationTropical rain forest vegetation, lowlands of Papua New Guinea.
   MethodsAll trees over 5cm DBH were surveyed in two non-replicated 1-ha plots situated in primary and secondary forest. Grid location, DBH, height and species identity were recorded for all surveyed trees. Analysis of the spatial pattern and the autocorrelation of tree sizes and identities were used to assess the structure of the forest found within the plots. Functions combining Ripley's K and the individual species-area relationship were applied to study the spatial distribution of trees and species diversity.
   ResultsThe spatial distribution of common species, and all stems collectively, was aggregated in the secondary forest plot but not different from random in the primary forest plot. Diameter and height were also strongly spatially auto-correlated in the secondary forest plot but not in the primary forest plot. Conspecific aggregations were more common in the secondary forest plot. Finally, the secondary forest plot was characterized by the presence of diversity-repelling species and lower diversity than the primary forest plot, where diversity-accumulating species were present.
   ConclusionsWe attribute the weaker autocorrelation of tree size in the primary forest to the development of size hierarchies throughout the course of stand aging. The conspecific aggregation and low local diversity within the secondary forest plot are likely caused by dispersal limitation during a brief period of establishment after disturbance. The higher local diversity of the primary forest can be explained by the reduction of species aggregation through increased mortality of conspecifics. This is caused by strong intraspecific competition, supporting the spatial segregation hypothesis (interspecific spatial segregation).

AB Convergent reproductive traits in non-related plants may be the result of similar environmental conditions and/or specialised interactions with pollinators. Here, we documented the pollination and reproductive biology of Bionia coriacea (Fabaceae), Esterhazya splendida (Orobanchaceae) and Ananas ananassoides (Bromeliaceae) as case studies in the context of hummingbird pollination in Cerrado, the Neotropical savanna of Central South America. We combined our results with a survey of hummingbird pollination studies in the region to investigate the recently suggested association of hummingbird pollination and self-compatibility. Plant species studied here differed in their specialisation for ornithophily, from more generalist A. ananassoides to somewhat specialist B. coriacea and E. splendida. This continuum of specialisation in floral traits also translated into floral visitor composition. Amazilia fimbriata was the most frequent pollinator for all species, and the differences in floral display and nectar energy availability among plant species affect hummingbirds' behaviour. Most of the hummingbird-pollinated Cerrado plants (60.0%, n = 20), including those studied here, were self-incompatible, in contrast to other biomes in the Neotropics. Association to more generalist, often territorial, hummingbirds, and resulting reduced pollen flow in open savanna areas may explain predominance of self-incompatibility. But it is possible that mating system is more associated with the predominance of woody hummingbird plants in the Cerrado plant assemblage than to the pollination system itself.

AB Soils are self-organized ecological systems within which organisms interact within a nested suite of discrete scales. Microorganisms form communities and physical structures at the smallest scale (microns), followed by the community of their predators organized in microfoodwebs (tens of microns), the functional domains built by ecosystem engineers (centimeters to meters), ecosystems, and landscapes. Ecosystem engineers, principally plant roots, earthworms, termites, and ants, play key roles in creating habitats for other organisms and controlling their activities through physical and biochemical processes. The biogenic, organic, and organomineral structures that they produce accumulate in the soil space to form three-dimensional mosaics of functional domains, inhabited by specific communities of smaller organisms (microfauna and mesofauna, microorganisms) that drive soil processes through specific pathways. Ecosystem engineers also produce signaling and energy-rich molecules that act as ecological mediators of biological engineering processes. Energy-rich ecological mediators may selectively activate microbial populations and trigger priming effects, resulting in the degradation, synthesis, and sequestration of specific organic substrates. Signaling molecules inform soil organisms of their producers' respective presences and change physiologies by modifying gene expression and through eliciting hormonal responses. Protection of plants against pests and diseases is largely achieved via these processes. At the highest scales, the delivery of ecosystem services emerges through the functioning of self-organized systems nested within each other. The integrity of the different subsystems at each scale and the quality of their interconnections are a precondition for an optimum and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services. Lastly, we present seven general research questions whose resolution will provide a firmer base for the proposed conceptual framework while offering new insights for sustainable use of the soil resource.

AB Assessing zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton is crucial to understand, model, and predict the structure and dynamics of pelagic communities. Our hypothesis is that phytoplankton consumption by zooplankton in freshwater lakes can be well represented by clustering phytoplankton species into morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and zooplankton species into broad taxonomic units: cladocerans, calanoid copepods, and rotifers. We characterized zooplankton potential grazing on MBFG based on an extensive literature review of experimental data including clearance and ingestion rates. Rotifers show greater potential grazing upon small-and medium-sized species (MBFG I and IV) and presented a Type III trait-based functional response. Cladocerans also show greater potential impact upon MBFG IV but a Type II response. Both groups maintained their respective feeding response regardless of the type of food available, indicating poor food selectivity. Copepods consumed different MBFGs, but a clear Type II pattern was observed when feeding on MBFGs V and VI. Prediction intervals indicated a greater variability in cladocerans' and copepods' response. This approach is a step to summarize and characterize grazing to the future quantification of ecosystem models. Further efforts should be done to include information about different larval stages and phytoplankton traits not directly related to morphology.

AB The water-holding capacity (WHC) of the understory in the headwater regions of major rivers plays an important role in both the capacity of the forest water reservoir and water quality and quantity in the butted rivers. Although forest gaps could regulate water-holding patterns in the understory by redistributing coarse woody debris (CWD), fine woody debris (FWD), non-woody debris (NWD) and understory vegetation, little information is available on the effects of forest gaps on understory WHC. Therefore, we investigated the WHCs of CWD, FWD, NWD, herbaceous vegetation, mosses, epiphytes (including fern and lichen growing on the surface of logs) and soils from the gap centre to the adjacent closed canopy in an alpine forest at the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The total WHC of the alpine forest understory components was approximately 300mm. Soil layer had the largest contribution to the total understory WHC (90%), and among the aboveground components, CWD and mosses contributed 5% and 4% to the aboveground WHC, respectively. With the exception of that of the herbaceous layer, the WHC of the forest floor increased from the gap centre to the closed canopy. Although mosses had the lowest biomass allocation on the alpine forest floor, the water-holding ratio (k) of mosses reached 485%. In conclusion, biomass is the parameter that most strongly and positively correlated with the WHC of the alpine forest understory, and forest gap formation decreases the understory WHC of alpine forest resulting from a decrease in organic soils, CWDs and mosses.

AB Rainforest restoration is an important application in today's multipurpose management of secondary forest. However, our knowledge of tree species' traits and responses to treatment is insufficient for foresters to make good decisions for sustainable management. The aim of our study was to see whether it is possible to predict tree species' responses to increased light based on species' traits, and to relate these responses to a possible pioneer-climax continuum of life history traits, also among species with presumed climax properties. We examined 33 taxa (including 19 from the dipterocarp family) replicated 20 times and randomly planted in lines over a 3 ha area in the interior of Sabah, Borneo. Four years after establishment we performed a canopy reduction treatment to increase the light conditions up to levels present in tree gaps in the forest. We created a PLS (Partial Least Square Regressions) model with the two predicted variables HGR (height growth response) and Q3 HGR (the 75 percentile of a species' HGR, interpreted as the potential HGR). The model captured 47% of the variation for the predicted variables. We found significant tree species' responses in height growth to the increased light. High specific leaf area, strong early height growth, high foliar N content, high leaved stem length and large crown were linked to fast growth, while high wood density and high foliar K content were associated with slow growth. We also found a trade-off between growth response and survival among the species. We conclude that climax tree species have specific life history adaptations along a pioneer-climax continuum, which can be predicted from species' traits. The importance of easily observed or extracted traits such as initial growth rate, specific leaf area and wood density for predicting growth suggests the possibility of fast screening of species with unknown characteristics, which could be of great value in practical forest management.

AB Climate change often induces shifts in plant functional traits. However, knowledge related to sensitivity of different functional traits and sensitive indicator representing plant growth under hydrothermal change remains unclear. Inner Mongolia grassland is predicted to be one of the terrestrial ecosystems which are most vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we analyzed the response of four zonal Stipa species (S. baicalensis, S. grandis, S. breviflora, and S. bungeana) from Inner Mongolia grassland to changing temperature (control, increased 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 degrees C), precipitation (decreased 30 and 15%, control, increased 15 and 30%) and their combined effects via climate control chambers. The relative change of functional traits in the unit of temperature and precipitation change was regarded as sensitivity coefficient and sensitive indicators were examined by pathway analysis. We found that sensitivity of the four Stipa species to changing temperature and precipitation could be ranked as follows: S. bungeana > S. grandis > S. breviflora > S. baicalensis. In particular, changes in leaf area, specific leaf area and root/shoot ratio could account for 86% of the changes in plant biomass in the four Stipa species. Also these three measurements were more sensitive to hydrothermal changes than the other functional traits. These three functional indicators reflected the combination of plant production capacity (leaf area), adaptive strategy (root/shoot ratio), instantaneous environmental effects (specific leaf area), and cumulative environmental effects (leaf area and root/shoot ratio). Thus, leaf area, specific leaf area and root/shoot ratio were chosen as sensitive indicators in response to changing temperature and precipitation for Stipa species. These results could provide the basis for predicting the influence of climate change on Inner Mongolia grassland based on the magnitude of changes in sensitive indicators.

AB Most evaluations of the effectiveness of PAs have relied on indirect estimates based on comparisons between protected and unprotected areas. Such methods can be biased when protection is not randomly assigned. We add to the growing literature on the impact of PAs by answering the following research questions: What is the impact of Chilean PAs on deforestation which occurred between 1986 and 2011? How do estimates of the impact of PAs vary when using only public land as control units? We show that the characteristics of the areas in which protected and unprotected lands are located differ significantly. To satisfactorily estimate the effects of PAs, we use matching methods to define adequate control groups, but not as in previous research. We construct control groups using separately non-protected private areas and non-protected public lands. We find that PAs avoid deforestation when using unprotected private lands as valid controls, however results show no impact when the control group is based only on unprotected public land. Different land management regimes, and higher levels of enforcement inside public lands may reduce the opportunity to add additional conservation benefits when the national systems for PAs are based on the protection of previously unprotected public lands. Given that not all PAs are established to avoid deforestation, results also admit the potential for future studies to include other outcomes including forest degradation (not just deforestation), biodiversity, wildlife, primary forests (not forests in general), among others.
