AB The latewood lignin content, maximum density and total ring width of ten consecutive annual increments were determined in treeline Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) using ultraviolet (UV) microscopy and radio-densitometry, respectively. A positive correlation between the total ring width and the mean temperature of mid-July to August was identified, as was one between the maximum density and the temperature of August-September. Lignin content in the secondary cell wall layer of the terminal latewood tracheids was positively correlated with the temperature for the period running from the beginning of September until the third week of October. It can, therefore, be concluded that lignification of the cell wall is susceptible to the influence of climatic variability, as is the case with ring width and maximum density.

TI LARGE-SCALE AND SMALL-SCALE EFFECTS OF HABITAT STRUCTURE ON RATES OF

AB Landscape ecology, predominantly a terrestrial discipline, considers the effect of large-scale (tens of meters to kilometers) spatial patterns of habitats on ecological processes such as competition, predation, and flow of energy. In this study, a landscape-ecology approach was applied to a marine soft-sediment environment to examine rates of predation and transfer of secondary production in and around vegetated habitats. Seagrass beds naturally occur in a variety of spatial configurations from patches 1-10s of meters across with interspersed unvegetated sediments (i.e., patchy coverage) to more continuous coverage with little or no bare sediment. I designed experiments to address how percent coverage of seagrass in a 100-m2 area of seafloor, and the spatial arrangement (degree of patchiness or fragmentation) of an equal area (100 m2) of vegetation affected predation (lethal) and siphon nipping (sublethal) intensity on an infaunal bivalve, Mercenaria mercenaria (hard clam). Measures of seagrass density and biomass with different percent coverage of seagrass were also made. When clams were placed in both the vegetated and unvegetated portions of the seafloor nearly twice as many clams were recovered live with 99% seagrass cover than with 23% seagrass cover, while survivorship was intermediate with 70% cover. Cropping of clam siphons from both the vegetated and unvegetated sediments was also affected by the amount of seagrass cover in a 100-m2 area of seafloor: mean adjusted siphon weights were approximately 76% heavier from the 99% seagrass cover treatment than from the 70% or 23% cover treatments. Survivorship of clams placed within an equal area of seagrass in very patchy, patchy, and continuous spatial configurations was 40% higher in the continuous seagrass treatment than in either of the two patchy treatments. This study demonstrates that transfer of secondary production in the form of predation and cropping on an infaunal organism is altered as the percent cover of seagrass changes. While large-scale changes in the amount and spatial patterning of vegetation may affect habitat utilization patterns and foraging HGLoopbehavior, increased seagrass density and biomass with increased percent coverage of seagrass limit any conclusions concerning predator foraging behavior and feeding success in response to patch shapes and sizes. Instead, local changes in seagrass characteristics provide the most compelling explanation for the observed results.

AB We investigated the selective pressures associated with the possession of wings and migration in wing-dimorphic planthoppers (Homoptera:  Delphacidae).  Both migratory (macropterous) and flightless (brachypterous) forms occur.  We found that levels of migration (% macroptery) in field populations decreased significantly as the persistence of their habitats increased.  By using phylogenetically independent contrasts between congeners, we obtained the same result, which suggests that habitat persistence has influenced levels of migration independent of common ancestry.  Also, there was a clear difference in the density-wing form response between species in temporary and persistent habitats.  Macropterous forms were triggered at lower densities for species inhabiting temporary rather than persistent habitats.  However, males of species in temporary habitats were macropterous at both low and high rearing densities; macroptery was positively density-dependent in the females of these species and in both sexes of species in persistent habitats.  Our results suggest that habitat persistence influences the migratory capability of planthoppers in two ways:  (1) by selecting for habitat escape, and (2) by dictating the availability of mates.  In persistent habitats wings are less necessary for habitat escape and they are rarely required for mate location.  As a consequence and because wings impose a reproductive penalty, flightlessness prevails.  For species in temporary habitats, wings are favored in males to locate females at low colonizing densities and are favored in both sexes at high densities for reasons of habitat escape.  We conclude that habitat persistence has played a major role in shaping patterns of migration in this group of sap-feeding herbivores.

AB In this work, we compare the resolution of V2-V3 and V3-V4 16S rRNA regions for the purposes of estimating microbial community diversity using paired-end Illumina MiSeq reads, and show that the fragment, including V2 and V3 regions, has higher resolution for lower-rank taxa (genera and species). It allows for a more precise distance-based clustering of reads into species-level OTUs. Statistically convergent estimates of the diversity of major species (defined as those that together are covered by 95% of reads) can be achieved at the sample sizes of 10000 to 15000 reads. The relative error of the Shannon index estimate for this condition is lower than 4%.

AB The insect's microbiota is well acknowledged as a "hidden" player influencing essential insect traits. The gut microbiome of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) has been shown to be highly variable between and within species, resulting in a controversy on the functional relevance of gut microbes in this insect order. Here, we aim to (i) review current knowledge on the composition of gut microbial communities across Lepidoptera and (ii) elucidate the drivers of the variability in the lepidopteran gut microbiome and provide an overview on (iii) routes of transfer and (iv) the putative functions of microbes in Lepidoptera. To find out whether Lepidopterans possess a core gut microbiome, we compared studies of the microbiome from 30 lepidopteran species. Gut bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae, Bacillaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae families were the most widespread across species, with Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, and Enterococcus being the most common genera. Several studies indicate that habitat, food plant, and age of the host insect can greatly impact the gut microbiome, which contributes to digestion, detoxification, or defense against natural enemies. We mainly focus on the gut microbiome, but we also include some examples of intracellular endosymbionts. These symbionts are present across a broad range of insect taxa and are known to exert different effects on their host, mostly including nutrition and reproductive manipulation. Only two intracellular bacteria genera (Wolbachia and Spiroplasma) have been reported to colonize reproductive tissues of Lepidoptera, affecting their host's reproduction. We explore routes of transmission of both gut microbiota and intracellular symbionts and have found that these microbes may be horizontally transmitted through the host plant, but also vertically via the egg stage. More detailed knowledge about the functions and plasticity of the microbiome in Lepidoptera may provide novel leads for the control of lepidopteran pest species.

AB Although the ecosystem services provided by mountain grasslands have been demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to environmental and management changes in the past, it remains unclear how they will be affected in the face of a combination of further land-use/cover changes and accelerating climate change. Moreover, the resilience of ecosystem services has not been sufficiently analysed under future scenarios. This study aimed to assess future impacts on multiple mountain grassland ecosystem services and their resilience. For a study area in the Central Alps (Stubai Valley, Austria), six ecosystem services were quantified using plant trait-based models for current and future conditions (in 2050 and 2100) considering three socio-economic scenarios. Under all scenarios, the greatest changes in ecosystem services were related to the natural reforestation of abandoned grassland, causing a shift from grassland to forest services. Although the high resilience potential of most ecosystem services will be maintained in the future, climate change seems to have negative impacts, especially on the resilience of forage production. Thus, decision makers and farmers will be faced with the higher vulnerability of ecosystem services of mountain grassland. Future policies should consider both socio-economic and environmental dynamics to manage valuable ecosystem services. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Global temperature is a fundamental climate metric highly correlated with sea level, which implies that keeping shorelines near their present location requires keeping global temperature within or close to its preindustrial Holocene range. However, global temperature excluding short-term variability now exceeds +1(circle)C relative to the 1880-1920 mean and annual 2016 global temperature was almost +1.3(circle)C. We show that global temperature has risen well out of the Holocene range and Earth is now as warm as it was during the prior (Eemian) interglacial period, when sea level reached 6-9m higher than today. Further, Earth is out of energy balance with present atmospheric composition, implying that more warming is in the pipeline, and we show that the growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. The rapidity of ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difficult to predict, but is dependent on the magnitude of warming. Targets for limiting global warming thus, at minimum, should aim to avoid leaving global temperature at Eemian or higher levels for centuries. Such targets now require "negative emissions", i.e., extraction of CO2 from the air. If phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins soon, improved agricultural and forestry practices, including reforestation and steps to improve soil fertility and increase its carbon content, may provide much of the necessary CO2 extraction. In that case, the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion above the natural range of the current interglacial (Holocene) could be limited and irreversible climate impacts could be minimized. In contrast, continued high fossil fuel emissions today place a burden on young people to undertake massive technological CO2 extraction if they are to limit climate change and its consequences. Proposed methods of extraction such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or air capture of CO2 have minimal estimated costs of USD 89-535 trillion this century and also have large risks and uncertain feasibility. Continued high fossil fuel emissions unarguably sentences young people to either a massive, implausible cleanup or growing deleterious climate impacts or both.

AB Research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has demonstrated links between plant diversity and ecosystem functions such as productivity(1,2). At other trophic levels, the plant microbiome has been shown to influence host plant fitness and function(3,4), and host-associated microbes have been proposed to influence ecosystem function through their role in defining the extended phenotype of host organisms(5,6) However, the importance of the plant microbiome for ecosystem function has not been quantified in the context of the known importance of plant diversity and traits. Here, using a tree biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment, we provide strong support for the hypothesis that leaf bacterial diversity is positively linked to ecosystem productivity, even after accounting for the role of plant diversity. Our results also show that host species identity, functional identity and functional diversity are the main determinants of leaf bacterial community structure and diversity. Our study provides evidence of a positive correlation between plant-associated microbial diversity and terrestrial ecosystem productivity, and a new mechanism by which models of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships can be improved.

AB Almost 30 y ago, the field of intraspecific phylogeography laid the foundation for spatially explicit and genealogically informed studies of population divergence. With new methods and markers, the focus in phylogeography shifted to previously unrecognized geographic genetic variation, thus reducing the attention paid to phenotypic variation in those same diverging lineages. Although phenotypic differences among lineages once provided the main data for studies of evolutionary change, the mechanisms shaping phenotypic differentiation and their integration with intraspecific genetic structure have been underexplored in phylogeographic studies. However, phenotypes are targets of selection and play important roles in species performance, recognition, and diversification. Here, we focus on three questions. First, how can phenotypes elucidate mechanisms underlying concordant or idiosyncratic responses of vertebrate species evolving in shared landscapes? Second, what mechanisms underlie the concordance or discordance of phenotypic and phylogeographic differentiation? Third, how can phylogeography contribute to our understanding of functional phenotypic evolution? We demonstrate that the integration of phenotypic data extends the reach of phylogeography to explain the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Finally, we stress the importance of natural history collections as sources of high-quality phenotypic data that span temporal and spatial axes.

AB Recent efforts to evaluate the contribution of neonicotinoid insecticides to worldwide pollinator declines have focused on honey bees and the chronic levels of exposure experienced when foraging on crops grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds. However, few studies address non-crop plants as a potential route of pollinator exposure to neonicotinoid and other insecticides. Here we show that pollen collected by honey bee foragers in maize- and soybean-dominated landscapes is contaminated throughout the growing season with multiple agricultural pesticides, including the neonicotinoids used as seed treatments. Notably, however, the highest levels of contamination in pollen are pyrethroid insecticides targeting mosquitoes and other nuisance pests. Furthermore, pollen from crop plants represents only a tiny fraction of the total diversity of pollen resources used by honey bees in these landscapes, with the principle sources of pollen originating from non-cultivated plants. These findings provide fundamental information about the foraging habits of honey bees in these landscapes.

AB The reconstruction of a species tree from genomic data faces a double hurdle. First, the (gene) tree describing the evolution of each gene may differ from the species tree, for instance, due to incomplete lineage sorting. Second, the aligned genetic sequences at the leaves of each gene tree provide merely an imperfect estimate of the topology of the gene tree. In this note, we demonstrate formally that a basic statistical problem arises if one tries to avoid accounting for these two processes and analyses the genetic data directly via a concatenation approach. More precisely, we show that, under the multispecies coalescent with a standard site substitution model, maximum likelihood estimation on sequence data that has been concatenated across genes and performed under the incorrect assumption that all sites have evolved independently and identically on a fixed tree is a statistically inconsistent estimator of the species tree. Our results provide a formal justification of simulation results described of Kubatko and Degnan (2007) and others, and complements recent theoretical results by DeGlorgio and Degnan (2010) and Chifman and Kubtako (2014).

AB Biodiversity conflicts, and human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) in particular, are predicted to increase. Understanding drivers of these conflicts is a prerequisite for developing strategies to achieve conservation goals. People are a part of all HWC problems meaning social research methods are essential for finding solutions. We conducted a meta-analysis of the variables predicted to drive attitudes of people living in areas with damage causing carnivores, ungulates, elephants and primates so as to determine if common patterns of variables are present across a wide range of contexts. We categorized variables reported in publications into main and sub-categories and developed three indexes to describe relative frequency of category use, relative significance of categories and degree of accuracy between use and significance. From 45 suitable publications, 16 main categories and 17 sub-categories were identified. The majority of publications measured variables with a low likelihood of explaining drivers of HWC, or did not quantify variables of generally high utility. For example, only four categories (25%) were applied in over 50% of publications, and two thirds were mostly not significant in explaining attitudes. Tangible costs and tangible benefits thought to be the main drivers of attitudes were respectively, two and three times more nonsignificant than significant. Intangible costs however were the most important category to explain attitudes but was under represented in publications. Intangible benefits were mostly not important in explaining attitudes. Costs were more significant than benefits suggesting negative perceptions more strongly determine attitudes. Other important categories were exposure and experience with a species, stakeholder types and legal status of land. Socio-demographic variables commonly used in published studies such as gender, education and wealth, poorly explained attitudes. We conclude that greater conceptual clarity is urgently required to guide future attitude studies so that research can reliably inform the development of species management plans and policies.

AB Theory predicts shifts in the magnitude and direction of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function (BEF) over succession, but this theory remains largely untested. We studied the relationship between aboveground tree biomass dynamics (biomass) and multiple dimensions of biodiversity over 8-16years in eight successional rainforests. We tested whether successional changes in diversity-biomass correlations reflect predictions of niche theories. Diversity-biomass correlations were positive early but weak later in succession, suggesting saturation of niche space with increasing diversity. Early in succession, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity in two leaf traits exhibited the strongest positive correlations with biomass, indicating complementarity or positive selection effects. In mid-successional stands, high biodiversity was associated with greater mortality-driven biomass loss, i.e. negative selection effects, suggesting successional niche trade-offs and loss of fast-growing pioneer species. Our results demonstrate that BEF relationships are dynamic across succession, thus successional context is essential to understanding BEF in a given system.

AB Molecular studies have been instrumental for refining species boundaries in the coral genus Pocillopora and revealing hidden species diversity within the extensively studied global species Pocillopora damicornis. Here we formally revise the taxonomic status of species closely related to and within the P.damicornis species complex, taking into account both genetic evidence and new data on morphometrics, including fine-scale corallite and coenosteum structure. We found that mitochondrial molecular phylogenies are congruent with groups based on gross-morphology, therefore reflecting species-level differentiation. However, high levels of gross morphological plasticity and shared morphological characteristics mask clear separation for some groups. Fine-scale morphological variation, particularly the shape and type of columella, was useful for differentiating between clades and provides an excellent signature of the evolutionary relationships among genetic lineages. As introgressive hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting complicate the delineation of species within the genus on the basis of a single species concept, the Unified Species Concept may represent a suitable approach in revising Pocillopora taxonomy. Eight species are herein described (P.damicornis, P.acuta, P.aliciae, P.verrucosa, P.meandrina, P.eydouxi, P.cf. brevicornis), including a novel taxon - Pocillopora bairdi sp. nov.

AB 1. Stream managers need to understand relationships between multiple stressors and ecological responses. We examined responses of benthic invertebrates and algae along two land-use-related stressor gradients of concern in running waters. Our correlative study of the consequences of augmented deposited fine sediment and nutrient concentrations was conducted in a regional set of streams and rivers monitored by a water management authority in New Zealand and incorporated a wide range of catchment geologies and stream orders.
   2. We used multiple linear regression analysis and an information-theoretic approach to select the best predictive models for our biological response variables by testing multiple competing hypotheses that include nonlinear subsidy-stress relationships and interactive effects between the two stressors.
   3. Patterns consistent with a subsidy-stress response to increasing dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration were found for the relative abundances of the common invertebrate genera Pycnocentrodes and Deleatidium and for the relative abundance of total individuals in the EPT orders (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera).
   4. Fine sediment seemed the more pervasive stressor, apparently counteracting and overwhelming any initial subsidy effect of increased nutrients, and accounting for more of the variance in biological response variables. Relationships with high nutrient concentrations were weaker and modelled with less certainty, probably reflecting the indirect modes of action of nutrients compared to those underlying sediment effects. Nevertheless, in several cases, the models indicated that nutrients interacted synergistically with fine sediment, lending further weight to the conclusion that managers need to address both stressors to achieve the best outcomes.

AB P>It is well known that species evolutionary history plays a crucial role in community assembly. Here, we offer a formal analytical framework to integrate in metacommunity analysis the species' phylogeny with their functional traits and abundances. We define phylogenetic structure of a community as phylogenetically weighted species composition. This is used to reveal patterns of phylogenetic community variation and to measure and test by specified null models the phylogenetic signal at the metacommunity level, which we distinguish from phylogenetic signal at the species pool level. The former indicates that communities more similar in their phylogenetic structure are also similar in their average trait values, which may indicate species' niche conservation for the given traits. We apply this framework to an example from grassland communities and find that traits with significant phylogenetic signal at the metacommunity level exhibit ecological filtering along the resource gradient, but since both mechanisms act independently on traits, niche conservatism is not supported.

AB Wood production varies substantially with resource availability, and the variation in wood production can result from several mechanisms: increased photosynthesis, and changes in partitioning of photosynthesis to wood production, belowground flux, foliage production or respiration. An understanding of the mechanistic basis for patterns in wood production within a stand and across landscapes requires a complete annual carbon budget. We measured annual carbon flows to wood production, foliage production and total belowground carbon flux (the sum of root production, root respiration, and mycorrhizal production and respiration) from ages three to five years in clonal Eucalyptus plantations at four sites in Brazil to test if fertility, water availability and stand structure changed wood production and by what mechanism. We also quantified the patterns in light interception and the efficiency of light use to provide additional mechanistic insights into growth responses and to determine if light-use efficiency was related to changes in flux and partitioning.
   The routine level of forest fertilization at these four sites was high enough that further increases in nutrient supply did not increase wood growth. Irrigation increased wood net primary productivity (age three to five) from 1.45 to 1.84 kg m(-2) year of C (27%), because of increases in light interception (5%), photosynthetic efficiency (from 0.028 to 0.031 mol C/mol photons absorbed, 11%), gross primary productivity (from 3.62 to 4.28 m(-2) year(-1) of C, 18%), and partitioning to wood (from 0.397 to 0.430 of photosynthesis, 8%). These changes increased light-use efficiency by 20%. Annual flux belowground varied among sites from 0.43 to 1.0 m(-2) year(-1) of C but did not vary with water availability. Across the four sites for the irrigated and unirrigated treatments, light-use efficiency was positively correlated with gross primary productivity and partitioning to wood production. Increasing heterogeneity of stand structure (resulting from staggered timing of planting within plots) led to a 14% loss in wood biomass relative to uniform stand structure at age six. Light-use efficiency, gross primary productivity, and wood net primary productivity were lower, but not significantly so, in heterogeneous compared to uniform stands. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The increase of biodiversity from poles to equator is one of the most pervasive features of nature. For 2 centuries since von Humboldt, Wallace, and Darwin, biogeographers and ecologists have investigated the environmental and historical factors that determine the latitudinal gradient of species diversity, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The recently proposed metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) aims to explain ecological patterns and processes, including geographical patterns of species richness, in terms of the effects of temperature and body size on the metabolism of organisms. Here we use 2 comparable databases of tree distributions in eastern Asia and North America to investigate the roles of environmental temperature and spatial scale in shaping geographical patterns of species diversity. We find that number of species increases exponentially with environmental temperature as predicted by the MTE, and so does the rate of spatial turnover in species composition (slope of the species-area relationship). The magnitude of temperature dependence of species richness increases with spatial scale. Moreover, the relationship between species richness and temperature is much steeper in eastern Asia than in North America: in cold climates at high latitudes there are more tree species in North America, but the reverse is true in warmer climates at lower latitudes. These patterns provide evidence that the kinetics of ecological and evolutionary processes play a major role in the latitudinal pattern of biodiversity.

AB Sperm competition is now recognised as a potent selective force shaping many male reproductive traits. While the influence of sperm competition on sperm number is widely accepted, its effects upon sperm size remain controversial. It had been traditionally assumed that there is a trade-off between sperm number and sperm size, so that an increase in sperm number would result in a decrease in sperm size, under conditions of sperm competition. Contrary to this prediction, we proposed some time ago that sperm competition favours an increase in sperm size, because longer sperm swim faster and are more likely to win the race to fertilize ova. Comparative studies between species show that in many taxa such a relationship exists, but the consequences of an increase in sperm size may vary between taxa depending on the environment in which spermatozoa have to compete. We present new evidence showing that in mammals longer sperm swim at higher speeds. We also show that mean swimming speed is highly correlated with maximum swimming speed, so even if the fastest swimming sperm are more likely to fertilize, both measures are informative. When individuals of the same species are compared, ratios between the dimensions of different sperm components, as well as the shape of the head, seem better at explaining sperm swimming velocity. Finally, we show that mean and maximum sperm swimming speed determine male fertility. Other studies have shown that in competitive contexts, males with faster swimming sperm have higher fertilization success. We conclude that the available evidence supports our original hypothesis.

AB The development of stable isotope techniques is one of the main methodological advances in ecology of the last decades of the 20th century. Many biogeochemical processes are accompanied by changes in the ratio between stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (C-12/C-13 and N-14/N-15), which allows different ecosystem components and different ecosystems to be distinguished by their isotopic composition. Analysis of isotopic composition makes it possible to trace matter and energy flows through biological systems and to evaluate the rate of many ecological processes. The main concepts and methods of stable isotope ecology and patterns of stable isotope fractionation during organic matter decomposition are considered with special emphasis on the fractionation of isotopes in food chains and the use of stable isotope studies of trophic relationships between soil animals in the field.

AB Allee effects can play a critical role in slowing or preventing the establishment of low density founder populations of non-indigenous species. Similarly, the spread of established invaders into new habitats can be influenced by the degree to which small founder populations ahead of the invasion front are suppressed through Allee effects. We develop an approach to use empirical data on the gypsy moth, a non-indigenous invader in North America, to quantify the Allee threshold across geographical regions, and we report that the strength of the Allee effect is subject to spatial and temporal variability. Moreover, we present what is to our knowledge the first empirical evidence that geographical regions with higher Allee thresholds are associated with slower speeds of invasion.

AB Many animal signals are performed in a highly redundant manner as in some bird species where males sing several renditions of one song type before switching to another. However, differences in signal redundancy between contexts and between individuals are only poorly understood. We found that chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) in noisier areas (i.e., close to waterfalls and torrents) sang longer bouts of the same song type before switching to a new type, suggesting that they use increased serial redundancy to get the message across in noisy conditions. This is the first evidence of a noise-dependent adjustment of signal redundancy in a songbird. In addition, we found that song types with faster trills were sung in shorter bouts suggesting that the performance of highly redundant song series is probably limited by motor constraints. Thus, in noisy environments, serial redundancy in bird song may reflect a trade-off between successful signal transmission and preventing motor fatigue.

AB Changes in anatomy, sclerophylly, pressure-volume relationships, chemical composition and oxidative stress symptoms were studied in leaves of three Olea europaea L. cultivars (Cobrancosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana), submitted to contrasting water availability regimes. Anatomically, Cobrancosa and Madural were more capable than Verdeal Transmontana to cope with low water (LW) availability, with a thicker upper epidermis, a thicker palisade parenchyma and a higher stomatal density. Cobrancosa leaves also revealed the lowest specific leaf area and the highest density of the foliar tissue. Under LW conditions, Cobrancosa and Madural showed greater capability for osmotic adjustment and increased tissue rigidity. By contrast, Verdeal Transmontana did not exhibit osmotic adjustment, but was able to increase tissue elasticity and total soluble protein concentration. Leaves grown under LW conditions revealed signs of oxidative stress, with decreases in chlorophyll, carotenoid and total thiol concentrations and increased levels of lipid peroxidation. Nevertheless, LW plants developed some defense mechanisms against oxidative stress, like the increase in total phenol and total soluble protein concentrations. Comparatively, Cobrancosa revealed more protection against oxidative stress. In opposition, the increased levels of lipid peroxidation and the decreased total thiol concentration under LW conditions suggest that the mechanisms against oxidative stress were less effective in Madural.

AB Although the function of ornamental traits in males has been the focus of intensive research for decades, expression of such traits in females has received much less study. Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) display structurally based ultraviolet/blue and melanin-based chestnut plumage, and in males this plumage coloration is related to both reproductive success and competitive ability. Compared to males, female bluebirds show a subdued expression of blue and chestnut ornamental coloration, and we used a combination of an aviary nutritional- stress experiment and four years of field data to test the hypothesis that coloration functions as a signal of female quality. First, we tested the effect of food intake on expression of structural and melanin coloration in female eastern bluebirds to determine whether structural or melanin coloration are condition-dependent traits. Females that were given ad libitum access to food displayed more ornamented structural coloration than females on a food-restricted diet, but there was no effect of the experiment on melanin ornamentation. Second, we used field data to assess whether female ornamentation correlated with measures of mate quality and parental effort. The structural coloration of females predicted first egg date, maternal provisioning rates, and measures of reproductive success. These data indicate that structural coloration is dependent on nutritional condition and suggest that sexual selection is acting on structurally based plumage coloration in female eastern bluebirds.

AB The question we address in this article is how hybridization in the recent past can be detected in recently evolved species. Such species may not have evolved genetic incompatibilities and may hybridize with little or no fitness loss. Hybridization can be recognized by relatively small genetic differences between sympatric populations because sympatric populations have the opportunity to interbreed whereas allopatric populations do not. Using microsatellite DNA data from Darwin's finches in the Galapagos archipelago, we compare sympatric and allopatric genetic distances in pairs of Geospiza and Camarhynchus species. In agreement with the hybridization hypothesis, we found a statistically strong tendency for a species to be more similar genetically to a sympatric relative than to allopatric populations of that relative. Hybridization has been studied directly on two islands, but it is evidently more widespread in the archipelago. We argue that introgressive hybridization may have been a persistent feature of the adaptive radiation through most of its history, facilitating evolutionary diversification and occasionally affecting both the speed and direction of evolution.

AB Conservation biologists and other environmentalists confront five obstacles in building support for regulatory policies that seek to exclude or remove introduced plants and other non-native species that threaten to harm natural areas or the natural environment. First, the concept of ``harm to the natural environment'' is nebulous and undefined. Second, ecologists cannot predict how introduced species will behave in natural ecosystems. If biologists cannot de. ne ``harm'' or predict the behavior of introduced species, they must target all non-native species as potentially ``harmful,'' an impossibly large regulatory task. Third, loss of species richness may constitute harm to an environment, but introduced organisms typically, generally, and significantly add to species richness in ecosystems. If species richness correlates with desirable ecosystem properties, moreover, such as stability and productivity, as some ecologists believe, then introduced organisms, by increasing species richness, would support those desirable properties. Fourth, one may plausibly argue that extinction constitutes environmental harm, but there is no evidence that non-native species, especially plants, are significant causes of extinction, except for predators in certain lakes and other small island-like environments. Fifth, while aesthetic, ethical, and spiritual values may provide a legitimate basis for invasive species policy, biologists often cite concepts such as ``biodiversity'' and ecosystem ``health'' or ``integrity'' to provide a scientific justification. To assert that non-native species threaten biodiversity or undermine ecosystem health, however, may be to draw conceptual entailments or consequences from definitions of ``biodiversity'' and ``integrity'' that arbitrarily exclude non-native species or make the presence of exotic species a per se indicator of decline.

AB An important goal of invasion biology is to identify physical and environmental characteristics that may make a region particularly receptive to invasions. The inland waters of California (USA) are highly invaded, particularly by fishes, although there is wide variation in numbers of normative fishes across the state's watersheds. Here we examine patterns of fish invasions in California watersheds and their associations with natural environmental characteristics, native fish diversity, and various measures of human habitat disturbance. Our analysis is based on an extensive data set on the distribution of freshwater fishes across California's watersheds and on GIS land-use coverages for the entire state. We used canonical correspondence analysis to examine associations between environmental characteristics and the distributions of both native and normative fish species. We then employed an information-theoretic model-selection approach to rank hypothesized models derived from the fish invasion literature with regard to how well they predicted numbers of normative fishes in California watersheds. Our results indicate that pervasive, anthropogenic, landscape-level changes (particularly the extent of urban development, small-scale water diversions, aqueducts, and agriculture) influenced spatial patterns of invasion. In addition, we find that deliberately stocked fishes have different habitat associations, including a strong association with the presence of dams, than other introduced fishes. In our analysis, watersheds with the most native species also contain the most normative species. We find no evidence that existing watershed protection helps to prevent fish invasions in California, but we suggest that restoration of natural hydrologic processes may reduce invasion impacts.

AB Sexual adornments often vary markedly across a species' range, which presumably is owing to differences in local environmental conditions and the associated selection pressures, such as natural versus sexual selection or the relative signaling value of different ornamental traits. However, there are only a few reported examples in which the information content of mating signals varies geographically, and even fewer in which a set of secondary sexual traits serves different signaling functions in different populations. Classic studies of sexual selection in the European barn swallow (Hirundo rustica rustica) demonstrate that elongate tail-streamers provide several reproductive advantages to males and females and are used as reliable signals of mate quality. Here, we show that tail-streamers do not appear to confer these same benefits in a population of barn swallows from North America (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster). Instead, ventral plumage coloration, which is more exaggerated in North American swallows compared with their European counterparts, predicts patterns of assortative mating and annual reproductive success in H. r. erythrogaster. These observations support the idea that ornamental traits can serve different functions among animal populations and suggest that geographic variation in different sexual signals may facilitate population divergence, which may ultimately lead to speciation.

AB Medical research is increasingly focusing on the contribution of nutritional programming to disease in later life. Programming is a process whereby a stimulus during a critical window of time permanently affects subsequent structure, function or developmental schedule of the organism. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis is widely used to interpret such studies, with early growth restriction seen as adaptation to environmental deprivation. However, such permanent adjustment is less beneficial than maintaining flexibility so as to recover from early growth deficits if the environment improves. Thus, the existing thrifty phenotype hypothesis fails to explain why plasticity is lost so early in development in species with extended growth. One explanation is that the developing organism simply cannot maintain phenotypic plasticity throughout the period of organ growth. This article adds a life history perspective, arguing that programming of the offspring may in some species benefit maternal fitness more than it does that of individual offspring. Closing the critical window early in development allows the preservation of maternal strategy in offspring phenotype, which in humans benefits the mother by constraining offspring demand after weaning. The offspring gains by being buffered against environmental fluctuations during the most sensitive period of development, allowing coherent adaptation of organ growth to the state of the environment. The critical window is predicted to close when offspring physiology becomes independent of maternal physiology, the timing of which depends on offspring trait. Because placental nutrition and lactation buffer against short-term environmental fluctuations, maternal strategy is predicted to derive from long-term experience, encapsulated in maternal size and nutritional status. Such an approach implies that public health programmes for improving birth weight may be more effective if they target maternal development rather than nutrition during pregnancy. Equally, aggressive nutritional management of infants born small or pre-term may induce the very environmental fluctuations that are naturally softened by maternal nutrition.

AB Invasions of nonindigenous species have caused ecological devastation to natural communities worldwide, yet the biological bases for invasiveness remain poorly understood. Our studies of invasive watermilfoil (Myriophyllum) populations revealed widespread polymorphisms in biparentally inherited nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences, which were not detected in populations of native North American species. Subclones of the polymorphic regions revealed the occurrence of distinct sequences matching those acquired from both nonindigenous and native North American species. Molecular data demonstrate clearly that invasive watermilfoil populations in North America have resulted from hybridization between nonindigenous and native species. These observations suggest that invasiveness in these aggressive aquatic weeds may be linked to heterosis maintained by vegetative propagation.

AB The impact of regional factors (such as speciation or dispersal) on the species richness in local communities (S-L) has received increasing attention. A prominent method to infer the impact of regional factors is the comparison of species richness in local assemblages (S-L) with the total number of species in the region (S-R). Linear relations between S-R and S-L have been interpreted as an indication of strong regional influence and weak influence of interactions within local communities. We propose that two aspects bias the outcome of such comparisons: (1) the spatial scale of local and regional sampling, and (2) the body size of the organisms. The impact of the local area reflects the scales of ecological interactions, whereas the ratio between local and regional area reflects the inherent moment of autocorrelation. A proposed impact of body size on the relation is based on the high dispersal and high abundance of small organisms. We predict strongest linearity between S-R and S-L for large organisms, for large local areas (less important ecological interactions) and for sampling designs where the local habitat area covers a high proportion of the regional area (more important autocorrelation). We conducted a meta-analysis on 63 relations obtained from the literature. As predicted, the linearity of the relationship between S-L and S-R increased with the proportion of local to regional sampling area. In contrast, neither the body size of the organisms nor the local area itself was significantly related to the relation between S-L and S-R. This indicated that ecological interactions played a minor role in the shape of local to regional richness plots, which instead was mainly influenced by the sampling design. We found that the studies published so far were highly biased towards larger organisms and towards high similarity between the local and regional area. The proposed prevalence of linear relationships may thus be an artefact and plots of S-L to S-R are not a suitable tool with which to infer the strength of local interactions.

AB While exotic plant species often come to dominate disturbed communities, long-term patterns of invasion are poorly known. Here we present data from 40 yr of continuous vegetation sampling, documenting the temporal distribution of exotic plant species in old field succession. The relative cover of exotic species decreased with time since abandonment, with significant declines occurring greater than or equal to 20 yr post-abandonment. The number of exotic species per plot also declined with time since abandonment while field-scale richness of exotics did not change. This suggests displacement occurring at small spatial scales. Life history types changed from short-lived herbaceous species to long-lived woody species for both native and exotic plant species. However, shrubs and lianas dominated woody cover of exotic plants while trees dominated native woody cover. The species richness of exotic and native species was positively correlated at most times. In abandoned hay fields, however, the proportion of exotic plant cover per plot was inversely related to total species richness. This relationship suggests that it is not the presence, but the abundance of exotic species that may cause a reduction in community diversity. While the development of closed-canopy forest appears to limit most introduced plant species, several shade-adapted exotic species are increasing within the fields. These invasions may cause a reversal of the patterns seen in the first 40 yr of succession and may result in further impacts on community structure.

AB Atlantic cod Gadus morhua is an extremely important fish in the northern hemisphere with respect to culture, economics, and ecology. However, the effects of over-fishing, environmental change, fish community dynamics and other factors that have altered the trophic ecology of cod are not well understood. We present an analysis of the trophic patterns of cod in the northeast US shelf ecosystem from a 25 yr time series of food habits data. Additionally, we compared the diet of this species with the spatio-temporal distribution of its prey species and evaluated prey preference over time. Atlantic cod exhibit an omnivorous diet; we assessed the temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic trends in this diet by examination of >15 000 stomachs. Ontogenetic shifts in diet were observed; early juveniles consumed more pelagic than benthic invertebrates, medium cod consumed benthic invertebrates and fish, and larger cod consumed larger amounts of fish. Cannibalism also increased with ontogeny. Diet shifted significantly over a period of 3 decades, concurrent with changes in forage species abundance and distribution. Most of the major prey species were eaten in periods when they had high spatio-temporal overlap with cod and were abundant, indicating opportunistic feeding by cod, Similar to many other ecosystems, cod prefer sand lance, Cancer spp. crabs and herring, regardless of the abundance or spatio-temporal overlap with these prey species, It is unclear whether the observed changes in the trophic dynamics of cod have broad implications for cod populations, yet the evidence does suggest that cod are not likely to influence the abundance and distribution of their prey populations in this ecosystem.

AB 1. Positive relationships between the density and distribution of species in taxonomic assemblages are well documented, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Two factors that are expected to be important in explaining variation in these relationships are the spatial scale of analysis and the relative mobility of the study species.
   2. We examined density-distribution relationships in British butterflies at a variety of spatial scales. Distributions were proportions of grid squares occupied: 50 m grid within 0.25 km(2) areas (local), 500 m grid in 35 km(2) (regional), 10 km grid across England, Wales and Scotland (national), 153 000 km(2) grid squares across Europe (European), and also seven categories of international distribution (Global; 1 = European endemic to 7 = in 5 + continents). Densities were measured using transect counts at local, regional and national scales.
   3. Different relationships between density and distribution occurred at different scales of analysis. When we controlled for the effects of mobility and /or phylogenetic association, a positive relationship between density and distribution was apparent at local, regional and national scales. Species' national densities in Britain were positively correlated with their European distribution sizes, but significantly negatively correlated with their global range sizes.
   4. Butterfly mobility had a positive effect on distribution and a negative effect on density at all spatial scales. For a given total abundance, more mobile species had lower densities but wider distributions, i.e. they were less aggregated than more sedentary species.
   5. The decreasing strength of the density-distribution correlation, and the eventual reversal of the pattern, with the increasing magnitude of difference between the scale at which density was measured relative to distribution, suggests that some element of niche may be important in determining densities and distributions. However, the measure of niche breadth analysed did not explain significant variation in density distribution, or in the density-distribution relationship.

AB The lowest photon flux density of photosynthetically active radiation at which O-2-evolving marine photolithotrophs appear to be able to grow is some 10 nmol photon m(-2) s-(1), while marine non-O-2-evolvers can grow at 4 nmol photon m(-2) s(-1), in both cases with the photon flux density averaged over the 24 hour L:D cycle. Constraints on the ability to grow at very low fluxes of photosynthetically active radiation fall into three categories. Category one includes essential processes whose efficiency is independent of the rate of energy input, but whose catalysts show phylogenetic variation leading to different energy costs for a given process in different taxa, e.g light-harvesting complexes, RUBISCO and probably in the sensitivity of PsII to photodamage. The second category comprises essential processes whose efficiency decreases with decreasing energy input rate as a result of back-reactions independent of the energy input rate, e.g. charge recombination following charge separation by PsII and short-circuit H+ fluxes across the thylakoid membrane which decrease the fraction of pumped H+ which can be used in adenosine diphosphate phosphorylation. Category two also includes that component of protein turnover which cannot be related to replacement of polypeptides which were incorrectly assembled following uncorrected errors of transcription or translation! or which were damaged by processes whose rate increases with increasing energy input rate such as photodamage to PsII. The third category includes only O-2-dependent damage to the D1 protein of PsII whose rate increases with a decreasing incident flux of photosynthetically active radiation. Processes in categories two and three are most likely to impose the lower limit on the photon flux density which can support photolithotrophic growth. The available literature, mainly on organisms which are not adapted to growth at very low photon flux densities, suggests that three major limitations (charge recombination in PsII, H+ leakage and slippage, and protein turnover) can individually impose lower limits in excess of 20 nmol photon m(-2) s(-1) on photolithotrophic growth. Furthermore, these three limitations are interactive, so that considering all three processes acting in series leads to an even higher predicted lower photon flux density limit for photolithotrophic growth.

AB Permanent plots in old-growth hemlock-northern hardwood forests of Michigan's upper peninsula have been remeasured over periods of 16-32 yr. A gradient from hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) to sugar maple (Acer saccharum) dominance is associated with increasing soil pH and calcium. Secondary species include yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and basswood (Tilia americana). From 1962 to 1994 hemlock increased in basal area and dominance in most plots. Sugar maple showed little overall change, while basswood and especially yellow birch showed sporadic but often large declines in basal area. Birch populations declined due to lack of recruitment, and sugar maple and basswood may be subject to similar decline; only hemlock showed a fairly stable size structure. Mortality rates were lowest for hemlock (0.3%/yr) and highest for yellow birch (1.6%/yr), corresponding to canopy residence times of 357 and 61 yr, respectively. Stem maps allowed assessment of neighborhood influences on growth and mortality. Growth and mortality rates were negatively correlated for all species. Growth rate was influenced by tree size and site conditions for all species, but hemlock and sugar maple growth rates were also affected by size- and distance-weighted indices of neighbor influence. Old-growth stands several centuries old continue to undergo compositional change related to both stand history and current population interactions. Yellow birch and basswood are probably maintained by significant disturbances and will decline under a disturbance regime of small gaps. Hemlock may be the ultimate competitive dominant in most sites but may require well over a millennium without major disturbance to displace sugar maple.

AB For over 40 y the dominant theory of stomatal behavior has been that plants should open stomates until the carbon gained by an infinitesimal additional opening balances the additional water lost times a water price that is constant at least over short periods. This theory has persisted because of its remarkable success in explaining strongly supported simple empirical models of stomatal conductance, even though we have also known for over 40 y that the theory is not consistent with competition among plants for water. We develop an alternative theory in which plants maximize carbon gain without pricing water loss and also add two features to both this and the classical theory, which are strongly supported by empirical evidence: (i) water flow through xylem that is progressively impaired as xylem water potential drops and (ii) fitness or carbon costs associated with low water potentials caused by a variety of mechanisms, including xylem damage repair. We show that our alternative carbon-maximization optimization is consistent with plant competition because it yields an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS)-species with the ESS stomatal behavior that will outcompete all others. We further show that, like the classical theory, the alternative theory also explains the functional forms of empirical stomatal models. We derive ways to test between the alternative optimization criteria by introducing a metric-the marginal xylem tension efficiency, which quantifies the amount of photosynthesis a plant will forego from opening stomatal an infinitesimal amount more to avoid a drop in water potential.

AB In recent years the human microbiome has become a growing area of research and it is becoming clear that the microbiome of humans plays an important role for human health. Extensive research is now going into cataloging and annotating the functional role of the human microbiome. The ability to explore and describe the microbiome of any species has become possible due to new methods for sequencing. These techniques allow comprehensive surveys of the composition of the microbiome of nonmodel organisms of which relatively little is known. Some attention has been paid to the microbiome of insect species including important vectors of pathogens of human and veterinary importance, agricultural pests, and model species. Together these studies suggest that the microbiome of insects is highly dependent on the environment, species, and populations and affects the fitness of species. These fitness effects can have important implications for the conservation and management of species and populations. Further, these results are important for our understanding of invasion of nonnative species, responses to pathogens, and responses to chemicals and global climate change in the present and future.

AB The spatial structure of the environment (e.g. the configuration of habitat patches) may play an important role in determining the strength of local adaptation. However, previous studies of habitat heterogeneity and local adaptation have largely been limited to simple landscapes, which poorly represent the multiscale habitat structure common in nature. Here, we use simulations to pursue two goals: (i) we explore how landscape heterogeneity, dispersal ability and selection affect the strength of local adaptation, and (ii) we evaluate the performance of several genotype-environment association (GEA) methods for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. We found that the strength of local adaptation increased in spatially aggregated selection regimes, but remained strong in patchy landscapes when selection was moderate to strong. Weak selection resulted in weak local adaptation that was relatively unaffected by landscape heterogeneity. In general, the power of detection methods closely reflected levels of local adaptation. False-positive rates (FPRs), however, showed distinct differences across GEA methods based on levels of population structure. The univariate GEA approach had high FPRs (up to 55%) under limited dispersal scenarios, due to strong isolation by distance. By contrast, multivariate, ordination-based methods had uniformly low FPRs (0-2%), suggesting these approaches can effectively control for population structure. Specifically, constrained ordinations had the best balance of high detection and low FPRs and will be a useful addition to the GEA toolkit. Our results provide both theoretical and practical insights into the conditions that shape local adaptation and how these conditions impact our ability to detect selection.

AB Urbanisation has an important impact on biodiversity, mostly driving changes in species assemblages, through the replacement of specialist with generalist species, thus leading to biotic homogenisation. Mobility is also assumed to greatly affect species' ability to cope in urban environments. Moreover, specialisation, mobility and their interaction are expected to greatly influence ecological processes such as metacommunity dynamics and assembly processes, and consequently the way and the spatial scale at which organisms respond to urbanisation. Here we investigate urbanisation impacts on distinct characteristics of species assemblages - namely specialisation degree in resource use, mobility and number of species, classified according to both characteristics and their combination - for vascular plants, butterflies and birds, across a range of spatial scales (from 1 x 1 km plots to 5 km-radius buffers around them).
   We found that the degree of specialisation, mobility and their interaction, greatly influenced species' responses to urbanisation, with highly mobile specialist species of all taxonomic groups being affected most. Two different patterns were found: for plants, urbanisation induced trait divergence by favouring highly mobile species with narrow habitat ranges. For birds and butterflies, however, it reduced the number of highly mobile specialist species, thus driving trait convergence. Mobile organisms, across and within taxonomic groups, tended to respond at larger spatial scales than those that are poorly mobile. These findings emphasize the need to take into consideration species' ecological aspects, as well as a wide range of spatial scales when evaluating the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity. Our results also highlight the harmful impact of widespread urban expansion on organisms such as butterflies, especially highly mobile specialists, which were negatively affected by urban areas even at great distances.

AB Shoots and roots are autotrophic and heterotrophic organs of plants with different physiological functions. Do they have different metabolomes? Do their metabolisms respond differently to environmental changes such as drought? We used metabolomics and elemental analyses to answer these questions. First, we show that shoots and roots have different metabolomes and nutrient and elemental stoichiometries. Second, we show that the shoot metabolome is much more variable among species and seasons than is the root metabolome. Third, we show that the metabolic response of shoots to drought contrasts with that of roots; shoots decrease their growth metabolism (lower concentrations of sugars, amino acids, nucleosides, N, P, and K), and roots increase it in a mirrored response. Shoots are metabolically deactivated during drought to reduce the consumption of water and nutrients, whereas roots are metabolically activated to enhance the uptake of water and nutrients, together buffering the effects of drought, at least at the short term.

AB Detailed linkage and recombination rate maps are necessary to use the full potential of genome sequencing and population genomic analyses. We used a custom collared flycatcher 50K SNP array to develop a high-density linkage map with 37262 markers assigned to 34 linkage groups in 33 autosomes and the Z chromosome. The best-order map contained 4215 markers, with a total distance of 3132cM and a mean genetic distance between markers of 0.12cM. Facilitated by the array being designed to include markers from most scaffolds, we obtained a second-generation assembly of the flycatcher genome that approaches full chromosome sequences (N50 super-scaffold size 20.2Mb and with 1.042Gb (of 1.116Gb) anchored to and mostly ordered and oriented along chromosomes). We found that flycatcher and zebra finch chromosomes are entirely syntenic but that inversions at mean rates of 1.5-2.0 event (6.6-7.5Mb) per My have changed the organization within chromosomes, rates high enough for inversions to potentially have been involved with many speciation events during avian evolution. The mean recombination rate was 3.1cM/Mb and correlated closely with chromosome size, from 2cM/Mb for chromosomes >100Mb to >10cM/Mb for chromosomes <10Mb. This size dependence seemed entirely due to an obligate recombination event per chromosome; if 50cM was subtracted from the genetic lengths of chromosomes, the rate per physical unit DNA was constant across chromosomes. Flycatcher recombination rate showed similar variation along chromosomes as chicken but lacked the large interior recombination deserts characteristic of zebra finch chromosomes.

AB Background: Honeybees provide economically and ecologically vital pollination services to crops and wild plants. During the last decade elevated colony losses have been documented in Europe and North America. Despite growing consensus on the involvement of multiple causal factors, the underlying interactions impacting on honeybee health and colony failure are not fully resolved. Parasites and pathogens are among the main candidates, but sublethal exposure to widespread agricultural pesticides may also affect bees.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate effects of sublethal dietary neonicotinoid exposure on honeybee colony performance, a fully crossed experimental design was implemented using 24 colonies, including sister-queens from two different strains, and experimental in-hive pollen feeding with or without environmentally relevant concentrations of thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Honeybee colonies chronically exposed to both neonicotinoids over two brood cycles exhibited decreased performance in the short-term resulting in declining numbers of adult bees (-28%) and brood (-13%), as well as a reduction in honey production (-29%) and pollen collections (-19%), but colonies recovered in the medium-term and overwintered successfully. However, significantly decelerated growth of neonicotinoid-exposed colonies during the following spring was associated with queen failure, revealing previously undocumented long-term impacts of neonicotinoids: queen supersedure was observed for 60% of the neonicotinoid-exposed colonies within a one year period, but not for control colonies. Linked to this, neonicotinoid exposure was significantly associated with a reduced propensity to swarm during the next spring. Both short-term and long-term effects of neonicotinoids on colony performance were significantly influenced by the honeybees' genetic background.
   Conclusions/Significance: Sublethal neonicotinoid exposure did not provoke increased winter losses. Yet, significant detrimental short and long-term impacts on colony performance and queen fate suggest that neonicotinoids may contribute to colony weakening in a complex manner. Further, we highlight the importance of the genetic basis of neonicotinoid susceptibility in honeybees which can vary substantially.

AB While homoploid hybridization was viewed as maladaptive by zoologists, the possibility that it might play a creative role in evolution was explored and debated by botanists during the evolutionary synthesis. Owing to his synthetic work on the ecological and genetic factors influencing the occurrence and effects of hybridization, G. Ledyard Stebbins' contributions to this debate were particularly influential. We revisit Stebbins' views on the frequency of hybridization, the evolution of hybrid sterility, and the evolutionary importance of transgressive segregation, introgression, and homoploid hybrid speciation in the context of contemporary evidence. Floristic surveys indicate that similar to 10% of plant species hybridize, suggesting that natural hybridization is not as ubiquitous as Stebbins argued. There is stronger support for his contention that chromosomal sterility is of greater importance in plants than in animals and that selection drives the evolution of hybrid sterility. Stebbins' assertions concerning the frequent occurrence of transgressive segregation and introgressive hybridization have been confirmed by contemporary work, but few studies directly link these phenomena to adaptive evolution or speciation. Stebbins proposed a mechanism by which chromosomal rearrangements partially isolate hybrid lineages and parental species, which spurred the development of the recombinational model of homoploid speciation. While this model has been confirmed empirically, the establishment of reproductively independent hybrid lineages is typically associated with the development of both intrinsic and extrinsic reproductive barriers. We conclude by reflecting on outcomes of hybridization not considered by Stebbins and on possible future research that may extend our understanding of the evolutionary role of hybridization beyond Stebbins' legacy.

AB Most species introductions are not expected to result in invasion, and species that are invasive in one area are frequently not invasive in others. However, cases of introduced organisms that failed to invade are reported in many instances as anecdotes or are simply ignored. In this analysis, we aimed to find common characteristics between non-invasive populations of known invasive species and evaluated how the study of failed invasions can contribute to research on biological invasions. We found intraspecific variation in invasion success and several recurring explanations for why non-native species fail to invade; these included low propagule pressure, abiotic resistance, biotic resistance, genetic constraints and mutualist release. Furthermore, we identified key research topics where ignoring failed invasions could produce misleading results; these include studies on historical factors associated with invasions, distribution models of invasive species, the effect of species traits on invasiveness, genetic effects, biotic resistance and habitat invasibility. In conclusion, we found failed invasions can provide fundamental information on the relative importance of factors determining invasions and might be a key component of several research topics. Therefore, our analysis suggests that more specific and detailed studies on invasion failures are necessary.

AB Ecologists widely agree that species diversity consists of two components, richness (the number of species) and evenness (a measure of the equitability of the proportional abundances of those species). However, no consensus on an exact definition of evenness (or equitability) has emerged. Instead, numerous equitability indices have been used in the ecological literature, as different researchers have preferred indices with different mathematical properties. In this paper, I show that the phrase species diversity consists of two independent components, richness and evenness logically leads to one particular definition of evenness (Evenness = Diversity/Richness). To facilitate accurate communication, I propose that the term evenness be used only to refer to this phenomenon, and that other terms be used for the equitability indices that measure other things. Here I provide a review of popular equitability indices, explain what each measures in practice, and show how they relate to each other and to evenness itself. I also explore how the partitioning of diversity into richness and evenness components is related to the partitioning of diversity into alpha and beta components. Dissecting the indices makes it easier to see the conceptual differences among them. Such understanding is necessary to ensure that an appropriate index is chosen for the questions at hand, as well as to interpret the index values correctly and to assess when index values can and when they cannot be considered comparable.

AB 1. Legacy effects of plant influences on abiotic and biotic soil properties can result in priority effects that influence the structure and composition of plant communities. To better understand the role of these plant soil interactions, here we expand the concept of plant soil feedbacks from a within-species approach (intraspecific plant soil feedback) to a between-species approach (interspecific plant soil interactions).
   2. In a greenhouse experiment, we tested how the early successional Jacobaea vulgaris affects its own performance and the performance of 30 co-occurring plant species via changes in abiotic and biotic soil conditions. In addition, we examined the reciprocal effect of the co-occurring species on J. vulgaris.
   3. Our study had three important results. First, J. vulgaris exhibits strong negative plant soil feedback. Secondly, there were large differences among the co-occurring species in interspecific plant soil effects on J. vulgaris growth. Approximately, half the species reduced J. vulgaris performance, whereas the other half had no effect. Thirdly, soil conditioned by J. vulgaris had a positive or neutral effect on the growth of the co-occurring species.
   4. To test the soil effects of entire plant communities, in 10 old-fields that differed in time since abandonment we recorded the identity of all plants surrounding J. vulgaris individuals. We calculated the weighted soil effect of this community on J. vulgaris and the reciprocal effect off. vulgaris on the community. There was a positive linear relationship between time since abandonment and the weighted feedback effect of J. vulgaris on the plant community.
   5. We suggest three mechanisms how the legacy of plant soil interactions may enhance the rate of succession through priority effects: early successional plant species exert negative plant soil feedback; co-occurring plant species cause negative interspecific plant soil effects to the early successional species; and the early successional species have overall positive interspecific plant soil effects on the co-occurring plant species.
   6. Synthesis. The performance of an early successional species can be reduced directly by the legacy effects of intraspecific plant soil feedback, as well as indirectly by the legacy effects of both intra- and interspecific plant soil interactions. These intra- and interspecific plant soil interactions can prioritize transitions of plant species in plant communities.

AB Community ecologists and conservation biologists often work with data that are too sparse for achieving reliable inference with species-specific approaches. Here we explore the idea of combining species-specific models into a single hierarchical model. The community component of the model seeks for shared patterns in how the species respond to environmental covariates. We illustrate the modeling framework in the context of logistic regression and presence-absence data, but a similar hierarchical structure could also be used in many other types of applications. We first use simulated data to illustrate that the community component can improve parameterization of species-specific models especially for rare species, for which the data would be too sparse to be informative alone. We then apply the community model to real data on 500 diatom species to show that it has much greater predictive power than a collection of independent species-specific models. We use the modeling approach to show that roughly one-third of distance decay in community similarity can be explained by two variables characterizing water quality, rare species typically preferring nutrient-poor waters with high pH, and common species showing a more general pattern of resource use.

AB Interconnected social and environmental systems are the domain of ecological economics, and models can be used to explore feedbacks and adaptations inherent in these systems. Agent-based modeling (ABM) represents autonomous entities, each with dynamic behavior and heterogeneous characteristics. Agents interact with each other and their environment, resulting in emergent outcomes at the macroscale that can be used to quantitatively analyze complex systems. ABM is contributing to research questions in ecological economics in the areas of natural resource management and land-use change, urban systems modeling, market dynamics, changes in consumer attitudes, innovation, and diffusion of technology and management practices, commons dilemmas and self-governance, and psychological aspects to human decision making and behavior change. Frontiers for ABM research in ecological economics involve advancing the empirical calibration and validation of models through mixed methods, including surveys, interviews, participatory modeling, and, notably, experimental economics to test specific decision-making hypotheses. Linking ABM with other modeling techniques at the level of emergent properties will further advance efforts to understand dynamics of social-environmental systems.

AB Tamarix ramosissima is a naturalized, normative plant species which has become widespread along riparian corridors throughout the western United States. We test the hypothesis that the distribution and success of Tamarix result from human modification of river-flow regimes. We conducted a natural experiment in eight ecoregions in arid and semiarid portions of the western United States, measuring Tamarix and native Populus recruitment and abundance at 64 sites along 13 perennial rivers spanning a range of altered flow regimes. We quantified biologically relevant attributes of flow alteration as an integrated measure (the index of flow modification, IFM), which was then used to explain between-site variation in abundance and recruitment of native and nonnative riparian plant species.
   We found the likelihood of successful recruitment of Tamarix to be highest along unregulated river reaches and to remain high across a gradient of regulated flows. Recruitment probability for Populus, in contrast, was highest under free-flowing conditions and declined abruptly Under even slight flow modification (IFM > 0.1). Adult Tamarix was most abundant at intermediate levels of IFM. Populus abundance declined sharply with modest flow regulation (IFM > 0.2) and was not present at the Most flow-regulated sites. Dominance of Tamarix was highest along rivers with the most altered flow regimes. At the 16 least regulated sites, Tamarix and Populus were equally abundant.
   Given observed patterns of Tamarix recruitment and abundance. We infer that Tamarix would likely have naturalized, spread. and established widely in riparian communities ill the of dam construction, diversions, and flow regulation in western North America. absence However, Tamarix dominance over native Species would likely be less extensive ill the absence of human alteration of river-flow regimes. Restoration that combines active mechanical removal of established stands of Tamarix with a program of flow releases conducive to native species establishment and persistence is hypothesized to facilitate the codominance of Populus ill reaches where it has become rare. Our findings have implications for planning flow-related stream restoration, for developing realistic expectations for yield on investment in prescribed flow releases, and for planning flow-related interventions that might be possible if control and management of invasive plant species along rivers is a goal.

AB Schistosomiasis is a disease of great medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions, caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma (subclass Digenea). Following major water development schemes in the 1980s, schistosomiasis has become an important parasitic disease of children living in the Senegal River Basin (SRB). During molecular parasitological surveys, nuclear and mitochondrial markers revealed unexpected natural interactions between a bovine and human Schistosoma species: S. bovis and S. haematobium, respectively. Hybrid schistosomes recovered from the urine and faeces of children and the intermediate snail hosts of both parental species, Bulinus truncatus and B. globosus, presented a nuclear ITS rRNA sequence identical to S. haematobium, while the partial mitochondrial cox1 sequence was identified as S. bovis. Molecular data suggest that the hybrids are not 1st generation and are a result of parental and/or hybrid backcrosses, indicating a stable hybrid zone. Larval stages with the reverse genetic profile were also found and are suggested to be F1 progeny. The data provide indisputable evidence for the occurrence of bidirectional introgressive hybridization between a bovine and a human Schistosoma species. Hybrid species have been found infecting B. truncatus, a snail species that is now very abundant throughout the SRB. The recent increase in urinary schistosomiasis in the villages along the SRB could therefore be a direct effect of the increased transmission through B. truncatus. Hybridization between schistosomes under laboratory conditions has been shown to result in heterosis (higher fecundity, faster maturation time, wider intermediate host spectrum), having important implications on disease prevalence, pathology and treatment. If this new hybrid exhibits the same hybrid vigour, it could develop into an emerging pathogen, necessitating further control strategies in zones where both parental species overlap.

AB A number of recent studies have focused on estimating gross primary production (GPP) using vegetation indices (VIs). In this paper, GPP is retrieved as a product of incident light use efficiency (LUE), defined as GPP/PAR, and the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). As a good correlation is found between canopy chlorophyll content and incident LUE for six types of wheat canopy (R-2 = 0.87, n = 24), indices aimed for chlorophyll assessment can be used as an indicator of incident LUE and the product of chlorophyll indices and PAR will be a proxy of GPP. In a field experiment, we investigated four canopy chlorophyll content related indices (Red edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index I Red Edge NDVI), modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index [MCARI(710)], Red Edge Chlorophyll Index [CIred (edge)] and the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index [MTCI]) for GPP estimation during the growth cycle of wheat. These indices are validated for leaf and canopy chlorophyll estimation with ground truth data of canopy chlorophyll content. With ground truth data, a strong correlation is observed for canopy chlorophyll estimation with correlation coefficients R-2 of 0.79, 0.84, 0.85 and 0.87 for Red Edge NDVI, MCARI(710), CIred (edge) and MTCI, respectively (n = 24). As evidence of the existence of a relationship between canopy chlorophyll and GPP/PAR, these indices are shown to be a good proxy of GPP/PAR with R-2 ranging from 0.70 for Red Edge NDVI and 0.75 for MTCI (n = 240). Remote estimation of GPP from canopy chlorophyll content x PAR is proved to be relatively successful (R-2 of 0.47, 0.53, 0.65 and 0.66 for Red edge NDVI, MCARI(710), CIred edge and MTCI respectively, n = 240). These results open up a new possibility to estimate GPP and should inspire new models for remote sensing of GPP. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting coherent signals of climate change is best achieved by conducting expansive, long-term studies. Here, using counts of waders (Charadrii) collected from ca. 3500 sites over 30 years and covering a major portion of western Europe, we present the largest-scale study to show that faunal abundance is influenced by climate in winter. We demonstrate that the 'weighted centroids' of populations of seven species of wader occurring in internationally important numbers have undergone substantial shifts of up to 115 km, generally in a northeasterly direction. To our knowledge, this shift is greater than that recorded in any other study, but closer to what would be expected as a result of the spatial distribution of ecological zones. We establish that year-to-year changes in site abundance have been positively correlated with concurrent changes in temperature, but that this relationship is most marked towards the colder extremities of the birds' range, suggesting that shifts have occurred as a result of range expansion and that responses to climate change are temperature dependent. Many attempts to model the future impacts of climate change on the distribution of organisms, assume uniform responses or shifts throughout a species' range or with temperature, but our results suggest that this may not be a valid approach. We propose that, with warming temperatures, hitherto unsuitable sites in northeastern Europe will host increasingly important wader numbers, but that this may not be matched by declines elsewhere within the study area. The need to establish that such changes are occurring is accentuated by the statutory importance of this taxon in the designation of protected areas.

AB The grey wolf has one of the largest historic distributions of any terrestrial mammal and can disperse over great distances across imposing topographic barriers. As a result, geographical distance and physical obstacles to dispersal may not be consequential factors in the evolutionary divergence of wolf populations. However, recent studies suggest ecological features can constrain gene flow. We tested whether wolf-prey associations in uninterrupted tundra and forested regions of Canada explained differences in migratory behaviour, genetics, and coat colour of wolves. Satellite-telemetry data demonstrated that tundra wolves (n = 19) migrate annually with caribou (n = 19) from denning areas in the tundra to wintering areas south of the treeline. In contrast, nearby boreal coniferous forest wolves are territorial and associated year round with resident prey. Spatially explicit analysis of 14 autosomal microsatellite loci (n = 404 individuals) found two genetic clusters corresponding to tundra vs. boreal coniferous forest wolves. A sex bias in gene flow was inferred based on higher levels of mtDNA divergence (F-ST = 0.282, 0.028 and 0.033; P < 0.0001 for mitochondrial, nuclear autosomal and Y-chromosome markers, respectively). Phenotypic differentiation was substantial as 93% of wolves from tundra populations exhibited light colouration whereas only 38% of boreal coniferous forest wolves did (chi(2) = 64.52, P < 0.0001). The sharp boundary representing this discontinuity was the southern limit of the caribou migration. These findings show that substantial genetic and phenotypic differentiation in highly mobile mammals can be caused by prey-habitat specialization rather than distance or topographic barriers. The presence of a distinct wolf ecotype in the tundra of North America highlights the need to preserve migratory populations.

AB The majority of tallgrass prairie root biomass is located in the upper soil layers (0-25 cm), but species differences exist in reliance on soil water at varying depths. These differences have led to the hypothesis that resource partitioning belowground facilitates species co-existence in this mesic grassland. To determine if plant water relations can be linked to soil water partitioning as a potential mechanism allowing C-3 species to persist among the more dominant C-4 grasses, we measured differences in the source of water-use using the isotopic signature of xylem water, volumetric soil water content at 4 depths, and leaf water potentials. Data were collected for seven species representing C-4 grasses, C-3 forbs and C-3 shrubs over three growing seasons at the Konza Prairie (Kansas, USA) to encompass a range of natural climatic conditions. C-4 grasses relied on shallow soil water (5 cm) across the growing season and had midday leaf water potentials that were highly correlated with shallow soil water regardless of soil water availability at other portions of the soil profile (20, 40 and 90 cm). In contrast, C-3 species only used shallow soil water when plentiful at this depth; these species increased their dependence on soil water from greater depths as the upper soil layers dried. Structural equation models describing plant water relations were very similar for the three C-4 species, whereas a unique set of models and drivers were identified for each of the C-3 species. These results support soil water partitioning as a mechanism for species coexistence, as C-4 species in this grassland have relatively consistent dependence on water in shallow soil layers, whereas C-3 species show niche differentiation in water use strategies to avoid competition with C-4 grasses for water in shallow soil layers when this resource is limiting and leaf water stress is high.

AB Eutrophication due to high anthropogenic nutrient loading has greatly impacted ecological processes in marine coastal waters and, therefore, much effort has been put into reducing nitrogen and phosphorus discharges into European and North-American waters. Nutrient enrichment usually resulted in increase of biomass and production of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos, often coinciding with shifts in species composition within the primary producer community. Consequences of increasing eutrophication for higher trophic levels are still being disputed, and even less is known about the consequences of nutrient reduction on coastal food webs. Here, we present 30-year concurrent field observations on phytoplankton, macrozoobenthos and estuarine birds in the Dutch Wadden Sea, which has been subject to decades of nutrient enrichment and subsequent nutrient reduction. We demonstrate that long-term variations in limiting nutrients (phosphate and silicon) were weakly correlated with biomass and more strongly with community structures of phytoplankton, macrozoobenthos and estuarine birds. Although we cannot conclusively determine if, and if so to what extent, nutrient enrichment and subsequent nutrient reduction actually contributed to the concurrent trends in these communities, it appears likely that part of the variance in the studied coastal communities is related to changes in nutrient loads. Our results imply that nutrient reduction measures should not ignore the potential consequences for policies aimed at bird conservation and exploitation of marine living resources.

AB Increasing use is being made in conservation management of statistical models that couple extensive collections of species and environmental data to make predictions of the geographic distributions of species. While the relationships fitted between a species and its environment are relatively transparent for many of these modeling techniques, others are more 'black box' in character, only producing geographic predictions and providing minimal or untraditional summaries of the fitted relationships on which these predictions are based. This in turn prevents robust evaluation of the ecological sensibility of such models, a necessary process if model predictions are to be treated with confidence. Here we propose a new but simple method for visualizing modeled responses that can be implemented with any modeling method, and demonstrate its application using five common methods applied to the prediction of an Australian tree species. This is achieved by insetting an "evaluation strip" into the spatial data layers, which, after predictions have been made, can be clipped out and used for creating plots of the modelled responses. We present findings of the application strip for algorithms GLMs, GAMs, CLIM, DOMAIN and MARS. Evaluation strips can be constructed to investigate either uni-variate responses, or the simultaneous variation in predicted values in relation to two variables. The latter option is particularly useful for evaluating responses in models that allow the fitting of complex interaction terms. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic diversity and population structure were investigated across the core range of Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus laniarius; Dasyuridae), a wide-ranging marsupial carnivore restricted to the island of Tasmania. Heterozygosity (0.386-0.467) and allelic diversity (2.7-3.3) were low in all subpopulations and allelic size ranges were small and almost continuous, consistent with a founder effect. Island effects and repeated periods of low population density may also have contributed to the low variation. Within continuous habitat, gene flow appears extensive up to 50 km (high assignment rates to source or close neighbour populations; nonsignificant values of pairwise F-ST), in agreement with movement data. At larger scales (150-250 km), gene flow is reduced (significant pairwise F-ST) but there is no evidence for isolation by distance. The most substantial genetic structuring was observed for comparisons spanning unsuitable habitat, implying limited dispersal of devils between the well-connected, eastern populations and a smaller northwestern population. The genetic distinctiveness of the northwestern population was reflected in all analyses: unique alleles; multivariate analyses of gene frequency (multidimensional scaling, minimum spanning tree, nearest neighbour); high self-assignment (95%); two distinct populations for Tasmania were detected in isolation by distance and in Bayesian model-based clustering analyses. Marsupial carnivores appear to have stronger population subdivisions than their placental counterparts.

AB Growth and nitrogen (N) economy of mountain birch are reported here in response to temperature change. Mechanisms of temperature effects on plant growth in temperate - arctic regions are discussed in the light of decreasing growth rates and increasing leaf-N contents along altitudinal and latitudinal temperature gradients.
   Mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) seedlings were grown at two soil temperatures, air temperatures and nutrient concentrations in a full-factorial experiment during one growing season in northern Sweden.
   Changes in air and soil temperature affected aboveground growth more than belowground growth. An increase in air temperature increased leaf area ratio and plant-N productivity while decreasing plant-N concentration and leaf-N content. A change in soil temperature affected root-N uptake rate and plant-N concentration, similar to the effect of a change in nutrient supply. Air and soil temperature had interactive effects on growth rate, N productivity and leaf-N content.
   The results indicate that increasing leaf-N content with increasing altitude and latitude is not only a passive consequence of weaker N dilution by reduced growth, but also a physiological acclimation to lower air temperature.

AB The availability and spatial arrangement of habitat patches are known to strongly influence fauna in terrestrial ecosystems. The importance of patch arrangement is not well-studied within running-water systems where flow-induced movements of patches and of fauna could decouple habitat characteristics and faunal habitat preferences. Using small, stream-dwelling invertebrates, we asked if fauna in such systems can distinguish among patch types and if patch arrangement at their 'landscape scale' (i.e., within a streambed across which they move and forage) can be linked to faunal abundance. We quantified the spatial distribution of sand and leaf patches at multiple sites on a streambed at regular intervals over a 1 1/2 yr period, estimated faunal abundance in the two patch types, and experimentally determined if faunal colonization varied among leaf patches that were similar structurally but differed in their potential microbial food resources. We show that despite their small size and limited swimming abilities, these stream invertebrates did respond to patch type, that specific characteristics of an individual patch influenced faunal colonization, and that the spatial arrangement of patches on the streambed was linked to field abundances. Larval chironomids and adult copepods were more abundant in leaves than in sand and preferentially colonized leaf patches made with rapidly decomposing leaves that harbored higher microbial (bacteria and fungi) abundances over leaf patches with more refractory leaves and lower microbial abundances. Further, statistical models that included spatially-explicit data on patch arrangement (e.g., patch contagion, distance between patches) explained significantly more variation in faunal abundance, than models that included only nonspatial information (e.g., date, time since last flood). Despite the fact that these fauna live in a highly dynamic environment with variable flow rates during the year, unstable patch configurations, and seasonal changes in total abundance, our findings suggest a need for aquatic ecologists to test the hypothesis that small-scale landscape attributes within streams (e.g., leaf patch aggregation) may be important to faunal dynamics. If patch aggregation has negative consequences for stream biota, streambed 'landscapes' may be fundamentally different from many terrestrial landscapes due to the inherent connectivity provided by the water and the over-riding importance of patch edges. Regardless of these differences, our findings suggest that the spatial configuration of patches in a landscape may have consequences for fauna even in highly dynamic systems, in which patches move and fauna periodically experience high levels of passive dispersal.

AB Ecological modellers are preparing to address how the biosphere may respond to decadal- to century-scale changes in the Earth's environmental system. This endeavour has revealed a question for which no immediate answer is readily available: how do ecosystems respond dynamically to climate variations? This question is explored with a 10 + year record of global vegetation dynamics recorded by a satellite remote sensing observatory. It is found that the average geography of observed vegetation patterns is well explained by continental-scale patterns of climatology in both North and South America and Africa. However, there is little relation observed in inter-annual deviations of the two data sets, with the possible exception of marginal cold and/or dry environments. Evidence from the African continent suggests that even in marginal environments the apparent correlation between climate and the satellite vegetation measurements varies from year to year indicating some persistence or lag between vegetation activity and climate dynamics. These observations lead to a conceptual model of vegetation amount and activity in the presence of climate variation. Testing the model is an important objective that could be addressed by the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems, International Geosphere-Biosphere Project over the next decade.

AB Biodiversity is a multifaceted phenomenon involving the variety of organisms present, the genetic differences among them, and the communities, ecosystems, and landscape patterns in which they occur. Society will increasingly value biodiversity and influence the passage of laws and writing of regulations involving biodiversity which rangeland managers will have to abide by over the coming decades. Even private and developing world rangelands will be affected.
   While taxonomic knowledge of vertebrates and vascular plants and their abundance, rarity, and distribution, in the developed nations is generally adequate, the same cannot be said of the developing world. Furthermore, adequate knowledge of invertebrates, nonvascular plants, and microbes is deficient everywhere.
   Although the basis of variation at all higher levels, genetic variation within rangeland species, even the major ones, has barely been assessed. Obtaining statistically adequate data on populations of rare species that are small and secretive is well nigh impossible.
   We have many means of measuring community diversity, but all of them are value laden. That is, choice of variables to measure and how they are indexed betrays what we consider are important. We should be more forthright in stating to the users the biases of these methods. There are many other, more useful ways to describe community-level diversity besides the traditional focus on species.
   Ungulate grazing is an important process in many ecosystems. Thus, removal of grazing destabilizes some systems. Livestock grazing will actually increase the chances of survival of some species. Moderate livestock grazing can also enhance community and landscape-level diversity in many instances.
   Attention is now shifting from ''charismatic'' species to defensively managing larger tracts of land with habitat or ecosystems holding suites of sensitive species. Since some accelerated extinction of isolated populations and species is inevitable, we need to know which species and ecotypes are most valuable. Understanding of modular, guild, and functional group structure would also help us identify keystone or critical link species and better focus our attention on truly important tracts of land where they live.
   It is probably more important to sustain soils and ecosystem processes than any randomly selected species, especially if functionally redundant species can be identified. Similarly, not all introduced, alien, or exotic species are equal threats; it depends on how they fit into ecosystems. Sustainable development will depend on finding balance between use and protection, from range sites to landscapes, and even on a global basis.

AB (1) The population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries L.) on Hirta (St. Kilda) shows marked and persistent instability in population size.  Both during the 1960s and the 1980s, the population varied in size from around 600 animals to nearly 1600.
   (2) Changes in population size occur between successive years as a result of high over-winter mortality, the key factor limiting population size.  This is particularly pronounced among lambs and rams and is caused principally by starvation.
   (3) Winter mortality increases with population density at the onset of winter in a non-linear fashion.  Neither neonatal survival nor overall fecundity are density-dependent, though both are low following years when winter mortality is high.
   (4) The persistent instability of the St. Kilda sheep population is probably caused by their consistently high fecundity associated with a super-abundance of food in summer.  In conjunction, these may permit the population to pass through winter at a level close to carrying capacity; to increase by as much as 50% during the subsequent summer; and to enter the next winter at a level substantially higher than the island can support.

TI Relational values resonate broadly and differently than intrinsic or
   instrumental values, or the New Ecological Paradigm
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FRAMEWORK; HUMANS
AB Value orientations used to explain or justify conservation have been rooted in arguments about how much and in what context to emphasize the intrinsic versus instrumental value of nature. Equally prominent are characterizations of beliefs known as the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), often used to help explain pro-environmental behaviour. A recent alternative to these positions has been identified as 'relational value' D broadly, values linking people and ecosystems via tangible and intangible relationships to nature as well as the principles, virtues and notions of a good life that may accompany these. This paper examines whether relational values are distinct from other value orientation and have potential to alleviate the intrinsic-instrumental debate. To test this possibility, we sought to operationalize the construct D relational values D by developing six relational statements. We ask: 1) Do the individual statements used to characterize relational values demonstrate internal coherence as either a single or multi-dimensional construct? 2) Do relational value statements (including those strongly stated) resonate with diverse populations? 3) Do people respond to relational value statements in a consistently different way than NEP scale statements? Data for this work is drawn from an online panel of residents of northeastern US (n = 400), as well as a sample of Costa Rican farmers (n = 253) and tourists in Costa Rica (n = 260). Results indicate relational values are distinct as a construct when compared to the NEP.

AB Limiting similarity theory predicts that competing species must segregate along one or more dimensions of their ecological niche in order to coexist. In predator communities, interspecific interactions are influenced by a diversity of factors; therefore, the behavioural patterns of composing species will differ due to locally adapted interactions. We deployed 32-41 camera-traps in five study areas across the Iberian Peninsula to investigate the temporal relations between mesocarnivores in SW Europe. The selection for a period of the diel cycle and plasticity in activity patterns was evaluated using the Jacobs Selection Index (JSI) and the coefficient of activity overlap (a dagger(1)). Furthermore, we investigated whether temporal shifts can facilitate coexistence by reducing activity overlap. Seven species of mesocarnivores were detected and were assigned into one of three behaviourally distinct groups: diurnal (JSI(day) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.8), strictly nocturnal (JSI(night) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.8) or facultative nocturnal species (0.4 a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand JSI(night) > 0.8). Most species exhibited substantial flexibility, which allowed them to locally adapt their foraging strategies (intraspecific a dagger(1) = 0.70-0.77). Mean Delta(1) from all interspecific pairwise comparisons was negatively correlated with the number of carnivore species with a parts per thousand yen10 detections (r -0.76, p = 0.02). Our results suggest that temporal segregation is likely to play an important role in facilitating mesocarnivore coexistence, especially with increasing community complexity, where most species' activity peaks were asynchronous. These results contribute to understanding the dynamics and behavioural strategies of coexisting mesocarnivores, crucial for forecasting the possible outcomes of conservation or management actions.

AB 1. Landscape patterns influence a range of ecological processes at multiple spatial scales. Landscape pattern metrics are often used to study the patterns that result from the linear and nonlinear interactions between spatial aggregation and abundance of habitat.
   2. However, many class-level pattern metrics are highly correlated with habitat abundance, making their use as a measure of habitat fragmentation problematic.
   3. We argue that a class-level pattern metric should be (1) able to differentiate landscapes across a range of spatial aggregations, and (2) independent of habitat abundance, if it is to be used to distinguish between effects of habitat amount and fragmentation.
   4. Based on these criteria and using both simulated and actual landscapes, we evaluated 64 class-level pattern metrics. These metrics were reclassified into four groups based on their correlation with aggregation and abundance.
   5. Among all these metrics, nine were considered robust for fragmentation measurements, which cover most of the characteristics that define pattern, including core area, shape, proximity / isolation, contrast, and contagion / interspersion.
   6. Optimal metrics for individual studies will depend on both biological rationales and statistically robust metrics that are appropriate for achieving each study objectives.

AB Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis. Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history, providing evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to plant functioning, greater effort is needed to determine and quantify the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and canopy chlorophyll (Chl) content, the main photosynthetic pigment, as well as its proxy, green leaf area index (CIAO, both used as quantitative measures of plant greenness. The objective of this study is to establish relationships for GPP vs. canopy CM content and GPP vs. GLAI in maize. The main focus of the paper is to reveal fine details of the relationships and understand their features in different stages of maize development. Data on GPP, leaf Chl content and GLAI were collected across ten years (2001-2010) at three AmeriFlux sites in Nebraska over irrigated and rainfed maize. Relationships of GPP vs. total canopy Chl content and GPP vs. GLAI were established for vegetative, tasseling and reproductive stages. In each stage, relationships were close with determination coefficients above 0.9; however, the shapes and slopes of the relationships in vegetative stages were different from reproductive stages. This difference was more pronounced for the GPP vs. CIA! relationship. In part, this difference is due to different leaf Chl contents in vegetative and reproductive stages. Smaller but detectable differences in shape and slope were also found for the GPP vs. canopy Chl relationship. Despite the differences in relationships for vegetative and reproductive stages, for the entire growing season, green LAI (GIAI) explained 90% of GPP variation with a coefficient of variation (CV) = 17%, while total canopy Chl content explained more than 92% of GPP variation with CV = 15%. Quantitative characterization of relationships between GPP and such biophysical characteristics as GLAI and canopy Chl content underlines the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis and has significant implications on remote sensing of primary production.

AB Current evidence of phenological responses to recent climate change is substantially biased towards northern hemisphere temperate regions. Given regional differences in climate change, shifts in phenology will not be uniform across the globe, and conclusions drawn from temperate systems in the northern hemisphere might not be applicable to other regions on the planet. We conduct the largest meta-analysis to date of phenological drivers and trends among southern hemisphere species, assessing 1208 long-term datasets from 89 studies on 347 species. Data were mostly from Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), South America and the Antarctic/subantarctic, and focused primarily on plants and birds. This meta-analysis shows an advance in the timing of spring events (with a strong Australian data bias), although substantial differences in trends were apparent among taxonomic groups and regions. When only statistically significant trends were considered, 82% of terrestrial datasets and 42% of marine datasets demonstrated an advance in phenology. Temperature was most frequently identified as the primary driver of phenological changes; however, in many studies it was the only climate variable considered. When precipitation was examined, it often played a key role but, in contrast with temperature, the direction of phenological shifts in response to precipitation variation was difficult to predict a priori. We discuss how phenological information can inform the adaptive capacity of species, their resilience, and constraints on autonomous adaptation. We also highlight serious weaknesses in past and current data collection and analyses at large regional scales (with very few studies in the tropics or from Africa) and dramatic taxonomic biases. If accurate predictions regarding the general effects of climate change on the biology of organisms are to be made, data collection policies focussing on targeting data-deficient regions and taxa need to be financially and logistically supported.

AB Experts working on behalf of international development organisations need better tools to assist land managers in developing countries maintain their livelihoods, as climate change puts pressure on the ecosystem services that they depend upon. However, current understanding of livelihood vulnerability to climate change is based on a fractured and disparate set of theories and methods. This review therefore combines theoretical insights from sustainable livelihoods analysis with other analytical frameworks (including the ecosystem services framework, diffusion theory, social learning, adaptive management and transitions management) to assess the vulnerability of rural livelihoods to climate change. This integrated analytical framework helps diagnose vulnerability to climate change, whilst identifying and comparing adaptation options that could reduce vulnerability, following four broad steps: i) determine likely level of exposure to climate change, and how climate change might interact with existing stresses and other future drivers of change; ii) determine the sensitivity of stocks of capital assets and flows of ecosystem services to climate change; iii) identify factors influencing decisions to develop and/or adopt different adaptation strategies, based on innovation or the use/substitution of existing assets; and iv) identify and evaluate potential trade-offs between adaptation options. The paper concludes by identifying interdisciplinary research needs for assessing the vulnerability of livelihoods to climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A fundamental question concerning group-living species is what factors influence the evolution of sociality. Although several studies link adult social bonds to fitness, social patterns and relationships are often formed early in life and are also likely to have fitness consequences, particularly in species with lengthy developmental periods, extensive social learning, and early social bond-formation. In a longitudinal study of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), calf social network structure, specifically the metric eigenvector centrality, predicted juvenile survival in males. Additionally, male calves that died post-weaning had stronger ties to juvenile males than surviving male calves, suggesting that juvenile males impose fitness costs on their younger counterparts. Our study indicates that selection is acting on social traits early in life and highlights the need to examine the costs and benefits of social bonds during formative life history stages.

AB As urbanisation is set to continue, understanding the impact on wildlife becomes increasingly important if we are to be able to conserve biodiversity. As an excellent group of bioindicators, invertebrates can allow us to understand some of the forces in urban areas which impact upon biodiversity and wildlife populations. This paper discusses some of the trends in the abundance, diversity and richness of invertebrates related to urbanisation and the specific urban environmental and traffic factors which may be at play.

AB Integrating stakeholder knowledge into natural resource governance is considered to add flexibility to social-ecological systems (SES) because knowledge diversity reduces rigidity, represents multiple perspectives, and promotes adaptability in decision-making. Characterizing the differences between knowledge systems, however, is not easily accomplished. There are few metrics readily available to compare one knowledge system to another. This paper characterizes knowledge about a model SES, the summer flounder fishery in the mid-Atlantic, to evaluate differences and similarities in the structural and functional characteristics of stakeholder mental models. To measure these differences, we collected Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Maps (FCM) from several stakeholder groups (managers, scientists, harvesters, pre and post harvest sectors, and environmental NGOs) which comprise social agents within the SES. We then compared stakeholder groups' maps using graph theory indices to characterize the structure and function of the model system. We then combined stakeholder FCM to generate a community map which represents a theoretical model of the combination of stakeholder knowledge. Our study indicates that while there may be benefits to integrating knowledge in resource decision-making, it also has costs associated with it. Although integrating knowledge may increase structural knowledge, it may also decrease precision in understanding of how a system functions and be overly focused on driving components which would reduce the ability of decision-makers to predict system reaction to a decision or policy plan.

AB Moisture inputs drive soil respiration (SR) dynamics in semi-arid and arid ecosystems. However, determining the contributions of root and microbial respiration to SR, and their separate temporal responses to periodic drought and water pulses, remains poorly understood. This study was conducted in a pine forest ecosystem with a Mediterranean-type climate that receives seasonally varying precipitation inputs from both rainfall (in the winter) and fog-drip (primarily in the summer). We used automated SR measurements, radiocarbon SR source partitioning, and a water addition experiment to understand how SR, and its separate root and microbial sources, respond to seasonal and episodic changes in moisture. Seasonal changes in SR were driven by surface soil water content and large changes in root respiration contributions. Superimposed on these seasonal patterns were episodic pulses of precipitation that determined the short-term SR patterns. Warm season precipitation pulses derived from fog-drip, and rainfall following extended dry periods, stimulated the largest SR responses. Microbial respiration dominated these SR responses, increasing within hours, whereas root respiration responded more slowly over days. We conclude that root and microbial respiration sources respond differently in timing and magnitude to both seasonal and episodic moisture inputs. These findings have important implications for the mechanistic representation of SR in models and the response of dry ecosystems to changes in precipitation patterns.

AB Population genetics theory is primarily based on mathematical models in which spatial complexity and temporal variability are largely ignored. In contrast, the field of landscape genetics expressly focuses on how population genetic processes are affected by complex spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. It is spatially explicit and relates patterns to processes by combining complex and realistic life histories, behaviours, landscape features and genetic data. Central to landscape genetics is the connection of spatial patterns of genetic variation to the usually highly stochastic space-time processes that create them over both historical and contemporary time periods. The field should benefit from a shift to computer simulation approaches, which enable incorporation of demographic and environmental stochasticity. A key role of simulations is to show how demographic processes such as dispersal or reproduction interact with landscape features to affect probability of site occupancy, population size, and gene flow, which in turn determine spatial genetic structure. Simulations could also be used to compare various statistical methods and determine which have correct type I error or the highest statistical power to correctly identify spatio-temporal and environmental effects. Simulations may also help in evaluating how specific spatial metrics may be used to project future genetic trends. This article summarizes some of the fundamental aspects of spatial-temporal population genetic processes. It discusses the potential use of simulations to determine how various spatial metrics can be rigorously employed to identify features of interest, including contrasting locus-specific spatial patterns due to micro-scale environmental selection.

AB The natural abundance of stable (15)N isotopes in soils and plants is potentially a simple tool to assess ecosystem N dynamics. Several open questions remain, however, in particular regarding the mechanisms driving the variability of foliar delta(15)N values of non-N(2) fixing plants within and across ecosystems. The goal of the work presented here was therefore to: ( 1) characterize the relationship between soil net mineralization and variability of foliar Delta delta(15)N (delta(15)Nleaf - delta(15) Nsoil) values from 20 different plant species within and across 18 grassland sites; (2) to determine in situ if a plant's preference for NO(3)(-) - or NH(4)(+) uptake explains variability in foliar Delta delta(15)N among different plant species within an ecosystem; and (3) test if variability in foliar Delta delta(15)N among species or functional group is consistent across 18 grassland sites. Delta delta(15)N values of the 20 different plant species were positively related to soil net mineralization rates across the 18 sites. We found that within a site, foliar Dd15N values increased with the species' NO(3)(-) to NH(4)(+) uptake ratios. Interestingly, the slope of this relationship differed in direction from previously published studies. Finally, the variability in foliar Delta delta(15)N values among species was not consistent across 18 grassland sites but was significantly influenced by N mineralization rates and the abundance of a particular species in a site. Our findings improve the mechanistic understanding of the commonly observed variability in foliar Delta delta(15)N among different plant species. In particular we were able to show that within a site, foliar delta(15)N values nicely reflect a plant's N source but that the direction of the relationship between NO(3)(-) to NH(4)(+) uptake and foliar Delta delta(15)N values is not universal. Using a large set of data, our study highlights that foliar Delta delta(15)N values are valuable tools to assess plant N uptake patterns and to characterize the soil N cycle across different ecosystems.

AB The emergence of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning debate in the last decade has renewed interest in understanding why some communities are more easily invaded than others and how the impact of invasion on recipient communities and ecosystems varies. To date most of the research on invasibility has focused on taxonomic diversity, i.e., species richness. However, functional diversity of the communities should be more relevant for the resistance of the community to invasions, as the extent of functional differences among the species in an assemblage is a major determinant of ecosystem processes.
   Although coastal marine habitats are among the most heavily invaded ecosystems, studies on community invasibility and vulnerability in these habitats are scarce. We carried out a manipulative field experiment in tide pools of the rocky intertidal to test the hypothesis that increasing functional richness reduces the susceptibility of macroalgal communities to invasion. We selected a priori four functional groups on the basis of previous knowledge of local species characteristics: encrusting, turf, subcanopy, and canopy species. Synthetic assemblages containing one, two, three, or four different functional groups of seaweeds were created, and invasion by native species was monitored over an eight-month period. Cover and resource availability in the assemblages with only one functional group showed different patterns in the use of space and light, confirming true functional differences among our groups. Experimental results showed that the identity of functional groups was more important than functional richness in determining the ability of macroalgal communities to resist invasion and that resistance to invasion was resource-mediated.

AB 1. In migratory birds males tend to arrive first on breeding grounds, except in sex-role reversed species. The two most common explanations are the rank advantage hypothesis, in which male-male competition for breeding sites drives stronger selection for early arrival in males than females, and the mate opportunity hypothesis, which relies on sexual selection, as early arrival improves prospects of mate acquisition more for males than for females.
   2. To date, theoretical work has focused on selection for early arrival within a single sex, usually male. However, if fitness depends on territory quality, selection for early arrival should operate on both sexes. Here we use two independent modelling approaches to explore the evolution of protandry (male-first arrival) and protogyny (female-first arrival) under the rank advantage and mate opportunity hypotheses.
   3. The rank advantage hypothesis, when operating alone, fails to produce consistent patterns of protandry, despite our assumption that males must occupy territories before females. This is because an individual of either sex benefits if it out-competes same-sex competitors. Rather than promoting protandry, the rank advantage mechanism can sometimes result in protogyny. Female-female competition is stronger than male-male competition early in the season, if females compete for a resource (territories occupied by males) that is initially less common than the resource of interest to males (unoccupied territories).
   4. Our results support the mate opportunity hypothesis as an explanation of why protandry is the norm in migratory systems. Male-biased adult sex ratios and high levels of sperm competition (modelled as extra-pair young: EPY) both produce protandry as a result of sexual selection. Protogyny is only observed in our models with female-biased sex ratios and low EPY production.
   5. We also show that the effects of sex ratio biases are much stronger than those of EPY production, explore the evidence for sex ratio biases and extra-pair paternity in migratory species and suggest future research directions.

AB The planting of sand-binding vegetation in the Shapotou region at the southeastern edge of the Tengger Desert began in 1956. Over the past 46 years, it has not only insured the smooth operation of the Baotou-Lanzhou railway in the sand dune section but has also played an important role in the restoration of the local eco-environment; therefore, it is viewed as a successful model for desertification control and ecological restoration along the transport line in the arid desert region of China. Long-term monitoring and focused research show that within 4-5 years of establishment of sand-binding vegetation, the physical surface structure of the sand dunes stabilized, and inorganic soil crusts formed by atmospheric dust gradually turned into microbiotic crusts. Among the organisms comprising these crusts are cryptogams such as desert algae and mosses. In the 46 years since establishing sand-binding vegetation, some 24 algal species occurred in the crusts. However, only five moss species were identified, which was fewer than the species number in the crust of naturally fixed sand dunes. Other results of the planting were that near-surface wind velocity in the 46-year-old vegetation area was reduced by 54.2% compared with that in the moving sand area; soil organic matter increased from 0.06% in moving sand dunes to 1.34% in the 46-year-old vegetation area; the main nutrients N, P, K, etc., in the desert ecosystem increased; soil physicochemical properties improved; and soil-forming processes occurred in the dune surface layer. Overall, establishment of sand-binding vegetation significantly impacted soil water cycles, creating favorable conditions for colonization by many herbaceous species. These herbaceous species, in turn, facilitated the colonization and persistence of birds, insects, soil animals, and desert animals. Forty-six years later, some 28 bird species and 50 insect species were identified in the vegetated dune field. Thus, establishment of a relatively simple community of sand-binding species led to the transformation of the relatively barren dune environment into a desert ecosystem with complex structure, composition, and function. This restoration effort shows the potential for short-term manipulation of environmental variables (i.e., plant cover via artificial vegetation establishment) to begin the long-term process of ecological restoration, particularly in arid climates, and demonstrates several techniques that can be used to scientifically monitor progress in large-scale restoration projects.

AB Biotic homogenization, the process of gradual replacement of native biotas by nonindigeous and locally expanding normative species, is rapidly diminishing the regional distinctiveness of global terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although the empirical study of biotic homogenization is substantial and growing, the mechanisms underlying its dynamics remain poorly understood. We recently developed a theoretical model that predicts levels of biotic homogenization or differentiation (i.e., decreased community similarity) according to a series of distinct mechanisms. that describe the outcomes of various interactions between native species, normative species, and the environment. Here, we test this model using empirical data for freshwater fish faunas in the United States at three spatial scales: the entire continent, zoogeographic provinces in California, and watersheds within these provinces. Our analysis reveals that, in general, mechanisms depicting widespread introductions of cosmopolitan species and either no or differential spatial patterns of native-species extirpations explain fish-community homogenization across multiple spatial scales. Our results also highlight the potential effect of spatial grain on the perceived importance of different invasion-extinction scenarios shaping patterns of homogenization and differentiation. Next, we discuss the utility of the model for providing insight into the dominant ecological processes likely driving the homogenization of other major taxonomic groups that currently lack quantitative estimates of community change. Our study is the first to quantitatively examine the relative importance of different ecological mechanisms that can generate observed patterns of biotic homogenization. Using this model may allow advance prediction of future patterns of homogenization by explicitly considering underlying ecological processes and mechanisms.

AB We sampled 143 individuals from Rancho La Brea (RLB) large faunal collections for bone collagen stable carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotope ratios. These collections were recovered from asphalt seeps in the Los Angeles Basin, California, USA, and date from -40 to 12 ka. Our findings indicate that despite a slight reduction in collagen nitrogen content, RLB skeletal remains are relatively well preserved and most yield proteins diagnostic of diet. Herbivore delta(13)C and delta(15)N values covary with rumination and are consistent with changes in late Pleistocene vegetation reconstructed from pollen profiles. We find no evidence for reliance on C-4 grasses at RLB, despite low atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Carnivore delta(15)N values indicate Canis dirus, Smilodon fatalis and Panthera leo atrox competed for similar prey sets and were equally reliant on ruminant and nonruminant prey types. The delta(15)N values of Mammut americanum indicate partial reliance on vegetation with lower delta(15)N values (such as nitrogen-fixing taxa), distinguishing them from the remainder of the study population. A comparison of RLB and European faunal delta(15)N values from the late Pleistocene suggests that coastal southern California experienced greater aridity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Six endemic genera/sections of lobeliads (Campanulaceae) occupy nearly the full range of light regimes on moist sites in the Hawaiian Islands, from open alpine bogs and seacliffs to densely shaded rainforest interiors. To determine whether this clade has undergone a corresponding adaptive radiation in photosynthetic adaptations, we studied the natural light habitats and physiological characteristics of 11 species representing each sublineage. Across species in the field, average photon flux density (PFD) varies from 2.3 to 30.0 mol.m(-1).d(-1), and maximum assimilation rate (A(max)) ranges from 0.17 to 0.35 mumol CO2.g(--1).s(-1). Across species, A(max), dark respiration rate (R), Michaelis-Menten constant (k), light compensation point, specific leaf area (SLA), maximum carboxylation rate (V-emax), maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)), photosynthesis at saturating CO2 (A(sarCo2)), and carboxylation efficiency (a) all increase significantly and in tightly coupled fashion with PFD, in accord with classical economic theory. Area-based rates have a higher degree of physiological integration with each other and tighter coupling to PFD than the corresponding mass-based rates, despite the energetic importance of the latter. Area-based rates frequently show adaptive cross-over: high-light species outperform low-light species at high PFD and vice versa at low PFD. A(max)-mass has little relationship to leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf N content, or leaf lifespan individually, but a multiple regression explains 96% of the variance in A(max)-mass across species in terms of SLA, leaf N content, and average PFD. Instantaneous leaf compensation points range from 0.1 to 1.2% full sunlight, far lower than the ecological (whole-plant) compensation points (ECPs) of 1.1 to 29.0% sunlight calculated based on photosynthetic parameters, leaf longevity, and allocation to leaf vs. nonleaf tissue. The ECPs are much closer to the lower limits of PFD actually experienced by lobeliads, suggesting they may play an important role in restricting species distributions. Taken together, these data provide evidence for an adaptive radiation in photosynthetic traits that is strongly correlated with-and indeed may help determine-the light regime that each species inhabits.

AB In this work we consider the geometrical model of R. A. Fisher, in which individuals are characterized by a number of phenotypic characters under optimizing selection. Recent work on this model by H. A. Orr has demonstrated that as the number of characters increases, there is a significant reduction in the rate of adaptation. Orr has dubbed this a "cost of complexity." Although there is little evidence as to whether such a cost applies in the natural world, we suggest that the prediction is surprising, at least naively. With this in mind, we examine the robustness of Orr's prediction by modifying the model in various ways that might reduce or remove the cost. In particular, we explore the suggestion that modular pleiotropy, in which mutations affect only a subset of the traits, could play an important role. We conclude that although modifications of the model can mitigate the cost to a limited extent, Orr's finding is robust.

AB Aim In this study, we examine patterns of local and regional ant species richness along three elevational gradients in an arid ecosystem. In addition, we test the hypothesis that changes in ant species richness with elevation are related to elevation-dependent changes in climate and available area.
   Location Spring Mountains, Nevada, U.S.A.
   Methods We used pitfall traps placed at each 100-m elevational band in three canyons in the Spring Mountains. We compiled climate data from 68 nearby weather stations. We used multiple regression analysis to examine the effects of annual precipitation, average July precipitation, and maximum and minimum July temperature on ant species richness at each elevational band.
   Results We found that patterns of local ant species richness differed among the three gradients we sampled. Ant species richness increased linearly with elevation along two transects and peaked at mid-elevation along a third transect. This suggests that patterns of species richness based on data from single transects may not generalize to larger spatial scales. Cluster analysis of community similarity revealed a high-elevation species assemblage largely distinct from that of lower elevations. Major changes in the identity of ant species present along elevational gradients tended to coincide with changes in the dominant vegetation. Regional species richness, defined here as the total number of unique species within an elevational band in all three gradients combined, tended to increase with increasing elevation. Available area decreased with increasing elevation. Area was therefore correlated negatively with ant species richness and did not explain elevational patterns of ant species richness in the Spring Mountains. Mean July maximum and minimum temperature, July precipitation and annual precipitation combined to explain 80% of the variation in ant species richness.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that in arid ecosystems, species richness for some taxa may be highest at high elevations, where lower temperatures and higher precipitation may support higher levels of primary production and cause lower levels of physiological stress.

AB Body mass is a key determinant of fitness components in many organisms, and adult mass varies considerably among individuals within populations. These variations have several causes, involve temporal and spatial factors, and are not yet well understood. We use long-term data from 20 roe deer cohorts (1977-96) in a 2600 ha study area (Chize, western France) with two habitats contrasting in quality (rich oak forest in the North versus poor beech forest in the South) to analyse the effects of both cohort and habitat quality on adult mass (i.e. median body mass between 4 and 10 years of age) of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Cohort strongly influenced the adult body mass of roe deer in both sexes: males born in 1994 were 5.2 kg heavier when aged between 4 and 10 years old than males born in 1986, while females born in 1995 were 4.7 kg heavier between 4 and 10 years old than females born in 1982. For a given cohort, adult males were, on average, 0.9 kg heavier in the rich oak forest than in the poor beech forest. A similar trend occurred for adult females (0.5 kg heavier in the oak forest). The effects of cohort and habitat were additive and accounted for ca. 40% of the variation observed in the adult mass of roe deer at Chize (males: 41.2%; females: 40.2%). Population density during the spring of the birth accounted for about 35% of cohort variation, whereas rainfall in May-June had no effect. Such delayed effects of density at birth on adult body mass probably affect population dynamics, and might constitute a mechanism by which delayed density-dependence occurs in ungulate populations.

AB In a microcosm experiment, I tested how species composition, species, richness. and community age affect the Susceptibility of grassland communities to invasion by a noxious weed (Centaurea solstitialis L.). I also examined how these factors influenced Centaurea's impact on the rest of the plant community.
   When grown in monoculture, eight species found in California's grasslands differed widely in their ability to suppress Centaurea growth. The most effective competitor in monoculture was Hemizonia congesta ssp. luzulifolia, which, like Centaurea, is a summer-active annual forb. On average, Centaurea growth decreased as the species richness of communities increased. However, no polyculture suppressed Centaurea growth more than the monoculture of Hemizonia. Centaurea generally made up a Smaller proportion of community, biomass in newly created ("new" microcosms than in older ("established") microcosms, largely because Centaurea's competitors were more productive in the new treatment. Measures of complementarity suggest that Centaurea partitioned resources with annual grasses in the new microcosms. This resource partitioning may help to explain Centaurea's great success in western North American grasslands.
   Centaurea strongly suppressed growth of some species, but hardly affected others. Annual grasses were the least affected species in the new monocultures, and perennial grasses were among the least affected species in the established monocultures. In the new microcosms. Centaurea's suppression of competing species marginally abated with increasing species, richness. This trend was a consequence of the declining success of Centaurea in species-rich communities, rather than a change in the vulnerability of these communities to suppression by a given amount of the invader. The impact of the invader was not related to specie., richness in the established microcosms. The results or this study suggest that, at the neighborhood level, diversity can limit invasibility and may reduce the impact of all invader.

AB 1. Landscape modification is often considered the principal cause of population decline in many bat species. Thus, schemes for bat conservation rely heavily on knowledge about species-landscape relationships. So far, however, few studies have quantified the possible influence of landscape structure on large-scale spatial patterns in bat communities.
   2. This study presents quantitative models that use landscape structure to predict (i) spatial patterns in overall community composition and (ii) individual species' distributions through canonical correspondence analysis and generalized linear models, respectively. A geographical information system (GIS) was then used to draw up maps of (i) overall community patterns and (ii) distribution of potential species' habitats. These models relied on field data from the Swiss Jura mountains.
   3. Fight descriptors of landscape structure accounted for 30% of the variation in bat community composition. For some species, more than 60% of the variance in distribution could be explained by landscape structure. Elevation, forest or woodland cover, lakes and suburbs, were the most frequent predictors.
   4. This study shows that community composition in bats is related to landscape structure through species-specific relationships to resources. Due to their nocturnal activities and the difficulties of remote identification, a comprehensive bat census is rarely possible, and we suggest that predictive modelling of the type described here provides an indispensable conservation tool.

ID MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEMS
AB Urban metabolism measures quantitatively a city's load on the natural environment. We update the Newcombe et al. (3) pioneering study of Hong Kong's urban metabolism in 1971, highlighting trends in resource consumption and waste generation. Per capita food, water and materials consumption have surged since the early 1970s by 20%, 40%, and 149%, respectively. Tremendous pollution has accompanied this growing affluence and materialism, and total air emissions, CO2 Outputs, municipal solid wastes, and sewage discharges have risen by 30%, 250%, 245%, and 153%. As a result, systemic overload of land, atmospheric and water systems has occurred. While some strategies to tackle deteriorating environmental quality have succeeded, greater and more far-reaching changes in consumer behavior and government policy are needed if Hong Kong is to achieve its stated goal of becoming "a truly sustainable city" in the 21(st) century.

AB Three procedures for the estimation of null allele frequencies and gene diversity from dominant multilocus data were empirically tested in natural populations of the outcrossing angiosperm Persoonia mollis (Proteaceae). The three procedures were the square root transform of the null homozygote frequency, the Lynch & Milligan procedure, and the Bayesian method. Genotypes for each of 116 polymorphic loci generated by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) were inferred from segregation patterns in progeny arrays. Therefore, for the plus phenotype (band present), heterozygotes were distinguished from homozygotes. In contrast to previous studies, all three procedures produced very similar mean estimates of heterozygosity, which were in turn accurate estimators of the direct value (H-O = 0.28). A second population of P. mollis displayed markedly lower levels of heterozygosity (H-O = 0.20) but approximately twice as many polymorphic loci (284). These AFLP results show that biases in estimates of average null allele frequency and heterozygosity are largely eliminated in highly polymorphic dominant marker data sets displaying a J-shaped beta distribution with a high percentage of loci containing more than three null homozygotes and relatively few loci with no null homozygotes. This distribution may be typical of outcrossing angiosperms.

AB Disturbance of coastal sage scrub in southern California has led to extensive displacement of native shrubs by exotic annual grasses. The initial conversion from shrubland to exotic grassland is typically associated with disturbance caused by intense grazing, high fire frequency, or mechanical vegetation removal. While native shrubs have been shown to recolonize annual grasslands under some conditions, other annual grasslands are persistent and show no evidence of shrub recolonization. This study examined the mechanisms by which annual grasses may exclude native shrubs and persist after release from disturbance. Grass density was manipulated in experimental plots to achieve a series of prescribed densities. Artemisia californica, a dominant native shrub, was seeded or planted into the plots and responses to the grass density treatments were measured over two growing seasons. A. californica germination, first season growth, and survival were all negatively related to the density of neighboring annual grasses. The most probable mechanism underlying the reduction of first season growth and survival was depletion of soil water by the grasses. The effects of the grasses on A. californica were no longer significant in the second season. The results of this study indicate that Mediterranean annual grasses reduce recruitment and can persist by inhibiting post-disturbance establishment of A. californica from seed. Although succession alone may not return disturbed annual grasslands to their former shrubland composition, the results suggest that restoration can be achieved by using container plantings or grass removal followed by seeding.

AB Biochar is widely considered as effective way of sequestering carbon dioxide. The possibility of using it to enhance the mechanical strength and reduce permeability of cement mortar is explored in this study. The effect of fresh biochar and biochar saturated with carbon dioxide a priori on the setting time, mechanical strength and permeability of cement mortar was evaluated. The biochar was prepared from mixed wood saw dust at 300 degrees C and added to mortar during mixing at 2% by weight of cement It was found that addition of fresh biochar and saturated biochar reduce initial setting time and significantly improve early compressive strength of mortar. The experimental results suggested that biochar addition can impart ductility to mortar under flexure, although flexural strength was not significantly influenced. Water penetration and sorptivity of mortar was significantly reduced due to addition of biochar, which indicate higher impermeability in biochar added mortar. However, it is found that addition of fresh biochar offers significantly higher mechanical strength and improved permeability compared to biochar saturated with carbon dioxide. These results suggest that biochar has the potential to be successfully deployed as a carbon sequestering admixture in concrete constructions that also provides a way to waste recycling.

AB Citizen science D the involvement of volunteers in data collection, analysis and interpretation D simultaneously supports research and public engagement with science, and its profile is rapidly rising. Citizen science represents a diverse range of approaches, but until now this diversity has not been quantitatively explored. We conducted a systematic internet search and discovered 509 environmental and ecological citizen science projects. We scored each project for 32 attributes based on publicly obtainable information and used multiple factor analysis to summarise this variation to assess citizen science approaches. We found that projects varied according to their methodological approach from 'mass participation' (e.g. easy participation by anyone anywhere) to 'systematic monitoring' (e.g. trained volunteers repeatedly sampling at specific locations). They also varied in complexity from approaches that are 'simple' to those that are ` elaborate' (e.g. provide lots of support to gather rich, detailed datasets). There was a separate cluster of entirely computer-based projects but, in general, we found that the range of citizen science projects in ecology and the environment showed continuous variation and cannot be neatly categorised into distinct types of activity. While the diversity of projects begun in each time period (pre 1990, 1990 - 99, 2000 - 09 and 2010 - 13) has not increased, we found that projects tended to have become increasingly different from each other as time progressed (possibly due to changing opportunities, including technological innovation). Most projects were still active so consequently we found that the overall diversity of active projects (available for participation) increased as time progressed. Overall, understanding the landscape of citizen science in ecology and the environment (and its change over time) is valuable because it informs the comparative evaluation of the ` success' of different citizen science approaches. Comparative evaluation provides an evidence- base to inform the future development of citizen science activities.

AB Land plants underpin a multitude of ecosystem functions, support human livelihoods and represent a critically important component of terrestrial biodiversity-yet many tens of thousands of species await discovery, and plant identification remains a substantial challenge, especially where material is juvenile, fragmented or processed. In this opinion article, we tackle two main topics. Firstly, we provide a short summary of the strengths and limitations of plant DNA barcoding for addressing these issues. Secondly, we discuss options for enhancing current plant barcodes, focusing on increasing discriminatory power via either gene capture of nuclear markers or genome skimming. The former has the advantage of establishing a defined set of target loci maximizing efficiency of sequencing effort, data storage and analysis. The challenge is developing a probe set for large numbers of nuclear markers that works over sufficient phylogenetic breadth. Genome skimming has the advantage of using existing protocols and being backward compatible with existing barcodes; and the depth of sequence coverage can be increased as sequencing costs fall. Its non-targeted nature does, however, present a major informatics challenge for upscaling to large sample sets.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'From DNA barcodes to biomes'.

AB Two main effects are proposed to explain biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships: niche complementarity and selection effects. Both can be functionally defined using the functional diversity (FD) and functional identity (FI) of the community respectively. Herein, we present results from the first tree diversity experiment that separated the effect of selection from that of complementarity by varying community composition in high-density plots along a gradient of FD, independent of species richness and testing for the effects of FD and community weighted means of traits (a proxy for FI) on stem biomass increment (a proxy for productivity). After 4 years of growth, most mixtures did not differ in productivity from the averages of their respective monocultures, but some did overyield significantly. Those positive diversity effects resulted mostly from selection effects, primarily driven by fast-growing deciduous species and associated traits. Net diversity effect did not increase with time over 4 years.

AB With rapid development and the spread of urbanized land, there is an increasing need to understand species' responses to urban conditions. Carnivores are considered to be sensitive to urbanization; however, there is ample evidence that some carnivore species successfully inhabit urban areas, and human-modified habitats have recently been recognized as an important refuge for several species. Despite the increasing number of studies on urban carnivore ecology, no comprehensive cross-species comparisons have been made in order to assess the effects of urbanization on the spatial ecology of carnivores and their population densities. Such a review could provide interesting insight into how some carnivore species respond to increasing urbanization. Specifically, we examine changes in population density and home range size of eight carnivore species that occur along the natural-urban environmental gradient. Using data from 411 articles, we provide evidence that the home range size of carnivores decreases in six out of eight species, and population density increases in three out of six species along the natural-urban habitat gradient. The density-dependent pattern of variation in home range size is consistent in all species studied. Our results emphasize the remarkable ability of some carnivore species to adapt to novel environments through their behavioural flexibility and life history adaptations. We outline ideas for future research that could be adopted in addressing this phenomenon, namely comparative approaches and detailed studies of biotic and abiotic conditions along natural-urban gradients.

AB Despite rapid advancements in the development of non-monetary techniques for the assessment of social values for ecosystem services, little research attention has been devoted to the evaluation of their underpinning paradigms. This study evaluates two contrasting paradigms for the assessment of social values in non-monetary terms: an instrumental paradigm involving an objective assessment of the distribution, type and/or intensity of values that individuals assign to the current state of ecosystems and a deliberative paradigm involving the exploration of desired end states through group discussion. We present and then justify through case examples two approaches for assessing social values for ecosystem services using the instrumental paradigm and two approaches using the deliberative paradigm. Each approach makes different assumptions about: the underlying rationale for values assessment; the process through which values are elicited; the type of representativeness sought, and; the degree of involvement of decision-makers. However, case examples demonstrate that the boundaries between instrumental and deliberative paradigms are often not concrete. To accommodate this fluidity, we offer a third, pragmatic paradigm that integrates some of the qualities of both. This paradigm has implications for engaging multiple community groups and decision-makers in the articulation and mapping of social values for cultural ecosystem services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The perceived threat of climate change is often evaluated from species distribution models that are fitted to many species independently and then added together. This approach ignores the fact that species are jointly distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the same underlying climatic variables, and the abundance of any one species can be constrained by competition; a large increase in one is inevitably linked to declines of others. Omitting this basic relationship explains why responses modeled independently do not agree with the species richness or basal areas of actual forests.
   We introduce a joint species distribution modeling approach (JSDM), which is unique in three ways, and apply it to forests of eastern North America. First, it accommodates the joint distribution of species. Second, this joint distribution includes both abundance and presence-absence data. We solve the common issue of large numbers of zeros in abundance data by accommodating zeros in both stem counts and basal area data, i.e., a new approach to zero inflation. Finally, inverse prediction can be applied to the joint distribution of predictions to integrate the role of climate risks across all species and identify geographic areas where communities will change most (in terms of changes in abundance) with climate change. Application to forests in the eastern United States shows that climate can have greatest impact in the Northeast, due to temperature, and in the Upper Midwest, due to temperature and precipitation. Thus, these are the regions experiencing the fastest warming and are also identified as most responsive at this scale.

AB There is currently, widespread interest in the assessment of ecosystem services, and the new insights that the concept provides in understanding the ecology of landscapes and the science of sustainability. Three major assessment frameworks can be identified in the contemporary literature, namely one based on habitats, one based on the identification of the system elements that delivers the service, and one based on the understanding of places. Although all are useful for supporting decision making in relation to sustainable development, different situations require different perspectives, and so it is important to understand their advantages and drawbacks. Moreover, it is important to determine how they relate to other approaches used, for example, in landscape planning, so that the contribution that ecosystem assessments can make to sustainability debates can be better understood. The aim of this paper is to describe the strengths of the place-based approach because it is more easily overlooked as an assessment option. In particular we will argue that a place-based approach can help us better understand issues of multi-functionality, the valuation of natural capital and the role of landscape in framing debates about ecosystem services and sustainability. An appreciation of these issues will enable researchers interested in landscape to key questions and priorities in relation to questions of sustainability. Although it is useful to consider different assessment perspectives separately, we conclude that in practice, the habitat and systems approaches can form part of a place-based assessment, just as a better understanding of place can enrich assessments that spring from these more natural science approaches. Nevertheless, in designing analytical strategies to take the ecosystem approach forward, we suggest that it is vital to consider these different perspectives in order to build assessments that are relevant, legitimate and credible, and which can effectively address the problems of sustainability that emerge at the landscape scale.

AB The North-Atlantic has warmed faster than all other ocean basins and climate change scenarios predict sea surface temperature isotherms to shift up to 600km northwards by the end of the 21st century. The pole-ward shift has already begun for many temperate seaweed species that are important intertidal foundation species. We asked the question: Where will climate change have the greatest impact on three foundational, macroalgal species that occur along North-Atlantic shores: Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, and Ascophyllum nodosum? To predict distributional changes of these key species under three IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) over the coming two centuries, we generated Ecological Niche Models with the program MAXENT. Model predictions suggest that these three species will shift northwards as an assemblage or unit and that phytogeographic changes will be most pronounced in the southern Arctic and the southern temperate provinces. Our models predict that Arctic shores in Canada, Greenland, and Spitsbergen will become suitable for all three species by 2100. Shores south of 45 degrees North will become unsuitable for at least two of the three focal species on both the Northwest- and Northeast-Atlantic coasts by 2200. If these foundational species are unable to adapt to the rising temperatures, they will lose their centers of genetic diversity and their loss will trigger an unpredictable shift in the North-Atlantic intertidal ecosystem.

AB Current climate change exacerbates the environmental restrictions on temperate species inhabiting low latitude edges of their geographical ranges. We examined how temperature variations due to current and future climate change are likely to affect populations persistence of stream-dwelling brown trout Salmo trutta at the vulnerable southern periphery of its range. Analysis of 33 years of air temperature data (19752007) by time-series models indicated a significant upward trend and a pronounced shift in air temperature around 1986-1987. This warming is associated with an ongoing population decline of brown trout, most likely caused by a loss of suitable thermal habitat in lower latitudes since the 1980s. Population decrease may not be attributed to physical habitat modification or angler pressure, as carrying capacity remained stable and populations were not overexploited. We developed regional temperature models, which predicted that unsuitable thermal habitat for brown trout increased by 93% when comparing climate conditions between 19751986 and 19932004. Predictions from climate envelope models showed that current climate change may be rendering unsuitable 12% of suitable thermal habitat each decade, resulting in an overall population decrease in the lower reaches of around 6% per year. Furthermore, brown trout catches markedly decreased 20% per year. Projections of thermal habitat loss under the ecologically friendly B2 SRES scenario showed that brown trout may lose half of their current suitable habitat within the study area by 2040 and become almost extinct by 2100. In parallel to the upstream movement of brown trout thermal habitat, warm water species are increasing their relative abundance in salmonid waters. Empirical evidence was provided of how current climate change threatens some of the most healthy native brown trout populations in Southern Europe and how forthcoming climate change is expected to further decrease the conservation status of the species.

AB The accurate quantification of gross primary production (GPP) in crops is important for regional and global studies of carbon budgets. Because of the observed close relationship between GPP and total canopy chlorophyll content in crops, vegetation indices related to chlorophyll can be used as a proxy of GPP. In this study, we justified the approach, tested the performance of several widely used chlorophyll-related vegetation indices in estimating total chlorophyll content and GPP in maize based on spectral data collected at a close range, 6 meters above the top of the canopy, over a period of eight years (2001 to 2008). The results show that GPP can be accurately estimated with chlorophyll-related indices that use near infra-red and either green or the red edge range of the spectrum. These indices provide the best approximation of the widely variable GPP in maize under both irrigated and rainfed conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Rare species have restricted geographic ranges, habitat specialization, and/or small population sizes. Datasets on rare species distribution usually have few observations, limited spatial accuracy and lack of valid absences; conversely they provide comprehensive views of species distributions allowing to realistically capture most of their realized environmental niche. Rare species are the most in need of predictive distribution modelling but also the most difficult to model. We refer to this contrast as the "rare species modelling paradox" and propose as a solution developing modelling approaches that deal with a sufficiently large set of predictors, ensuring that statistical models are not over-fitted. Our novel approach fulfils this condition by fitting a large number of bivariate models and averaging them with a weighted ensemble approach. We further propose that this ensemble forecasting is conducted within a hierarchic multi-scale framework. We present two ensemble models for a test species, one at regional and one at local scale, each based on the combination of 630 models. In both cases, we obtained excellent spatial projections, unusual when modelling rare species. Model results highlight, from a statistically sound approach, the effects of multiple drivers in a same modelling framework and at two distinct scales. From this added information, regional models can support accurate forecasts of range dynamics under climate change scenarios, whereas local models allow the assessment of isolated or synergistic impacts of changes in multiple predictors. This novel framework provides a baseline for adaptive conservation, management and monitoring of rare species at distinct spatial and temporal scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There has been considerable debate about the role of hybrids in the evolutionary process. One question has involved the relative fitness of hybrid versus non-hybrid genotypes. For some, the assumption of lower hybrid fitness continues to be integral to their concept of species and speciation. In contrast, numerous workers have suggested that hybrid genotypes might demonstrate higher relative fitness under various environmental settings. Of particular importance in deciding between these opposing hypotheses are long-term analyses coupling ecological and genetic information. Although currently rare, such analyses have provided a test of the fitness of hybrid genotypes across generations and habitats and their role in adaptation and speciation. Here we discuss examples of these analyses applied to viruses, prokaryotes, plants and Darwin's Finches.

ID ELECTRICITY SUPPLY INVESTMENT; TECHNOLOGY; SECURITY; POWER;

AB This paper outlines a novel general framework for analysing energy diversity. A critical review of different reasons for policy interest reveals that diversity is more than a supply security strategy. There are particular synergies with strategies for transitions to sustainability. Yet - despite much important work - policy analysis tends to address only a subset of the properties of diversity and remains subject to ambiguity, neglect and special pleading. Developing earlier work, the paper proposes a more comprehensive heuristic framework, accommodating a wide range of different disciplinary and sociopolitical perspectives. It is argued that the associated multicriteria diversity analysis method provides a more systematic, complete and transparent way to articulate disparate perspectives and approaches and so help to inform more robust and accountable policymaking.

AB Studies of mate choice in vertebrates have focused principally on birds, in which male ornaments are often highly developed, and have shown that females commonly select mates on the basis of particular phenotypic characteristics that may reflect their genetic quality. Studies of female mate choice in mammals are less highly developed, and they have commonly focused on female mating preferences that are likely to be maintained by benefits to the female's own survival or breeding success. However, recent experimental studies of mate choice in mammals-especially rodents-provide increasing evidence of consistent female preferences that appear likely to generate benefits to the fitness of offspring. As yet, there is no compelling evidence that female mating preferences are less highly developed in female mammals than in female birds, although these preferences may more often be masked by the effects of male competition or of attempts by males to constrain female choice.

AB Most wildfires, even the most severe, burn at mixed intensities across a landscape, depending on local fuel loads, fuel moistures, and wind strength and direction. This heterogeneous patchwork of fire effects can influence the patterns of above- and belowground biotic recovery through altered environmental conditions, nutrient availability, and biotic sources for microbial and vegetative re-colonization. We quantified the effects of low- and high-severity fire 14 months post-burn on key environmental variables typically limiting to microbial activity. We characterized the soil microbial community structure through ester-linked fatty acid analysis (EL-FAME) and identified the soil environmental factors that best explain the pattern of microbial community profiles through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Low-severity burning caused no change in soil moisture, pH or temperature while high-severity burning caused an increase in soil moisture, temperature, and a decrease in pH levels, relative to the unburned sites. Soil respiration rates were significantly lower in both the low- and high-severity burn sites, relative to unburned sites, likely due to initial root and microbial death. Overall microbial biomass did not change with either low- or high-severity burning, but the microbial community ordination biplots showed separation of communities by fire, and slight separation by fire severity along three axes. This community separation was driven primarily by a decrease in fungal biomarkers (18:2 omega 6c, 18:3 omega 6c) with both low- and high-severity fire. Only 23% of the variation in the microbial community distribution could be explained by three environmental variables: soil pH, temperature, and carbon. These results suggest that the microbial communities in both the low- and high-severity burn sites are structurally different from the populations in the unburned sites. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The fitness effects of mutations on a given genotype are rarely constant across environments to which this genotype is more or less adapted, that is, between more or less stressful conditions. This can have important implications, especially on the evolution of ecological specialization. Stress is thought to increase the variance of mutations' fitness effects, their average, or the number of expressed Mutations. Although empirical evidence is available for these three mechanisms, their relative magnitude is Poorly Understood. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to discriminate between these mechanisms. using a Survey of empirical measures of imitation effects in contrasted environments. This survey, across various species and environments, shows that stress mainly increases the variance of Mutations' effects on fitness, with a Much more limited impact on their average effect or on the number of expressed initiations. This pattern is consistent with a simple model in which fitness is a Gaussian function of phenotypes around an environmentally determined optimum. These results Suggest that a simple, mathematically tractable landscape model may not be quantitatively as unrealistic as previously Suggested. They also Suggest that mutation parameter estimates may be strongly biased when measured in stressful environments.

AB We evaluated the oxidative cost paid by birds when coping with an immune challenge. We used the phytohaemagglutinin skin test (PHA) to assess the effects of the T-cell-mediated immune response on the concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs), total antioxidant barrier (OXY) and total serum carotenoid concentration in wild nestlings of the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Immunostimulation caused increased levels of ROMs, decreased OXY and increased circulating levels of carotenoids. These results suggest that an immune challenge can increase avian oxidative stress, and that carotenoids were remobilised from other tissues likely because their circulating levels were not sufficiently high to sustain an effective immune response.

AB Efforts to anticipate threats to biodiversity take the form of species richness predictions (SRPs) based on simple correlations with current climate and habitat area. We review the major approaches that have been used for SRP, species-area curves and climate envelopes, and suggest that alternative research efforts may provide more understanding and guidance for management. Extinction prediction suffers from a number of limitations related to data and the novelty of future environments. We suggest additional attention to (1) identification of variables related to biodiversity that are diagnostic and potentially more predictable than extinction, (2) constraints on species dispersal and reproduction that will determine population persistence and range shifts, including limited sources or potential immigrants for many regions, and (3) changes in biotic interactions and phenology. We suggest combinations of observational and experimental approaches within a framework available for ingesting heterogeneous data sources. Together, these recommendations amount to a shift in emphasis from prediction of extinction numbers to identification of vulnerabilities and leading indicators of change, as well as suggestions for surveillance tools needed to evaluate important variables and the experiments likely to provide most insight.

AB Competition theory has put forward three contrasting hypotheses: Competition for nutrients and light may lead to (i) stable coexistence of species, (ii) alternative stable states, or (iii) competitive exclusion. This paper presents a detailed investigation of competition among phytoplankton species to test these three different hypotheses. First, we developed a competition model combining competition for nutrients and light. Next, we ran monoculture experiments in phosphorus-limited and light-limited chemostats to estimate the model parameters for five freshwater phytoplankton species. Finally, we tested the model predictions in competition experiments, using phosphorus levels ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions. The population dynamics in the competition experiments were all in agreement with the model predictions. This demonstrates that competition for nutrients and light can be accurately predicted over a wide range of productivities. The experiments revealed that the intensity of competition remained constant or even decreased with increasing nutrient supply. Contrary to expectation, there were no trade-offs between competitive abilities for phosphorus and light. Species that were strong competitors for phosphorus were strong competitors for light as well. Hence, we found neither stable coexistence nor alternative stable states. All competition experiments led to competitive exclusion. Furthermore, the physiological traits of the species indicated that, if one would find trade-offs in competitive abilities, competition for phosphorus and light would lead to alternative stable states rather than to stable coexistence. These results suggest that stable coexistence mediated by competition for phosphorus and light is rare, and hence an unlikely explanation for the high biodiversity commonly found in phytoplankton communities.

ID COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; COEFFICIENT; DIVERSITY; SEDIMENT; GRADIENT
AB Multivariate analysis of species assemblage data often begins with transformation of abundances, to downweight contributions from dominant taxa to Bray-Curtis dissimilarities computed among samples. Although usually effective, global transformation is a blunt tool: it ignores differences in the variance structure of counts of individual species. Species which are highly spatially clustered should logically be given less weight than those with similar mean abundance but whose replicate counts have the lower variance associated with Poisson distributions (for which individual organisms arrive randomly and independently into the sample). Where replicates are available within sample groups specified a priori, this differential downweighting is achieved by dividing the counts for each species by their index of dispersion D, the variance to mean ratio, a clustering ('clurnping') measure calculated from replicates within a group, and then averaged across groups. The procedure is justified by assuming a generalised Poisson model for counts, allowing different species to have arbitrarily differing degrees of clustering. Downweighting is applied only where a species shows significant evidence of clumping, this being tested by a powerful, exact permutation test that replaces the standard (large-sample) chi(2) test for D = 1, which is often invalid because of low 'expected' frequencies. The resulting dispersion-weighted data matrix has a common (Poisson-like) variance structure across species, but unchanged relative responses of a species in different groups. Transformation may still be needed but now only to downweight consistently abundant species relative to equally consistent but less numerous species, rather than also dealing with erratic counts. Dispersion weighting is shown to be effective in 3 studies that examine: soft-sediment copepods in the metal-polluted Fal estuary, UK; benthic macrofauna of mangrove forests in Bicentennial Park, New South Wales, Australia; and sediment nematodes within and outside seagrass beds in the Yealm estuary, UK. A fourth data set, on macrobenthos from Loch Creran, UK, is added to a comparison of the differing cross-species distributions of the dispersion index.

AB TO ecology, populations may be linked conceptually with landscapes through habitat and spatial population models. Usually, these models deal with single species and treat a range of uncertainties implicitly and explicitly. They assist managers in testing different management scenarios and making strategic decisions. Landscape pattern analysis was the first attempt to deal with multiple species, and it led to a range of landscape management strategies. Advances in landscape ecology, driven largely by the pragmatic needs of conservation, are building approaches to multispecies management that have stronger ecological foundations. However, their treatment of uncertainty is in its infancy. In this paper, we provide examples to illustrate some of these issues. We conclude that one of the most important sources of uncertainty is the choice of the modeling frame. We recommend that landscape planners use different kinds of models, identify important sources of uncertainty that may affect planning decisions, and seek options that are likely to result in tolerable outcomes, despite uncertainty.

AB Coexistence of two organisms competing for the same nutrient is possible if one is an 'uptake', and the other a 'predation defence' specialist. In pelagic food webs this principle has been linked to cell size. Small osmotroph cells, with their high surface : volume ratio, have been argued to be uptake specialists, while larger osmotrophs avoiding the intense grazing pressure from small protozoan predators might represent 'predation defence' specialists. This may seem like an obligatory trade-off situation that necessitates a choice of either being small or being large, and thus being potentially dominant in oligotrophic or in eutrophic environments, respectively. However, in a more precise form, the theory for nutrient diffusion states that it is the 'surface : cell requirement of limiting element' ratio, rather than the 'surface : volume' ratio, that is important. The distinction is crucial, since it opens up the possibility of there being life strategies that use a non-limiting element to increase size. Hypothesized to maximize uptake and predator defence simultaneously, such strategies should be particularly successful. We suggest that this strategy is exploited by osmotrophs with different size and physiology, such as heterotrophic bacteria, unicellular cyanobacteria and diatoms. Since the strategy implies a shift in organism stoichiometry, the biogeochemical implications are strong, illustrating the tight relationships between physical micro-scale processes, organism life strategies, biodiversity, food web structure, and biogeochemistry.

AB Sexual selection often favors brighter and exaggerated traits, which also increase the risk of detection by predators. Signals that are preferentially conspicuous to conspecifics would reduce the predation cost of signaling and, therefore, might facilitate the evolution of stronger sexual and social signals. This selective signaling is possible if predators and prey have differently tuned sensory systems. By using a retinal model to compare reflectance from the plumages of Swedish songbirds to the reflectance of their natural backgrounds, we found their color badges to be significantly more conspicuous to other songbirds (which have a UV-tuned visual system) than to raptors and corvids (which have a violet-tuned system) in both coniferous and deciduous forests, consistent with an adaptive private communication system.

AB Individual animals from the same population, sex, age and reproductive status often respond differently and consistently to predators. One important dimension of this behavioural variation is the shy-bold continuum. Innate differences in boldness might explain why individuals differ in their antipredator behaviour. In a laboratory experiment, we examined the sources of individual variation in antipredator behaviour of adult male lizards Lacerta monticola. We simulated in the laboratory repeated predatory attacks of low or high risk and analysed activity levels and refuge use in both situations. Multivariate analyses suggested the existence of two consistent and independent shy-bold continua. The first described a gradient from bold lizards that spent shorter times in the refuge after predatory approaches to shy lizards with longer emergence times, whereas the other described a gradient from bold lizards with a low propensity to hide when the predator was close but risk was low to shy lizards that hid more often. We analysed whether morphological characteristics, body condition and health (estimated from their T cell immunocompetence) of individuals might account for the differences observed. Bold individuals had smaller absolute body size, but relatively larger heads, better body condition and better health. Bold individuals with a low propensity to hide when risk was low had larger absolute body sizes, whereas relative head size, and body condition and health were not important. We suggest that the position of an individual in the shy-bold continua might reflect its optimal antipredator behaviour, which would be a function of its health, general quality and ability to evade predators.

AB Inferring the spatial expansion dynamics of invading species from molecular data is notoriously difficult due to the complexity of the processes involved. For these demographic scenarios, genetic data obtained from highly variable markers may be profitably combined with specific sampling schemes and information from other sources using a Bayesian approach. The geographic range of the introduced toad Bufo marinus is still expanding in eastern and northern Australia, in each case from isolates established around 1960. A large amount of demographic and historical information is available on both expansion areas. In each area, samples were collected along a transect representing populations of different ages and genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci. Five demographic models of expansion, differing in the dispersal pattern for migrants and founders and in the number of founders, were considered. Because the demographic history is complex, we used an approximate Bayesian method, based on a rejection-regression algorithm. to formally test the relative likelihoods of the five models of expansion and to infer demographic parameters. A stepwise migration-foundation model with founder events was statistically better supported than other four models in both expansion areas. Posterior distributions supported different dynamics of expansion in the studied areas. Populations in the eastern expansion area have a lower stable effective population size and have been founded by a smaller number of individuals than those in the northern expansion area. Once demographically stabilized, populations exchange a substantial number of effective migrants per generation in both expansion areas, and such exchanges are larger in northern than in eastern Australia. The effective number of migrants appears to be considerably lower than that of founders in both expansion areas. We found our inferences to be relatively robust to various assumptions on marker. demographic, and historical features. The method presented here is the only robust, model-based method available so far, which allows inferring complex population dynamics over a short time scale. It also provides the basis for investigating the interplay between population dynamics, drift, and selection in invasive species.

AB We evaluate the alpha (within patch species richness), beta (spatial turnover among patches) and gamma (landscape) diversity of frogs in a tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) in central Veracruz, Mexico in order to assess (1) the influence of forest fragmentation on frog assemblages, (2) the importance to diversity of the various elements of the landscape matrix, including the shaded coffee plantations and cattle pastures that surround TMCF and (3) to identify the frog guilds most affected by habitat transformation. We sampled ten sites between May 1998 and November 2000: five TMCF fragments and five anthropogenic habitats. For the entire landscape, we registered 21 species belonging to six families. 100% of these were found in the TMCF fragments and 62% in the surrounding mosaic of anthropogenic habitats. Gamma diversity (gamma) is determined to a greater extent by species exchange (beta) than by local species richness (alpha). Elevational variation, the degree of conservation of the vegetation canopy and fragment size appear to determine the species diversity of this landscape. Large species, terrestrial species, those whose eggs develop outside water, and those whose larvae develop in the water seemed to be most affected by habitat transformation. On its own, even the largest and most species-rich cloud forest fragment is not capable of preserving the current anuran diversity. Neither are the shaded coffee plantations that are interspersed among and link the patches of TMCF. However together they form a diverse system of habitats crucial to species conservation in,this landscape. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spatial ecology and diet of Iberian lynx (Lynx paradinus) and the abundance of its main prey, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), were studied in southwestern Spain from December 1992 to December 1996 when a decline in rabbit populations occurred. Our objectives were to relate spatial ecology of lynx to rabbit abundance, water availability, and protection from human disturbance. Rabbits were almost the bole prey of lynx; rabbit remains were present in 99.2% (n = 1,171) of feces analyzed.
   Rabbit abundance and density in 6 different habitats were estimated by line transect sampling. Rabbits were more abundant in Mediterranean scrubland, closely followed by ash stands. Pastureland and lentiscus in plantations had 4.5 times fewer rabbits, and pine plantations 15-20 times fewer rabbits, than the Mediterranean scrubland. Abundance of rabbits in the Mediterranean scrubland was not spatially uniform, as density for 1994 and 1995 varied from 42-55/ha in the area close to the edge of the marsh (locally called the V ra) to 2-7/ha far from the Vera. Rabbit density was 3.5 times higher during spring thane during autumn. A decline in rabbit density occurred in 1996 when numbers were 72-91% lower than the previous years.
   We mapped warren density in Mediterranean scrubland and pastureland to determine intra-habitat (differences in spatial distribution of rabbits. Warren density, entrance density, and mean number of entrances per warren declined significantly with distance from the Vera in the Mediterranean scrubland, following a negative exponential function (adj. r(2) ranging between 83 and 97%). However, none of these variables showed any trend in relation to the Vera in the pastureland.
   The lynx population contained three stable pairs of adults plus young raised each year, some of which remained on the study area as subadults (older than one year), The seasonal number of different lynx in the study area ranged between 7 and 17. Average adult and young/subadult seasonal density was 0.77 (range 0.72-0.88) and 0.46 individuals/km(2) (range = 0.07-1.12),respectively
   We estimated home range and daily movements of lynx to determine changes that might be due to sex, season, or changing prey density. On average, total lynx home range size was 7.3 km(2) for young, 9.5 km(2) for yl adult females, and 18.2 km(2) fo adult males. Mean bore areas (60% isopleth using the kernel approximation) were on average 15%, 10%, and 34% of total home ranges of young, adult females, and adult males, respectively. Significant differences were found for home range and core area sizes among sex-age classes, but neither season nor year affected home range size or core area size. Daily movements averaged 8.0 kill. Daily distance traveled was not affected by sex-age class or season, but was different among years, with lynx traveling shorter distances in 1993 and 1996. Daily home range size averaged 1.46 km(2), mid again only varied by year. Lynx daily movements were associated With permanent, artificial water sites.
   Habitat use by lynx was remarkably constant, with no differences detected among sex-age classes, active or inactive locations, seasons, or years. The habitat most frequently used was Mediterranean scrubland (53% of locations), and both it and ash stands were the only habitats preferred by lynx; pine and eucalyptus plantations were avoided, and marsh, pastureland and lentiscus in plantations were neither preferred or avoided.). When lynx were found in the non-preferred habitats, on most occasions (78%) animals were closer than 300 in from the edge of one of the two preferred habitats, whereas on only 4% of occasions were animals further than 1 km. This behavior was particularly accentuated when lynx moved through open habitats. Lynx appeared to respond to high human presence, as they were mainly located inside the National Park (82% of occasions), and when outside the Park they more frequently used the areas that were farther from a tourist village.
   We used a Geographical Information System (GIS) to estimate average rabbit density and number of rabbits within lynx home ranges. On average, rabbit density within home ranges was 5.6/ha. The habitats that sustained more rabbits were Mediterranean scrubland (74.2% of total number of rabbits within home ranges) and ash stands (32.2% for 6 home ranges where these habitats were available). Rabbit densities within core areas were similar to those found in home ranges. Throughout the study period the lowest rabbit density estimated within home ranges was about I/ha in autumn 1996. The number of rabbits per Lynx ranged between 1,367 in spring 1994 and 73 in autumn 1996. Rabbit density within home ranges, core areas, and the trapping area were not correlated with range size (P's > 0.2).
   Lynx and rabbits preferred the least human-transformed scrubland habitats therefore natural habitats must be favored over plantations and pastureland areas. The edges of the preferred habitats were also heavily used by rabbits and consequently by lynx. The vegetation structure of the preferred habitats was characterized by intermediate understory cover (25-35%), low tree cover, and large and frequent grasslands. The rabbit decline observed during the study did not affect lynx spatial behavior or reproduction. Therefore, rabbit densities as low as 1 and 4.6/ha for the times of the lowest and highest rabbit density (i.e., autumn and spring, respectively) were enough to sustain tire lynx population. Other factors such as the presence of permanent water sites and relatively low human presence are important components of quality lynx habitat.

AB The patterns of interspecific variation identified by comparative studies provide valuable hypotheses about the role of physiological traits in evolutionary adaptation. This review covers tests of these hypotheses for photosynthetic traits that have used a microevolutionary perspective to characterize physiological variation among and within populations. Studies of physiological differentiation among populations show that evolutionary divergence in photosynthetic traits is common within species, and has a pattern that supports many adaptive hypotheses. These among-population studies imply that selection has influenced photosynthetic traits in some way, but they are not designed to identify the traits targeted by selection or the environmental agents that cause selection. Analyses of genetic and phenotypic variation within populations address these questions. Studies that have quantified genetic variation within populations show that levels of heritable variation can be adequate for evolutionary change in photosynthetic traits. Other studies have measured phenotypic selection for these traits by analyzing how the variation within populations is correlated with fitness. This work has shown that selection for photosynthetic traits may often operate indirectly via correlations with other traits, and emphasizes the importance of viewing the phenotype as an integrated function of growth, morphology, life-history and physiology. We also outline some methodological problems that may be encountered for ecophysiological traits by these types of studies, provide some potential solutions, and discuss future directions for the field of plant evolutionary ecophysiology.

AB Although biomonitoring approaches are being increasingly used in the measurement of stream and river health, critical assumptions about the nature of biological populations and communities that underpin them are often ignored. Many approaches based on pattern detection in plant and animal communities assume high temporal persistence in the absence of anthropogenic disturbances. However, this has been rarely tested with long-term data sets and there is evidence that this assumption is not true in some river systems. Biological processes, such as predation and recruitment, can account for considerable spatial and temporal variation in the structure of some stream communities. These processes may prevent the development of robust predictive models or indices based on pattern detection. Measurements of population or community attributes also are often used to infer ecosystem processes, yet the link between pattern and process has rarely been demonstrated. Many goals of river management relate to the maintenance of natural ecological processes and ecosystem function; direct measurement of these processes is, however, often neglected in assessment programs. Such measures are often sensitive to causal factors that are known to affect river health and it is possible to develop simple but powerful predictive models. Perhaps more importantly, should an impact to be detected, strategies for remediation are more obvious as the causal processes are generally better known. The ultimate success of biomonitoring approaches depends on how well we understand the biophysical processes that influence the structure and dynamics of stream and river systems, and the way they function.

AB Interpretation of nematode community indices requires a reference to a relatively undisturbed community. Maturity and trophic diversity index values were compared for five pairs of certified organically and conventionally managed soils in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. Available nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium) was estimated at various lag periods relative to times of sampling for nematode communities to determine the strength of correlative relationship between nematode communities and nitrogen availability. Soils were sampled six times yearly in 1993 and 1994 to determine the best time of year to sample. Maturity values for plant parasites were greater in organically than conventionally managed soils, and differences between management systems were greater in fall than spring months. However, other maturity and diversity indices did not differ between the two management practices. Differences in crop species grown in the two systems accounted for most differences observed in the community of plant-parasitic nematodes. Indices of free-living nematodes were correlated negatively with concentrations of ammonium, whereas indices of plant-parasitic nematodes were correlated positively with concentrations of nitrate. Due to the similarity of index values between the two systems, organically managed soils are not suitable reference sites for monitoring and assessing the biological aspects of soil quality for annually harvested crops.

AB Within plant communities seed mass often varies over 3 to 5 orders of magnitude, yet simple evolutionary models predict a single optimum seed mass. Here we explore a class of models where seed mass determines 1) the number of seeds produced via a size-number trade-off and 2) competitive ability - plants arising from large seeds are assumed to have a competitive advantage over those derived from small seeds. In this setting the existence of a single-species global ESS seed mass requires the competitive advantage of large seeds over small ones to be unbounded. If there is a limit on the competitive advantage that large seeds obtain then it is always possible to find a smaller seed mass that will successfully invade. In such circumstances there might be a multi-species coevolutionarily stable coalition of several species each with a different seed mass. In this way a wide range of seed masses could be promoted by evolution. In general the adaptive landscape generated by these models is extremely flat leading to slow evolutionary dynamics. The implications of these results for the interpretation of observational, comparative and experimental studies are discussed.

AB Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50?years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.

AB 1. Ecologists and many evolutionary biologists relate the variation in physiological, behavioural, life-history, demographic, population and community traits to the variation in weather, a key environmental driver. However, identifying which weather variables (e.g. rain, temperature, El Nino index), over which time period (e.g. recent weather, spring or year-round weather) and in what ways (e.g. mean, threshold of temperature) they affect biological responses is by no means trivial, particularly when traits are expressed at different times among individuals.
   2. A literature review shows that a systematic approach for identifying weather signals is lacking and that the majority of studies select weather variables from a small number of competing hypotheses that are founded on unverified a priori assumptions. This is worrying because studies that investigate the nature of weather signals in detail suggest that signals can be complex. Using suboptimal or wrongly identified weather signals may lead to unreliable projections and management decisions.
   3. We propose a four-step approach that allows for more rigorous identification and quantification of weather signals (or any other predictor variable for which data are available at high temporal resolution), easily implementable with our new R package 'climwin'. We compare our approach with conventional approaches and provide worked examples.
   4. Although our more exploratory approach also has some drawbacks, such as the risk of overfitting and bias that our simulations show can occur at low sample and effect sizes, these issues can be addressed with the right knowledge and tools.
   5. By developing both the methods to fit critical weather windows to a wide range of biological responses and the tools to validate them and determine sample size requirements, our approach facilitates the exploration and quantification of the biological effects of weather in a rigorous, replicable and comparable way, while also providing a benchmark performance to compare other approaches to.

AB Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a morphological trait widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning (i.e. photosynthetic and respiratory rates, chemical composition, resistance to herbivory, etc.). The LMA can be broken down into the leaf density (LD) and leaf volume to area ratio (LVA or thickness), which in turn are determined by anatomical tissues and chemical composition. The aim of this study is to understand the anatomical and chemical characteristics related to LMA variation in species growing in the field along a water availability gradient. We determined LMA and its components (LD, LVA and anatomical tissues) for 34 Mediterranean (20 evergreen and 14 deciduous) woody species. Variation in LMA was due to variation in both LD and LVA. For both deciduous and evergreen species LVA variation was strongly and positively related with mesophyll volume per area (VA or thickness), but for evergreen species positive relationships of LVA with the VA of epidermis, vascular plus sclerenchyma tissues and air spaces were found as well. The leaf carbon concentration was positively related with mesophyll VA in deciduous species, and with VA of vascular plus sclerenchymatic tissues in evergreens. Species occurring at the sites with lower water availability were generally characterised by a high LMA and LD.

AB The B cell response to Salmonella typhimurium (STm) occurs massively at extrafollicular sites, without notable germinal centers (GCs). Little is known in terms of its specificity. To expand the knowledge of antigen targets, we screened plasmablast (PB)-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for Salmonella specificity, using ELISA, flow cytometry, and antigen microarray. Only a small fraction (0.5%-2%) of the response appeared to be Salmonella-specific. Yet, infection of mice with limited B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires impaired the response, suggesting that BCR specificity was important. We showed, using laser microdissection, that somatic hypermutation (SHM) occurred efficiently at extrafollicular sites leading to affinity maturation that in turn led to detectable STm Ag-binding. These results suggest a revised vision of how clonal selection and affinity maturation operate in response to Salmonella. Clonal selection initially is promiscuous, activating cells with virtually undetectable affinity, yet SHM and selection occur during the extrafollicular response yielding higher affinity, detectable antibodies.

AB There is a fundamental trade-off between leaf traits associated with either resource acquisition or resource conservation. This gradient of trait variation, called the economics spectrum, also applies to fine roots, but whether it is consistent for coarse roots or at the plant community level remains untested. We measured a set of morphological and chemical root traits at a community level (functional parameters; FP) in 20 plant communities located along land-use intensity gradients and across three climatic zones (tropical, mediterranean and montane). We hypothesized (i) the existence of a root economics spectrum in plant communities consistent within root types (fine, < 2mm; coarse, 2-5mm), (ii) that variations in root FP occur with soil depths (top 20cm of soil and 100-150cm deep) and (iii) along land-use gradients. Root FP covaried, in line with the resource acquisition-conservation trade-off, from communities with root FP associated with resource acquisition (e.g. high specific root length, SRL; thin diameters and low root dry matter contents, RDMC) to root FP associated with resource conservation (e.g. low SRL, thick diameters and high RDMC). This pattern was consistent for both fine and coarse roots indicating a strong consistency of a trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation for plant roots. Roots had different suites of traits at different depths, suggesting a disparity in root function and exploitation capacities. Shallow, fine roots were thinner, richer in nitrogen and with lower lignin concentrations associated with greater exploitation capacities compared to deep, fine roots. Shallow, coarse roots were richer in nitrogen, carbon and soluble concentrations than deep, coarse roots. Fine root parameters of highly disturbed, herbaceous-dominated plant communities in poorer soils were associated with foraging strategies, that is greater SRL and lower RDMC and lignin concentration than those from less disturbed communities. Coarse roots, however, were less sensitive to the land-use gradient.Synthesis. This study demonstrates the existence of a general trade-off in root construction at a community level, which operates within all root types, suggesting that all plant tissues are controlled by the trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation.

AB Plant germination and growth can be influenced by sound, but the ecological significance of these responses is unclear. We asked whether acoustic energy generated by the feeding of insect herbivores was detected by plants. We report that the vibrations caused by insect feeding can elicit chemical defenses. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) rosettes pre-treated with the vibrations caused by caterpillar feeding had higher levels of glucosinolate and anthocyanin defenses when subsequently fed upon by Pieris rapae (L.) caterpillars than did untreated plants. The plants also discriminated between the vibrations caused by chewing and those caused by wind or insect song. Plants thus respond to herbivore-generated vibrations in a selective and ecologically meaningful way. A vibration signaling pathway would complement the known signaling pathways that rely on volatile, electrical, or phloem-borne signals. We suggest that vibration may represent a new long distance signaling mechanism in plant-insect interactions that contributes to systemic induction of chemical defenses.

AB We combined observations from four eddy covariance towers with remote sensing to better understand the altitudinal patterns of climate, plant phenology, Gross Ecosystem CO2 Uptake, and Evapotranspiration (ET) around the Upper Kings River basin in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Precipitation (P) increased with elevation to similar to 500 m, and more gradually at higher elevations, while vegetation graded from savanna at 405 m to evergreen oak and pine forest to mid-montane forest to subalpine forest at 2700 m. CO2 uptake and transpiration at 405 m peaked in spring (March to May) and declined in summer; gas exchange at 1160 and 2015 m continued year-round; gas exchange at 2700 m peaked in summer and ceased in winter. A phenological threshold occurred between 2015 and 2700 m, associated with the development of winter dormancy. Annual ET and Gross Primary Production were greatest at 1160 and 2015 m and reduced at 405 m coincident with less P, and at 2700 m coincident with colder temperatures. The large decline in ET above 2015 m raises the possibility that an upslope redistribution of vegetation with climate change could cause a large increase in upper elevation ET. We extrapolated ET to the entire basin using remote sensing. The 2003-11 P for the entire Upper Kings River basin was 984 mm y(-1) and the ET was 429 mm y(-1), yielding a P-ET of 554 mm y(-1), which agrees well with the observed Kings River flow of 563 mm y(-1). ET averaged across the entire basin was nearly constant from year to year.

AB Terrestrial plant productivity tends to increase under increasing but non-saturating photosynthetically active solar radiation when water, temperature and nutrients are not limiting. However, studies have shown that photosynthesis can also be higher under enhanced diffuse light despite a decrease in total irradiance. Clouds and atmospheric aerosols are two important variables that determine the total and proportion of diffuse light reaching the surface and thereby the rate of photosynthesis and carbon accumulation in plants. In addition to these factors, the response of plants to diffuse radiation is also dependant on plant characteristics such as functional types, leaf physiology, leaf area, leaf inclination, canopy structure and shape (i.e. clumping). Local environmental conditions (i.e. temperature, soil moisture, vapour pressure deficit, etc.) then modulate these plant responses. Changes in solar radiation as a consequence of clouds and aerosols thus can modify the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the role of solar radiation in terrestrial carbon processes has become one of the goals in terrestrial carbon cycle studies. It can help to identify the control and mechanisms of carbon processes and determines the geographical and temporal distribution of the major pools and fluxes in the global carbon cycle. Here we review the role of clouds and aerosols in partitioning solar radiation and their interactions with carbon processes of terrestrial plants. We also focus our review on vegetation characteristics that control the impact of radiation partitioning on vegetation carbon processes and the role of modelling approach to study this impact. We identify gaps in this field of research and further propose recommendations to bridge the gap.

AB Functional diversity (FD) is a key facet of biodiversity used to address central questions in ecology. Despite recent methodological advances, FD remains a complex concept and no consensus has been reached either on how to quantify it, or on how it influences ecological processes. Here we define FD as the distribution of trait values within a community. When and how to account for intraspecific trait variability (ITV) when measuring FD remains one of the main current debates. It remains however unclear to what extent accounting for population-level ITV would modify FD quantification and associated conclusions. In this paper, we address two critical questions: (1) How sensitive are different components of FD to the inclusion of population-level ITV? (2) Does the omission of ITV obscure the understanding of ecological patterns? Using a mixture of empirical data and simulation experiments, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of four commonly used FD indices (community weighted mean traits, functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, Petchey and Gaston's FD index) and their relationships with environmental gradients and species richness, by varying both the extent (plasticity or not) and the structure (contingency to environmental gradient due to local adaptation) of population-level ITV. Our results suggest that ITV may strongly alter the quantification of FD and the detection of ecological patterns. Our analysis highlights that 1) species trait values distributions within communities are crucial to the sensitivity to ITV, 2) ITV structure plays a major role in this sensitivity and 3) different indices are not evenly sensitive to ITV, the single-trait FD from Petchey and Gaston being the most sensitive among the four metrics tested. We conclude that the effects of intraspecific variability in trait values should be more systematically tested before drawing central conclusions on FD, and suggest the use of simulation studies for such sensitivity analyses.

AB 1. Functional traits are posited to explain interspecific differences in performance, but these relationships are difficult to describe for long-lived organisms such as trees, which exhibit strong ontogenetic changes in demographic rates. Here, we use a size-dependent model of tree growth to test the extent to which of 17 functional traits related to leaf and stem economics, adult stature and seed size predict the ontogenetic trajectory of tree growth.
   2. We used a Bayesian modelling framework to parameterize and contrast three size-dependent diameter growth models using 16 years of census data from 5524 individuals of 50 rain forest tree species: a size-dependent model, a size-dependent model with species-specific parameters and a size-dependent model based on functional traits.
   3. Most species showed clear hump-shaped ontogenetic growth trajectories and, across species, maximum growth rate varied nearly tenfold, from 0.58 to 5.51 mm year(-1). Most species attained their maximum growth at 60% of their maximum size, whereas the magnitude of ontogenetic changes in growth rate varied widely among species.
   4. The Trait-Model provided the best compromise between explained variance and model parsimony and needed considerably fewer parameters than the model with species terms.
   5. Stem economics and adult stature largely explained interspecific differences in growth strategy. Maximum absolute diameter growth rates increased with increasing adult stature and leaf delta C-13 and decreased with increasing wood density. Species with light wood had the greatest potential to modulate their growth, resulting in hump-shaped ontogenetic growth curves. Seed size and leaf economics, generally thought to be of paramount importance for plant performance, had no significant relationships with the growth parameters.
   6. Synthesis. Our modelling approach offers a promising way to link demographic parameters to their functional determinants and hence to predict growth trajectories in species-rich communities with little parameter inflation, bridging the gap between functional ecology and population demography.

AB We propose and test a theoretical model focusing on antecedents and consequences of demographic faultlines. We also posit contingencies that affect overall team dynamics in the context of demographic faultlines, such as the study setting and performance measurement. Using meta-analysis structural equation modeling with a final data set consisting of 311 data points (i.e., k [predictor-criterion relationships]), from 39 studies that were obtained from 36 papers with a total sample size of 24,388 individuals in 4,366 teams, we found that sex and racial diversity increased demographic faultline strength more than did diversity on the attributes of functional background, educational background, age, and tenure. Demographic faultline strength was found to increase task and relationship conflict as well as decrease team cohesion. Furthermore, although demographic faultline strength decreased both team satisfaction and team performance, there was a stronger decrease in team performance than in team satisfaction. The strength of these relationships increased when the study was conducted in the lab rather than in the field. We describe the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for advancing the study of faultlines.

ID DETERMINANTS; RESERVES; TANKER; SIZE
AB Little is known about how marine protected areas (MPAs) may be vulnerable to vessel oil spills in the United States. This study investigated individual size, frequency, and total amount of vessel oil spilled in US MPAs, and how characteristics of MPAs and individual spill events influenced spills. Vessel oil spills in US waters (2002-06) and MPA boundaries were mapped. Total number and volume of oil spills inside and outside MPAs were computed. Results show that the presence of a MPA does not seem to prevent vessel oil spills or reduce the amount of oil spilled, and that a variety of MPA attributes (e.g., scale of protection, fishing restrictions, and others) and spill event characteristics (e.g., vessel type, year of spill, and others) affect oil spills inside and outside MPAs. These results can be used to develop MPA rules and marine transportation policies that reduce the vulnerability of sensitive resources to oil spills. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The role of mesozooplankton as consumers and transformers of primary and secondary production in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas was examined during four cruises in spring and summer of both 2002 and 2004 as part of the western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interactions (SBI) program. Forty-seven grazing experiments using dominant mesozooplankton species and life stages were conducted at locations across the shelf, slope, and basin of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas to measure feeding rates on both chlorophyll and microzooplankton and to determine mesozooplankton prey preferences.
   Mesozooplankton biomass was at all times dominated by life stages of four copepod taxa: Calanus glacialis, Calanus hyperboreus, Metridia longa, and Pseudocalanus spp. Significant interannual, seasonal, regional, between species and within species differences in grazing rates were observed. Overall, the dominant zooplankton exhibited typical feeding behavior in response to chlorophyll concentration that could be modeled using species and life-stage specific IvIev functions. Microzooplankton were preferred prey at almost all times, with the strength of the preference positively related to the proportion of microzooplankton prey availability. Average mesozooplankton grazing impacts on both chlorophyll standing stock (0.6 +/- 0.5% d(-1) in spring, 5.1 +/- 6.3% d(-1) in summer) and primary production (12.8 +/- 11.8% d(-1) in spring, 27.6 +/- 24.5% d(-1) in summer) were quite low and varied between shelf, slope, and basin. Coincident microzooplankton grazing experiments [Sherr, E.B., Sherr, B.F., Hartz, A.J., 2009. Microzooplankton grazing impact in the Western Arctic Ocean. Deep-Sea Research II] were conducted at most stations. Together, microzooplankton-mesozooplankton grazing consumed only 44% of the total water-column primary production, leaving more than half directly available for local export to the benthos or for offshore transport into the adjacent basin.

AB Invasive species impose severe biological and economic costs worldwide. In forested ecosystems, invasive species supplant native species, resulting in decreased biodiversity. Furthermore, human-mediated disturbances may stress native forest species and benefit invasive species that thrive in disturbed habitats. Anthropogenic changes to the landscape have caused unprecedented increases in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) numbers, which has resulted in the degradation of understory native plant communities. We suggest that deer-mediated disturbance to understory communities facilitates the success of invaders in forests, Many North American forests experience both exotic plant invasion and deer overabundance, but the two problems have never been empirically linked. In this paper, we quantify deer effects on native and exotic understory herbs in a western Pennsylvania forest. We show that the percentage of bare ground and the relative abundances of the invasive herbs, Alliaria petiolata and Microstegium vimineum are significantly greater, while native plants are significantly smaller with a lower proportion flowering in deer access vs. deer exclusion plots. Our data support the idea that invader success is due in part to both preferential foraging by deer on native herbs that reduces their size and flowering status and the creation of open patches when deer are present. We conclude that deer overabundance facilitates the success of invasive species in forested ecosystems and that management will benefit by considering these factors jointly.

AB Invasive species are known to influence the structure and function of invaded ecological communities, and preventive measures appear to be the most efficient means of controlling these effects. However, management of biological invasions requires use of adequate tools to understand and predict invasion patterns in recently introduced areas. The present study: (1) estimates the potential geographic distribution and ecological requirements of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr), one of the most conspicuous invasive species throughout the world, in the Iberian Peninsula using ecological niche modeling, and (2) provides new insights into the process of selection of consensual areas among predictions from several modeling methodologies. Ecological niche models were developed using 5 modeling techniques: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), generalized boosted models (GBM), Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent). Models for the eastern and western portions of the Iberian Peninsula were built using subsets of occurrence and environmental data to investigate the potential for ecological niche differences between the invading populations. Our results indicate geographic differences between predictions of different approaches, and the utility of ensemble predictions in identifying areas of uncertainty regarding the species' invasive potential. More generally, our models predict coastal areas and major river corridors as highly suitable for Argentine ants, and indicate that western and eastern Iberian Peninsula populations occupy similar environmental conditions.

AB The two sibling bat species Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii occur in sympatry over wide areas of Southern and Central Europe. Morphological, ecological and previous genetic evidence supported the view that the two species constitute two well-differentiated groups, but recent phylogenetic analyses have shown that the two species share some mtDNA haplotypes when they occur in sympatry. In order to see whether some genetic exchange has occurred between the two species, we sequenced a highly variable segment of the mitochondrial control region in both species living in sympatry and in allopatry. We also analysed the nuclear diversity of 160 individuals of both species found in two mixed nursery colonies located north and south of the Alps. MtDNA analysis confirmed that European M. blythii share multiple, identical or very similar haplotypes with M. myotis. Since allopatric Asian M. blythii presents mtDNA sequences that are very divergent from those of the two species found in Europe, we postulate that the mitochondrial genome of the European M. blythii has been replaced by that of M. myotis. The analysis of nuclear diversity shows a strikingly different pattern, as both species are well differentiated within mixed nursery colonies (F-ST = 0.18). However, a Bayesian analysis of admixture reveals that the hybrids can be frequently observed, as about 25% of sampled M. blythii show introgressed genes of M. myotis origin. In contrast, less than 4% of the M. myotis analysed were classified as non-parental genotypes, revealing an asymmetry in the pattern of hybridization between the two species. These results show that the two species can interbreed and that the hybridization is still ongoing in the areas of sympatry. The persistence of well-differentiated nuclear gene pools, in spite of an apparent replacement of mitochondrial genome in European M. blythii by that of M. myotis, is best explained by a series of introgression events having occurred repeatedly during the recent colonization of Europe by M. blythii from Asia. The sharp contrast obtained from the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers further points to the need to cautiously interpret results based on a single class of genetic markers.

AB Modelling of climate change-induced species range shifts has generally addressed migration limitations inadequately, often assuming 'null' migration or instantaneous 'full' migration extremes. We describe methods for incorporating simple migration rate assumptions into multispecies modelling, using the Proteaceae of the Cape Floristic Region. Even with optimistic migration assumptions, range loss projections more closely approximate null migration than full migration assumptions. Full migration results were positively skewed by few species with large range increases, an overestimate eliminated by dispersal-limited migration rate assumptions. Wind- and ant/rodent-dispersed species responded differently to climate change. Initially larger ranges of wind-dispersed species were more strongly reduced by climate change, despite far greater assumed dispersal distances - we suggest that these well-dispersed species populate more marginal areas of potential range, causing lower resilience to climatic changes at range margins. Overall, range loss rate slowed with advancing climate change, possibly because species ranges contracted into core areas most resilient to climate change. Thus, a consideration of simple dynamics of range change (rather than single step, present-future comparisons of range) provide new insights relevant for conservation strategies, in particular, and for guiding monitoring efforts to detect and gauge the impacts of climate change on natural populations.

AB We present a modelling framework for predicting forest areas. The framework is obtained by integrating a machine learning software suite within the GRASS Geographical Information System (GIS) and by providing additional methods for predictive habitat modelling. Three machine learning techniques (Tree-Based Classification, Neural Networks and Random Forest) are available in parallel for modelling from climatic and topographic variables. Model evaluation and parameter selection are measured by sensitivity-specificity ROC analysis, while the final presence and absence maps are obtained through maximisation of the kappa statistic. The modelling framework is applied at a resolution of 1km. with Iberian subpopulations of Pinus sylvestris L. forests. For this data set, the most accurate algorithm is Breiman's random forest, an ensemble method which provides automatic combination of tree-classifiers trained on bootstrapped subsamples and randomised variable sets. All models show a potential area of P.syluestris for the Iberian Peninsula which is larger than the present one, a result corroborated by regional pollen analyses.

AB Sperm competition models predict that males typically mating in disfavoured roles should be selected to compensate for their disadvantage by investing more into sperm. We studied the effect of rapid changes in social status on ejaculate investments during experimental trials with an externally fertilizing teleost - the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). We document that males becoming dominant produce less sperm with lower velocity, but have higher sex steroid concentrations than subordinate males. These differences in sperm characteristics seem mainly to result from a decreased investment in sperm among fish that become dominant compared to pre-trial levels. Moreover, these adjustments of sperm production and sperm velocity seem not to be traded against sperm longevity. Our results support theoretical models of sperm competition, as males forced to mate in disfavoured roles seem to invest more into ejaculate quality than males in favoured roles. Additionally, we are the first to report that males, in a species with status-dependent shifts in reproductive tactics, have evolved rapid tactic specific adjustments of sperm production and sperm velocity corresponding to what could be predicted from their reproductive roles.

AB Stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope ratios are commonly used to reconstruct palaeodiets and palaeoenvironments. The method is based on our knowledge of isotopic patterns in plants, which are Subject to taxonomic and environmental variability. While previous researchers have addressed isotopic variability amongst plants, no studies have looked extensively at a broad suite of taxa over multiple temporal scales from within the savanna biome so as to provide baseline data for palaeodietary and palaeoenvironmental studies. Here we document variations in the isotopic compositions of plants collected over two years from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, with respect to species and anatomical differences, and the influences of geological substrate and spatio-temporal shifts in climate. Results show that environmentally-induced carbon isotopic variations in plants within this region are generally smaller than 2 parts per thousand, which is lower than what has been previously reported for plants compared across multiple habitat-types. These data suggest that delta C-13 differences of similar to 2 parts per thousand or more (or similar to 1 parts per thousand if the diet is predominantly C-4) between animals from a given area reliably indicate real dietary differences. Plant delta N-15 values vary greatly between different microhabitats (by up to 4 parts per thousand), responding to a range of environmental influences that may, in turn.. significantly influence variation in animal delta N-15 values.

AB Many investigations in current ecological research focus on ecological functions, the functions of biodiversity, or the functioning of ecological systems. However, within ecology "function" is used in several different meanings. The most important ones are those of function as denoting either processes, roles, services or the "functioning" of whole systems. Some of these meanings pose considerable problems in terms of their ability to apply them in empirical research. These problems together with the ambiguity of the term "function" constitute considerable impediments for generalizations of research results. In order to improve this situation, the current paper describes the different meanings of "function" and discusses the requirements necessary to unambiguously apply the concept(s) in practice. This is illustrated by the example of current discussions on the "functions of biodiversity".

AB This paper presents a new ordination method to compare several communities containing species that differ according to their taxonomic, morphological or biological features. The objective is first to find dissimilarities among communities from the knowledge about differences among their species, and second to describe these dissimilarities with regard to the feature diversity within communities. In 1986, Rao initiated a general framework for analysing the extent of the diversity. He defined a diversity coefficient called quadratic entropy and a dissimilarity coefficient and proposed a decomposition of this diversity coefficient in a way similar to ANOVA. Furthermore, Gower and Legendre (1986) built a weighted principal coordinate analysis. Using the previous context, we propose a new method called the double principal coordinate analysis (DPCoA) to analyse the relation between two kinds of data. The first contains differences among species (dissimilarity matrix); the second the species distribution among communities (abundance or presence/absence matrix). A multidimensional space assembling the species points and the community points is built. The species points define the original differences between species and the community points define the deduced differences between communities. Furthermore, this multidimensional space is linked with the diversity decomposition into between-community and within-community diversities. One looks for axes that provide a graphical ordination of the communities and project the species onto them. An illustration is proposed comparing bird communities which live in different areas under mediterranean bioclimates. Compared to some existing methods, the double principal coordinate analysis can provide a typology of communities taking account of an abundance matrix and can include dissimilarities among species. Finally, we show that such an approach generalizes some of these methods and allows us to develop new analyses. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nutrient discharges from sewage treatment plants can contribute significantly to coastal and estuarine eutrophication. To counter anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loads in a Baltic Sea coastal embayment, improved (similar to85%) N removal was implemented in a tertiary sewage-treatment plant. This study used nitrogen siable-isotope ratios (delta(15)N) in attached brown macroalgae, Fucus vesiculosus, to map the change in the spatial extent of-the influence of sewage-derived N. Elevated N content and delta(15)N values (delta(15)N = 8-9parts per thousand) suggest that sewage N was still traceable in algal tissues despite enhanced N removal from the effluent. However, the delta(15)N values decreased significantly with distance and approached background levels within 10-12 km of the outfall. Compared to a survey conducted in 1989, prior to enhanced N removal in the sewage treatment plant, macroalgae were 2.5-6parts per thousand lower in delta(15)N values within 24 km from the outfall, demonstrating a decline in the importance of sewage-derived nutrients to macroalgae, particularly in the inner reaches of the bay. Beyond 25 km from the outfall, delta(15)N values were at background levels (delta(15)N = 4parts per thousand). Two-source mixing models estimate that the Percentage sewage contribution to total algal N uptake in algae near the outfall Was similar to40% in 1989 and similar to 12% in 1999. Similarly, temporal variation in individual plants estimate that the percentage sewage N contribution to algae within 1 km from the outfall declined from >40% in the mid-1990s to similar to20% in 2002. Nutrient budget calculations showed that F. vesiculosus is not an effective sink for N, assimilating only similar to3% of total annual N loads entering the bay.

AB Soil collected from an upland pasture was manipulated experimentally in ways shown previously to alter microbial community structure. One set of soil was subjected to chloroform fumigation for 0, 0.5, 2, or 24 h and the other was sterilised by gamma-irradiation and inoculated with a 10(-2), 10(-4), 10(-6), or 10(-8) dilution of a soil suspension prepared from unsterilized soil. Following incubation for 8 months, to allow for the stabilization of microbial biomass and activity, the resulting microbial community structure (determined by PCR-DGGE of bacterial specific amplification products of total soil DNA) was assessed. In addition, the functional stability (defined here as the resistance and resilience of short-term decomposition of plant residues to a transient heat or a persistent copper perturbation) was determined. Changes in the active bacterial population following perturbation (determined by RT-PCR-DGGE of total soil RNA) were also monitored. The manipulations resulted in distinct shifts in microbial community structure as shown by PCR-DGGE profiles, but no significant decreases in the number of bands. These shifts in microbial community structure were associated with a reduction in functional stability. The clear correlation between altered microbial community structure and functional stability observed in this upland pasture soil was not evident when the same protocols were applied to soils in other studies. RT-PCR-DGGE profiles only detected a shift in the active bacterial population following heat, but not copper, perturbation. We conclude that the functional stability of decomposition is related to specific components of the microbial community.

AB The capercaillie inhabits a continuous range in large parts of the Palearctic boreal forest, but is patchily distributed in temperate Europe. An ongoing population decline, largely related to human land use changes, has been most pronounced in central and western Europe, where some local populations have become extinct. In this study, we document the genetic differentiation of capercaillie populations at different stages along a gradient of spatial structuring from high connectivity (continuous range in the boreal forest) to a metapopulation systems (Alps) and recent (central Europe) and historic (Pyrenees) isolation. Four hundred and sixty individuals from 14 sample sites were genotyped at 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess genetic structure and variation of capercaillie populations across its European range. As expected, differentiation was least pronounced within the continuous range in the boreal forest. Within the metapopulation system of the Alps, differentiation was less than among the isolated populations of central Europe (Black Forest, Fichtelgebirge, Thuringia, Vosges). In the long-isolated population of the Pyrenees, and the recently isolated populations of central Europe, genetic diversity was significantly reduced compared with the Alps and boreal forest. Our results agree with the concept of a gradual increase in genetic differentiation from connectivity to isolation, and from recent to historic isolation. Anthropogenic habitat deterioration and fragmentation thus not only leads to range contractions and extinctions, but may also have significant genetic and evolutionary consequences for surviving populations. To maintain high levels of genetic variation in species in fragmented habitats, conservation should aim at securing connectivity between spatially distinct populations.

AB Inferring phylogenetic relationships among closely related plant species is often difficult due to the lack of molecular markers exhibiting enough nucleotide variability at this taxonomic level. Moreover, gene tree does not necessary represent the true species tree because of random sorting of polymorphic alleles in different lineages. A solution to these problems is to use many amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) distributed throughout the whole genome, to infer cladistic and phenetic among-species relationships. Phylogenetic relationships among interfertile species of Trollius L. (Ranunculaceae) were investigated using nuclear DNA (ITS1 + 5.8S rRNA + ITS2) and chloroplast DNA (trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergene spacer) sequences, and AFLP markers. ITS sequences were not informative at the intrageneric level, but confirmed the sister relationship between Trollius and Adonis genera, and provided new information on the phylogenetic relationships among five Ranunculaceae genera. Chloroplast DNA was more informative among Trollius species, but not consistent with the sections previously described. AFLP proved to be a powerful tool to resolve the complex genetic relationships between the morphological entities constituting the genus Trollius. Although as much as 76.1% of the total AFLP variability was found within a priori defined morphological groups, the remaining 23.9% variability differentiating groups was sufficient to generate congruent and robust cladistic and phenetic trees. Several morphological traits, independent from those used to define groups, were mapped onto the molecular phylogeny, and their evolution discussed in relation to the absence/presence of pollinator-seed parasite Chiastocheta flies.

AB To lest whether spider succession following harvest differed from succession following wildfire, spiders were collected by pitfall trapping and sweep netting over two years in aspen-dominated boreal Forests. Over 8400 individuals from 127 species of spiders were identified from 12 stands representing three age-classes (stand origin in 1995, 1982, and 1968) and two disturbance types (wildfire and harvesting). The diversity of spider assemblages tended to be higher in fire-origin stands than in harvest-origin stands; the youngest tire-origin stands also supported more even distributions of spider species. Spider assemblages responded quickly to wildfire and harvesting as open habitat specialists colonized stands within one year after disturbance. Many web-building species common to older forests either survived harvesting, or re-colonized harvest-origin stands more rapidly than they re-colonized fire-origin stands. Cluster analyses and DCA ordination show faunal convergence by ca 30 years after wildfire and harvesting; trajectories in re-colonization, however, differed by disturbance type as the succession of spider assemblages from fire-origin stands lagged behind spider succession in harvest-origin stands. Comparison with cluster analyses using vegetation data and abiotic site conditions suggests spider assemblages recover from harvesting and fire more rapidly than do a variety of other site characteristics. Several spider species (e.g. Gnaphosa borea Kulczynski, Pirata bryantae Kurata, Arctosa alpigena (Doleschall)) appear dependent on some of the conditions associated with wildfires as they were absent or rarely collected in harvest-origin stands.

AB Livestock grazing (without modern fertilizers), mowing, and other traditional methods of animal husbandry are used in Europe for managing human-made habitats such as seminatural grasslands. From a review of essential literature, I hypothesize that traditional animal husbandry partially compensates for the loss of natural processes that have been suppressed by humans. There is indirect evidence that livestock grazing and mowing have made possible the continued existence of many species threatened by the human overkill of megaherbivores and other large herbivores. Many species that were dependent on natural fires and floods may have benefited from grazing and mowing, which also may be effective tools for mitigating the negative effects of eutrophications. As partial surrogates, traditional grazing and mowing have obscured the importance of natural disturbances to European biodiversity. Thus, the end of traditional animal husbandry, together with the suppression of natural disturbances, may cause even more adverse effects to biodiversity than is generally recognized.

AB Intrinsic growth and mortality rates need to be estimated to assess the potential for oligotrich ciliate populations to exploit prey populations, and since species specific differences exist, data for a variety of ciliates grazing on a variety of prey are also needed. In this paper, data are presented on the growth and mortality rates of 4 planktonic oligotrichs (2 Strobilidium species and 2 Strombidium species), at a number of prey concentrations. Growth and mortality data for these and other species in these 2 genera are reviewed. In general, these oligotrichs have maximum growth rates (mu, d(-1)) ranging from similar to 0.3 to 2.2 (at temperatures ranging from 6 to 31 degrees C); they have similar threshold concentrations (the food concentration where growth rate equals zero) of 10 to 100 ng C ml(-1); they have rapid mortality rates at sub-threshold concentrations (cells only survive 1 to 3 d); and the range of food concentrations where the growth rate increases from zero to near its maximum is 20 to 300 ng C ml(-1). Although generalities can be made about ciliates in these 2 genera, the data suggest that in terms of growth and mortality rates, planktonic oligotrichs cannot be considered a single functional group. There is, however, a need to predict 'typical' oligotrich growth rates. To this end, several formulae have been established to predict maximum growth rates from ciliate cell volume and ambient temperature. In this paper, the growth data for Strobilidium and Strombidium are reviewed and compared to the predicted values from formulae in the Literature; the formula presented by Muller & Geller (1993, Arch. Hydrobiol. 126: 315-327) appears to be the best predictor of maximum growth rate from cell volume and ambient temperature. Finally, based on the review of growth data for these 2 genera, some speculations are made as to how these ciliates may exploit prey populations in a planktonic environment composed of small-scale patches.

ID SPECIES ABUNDANCE; DIVERSITY
AB Indices and models of diversity have proved to be valuable in ecology. They may be used to explore, quantify and compare the complexity of soil patterns in different areas and environments. The different ways of measuring diversity may be grouped into three classes: indices of richness, abundance distribution models, and indices based on proportional abundance of objects. Four scales of diversity can be distinguished: point scaling diversity (polypedon), alpha scaling diversity (soil association), gamma scaling diversity (landscape or drainage basin) and epsilon scaling diversity (geographical soil region). Differentiation diversity is a measure of how different a range of soilscapes are in terms of the variety. Diversity-area relationships are then analyzed. Examples of how to apply these indices for analysing soil patterns and their results are shown. From these results it is inferred that diversity indices in the analysis of soil patterns would be similar to those for biodiversity in ecology. This suggests that there are common processes of organization of biotic and abiotic ecological structures.

AB The spatial distribution of genets in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus bovinus (L.:Fr.) Roussel were studied in somatic incompatibility pairings of isolates from five Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands differing in forest history and age. With increasing forest age, the size of genets increased while the number of genets and production of sporocarps per unit area decreased. There was an estimated 700-5700 genets ha(-1) in younger forests and 30-120 ha(-1) in older ones. The maximum size of genets was 1.7-5.3 m in the younger forest and to 17.5 m in the older ones. The production of sporocarps per unit area decreased with increasing forest age. Furthermore, production of sporocarps increased nonlinearly with the size of the genet, suggesting that genets become fragmented. Ergosterol measurements indicated that the fungal biomass of one genet consisted of 20-45% sporocarps and 55-80% mycorrhiza, not including extramatrical mycelia. Mycorrhizal aggregations in soil were mapped in two 5 m(2) areas and, based on somatic incompatibility tests, all were found to belong to the same genet as sporocarps present above ground. Production of spores per sporocarp was estimated to be 1.1-12.8 x 10(8). The observations are discussed in terms of population ecology.

AB Egg-carrying cyclopoid copepods have lower fecundity and feeding rates, and longer egg hatching times, than free-spawning calanoid copepods. Simple demographic considerations suggest that the lower feeding and fecundity of egg-carrying cyclopoids are adaptations to the potentially elevated mortality of ovigerous females, while the shorter egg hatching time and higher feeding and fecundity rates found in free-spawning calanoid copepods represent adaptations to the very high mortality rates experienced by suspended eggs.

AB 1. Transects made beside 12 main roads in Dorset and Hampshire (UK) showed that verges and central reservations supported a wide variety of butterflies and burnets (Zygaenidae). One site had 23 species of butterfly (=40% of British species), while the average was nine (16%) species per 100-m transect. Most were common species, but some rarities were present.
   2. Mark-recapture estimates of adult densities on verges were up to 2774 adults ha-1 for Maniola jurtina. Populations of Melanargia galathea, Pieris rapae and Polyommatus icarus were large or medium-sized for these species.
   3. Variation in the number of species, density and diversity of butterflies and burnets depended on the range of breeding habitats on verges. The density of adults and number of species were correlated with verge width, while diversity was correlated with the abundance of nectar. The amount of traffic had no apparent effect on populations on verges.
   4. Road verges could be substantially improved for butterflies and burnets by reducing the depth of top soil and amount of fertilizer applied, by planting with native seed mixes and shrubs, by creating an irregular topography and surrounding them with hedges, and by making verges and central reservations as wide as possible.
   5. Wide busy roads were no barrier to the movements of species living in open populations, but slightly impeded those with closed populations. Mark-recapture showed that 10-30% of adults of three species with closed populations crossed the road. Roads cannot be considered as a barrier to gene flow in any species in this study.
   6. Vehicles killed 0.6-1.9% of adults of species from closed populations, and about 7% of those from open populations. These mortalities were insignificant compared to those caused by natural factors.

AB Unraveling the drivers controlling community assembly is a central issue in ecology. Although it is generally accepted that selection, dispersal, diversification and drift are major community assembly processes, defining their relative importance is very challenging. Here, we present a framework to quantitatively infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin-based null model analysis (iCAMP). iCAMP shows high accuracy (0.93-0.99), precision (0.80-0.94), sensitivity (0.82-0.94), and specificity (0.95-0.98) on simulated communities, which are 10-160% higher than those from the entire community-based approach. Application of iCAMP to grassland microbial communities in response to experimental warming reveals dominant roles of homogeneous selection (38%) and 'drift' (59%). Interestingly, warming decreases 'drift' over time, and enhances homogeneous selection which is primarily imposed on Bacillales. In addition, homogeneous selection has higher correlations with drought and plant productivity under warming than control. iCAMP provides an effective and robust tool to quantify microbial assembly processes, and should also be useful for plant and animal ecology. Studies of microbial community assembly mechanisms typically use metrics for turnover within the whole community. Here, the authors develop an alternative approach based on turnover within lineages and dissect mechanistic change in grassland bacterial assembly under experimental warming.

AB Drought is a common hydrometeorological phenomenon and a pervasive global hazard. As our climate changes, it is likely that drought events will become more intense and frequent. Effective drought monitoring is therefore critical, both to the research community in developing an understanding of drought, and to those responsible for drought management and mitigation. Over the past 50 years remote sensing has shifted the field away from reliance on traditional site-based measurements and enabled observations and estimates of key drought-related variables over larger spatial and temporal scales than was previously possible. This has proven especially important in data poor regions with limited in-situ monitoring stations. Available remotely sensed data products now represent almost all aspects of drought propagation and have contributed to our understanding of the phenomena. In this review we chart the rise of remote sensing for drought monitoring, examining key milestones and technologies for assessing meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought events. We reflect on challenges the research community has faced to date, such as limitations associated with data record length and spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. This review then looks ahead to the future in terms of new technologies, such as the ESA Sentinel satellites, analytical platforms and approaches, such as Google EarthEngine, and the utility of existing data in new drought monitoring applications. We look forward to the continuation of 50 years of progress to provide effective, innovative and efficient drought monitoring solutions utilising remote sensing technology.

AB Early environments can profoundly influence an organism in ways that persist over its life. In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: |g| = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = -8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6 degrees C versus 2 degrees C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.

AB The preservation of ecosystem processes under ongoing biotic erosion requires that some species within affected communities perform similar functions, a property that is usually defined as functional redundancy. Although functional redundancy has recently become a relevant part of ecological research, so far there is no agreement on its measurement. The scope of this work is thus to propose a consistent framework based on functional dissimilarities among species for summarizing different facets of functional redundancy. The behaviour of the proposed measures is illustrated with one small artificial data set, together with actual examples on the species functional turnover along successional gradients. We believe this new framework provides an important contribution for the clarification and quantification of key metrics of community redundancy and vulnerability. The method, for which we provide a simple r function called uniqueness', further allows summarizing the functional contribution of single species to the overall redundancy of any type of biological community.

AB 1. Understanding how land-use intensification affects forest resilience is a key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying regeneration processes and for planning more sustainable land-use systems. Here, we evaluate how the intensification of a swidden cultivation system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon.
   2. Along a gradient of land-use intensity, we analysed the relative role of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in determining the resilience of early secondary forests (SFs). We assessed resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment. We used as a reference the recovery level achieved by SFs subjected to the lowest intensity of use, given that these SFs are part of a dynamic system and may not develop to old-growth forests. Therefore, we interpreted a deviation from this reference level as a change in forest resilience.
   3. The recovery of forest structure was determined by management intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by landscape configuration. With increasing number of cycles and weeding frequency along with decreasing fallow period and patch area, SF basal area and canopy height decreased, regeneration shifted from a seed-to sprout-dependent strategy, and liana infestation on trees increased. With decreasing area covered by old-growth forest, species richness and Shannon diversity decreased.
   4. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies. Our findings demonstrate the - many times overlooked - importance of previous management intensity in determining the structure of SFs and highlight the importance of regeneration strategy for forest resilience.
   5. Synthesis. Swidden cultivation supports people's livelihoods and transforms landscapes in the tropics. The sustainability of this system depends on ecosystem services provided by SFs that develop during the fallow period. Land-use intensification reduces the resilience of SFs and ultimately may drive the system towards an arrested succession state that holds a lower potential to deliver ecosystem services to the Amazonian people. Under an intensification scenario, the adaptation of management practices is needed to guarantee the resilience of swidden cultivation systems.

AB The distribution of tropical forest biomass across the landscape is poorly understood, particularly in increasingly common secondary tropical forests. We studied the landscape-scale distribution of edaphic properties, plant community characteristics, and aboveground biomass (AGB) in secondary tropical dry forests in northwest Costa Rica. We used structural equation modeling to examine conceptual models of relationships among these factors, with data from 84 0.1 ha plots. Stand age and soils explained 33%-60% of the variation in community-weighted mean values of foliar traits including specific leaf area, foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, and delta C-13. Aboveground biomass ranged from 1.7 to 409 Mg.ha(-1) among plots between 5 and >100 years old. Stand age alone explained 46% of the variation in AGB among plots, while a model including age, soil pH, traits, and forest type explained 58%. Stand age was the most important variable explaining the distribution of AGB and community characteristics in secondary forests. We speculate that plot size, landscape heterogeneity, disturbance history, and stand dynamics contribute to the unexplained variation in AGB across the landscape.

AB The allocation of nonstructural carbon (NSC) to growth, metabolism and storage remains poorly understood, but is critical for the prediction of stress tolerance and mortality.
   We used the radiocarbon (C-14) 'bomb spike' as a tracer of substrate and age of carbon in stemwood NSC, CO2 emitted by stems, tree ring cellulose and stump sprouts regenerated following harvesting in mature red maple trees. We addressed the following questions: which factors influence the age of stemwood NSC?; to what extent is stored vs new NSC used for metabolism and growth?; and, is older, stored NSC available for use?
   The mean age of extracted stemwood NSC was 10 yr. More vigorous trees had both larger and younger stemwood NSC pools. NSC used to support metabolism (stem CO2) was 1-2 yr old in spring before leaves emerged, but reflected current-year photosynthetic products in late summer. The tree ring cellulose C-14 age was 0.9 yr older than direct ring counts. Stump sprouts were formed from NSC up to 17 yr old.
   Thus, younger NSC is preferentially used for growth and day-to-day metabolic demands. More recently stored NSC contributes to annual ring growth and metabolism in the dormant season, yet decade-old and older NSC is accessible for regrowth.

AB Over the last two decades, macroecology the analysis of large-scale, multi-species ecological patterns and processes has established itself as a major line of biological research. Analyses of statistical links between environmental variables and biotic responses have long and successfully been employed as a main approach, but new developments are due to be utilized. Scanning the horizon of macroecology, we identified four challenges that will probably play a major role in the future. We support our claims by examples and bibliographic analyses. 1) Integrating the past into macroecological analyses, e.g. by using paleontological or phylogenetic information or by applying methods from historical biogeography, will sharpen our understanding of the underlying reasons for contemporary patterns. 2) Explicit consideration of the local processes that lead to the observed larger-scale patterns is necessary to understand the fine-grain variability found in nature, and will enable better prediction of future patterns (e.g. under environmental change conditions). 3) Macroecology is dependent on large-scale, high quality data from a broad spectrum of taxa and regions. More available data sources need to be tapped and new, small-grain large-extent data need to be collected. 4) Although macroecology already lead to mainstreaming cutting-edge statistical analysis techniques, we find that more sophisticated methods are needed to account for the biases inherent to sampling at large scale. Bayesian methods may be particularly suitable to address these challenges. To continue the vigorous development of the macroecological research agenda, it is time to address these challenges and to avoid becoming too complacent with current achievements.

AB 1. Rhizosphere bacteria antagonistic to fungal pathogens improve plant performance by preventing infection. In temperate grasslands, primary productivity often increases with plant diversity, and we hypothesized that this effect may in part rely on the interactions between plants and antagonistic bacteria.
   2. We investigated the impact of plant diversity and functional group composition on soil bacteria producing the antifungal compounds 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and pyrrolnitrin (PRN) in a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment, as well as their impact on soil suppressiveness. Soil suppressiveness was investigated in a model infection assay with Beta vulgaris and the pathogen Rhizoctonia solani.
   3. The abundance of DAPG and PRN producers increased with plant diversity and that of PRN also increased in the presence of grasses. Moreover, legume species richness and coverage decreased the abundance of DAPG and PRN producers, respectively, contrary to beneficial effects of legumes on soil microorganisms reported previously. In turn, soil suppressiveness was at maximum when DAPG and PRN producer abundance was high.
   4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that plant diversity contributes to plant community resistance against pathogens by fostering beneficial bacterial communities. This indirect soil feedback mechanism may contribute to the positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity and could also help the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural management strategies.

AB According to theory, gene flow to marginal populations may stall or aid adaptation at range limits by swamping peripheral populations with maladaptive gene flow or by enhancing genetic variability and reducing inbreeding depression, respectively. We tested these contrasting predictions by manipulating patterns of gene flow of the annual plant, Mimulus laciniatus, at its warm range limit. Gene flow was experimentally applied by using crosses within warm-limit populations (selfed and outcrossed), between warm-limit populations, and between warm-limit and central range populations across two elevational transects. We measured the fitness of offspring in a common garden at the warm-edge species range limit. All sources of gene flow increased seedling emergence at the range limit, suggesting local inbreeding depression at both range limit populations; however, lifetime reproductive success only increased significantly when pollen originated from another warm-limit population. Center-to-warm-edge gene flow was maladaptive by delaying time to development at this warm, fast-drying range limit, whereas edge-to-edge gene flow hastened emergence time and time to reproduction. By empirically testing theory on the effects of gene flow on the formation of geographic range limits, we find benefits of gene flow among populations to be greatest when gene flow is between populations occupying the same range limit. Our results emphasize the overlooked importance of gene flow among populations occurring near the same range limit and highlight the potential for prescriptive gene flow as a conservation option for populations at risk from climate change.

AB Plants distributed across a wide range of environmental conditions are submitted to differential selective pressures. Long-term selection can lead to the development of adaptations to the local environment, generating ecotypic differentiation. Additionally, plant species can cope with this environmental variability by phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we examine the importance of both processes in coping with environmental heterogeneity in the Mediterranean sclerophyllous cork oak Quercus suber. For this purpose, we measured growth and key functional traits at the leaf level in 9-year-old plants across 2 years of contrasting precipitation (2005 and 2006) in a common garden. Plants were grown from acorns originated from 13 populations spanning a wide range of climates along the distribution range of the species. The traits measured were: leaf size (LS), specific leaf area (SLA), carbon isotope discrimination (delta C-13) and leaf nitrogen content per unit mass (N-mass). Inter-population differences in LS, SLA and delta C-13 were found. These differences were associated with rainfall and temperature at the sites of origin, suggesting local adaptation in response to diverging climates. Additionally, SLA and LS exhibited positive responses to the increase in annual rainfall. Year effect explained 28% of the total phenotypic variance in LS and 2.7% in SLA. There was a significant genotype x environment interaction for shoot growth and a phenotypic correlation between the difference in shoot growth among years and the annual mean temperature at origin. This suggests that populations originating from warm sites can benefit more from wet conditions than populations from cool sites. Finally, we investigated the relationships between functional traits and aboveground growth by several regression models. Our results showed that plants with lower SLA presented larger aboveground growth in a dry year and plants with larger leaf sizes displayed larger growth rates in both years. Overall, the study supports the adaptive value of SLA and LS for cork oak under a Mediterranean climate and their potentially important role for dealing with varying temperature and rainfall regimes through both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity.

AB We determined the temporal dynamics of cambial activity and xylem cell differentiation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) within a dry inner Alpine valley (750 m a.s.l., Tyrol, Austria), where radial growth is strongly limited by drought in spring. Repeated micro-sampling of the developing tree ring of mature trees was carried out during two contrasting years at two study plots that differ in soil water availability (xeric and dry-mesic sites). In 2007, when air temperature at the beginning of the growing season in April exceeded the long-term mean by 6.4 degrees C, cambial cell division started in early April at both study plots. A delayed onset of cambial activity of c. 2 weeks was found in 2008, when average climate conditions prevailed in spring, indicating that resumption of cambial cell division after winter dormancy is temperature controlled. Cambial cell division consistently ended about the end of June/early July in both study years. Radial enlargement of tracheids started almost 3 weeks earlier in 2007 compared with 2008 at both study plots. At the xeric site, the maximum rate of tracheid production in 2007 and 2008 was reached in early and mid-May, respectively, and c. 2 weeks later at the dry-mesic site. Since in both study years more favorable growing conditions (i.e., an increase in soil water content) were recorded during summer, we suggest a strong sink competition for carbohydrates to mycorrhizal root and shoot growth. Wood formation stopped c. 4 weeks earlier at the xeric compared with the dry-mesic site in both years, indicating a strong influence of drought stress on cell differentiation. This is supported by radial widths of earlywood cells, which were found to be significantly narrower at the xeric than at the dry-mesic site (P < 0.05). Repeated cellular analyses during the two growing seasons revealed that, although spatial variability in the dynamics and duration of cell differentiation processes in P. sylvestris exposed to drought is strongly influenced by water availability, the onset of cambial activity and cell differentiation is controlled by temperature.

AB Climate change is altering ecological systems throughout the world. Managing these systems in a way that ignores climate-change will likely fail to meet management objectives. The uncertainty in projected climate change impacts is one of the greatest challenges facing managers attempting to address global change. In order to select successful management strategies, managers need to understand the uncertainty inherent in projected climate impacts and how these uncertainties affect the outcomes of management activities. Perhaps the most important tool for managing ecological systems in the face of climate change is active adaptive management, in which systems are closely monitored and management strategies are altered to address expected and ongoing changes. Here, we discuss the uncertainty inherent in different types of data on potential climate impacts and explore climate projections and potential management responses at three sites in North America. The Central Valley of California, the headwaters of the Klamath River in Oregon, and the barrier islands and sounds of North Carolina each face a different set of challenges with respect to climate change. Using these three sites, we provide specific examples of how managers are already beginning to address the threat of climate change in the face of varying levels of uncertainty.

AB Ensemble species distribution models combine the strengths of several species environmental matching models, while minimizing the weakness of any one model. Ensemble models may be particularly useful in risk analysis of recently arrived, harmful invasive species because species may not yet have spread to all suitable habitats, leaving species-environment relationships difficult to determine. We tested five individual models (logistic regression, boosted regression trees, random forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and maximum entropy model or Maxent) and ensemble modeling for selected nonnative plant species in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Wyoming; Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, and areas of interior Alaska. The models are based on field data provided by the park staffs, combined with topographic, climatic, and vegetation predictors derived from satellite data. For the four invasive plant species tested, ensemble models were the only models that ranked in the top three models for both field validation and test data. Ensemble models may be more robust than individual species-environment matching models for risk analysis.

AB While high resolution satellite remote sensing has been hailed as a very useful source of data for biodiversity assessment and monitoring, applications have been more developed in temperate areas. The biodiverse tropics offer a challenge of an altogether different magnitude for hyperspatial and hyperspectral remote sensing. This paper examines issues related to hyperspatial and hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery, which constitutes one of the most potentially powerful yet underutilized sources of for tropical research on biodiversity. Hyperspatial data with their increased pixel resolution are possibly best suited at facilitating the accurate location of features such as tree canopies, but less suited to the identification of aspects such as species identity, particularly when spatial resolution becomes too fine and pixels are smaller than the size of the object (e.g., tree canopy) being identified. Hyperspectral data on the other hand, with their high spectral resolution, can be used to record information pertaining to a range of critical plant properties related to species identity, and can be very effective used for discriminating tree species in tropical forests, despite the greater complexity of such environments. There remains a glaring gap in the easy availability of hyperspectral and hyperspatial satellite data in the tropics due to reasons of cost, data coverage, and security restrictions. Stimulating discussion on the applications of this powerful, but underutilized tool by ecologists, is the first step in promoting a more extensive use of such data for ecological studies in tropical biodiversity rich areas.

AB The expectation that long-term, broad-scale changes in the relative abundance of species, homogenisation of habitats and decreases in diversity will affect ecosystem function has led to an increasing number of studies on functional diversity and composition. Such studies frequently consider the effect of environmental gradients and anthropogenic impacts, but rarely the effect of biogenic habitat variation. In marine soft-sediment systems, habitat variability is likely to be of particular importance because of the strong link between habitat and species diversity. In this study we examine the link between functional trait diversity (as richness and evenness) and composition, and habitat variation in two locations with different regional species pools. We found similar functional traits occurring in the two locations, but differences between habitats within the locations. High evenness within traits was apparent (across both locations and habitats) reflecting the potential for the maintenance of function with the loss of individual species. Between-habitat differences in functional traits were driven by differences in organism densities rather than the presence/absence of individual traits, emphasising the importance of density shifts in driving function. Furthermore, our demonstration of habitat variation as a driver of functional composition and diversity suggests that habitat heterogeneity should be explicitly included within studies trying to predict the effect of species loss on ecosystem function.

TI Patterns of Polymorphism and Demographic History in Natural Populations
   of Arabidopsis lyrata
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Many of the processes affecting genetic diversity act on local populations. However, studies of plant nucleotide diversity have largely ignored local sampling, making it difficult to infer the demographic history of populations and to assess the importance of local adaptation. Arabidopsis lyrata, a self-incompatible, perennial species with a circumpolar distribution, is an excellent model system in which to study the roles of demographic history and local adaptation in patterning genetic variation.
   Principal Findings: We studied nucleotide diversity in six natural populations of Arabidopsis lyrata, using 77 loci sampled from 140 chromosomes. The six populations were highly differentiated, with a median FST of 0.52, and STRUCTURE analysis revealed no evidence of admixed individuals. Average within-population diversity varied among populations, with the highest diversity found in a German population; this population harbors 3-fold higher levels of silent diversity than worldwide samples of A. thaliana. All A. lyrata populations also yielded positive values of Tajima's D. We estimated a demographic model for these populations, finding evidence of population divergence over the past 19,000 to 47,000 years involving non-equilibrium demographic events that reduced the effective size of most populations. Finally, we used the inferred demographic model to perform an initial test for local adaptation and identified several genes, including the flowering time gene FCA and a disease resistance locus, as candidates for local adaptation events.
   Conclusions: Our results underscore the importance of population-specific, non-equilibrium demographic processes in patterning diversity within A. lyrata. Moreover, our extensive dataset provides an important resource for future molecular population genetic studies of local adaptation in A. lyrata.

AB The establishment of ecological networks (ENs) has been proposed as an ideal way to counteract the increasing fragmentation of natural ecosystems and as a necessary complement to the establishment of protected areas for biodiversity conservation. This conservation tool, which comprises core areas, corridors, and buffer areas, has attracted the attention of several national and European institutions. It is thought that ENs can connect habitat patches and thus enable species to move across unsuitable areas. In Europe, however, ENs are proposed as an oversimplification of complex ecological concepts, and we maintain that they are of limited use for biodiversity conservation for several reasons. The ENs are species specific and operate on species-dependent scales. In addition, the information needed for their implementation is only available for a handful of species. To overcome these limitations, ENs have been proposed on a landscape scale (and for selected "focal" species), but there is no indication that the structural composition of core areas, corridors, and buffer areas could ensure the functional connectivity and improve the viability of more than a few species. The theory behind ENs fails to provide sufficient practical information on how to build them (e.g., width, shape, structure, content). In fact, no EN so far has been validated in practice (ensuring connectivity and increasing overall biodiversity conservation), and there are no signs that validation will be possible in the near future. In view of these limitations, it is difficult to justify spending economic and political resources on building systems that are at best working hypotheses that cannot be evaluated on a practical level.

AB Remote sensing is a potentially powerful technology with which to extrapolate eddy covariance-based gross primary production (GPP) to continental scales. In support of this concept, we used meteorological and flux data from the AmeriFlux network and Support Vector Machine (SVM), an inductive machine learning technique, to develop and apply a predictive GPP model for the conterminous U.S. In the following four-step process, we first trained the SVM to predict flux-based GPP from 33 AmeriFlux sites between 2000 and 2003 using three remotely-sensed variables (land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover) and one ground-measured variable (incident shortwave radiation). Second, we evaluated model performance by predicting GPP for 24 available AmeriFlux sites in 2004. In this independent evaluation, the SVM predicted GPP with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.87 gC/m(2)/day and an R-2 of 0.71. Based on annual total GPP at 15 AmeriFlux sites for which the number of 8-day averages in 2004 was no less than 67%(30 out of a possible 45), annual SVM GPP prediction error was 32.1% for non-forest ecosystems and 22.2% for forest ecosystems, while the standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP product (MOD17) had an error of 50.3% for non-forest ecosystems and 21.5% for forest ecosystems, suggesting that the regionally tuned SVM performed better than the standard global MOD 17 GPP for non-forest ecosystems but had similar performance for forest ecosystems. The most important explanatory factor for GPP prediction was EVI, removal of which increased GPP RMSE by 0.85 gC/m2/day in a cross-validation experiment. Third, using the SVM driven by remote sensing data including incident shortwave radiation, we predicted 2004 conterminous U.S. GPP and found that results were consistent with expected spatial and temporal patterns. Finally, as an illustration of SVM GPP for ecological applications, we estimated maximum light use efficiency (e(max)), one of the most important factors for standard light use efficiency models, for the conterminous U.S. by integrating the 2004 SVM GPP with the MOD17 GPP algorithm. We found that emax varied from similar to 0.86 gC/MJ in grasslands to similar to 1.56 gC/MJ in deciduous forests, while MOD17 emax was 0.68 gC/MJ for grasslands and 1.16 gC/MJ for deciduous forests, suggesting that refinements of MOD17 emax may be beneficial. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Pressure-volume (P-V) curves for leaves or terminal shoots summarize leaf-level responses to increasing water deficit. P-V curve traits and field-measured shoot xylem pressures were characterized across 62 species from four sites differing in rainfall and soil phosphorus. Within-species variation in the measured traits was small relative to differences among species and between environments. P-V curve traits tended to differ with site rainfall but not with soil phosphorus. Turgor loss points (TLPs) varied widely and averaged more negative in species from lower-rainfall sites. Differences between species in TLP were driven mainly by differences in solute potential, rather than by differences in cell wall elasticity. Among species at individual sites, species seemed to vary in leaf-response strategy reflected in TLP independently from water-uptake strategy reflected in predawn xylem pressures and in xylem pressure drop from predawn to midday.

AB We used satellite-tracking data from repeated journeys between Europe and West Africa by the same osprey, Pandion haliaetus, individuals to test whether the timing of migration differs between spring and autumn and whether landmarks and stopover goal areas are important for navigation. The timing of migration varied more in autumn than in spring, owing to significant differences between individuals (related to sex) in autumn migration dates. Autumn journeys were significantly slower than spring journeys because they included more stopover days. The difference may be explained by environmental conditions restricting the timing of migration in spring, by differences in opportunities to deposit fuel prior to departure, and by differences in expected changes in foraging/fuelling conditions along the route. Flight paths from repeated journeys by the same individual were often 120-405 km apart (maximum east-west separation 1400 km). These distances exceed the expected normal range of vision, suggesting that the ospreys did not find their way by following familiar landmarks. Flight paths converged in some regions, indicating the existence of up to three intermediary goal areas along the route of individual birds. Between these goal regions route fidelity was low, and the ospreys could find the next goal region after extensive deviation, presumably by map-based navigation and possibly in combination with path integration.

AB The fitness consequences of mate choice are a source of ongoing debate in evolutionary biology. Recent theory predicts that indirect benefits of female choice due to offspring inheriting superior genes are likely to be negated when there are direct costs associated with choice, including any costs of mating with attractive males. To estimate the fitness consequences of mating with males of varying attractiveness, we housed female house crickets, Acheta domesticus, with either attractive or unattractive males and measured a variety of direct and indirect fitness components. These fitness components were combined to give relative estimates of the number of grandchildren produced and the intrinsic rate of increase ( relative net fitness). We found that females mated to attractive males incur a substantial survival cost. However, these costs are cancelled out and may be outweighed by the benefits of having offspring with elevated fitness. This benefit is due predominantly, but not exclusively, to the effect of an increase in sons' attractiveness. Our results suggest that the direct costs that females experience when mating with attractive males can be outweighed by indirect benefits. They also reveal the value of estimating the net fitness consequences of a mating strategy by including measures of offspring quality in estimates of fitness.

AB Recent adaptive radiations provide excellent model systems for understanding speciation, but rapid diversification can cause problems for phylogenetic inference. Here we use gene genealogies to investigate the phylogeny of recent speciation in the heliconiine butterflies. We sequenced three gene regions, intron 3 (approximate to550 bp) of sex-linked triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi), intron 3 (approximate to450 bp) of autosomal mannose-phosphate isomerase (Mpi), and 1,603 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II (COI and COII), for 37 individuals from 25 species of Heliconius and related genera. The nuclear intron sequences evolved at rates similar to those of mitochondrial coding sequences, but the phylogenetic utility of introns was restricted to closely related geographic populations and species due to high levels of indel variation. For two sister species pairs, Heliconius erato-Heliconius himera and Heliconius melpoinene-Heliconius cydno, there was highly significant discordance between the three genes. At mtDNA and Tpi, the hypotheses of reciprocal monophyly and paraphyly of at least one species with respect to its sister could not be distinguished. In contrast alleles sampled from the third locus, Mpi, showed polyphyletic relationships between both species pairs. In all cases, recent coalescence of mtDNA lineages within species suggests that polyphyly of nuclear genes is not unexpected. In addition, very similar alleles were shared between melpomene and cydno, implying recent gene flow. Our finding of discordant genealogies between genes is consistent with models of adaptive speciation with ongoing gene How and highlights the need for multiple locus comparisons to resolve phylogeny among closely related species.

ID PARKS; POPULATIONS; PEOPLE
AB We examined quantitatively the interaction of reserve size and surrounding local human density in the United States and their relative effect on extinction of large mammals in 13 national parks of the western United States. Data on reserve size and human density were obtained from publicly available sources. Local human density was calculated as the mean density in the 50- or 100-km zone surrounding the reserves' borders. Reliable extinction data are extraordinarily hard to find. Using a variety of definitions of extinct , we collated information on extinctions of large mammals (>5 kg) that spanned the size of U.S. national parks as a whole. Human density surrounding reserves varies considerably. Overall, small reserves were in areas of higher human density than were large reserves (p < 0.0001, r(2) = -0.24, n = 864; excluding Hawaii), and many of the small reserves were at higher local density than the mean for the contiguous United States. Extinction rates of large mammals correlate significantly with local human density, but not with park area. These findings together emphasize that (1) processes occurring outside of a reserve's boundary may unexpectedly strongly affect species within the reserve; (2) small reserves might suffer the double jeopardy of not only their size but also their situation in especially adverse surrounds; and thus (3) small reserves might suffer more intense edge effects and be more isolated than large reserves. If so, conservation workers need to incorporate the relationship into their models and management decisions.

AB Microsatellite loci mutate at an extremely high rate and are generally thought to evolve through a stepwise mutation model. Several differentiation statistics taking into account the particular mutation scheme of the microsatellite have been proposed. The most commonly used is (R-ST) over cap, which is independent of the mutation rate under a generalized stepwise mutation model. (F-ST) over cap and (R-ST) over cap are commonly reported in the literature, but often differ widely. Here we compare their statistical performances using individual-based simulations of a finite island model. The simulations were run under different levels of gene flow, mutation rates, population number and sizes. In addition to the per locus statistical properties, we compare two ways of combining (R-ST) over cap over loci. Our simulations show that even under a strict stepwise mutation model, no statistic is best overall. All estimators suffer to different extents from large bias and variance. While (R-ST) over cap better reflects population differentiation in populations characterized by very low gene-exchange, (F-ST) over cap gives better estimates in cases of high levels of gene flow. The number of loci sampled (12, 24, or 96) has only a minor effect on the relative performance of the estimators under study. For all estimators there is a striking effect of the number of samples, with the differentiation estimates showing very odd distributions for two samples.

AB Since there is little known about invertebrates in glacier foreland succession, the aim of this study was (1) to characterize succession patterns of the epigean fauna, (2) to analyze how these are related to plant succession,, and (3) to investigate the influence of locally varying environmental conditions. The Central Alpine glacier foreland of the Rotmoostal (Obergurgl, Tyrol, Austria) was selected as an example situated above the treeline (2280-2450 in above sea level) where a 2 km long deglaciated area covers a chronosequence of 140 yr. The epigean fauna was sampled in 70 plots of all ages and in nearby sites outside the foreland by pitfall trapping over the entire growing season in 1996 (June-October). Abiotic characterization and vegetation recordings were available for all plots.
   Rapid development of pioneer communities over 50 yr was followed by little change in older stages. Further development towards the mature invertebrate communities characteristic of areas outside the foreland only occurred on the sunny slopes near the terminal moraine and proceeded in a qualitatively different way. Sites in the alluvial outwash plain or otherwise physically disturbed were clearly successionally younger than adjacent undisturbed sites. The first colonizers were almost exclusively predators. Herbivores and decomposers appeared later. Similarities and differences between faunal and floral succession patterns are discussed.
   The major factors affecting faunal succession as identified by canonical correspondence analysis were soil formation and vegetation development along the chronosequence. In addition, favorable sun and light conditions may facilitate successional progress. Fauna communities also react to local conditions, most notably to the moisture/snow cover regime, Abiotic environment, architecture of plants, and plant species composition interact strongly as explanatory factors, but all three aspects also contribute significant unique correlations.
   There were no hints of random colonization patterns at the youngest sites. Pioneer invertebrate communities had the same small-scale spatial heterogeneity and equally strong correlations with environmental conditions as did the well-established communities at older sites. This leads to the conclusion that faunal colonization and succession in Alpine glacier forelands, to a large extent, follow predictable and deterministic assembly rules and that stochastic effects are of minor importance.

AB 1. Sapling growth of six rain forest tree species was compared to evaluate whether species respond in a similar way to a natural light gradient. Saplings were measured non-destructively; production and loss of leaves, stem and branches were analysed in detail.
   2. Sapling height growth was positively related to light environment and leaf area. No single descriptor of light environment explained sapling growth best. Direct or diffuse Light could explain plant growth, depending on species.
   3, Seventeen percent of the saplings had negative relative biomass growth rates, although they occurred in fairly bright conditions. Negative growth rates were caused by leaf shedding and stem breakage. Sapling relative growth rate increased with irradiance, mainly because of an increase in net assimilation rate.
   4. On a shoot basis, shaded plants had a smaller leaf mass fraction (LMF) and a larger specific leaf area, resulting in similar leaf area ratios (LAR) to those of sun plants. This contrasts with the results of seedling studies under controlled conditions, where LMF and LAR increased with shade.
   5. Biomass partitioning to leaf growth decreased with irradiance and relative growth rate of the sapling. This leaf partitioning ratio was better correlated with RGR than with irradiance.
   6. Species differed in the effect of light-dependent changes in specific leaf area (SLA) on growth. This underscores the importance of SLA in explaining differences in species performance in a forest environment. Nevertheless, the effect of SLA was not related to the shade tolerance of the species.

AB Despite considerable empirical and theoretical work on the individual and population consequences of early development, little is known about the correlations between early mass and adult size or lifetime reproductive success of free-ranging mammals. Using a 26-year study of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), we examined how mass as a lamb and mass gain as a yearling affected adult mass for both sexes, horn length of males and lifetime reproductive success of females at different population densities. Mass as a 3-week-old lamb was either weakly or not correlated with adult mass, horn length of adult males, or the number of lambs weaned over a ewe's lifetime. Weaning mass was correlated with most of these variables when the number of ewes in the population was taken into account. When weaning mass was controlled through partial correlation, mass as a yearling was correlated with adult mass of ewes but not with ewe reproductive success or with adult mass or horn length of rams. Lamb mass and number of ewes explained more of the variance in adult characteristics for males than for females. Our results suggest that mass gain during lactation, possibly but not necessarily related to the amount of maternal care received, affects adult mass and reproductive success. Females appear better able than males to compensate for poor early development, likely by postponing their first reproduction. Mass gain over several years and the number of ewes in the population strongly affect adult mass of both sexes and therefore can have profound effects on reproductive success of this long-lived species with a multi-year growth period.

AB Many plant species grow taller and have higher reproductive capacity where they are nonindigenous invaders than where they are native components of the flora. Traditionally, it has been accepted that this is a plastic response to a benign environment, though recently this assumption has been challenged and a genetic basis for increased plant size has been invoked. We tested the hypothesis that the increased size of certain weed species is genetically, rather than environmentally, based. A common environment growth experiment revealed no significant differences in the size of Carduus nutans, Digitalis purpurea, Echium vulgare or Senecio jacobaea sampled from alien (Australia and New Zealand) or native (Britain and continental Europe) habitats. We conclude that post-invasion genetic changes associated with increased size may be unusual and that the phenomenon, where it occurs, generally reflects a plastic response to a novel environment.

AB Honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health is compromised by complex interactions between multiple stressors, among which pesticides play a major role. To better understand the extent of honey bee colonies' exposure to pesticides in time and space, we conducted a survey by collecting corbicular pollen from returning honey bee foragers in 53 Italian apiaries during the active beekeeping season of 3 subsequent years (2012-2014).
   Of 554 pollen samples analysed for pesticide residues, 62% contained at least one pesticide. The overall rate of multiresidual samples (38%) was higher than the rate of single pesticide samples (24%), reaching a maximum of 7 pesticides per sample (1%). Over 3 years, 18 different pesticides were detected (10 fungicides and 8 insecticides) out of 66 analysed. Pesticide concentrations reached the level of concern for bee health (Hazard Quotient (HQ) higher than 1000) at least once in 13% of the apiaries and exceeded the thresholds of safety for human dietary intake (Acute Reference Dose (ARfD), the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), and the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL)) in 39% of the analysis. The pesticide which was most frequently detected was the insecticide chlorpyrifos (30% of the samples overall, exceeding ARfD, ADI, or MRL in 99% of the positive ones), followed by the fungicides mandipropamid (19%), metalaxyl (16%), spiroxamine (15%), and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid (12%). Imidacloprid had also the highest HQ level (5054, with 12% of its positive samples with HQ higher than 1000).
   This 3 year survey provides further insights on the contamination caused by agricultural pesticide use on honey bee colonies. Bee-collected pollen is shown to be a valuable tool for environmental monitoring, and for the detection of illegal uses of pesticides. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. For managed temperate forests, conservationists and policymakers favour fine-grained uneven-aged (UEA) management over more traditional coarse-grained even-aged (EA) management, based on the assumption that within-stand habitat heterogeneity enhances biodiversity. There is, however, little empirical evidence to support this assumption. We investigated for the first time how differently grained forest management systems affect the biodiversity of multiple above- and below-ground taxa across spatial scales.
   2. We sampled 15 taxa of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria within the largest contiguous beech forest landscape of Germany and classified them into functional groups. Selected forest stands have been managed for more than a century at different spatial grains. The EA (coarse-grained management) and UEA (fine-grained) forests are comparable in spatial arrangement, climate and soil conditions. These were compared to forests of a nearby national park that have been unmanaged for at least 20years. We used diversity accumulation curves to compare -diversity for Hill numbers D-0 (species richness), D-1 (Shannon diversity) and D-2 (Simpson diversity) between the management systems. Beta diversity was quantified as multiple-site dissimilarity.
   3. Gamma diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for at least one of the three Hill numbers for six taxa (up to 77%), while eight showed no difference. Only bacteria showed the opposite pattern. Higher -diversity in EA forests was also found for forest specialists and saproxylic beetles.
   4. Between-stand -diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for one-third (all species) and half (forest specialists) of all taxa, driven by environmental heterogeneity between age-classes, while -diversity showed no directional response across taxa or for forest specialists.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Comparing EA and uneven-aged forest management in Central European beech forests, our results show that a mosaic of different age-classes is more important for regional biodiversity than high within-stand heterogeneity. We suggest reconsidering the current trend of replacing even-aged management in temperate forests. Instead, the variability of stages and stand structures should be increased to promote landscape-scale biodiversity.

AB The concept of iso- vs. anisohydry has been used to describe the stringency of stomatal regulation of plant water potential (). However, metrics that accurately and consistently quantify species' operating ranges along a continuum of iso- to anisohydry have been elusive. Additionally, most approaches to quantifying iso/anisohydry require labour-intensive measurements during prolonged drought. We evaluated new and previously developed metrics of stringency of stomatal regulation of during soil drying in eight woody species and determined whether easily-determined leaf pressure-volume traits could serve as proxies for their degree of iso- vs. anisohydry. Two metrics of stringency of stomatal control of , (1) a hydroscape' incorporating the landscape of over which stomata control , and (2) the slope of the daily range of as pre-dawn declined, were strongly correlated with each other and with the leaf osmotic potential at full and zero turgor derived from pressure-volume curves.

AB Coastal oceans link terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. Yet, carbon sources and sinks in these biomes remain poorly understood. Here, we explore the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the Amazon River-to-ocean continuum from the lower mainstem at Obidos to the open ocean of the western tropical North Atlantic. We molecularly characterized DOM via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), determined DOM stable carbon isotopes, and interpreted the data in the context of bacterial abundance and production, phytoplankton biomass and composition. Multivariate analysis revealed that the DOM molecular variability in the plume was mainly influenced by the input of terrigenous DOM. Incubation experiments with water from close to the river mouth showed that photo- and bio-degradation preferentially removed C-13-depleted and C-13-enriched terrigenous DOM, respectively. However, there was no significant quantitative change in the total amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over five days. This result suggests that most of the reactive DOM had already been bio-degraded upstream within the river and that photo-degradation was diminished in the turbid plume close to the river mouth. Terrigenous DOM therefore appeared to be relatively non-reactive nearshore. In the less turbid offshore plume, enhanced light penetration stimulated growth of phytoplankton and increased bacterial production. Although marine DOM compounds became relatively enriched, bulk DOC concentrations were 9 to 30% below levels expected from conservative mixing of river and ocean endmembers suggesting that quantitative removal of terrigenous DOM was not compensated by marine DOM production. We propose that removal of terrigenous DOM in the outer plume may be enhanced by (i) bio-degradation primed by reactive algal DOM, (ii) photo-degradation, which may further break down DOM into more bio-available forms, and possibly (iii) sorption of DOM to sinking particles.

AB We conducted a meta-analysis of temperature, phytoplankton size structure, and productivity in cold, temperate, and warm waters of the world's oceans. Our data set covers all combinations of temperature and resource availability, thus allowing us to disentangle their effects. The partitioning of biomass between different size classes is independent of temperature, but depends strongly on the rate of resource use as reflected in the rate of primary production. Temperature and primary production explained 2% and 62%, respectively, of the variability in the contribution of microphytoplankton to total biomass. This contribution increases rapidly with total biomass and productivity, reaching values > 80% when chlorophyll a concentration is > 2 mu g L-1 or primary production is > 100 mg C L-1 d(-1), irrespective of water temperature. Conversely, picophytoplankton contribution is substantial (> 40%), at all temperatures, only when chlorophyll a concentration is, 1 mu g L-1 or primary production is < 50 mu g C L-1 d(-1). The temperature-size rule cannot explain these changes, which instead reflect fundamental reorganizations in the species composition of the assemblage, arising from taxon- and size-dependent differences in resource acquisition and use. Given that resource availability, rather than temperature per se, is the key factor explaining the relative success of different algal size classes, there will be no single, universal effect of global warming on phytoplankton size structure.

AB Crop descriptors, such as leaf area index, crop cover fraction, and leaf chlorophyll content, can be successfully estimated using appropriate spectral indices from the visible and near infrared spectral regions. However, these indices do not provide estimates of dry biomass, an important indicator of crop productivity. For estimating crop aboveground dry biomass and yield, this study developed an approach to integrate crop stressors and crop descriptors derived from optical remote sensing data with the Monteith radiation use efficiency model. Multi-temporal remote sensing data were acquired by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager and the Landsat-5/7 Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) sensors to monitor the growth conditions of corn in the 2001 and 2006 growing seasons. The modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) derived from the remote sensing data was used to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(ApAR)). A canopy structure dynamics model was then used to simulate the seasonal variation of f(APAR). Crop water stress was estimated from the near and shortwave infrared reflectance of the Landsat images for a dry period in the 2001 growing season. By estimating leaf chlorophyll content using the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI) in combination with the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), different levels of nitrogen content could be identified. For the two growing seasons, the aboveground dry biomass and yield were linearly related with the cumulative absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) using the Monteith radiation use efficiency model. The cumulative APAR accounted for 96% of the corn aboveground dry biomass variability and 72% of the yield variability. Biomass and yield variability were partly explained by the variations in crop water stress intensity, which was dependent on soil texture. The seasonal radiation use efficiency was stable over the 2 years and was about 3.9 g MJ(-1), with a confidence interval of 0.6 g MJ(-1) at the 95% confidence level. The assimilation of remotely sensed data into the radiation use efficiency model performed well for monitoring dry biomass accumulation and estimating corn yields.

AB Biotic responses to climate change will vary among taxa and across latitudes, elevational gradients, and degrees of insularity. However. clue to factors such as phenotypic plasticity, ecotypic variation, and evolved tolerance to thermal stress. it remains poorly Understood whether losses should be greatest in populations experiencing the greatest climatic change or living in places where the prevailing climate is closest to the edge of the species' bioclimatic envelope (e.g., at the hottest, driest sites). Research on American pikas (Ochotona princeps) in montane areas of the Great Basin during 1994-1999 suggested that 20th-century population extirpations were predicted by a combination of biogeographic, anthropogenic. and especially climatic factors. Surveys during 2005-2007 documented additional extirpations and within-site shifts of pika distributions at remaining sites. To evaluate the evidence in support of alternative hypotheses involving effects of thermal stress oil pikas, we placed temperature sensors at 156 locations within pika habitats in the vicinity of 25 sites with historical records of pikas in the Basin. We related these time series of sensor data to data on ambient temperature from weather stations within the Historical Climate Network. We then Used these highly correlated relationships, combined with long-term data front the same weather stations. to hindcast temperatures within pika habitats from 1945 through 2006. To explain patterns of loss, we posited three alternative classes of direct thermal stress: (1) ICMC cold stress (number of clays below a threshold temperature) (2) acute heat stress (number of days above a threshold temperature) and (3) chronic heat stress (average summer. temperature). Climate change was defined as change in our thermal metrics between two 31-yr periods: 1945-1975 and 1976-2006. We found that patterns of persistence were well predicted by metrics of climate. Our best models suggest some effects of Climate change; however recent and long-term metrics of chronic heat stress and acute cold stress, neither previously recognized as sources of stress for pikas, were sonic of the best predictors of pika persistence. Results illustrate that extremely rapid distributional shifts can be explained by climatic influences and have implications for conservation topics such as reintroductions and early-warning indicators.

AB Dryland rivers are renowned for their periods of 'boom' related to the episodic floods that extend over vast floodplains and fuel incredible production, and periods of 'bust' where the extensive channel network is restricted to the permanent refugial waterholes. Many of these river systems are unregulated by dams but are under increasing pressure, especially from water abstraction and overland flow interception for agriculture and mining. Although some aquatic organisms with desiccation-resistant life stages can utilise ephemeral floodplain habitats, the larger river waterholes represent the only permanent aquatic habitat during extended periods of low or no flow. These waterholes act as aquatic refugia in an otherwise terrestrial landscape. Variable patterns of connection and disconnection in space and time are a fundamental driver of diversity and function in these dryland river systems, and are vital for dispersal and the maintenance of diverse populations, generate the spatial and temporal variability in assemblage structure for a range of different organisms and fuel the productivity that sustains higher trophic levels. Changes to natural patterns of connection and disconnection of refugial waterholes, owing to water-resource development or climate change, will threaten their persistence and diminish their functional capacity to act as aquatic refugia.

AB As DNA sequences have become more readily available, it has become increasingly desirable to infer species phylogenies from multigene data sets. Much recent work has centered around the recognition that substantial incongruence in single-gene phylogenies necessitates the development of statistical procedures to estimate species phylogenies that appropriately model the process of evolution at the level of the individual genes. One process that gives rise to variation in the histories of individual genes is incomplete lineage sorting, which is commonly modeled by the coalescent, and thus much current work is focused on proper estimation of species phylogenies under the coalescent model. A second common source of discord in single-gene phylogenies is hybridization, a process that is ubiquitous in many groups of plants and animals. Although methods to incorporate hybridization into phylogenetic estimation have also been developed, only a handful of methods that address both coalescence and hybridization have been proposed. Here, I propose an extension of an existing model that incorporates both of these processes simultaneously by utilizing gene trees for inference in a likelihood framework. The model allows examination of the evidence for hybridization in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting due to deep coalescence via model selection using standard information criteria (e.g., Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion). The potential of the method is evaluated using simulated data.

AB 1. Patterns of water availability are frequently implicated in local and regional tree species distributions. A major floristic and climatic transition from aseasonal to seasonal evergreen tropical forest is the Kangar-Pattani Line (KPL) in the Indo-Sundaic region of Southeast Asia. We hypothesize that differences in species' drought tolerance will correspond with their distribution with respect to the KPL. Using a common garden study, we assess the role of differences in physiological drought tolerance traits to geographic distributions for 24 tropical tree species in relation to rainfall seasonality.
   2. Inherent differences in desiccation tolerance of seedlings were quantified as water potentials and relative water contents (RWCs) below which the plant could no longer support living tissue, and plant water relation parameters were measured using pressure-volume analysis. The relationships among these traits were examined using bivariate trait relationships and a principal components analysis (PCA). The physiological traits contributing most to lethal water potential and RWC were assessed using multiple regression analysis.
   3. Distribution-related differences in all desiccation tolerance and pressure-volume traits were detected both with and without phylogenetic correction. Widespread species that occurred in seasonally dry forests were able to maintain living tissue at more negative water potentials and lower RWCs than were species restricted to aseasonal forests. Likewise, widespread species demonstrated more negative water potentials at turgor loss, more negative saturated osmotic potential, lower symplastic water fraction and higher bulk modulus of elasticity values. Turgor loss point (TLP) and bulk modulus of elasticity were the best predictors of lethal water potential while symplastic water fraction and bulk modulus of elasticity were included as predictors of lethal RWC.
   4. Inherent differences in physiological traits contributing to drought tolerance are associated with differences in tropical tree species distributions in relation to rainfall seasonality. These results, combined with lack of support for hypothesized historical factors, strongly implicate climate as a determinant of tree species distributions around the KPL.

AB Over the past few decades, Much research has focussed on the effects of habitat area (i.e., patch size) and edges in fragmented landscapes. We review and synthesize the literature on area and edge effects to identify whether the ecological processes influenced by patch size and edge are distinct, to summarize evidence for the relative effect of each, and to discuss how estimating their independent effects may be accomplished in field Studies. Area and edge directly influence ecological processes in distinct ways, yet indirect effects can be similar, making it difficult to isolate the effects of area and edge in nature. Many Studies investigating both area and edge have been Confounded in their design and (or) analysis (i.e., studies did not control for one potential effect while testing for the other). Nonconfounded Studies have more frequently shown support for edge effects, and comparisons between nonconfounded and confounded studies Suggest that some observed area effects Could be explained by edge effects. We argue that by focussing on the fundamental processes directly influenced by area and edge, and by developing more rigorous study designs and analyses that isolate their relative influence, greater insight can be gained in future investigations on habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB Most tropical rain forests contain diverse arrays of tree species that form arbuscular mycorrhizae. In contrast, the less common monodominant rain forests, in which one tree species comprises more than 50% of the canopy, frequently contain ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associates. In this study, I explored the potential for common ECM networks, created by aggregations of ECM trees, to enhance seedling survivorship near parent trees. I determined the benefit conferred by the common ECM network on seedling growth and survivorship of an ECM monodominant species in Guyana. Seedlings with access to an ECM network had greater growth (73% greater), leaf number (55% more), and survivorship (47% greater) than seedlings without such access, suggesting that the ECM network provides a survivorship advantage. A survey of wild seedlings showed positive distance-dependent distribution and survival with respect to conspecific adults. These experimental and survey results suggest that the negative distance-dependent mechanisms at the seedling stage thought to maintain tropical rain forest diversity are reversed for ECM seedlings, which experience positive feedbacks from the ECM network. These results may in part explain the local monodominance of an ECM tree species within the matrix of high-diversity, tropical rain forest.

AB This study aims to demonstrate the potential of a process-based regional ecosystem model, LPJ-GUESS, driven by climate scenarios generated by a regional climate model system (RCM) to generate predictions useful for assessing effects of climatic and CO2 change on the key ecosystem services of carbon uptake and storage. Scenarios compatible with the A2 and B2 greenhouse gas emission scenarios of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) and with boundary conditions from two general circulation models (GCMs) - HadAM3H and ECHAM4/OPYC3 - were used in simulations to explore changes in tree species distributions, vegetation structure, productivity and ecosystem carbon stocks for the late 21st Century, thus accommodating a proportion of the GCM-based and emissions-based uncertainty in future climate development. The simulations represented in this study were of the potential natural vegetation ignoring direct anthropogenic effects. Results suggest that shifts in climatic zones may lead to changes in species distribution and community composition among seven major tree species of natural Swedish forests. All four climate scenarios were associated with an extension of the boreal forest treeline with respect to altitude and latitude. In the boreal and boreo-nemoral zones, the dominance of Norway spruce and to a lesser extent Scots pine was reduced in favour of deciduous broadleaved tree species. The model also predicted substantial increases in vegetation net primary productivity (NPP), especially in central Sweden. Expansion of forest cover and increased local biomass enhanced the net carbon sink over central and northern Sweden, despite increased carbon release through decomposition processes in the soil. In southern Sweden, reduced growing season soil moisture levels counterbalanced the positive effects of a longer growing season and increased carbon supply on NPP, with the result that many areas were converted from a sink to a source of carbon by the late 21st century. The economy-oriented A2 emission scenario would lead to higher NPP and stronger carbon sinks according to the simulations than the environment-oriented B2 scenario.

AB Allelic variation within individuals holds information regarding the relationships of organisms, which is expected to be particularly important for reconstructing the evolutionary history of closely related taxa. However, little effort has been committed to incorporate such information for reconstructing the phylogeny of organisms. Haplotype trees represent a solution when one nonrecombinant marker is considered, but there is no satisfying method when multiple genes are to be combined. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that converts a distance matrix of alleles to a distance matrix among organisms. This algorithm allows the incorporation of allelic variation for reconstructing the phylogeny of organisms from one or more genes. The method is applied to reconstruct the phylogeny of the seven native diploid species of Rosa sect. Cinnamomeae in North America. The glyceralgehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), and the malate synthase (MS) genes were sequenced for 40 individuals from these species. The three genes had little genetic variation, and most species showed incomplete lineage sorting, suggesting these species have a recent origin. Despite these difficulties, the networks (NeighborNet) of organisms reconstructed from the matrix obtained with the algorithm recovered groups that more closely match taxonomic boundaries than did the haplotype trees. The combined network of individuals shows that species west of the Rocky Mountains, Rosa gymnocarpaand R. pisocarpa, form exclusive groups and that together they are distinct from eastern species. In the east, three groups were found to be exclusive: R. nitida-R. palustris, R. foliolosa, and R. blanda-R. woodsii. These groups are congruent with the morphology and the ecology of species. The method is also useful for representing hybrid individuals when the relationships are reconstructed using a phylogenetic network.

AB Honey bee workers maintain the brood nest of their colony within a narrow temperature range of 34.5 +/- 1.5 degrees C, implying that there are significant fitness costs if brood is reared outside the normal range. However, the effects of abnormal incubation temperatures are subtle and not well documented. Here we show that short-term learning and memory abilities of adult workers are affected by the temperature they experienced during pupal development. In contrast, long-term learning and memory is not significantly affected by rearing temperature. Furthermore, we could detect no effects of incubation temperature on fluctuating asymmetry, as a measure of developmental stability, in workers, queens or drones. We conclude that the most important consequence of abnormal rearing temperatures are subtle neural deficiencies affecting short-term memory rather than physical abnormalities.

AB A microcosm-based approach was used to study impacts of plant and chemical factors on the bacterial community structure of an upland acidic grassland soil. Seven perennial plant species typical of both natural, unimproved (Nardus stricta, Agrostis capillaris, Festuca ovina and F. rubra) and fertilized, improved (Holcus lanatus, Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens) grasslands were either left unamended or treated with lime, nitrogen, or lime plus nitrogen in a 75-day glasshouse experiment. Lime and nitrogen amendment were shown to have a greater effect on microbial activity, biomass and bacterial ribotype number than plant species. Liming increased soil pH, microbial activity and biomass, while decreasing ribotype number. Nitrogen addition decreased soil pH, microbial activity and ribotype number. Addition of lime plus nitrogen had intermediate effects, which appeared to be driven more by lime than nitrogen. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis revealed that lime and nitrogen addition altered soil bacterial community structure, while plant species had little effect. These results were further confirmed by multivariate redundancy analysis, and suggest that soil lime and nitrogen status are more important controllers of bacterial community structure than plant rhizosphere effects.

AB Radial growth variability and response to interannual climate variation of Cembran pine (Pinus cembra L.) were studied in the timberline ecotone on Mt. Patscherkofel (2246 m a.s.l.). The study area, which is in the inner alpine dry region of the Central Austrian Alps, is characterized by a continental climate with minimum precipitation in winter (about 150 turn during December-February) and frequent occurrence of warm dry winds (Fohn) in early spring. The hypothesis that spatial and temporal variability of radial growth is caused by site-related differences in sensitivity to winter stress (i.e., desiccation) was examined by applying dendroclimatological techniques. Ordination methods applied to tree ring time series revealed that spatial variability in radial growth is influenced by the local site factors elevation and slope aspect. Growth-climate relationships were explored using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis. Radial growth at the timberline was positively correlated with temperature in July and was also strongly correlated with mild temperatures in the previous autumn and high precipitation in winter (January-March). At the tree line, temperatures in the previous autumn and precipitation in late winter (March) also controlled radial growth, whereas July temperature was not significantly correlated with ring width. Because previous autumn temperature and winter precipitation were the main growth-determining factors at the timberline and the tree line, and both of these climate variables are known to influence susceptibility of trees to winter stress, the results support the working hypothesis. Analysis of climatic conditions in extreme growth years confirmed the high sensitivity of tree ring growth to precipitation in late winter (March) at the tree line plots. Furthermore, extent of growth reduction and release varied spatially and temporarily, with south- and west-facing stands showing a higher sensitivity to climate variation in the most recent decade (1990s) than the north-facing stand. This aspect-related change in sensitivity to climate may be associated with effects of climate warming on cambial activity.

AB Attaining sustainability will require concerted interactive efforts among disciplines, many of which have not yet recognized, and internalized, the relevance of environmental issues to their main intellectual discourse. The inability of key scientific disciplines to engage interactively is an obstacle to the actual attainment of sustainability. For example, in the list of Millennium Development Goals from the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, 2002, the seventh of the eight goals, to "ensure environmental sustainability," is presented separately from the parallel goals of reducing fertility and poverty, improving gains in equity, improving material conditions, and enhancing population health. A more integrated and consilient approach to sustainability is urgently needed.

AB Intuition suggests, to most people, that parents should be selected to care for their offspring in relation to how certain they are of being the parents of those offspring. Theoretical models of the relationship between parental investment and certainty of parentage predict the two to be related only when some other assumptions are made, few of which can be taken for granted. I briefly review the models and their assumptions, and discuss two kinds of difficulty facing an empiricist wishing to test the models. The first is the problem of unmeasured (and immeasurable) variables. The second is the problem that even the most extensive models do not capture the complexity that can be demonstrated in real systems. I illustrate some of these problems, and some qualitative tests of the models, with experimental work on a population of the collared flycatcher. My conclusion is that although there are some cases where the models have qualitative support, we are a long way from understanding whether paternal care is commonly adjusted in relation to certainty of paternity.

AB We compared the species richness and abundance of pollinator (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) communities in two seasons (September 1998 and April 1999) among four types of urban land use in the Phoenix, Arizona, USA, metropolitan area (xeriscaped residential yards, mesiscaped residential yards, urban desert-remnant parks, and natural desert parks on the fringe of the metropolitan area). Richness and abundance of bees were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees. Specifically, preservation of desert and greater use of xeric landscaping rather than mesiscaping may help preserve this ecologically and economically vital group of organisms.

AB A series of LANDSAT greenness vegetation index (Gi) images, calibrated to a common reference image, were used to model the foliar phenological dynamics of 30 quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 29 black spruce (Picea mariana) stands in the boreal forest of Northeast Minnesota. The fitted phenology models were used in a simplified canopy radiative transfer model to estimate the amount of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted annually. The relationship between annual estimated PAR interception (IPAR) and measured annual above-ground net primary production (AANPP), that is, the dry matter yield of Sigma IPAR (epsilon(i)) was examined.
   Annual PAR interception among aspen stands was relatively high (600-1100 MJ m(-2) yr(-1)), with just three stands intercepting less than 600 MJ m(-2) yr(-1). Stand age affected the relationship between Sigma IPAR and AANPP in aspen, with Sigma IPAR in young stands being strongly related to AANPP (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.002) yet weakly related in mature stands (r(2) = 0.18, p < 0.05). This observation is consistent with increased maintenance respiration demands as the ratio of total to foliar biomass increases with stand age. epsilon(i) for above-ground production in aspen stands varied from 0.44-1.29 gMJ(-1), averaging 0.92 (+/- 0.22) gMJ(-1). In spruce, Sigma IPAR varied widely among stands (100-1100 MJ m(-2)), regardless of age, and explained 76% of the variance in AANPP (p < 0.0001). epsilon(i) for above-ground production in spruce varied from 0.17-0.89 g MJ(-1), averaging 0.49 (+/- 0.17) gMJ(-1). These values are within the range reported for other forest ecosystems. Estimates of AANPP from Sigma IPAR, assuming median values of epsilon(i), were used to estimate a carbon drawdown of 256 Mg C km(-2) for the above-ground component of general ecosystem cover-types over the 2280 km(2) study area.
   Variability in Ei among forest stands, both within and between species, is discussed in the context of evolutionary optimization of resource use efficiency. Results suggest that factors in addition to light interception are required to estimate stand productivity in boreal forest ecosystems, particularly in stands that are subject to periodic moisture stress and increased respiration demands with age.

TI First national-scale reconnaissance of neonicotinoid insecticides in

AB Environmental context Neonicotinoids are under increased scrutiny because they have been implicated in pollinator declines and, more recently, as potential aquatic toxicants. Nevertheless, there is currently little information on concentrations of multiple neonicotinoids in surface water. This paper presents a summary of concentrations of six neonicotinoids in streams from across the United States in both urban and agricultural areas. These environmental data are important in determining the potential risk of neonicotinoids to non-target aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
   Abstract To better understand the fate and transport of neonicotinoid insecticides, water samples were collected from streams across the United States. In a nationwide study, at least one neonicotinoid was detected in 53% of the samples collected, with imidacloprid detected most frequently (37%), followed by clothianidin (24%), thiamethoxam (21%), dinotefuran (13%), acetamiprid (3%) and thiacloprid (0%). Clothianidin and thiamethoxam concentrations were positively related to the percentage of the land use in cultivated crop production and imidacloprid concentrations were positively related to the percentage of urban area within the basin. Additional sampling was also conducted in targeted research areas to complement these national-scale results, including determining: (1) neonicotinoid concentrations during elevated flow conditions in an intensely agricultural region; (2) temporal patterns of neonicotinoids in heavily urbanised basins; (3) neonicotinoid concentrations in agricultural basins in a nationally important ecosystem; and (4) in-stream transport of neonicotinoids near a wastewater treatment plant. Across all study areas, at least one neonicotinoid was detected in 63% of the 48 streams sampled.

AB Although there is keen interest in the potential adaptive value of epigenetic variation, it is unclear what conditions favor the stability of these variants either within or across generations. Because epigenetic modifications can be environmentally sensitive, existing theory on adaptive phenotypic plasticity provides relevant insights. Our consideration of this theory suggests that stable maintenance of environmentally induced epigenetic states over an organism's lifetime is most likely to be favored when the organism accurately responds to a single environmental change that subsequently remains constant, or when the environmental change cues an irreversible developmental transition. Stable transmission of adaptive epigenetic states from parents to offspring may be selectively favored when environments vary across generations and the parental environment predicts the offspring environment. The adaptive value of stability beyond a single generation of parent-offspring transmission likely depends on the costs of epigenetic resetting. Epigenetic stability both within and across generations will also depend on the degree and predictability of environmental variation, dispersal patterns, and the (epi)genetic architecture underlying phenotypic responses to environment. We also discuss conditions that favor stability of random epigenetic variants within the context of bet hedging. We conclude by proposing research directions to clarify the adaptive significance of epigenetic stability.

AB When animals live in cities, they have to adjust their behaviour and life histories to novel environments. Noise pollution puts a severe constraint on vocal communication by interfering with the detection of acoustic signals. Recent studies show that city birds sing higher-frequency songs than their conspecifics in non-urban habitats. This has been interpreted as an adaptation to counteract masking by traffic noise. However, this notion is debated, for the observed frequency shifts seem to be less efficient at mitigating noise than singing louder, and it has been suggested that city birds might use particularly high-frequency song elements because they can be produced at higher amplitudes. Here, we present the first phonetogram for a songbird, which shows that frequency and amplitude are strongly positively correlated in the common blackbird (Turdus merula), a successful urban colonizer. Moreover, city blackbirds preferentially sang higher-frequency elements that can be produced at higher intensities and, at the same time, happen to be less masked in low-frequency traffic noise.

AB As in mammals, insect health is strongly influenced by the composition and activities of resident microorganisms. However, the microbiota of insects is generally less diverse than that of mammals, allowing microbial function in insects to be coupled to individual, identified microbial species. This trait of insect symbioses facilitates our understanding of the mechanisms that promote insect-microbial coexistence and the processes by which the microbiota affect insect well-being. As a result, insects are potentially ideal models to study various aspects of interactions between the host and its resident microorganisms that would be impractical or unfeasible in mammals and to generate hypotheses for subsequent testing in mammalian models.

AB Landscape researchers and practitioners, using the lens of sustainability science, are breaking new ground about how people's behaviors and actions influence the structure, function, and change of designed landscapes in an urbanizing world. The phrase-the scientific basis of the design for landscape sustainability-is used to describe how sustainability science can contribute to translational landscape research and practice about the systemic relationships among landscape sustainability, people's contact with nature, and complex place-based problems. In the first section of this article, important definitions about the scientific basis of the design for landscape sustainability are reviewed including the six Es of landscape sustainability-environment, economic, equity, aesthetics, experience, and ethics. A conceptual framework about the six Es of landscape sustainability for designed landscapes is introduced. The interrelatedness, opportunities, contradictions, and limitations of the conceptual framework are discussed in relation to human health/security, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and resource management. The conceptual framework about the six Es of landscape sustainability for designed landscapes follows the tradition in which landscape researchers and practitioners synthesize emerging trends into conceptual frameworks for advancing basic and applied activities.

AB This paper discusses biotic interactions in agroecosystems and how they may be manipulated to support crop productivity and environmental health by provision of ecosystem services such as weed, pest and disease management, nutrient cycling and biodiversity conservation. Important elements for understanding biotic interactions include consideration of the effects of diversity, species composition and food web structure on ecosystem processes; the impacts of timing, frequency and intensity of disturbance; and the importance of multitrophic interactions. All of these elements need to be considered at multiple scales that depend in part on the range of the movement of the organisms involved. These issues are first discussed in general, followed by an examination of the application of these concepts in agricultural management. The potential for a greater use of ecological management approaches is high; however, owing to the nature of complex interactions in ecosystems, there is some inherent unpredictability about responses to management interventions under different conditions. Such uncertainty needs to be accommodated in the development of recommendations for farm management. This requires an increased emphasis on the effective synthesis of complex and often apparently contradictory information and on field-based adaptive research, monitoring and social learning by farmer/researcher collaborations.

AB Children with ADHD were compared to healthy controls on a task battery of cognitive control, measuring motor inhibition (Go/No-Go and Stop tasks), cognitive inhibition (motor Stroop and Switch tasks), sustained attention and time discrimination. Children with ADHD showed an inconsistent and premature response style across all 6 tasks. In addition they showed task-specific impairments in measures of sustained attention, time discrimination, and motor inhibition, but spared cognitive inhibition. Measures of impairment correlated with behavioral hyperactivity and with each other, suggesting that they measure interrelated aspects of a multifaceted construct of cognitive impulsiveness. The task battery as a whole showed 76% correct discrimination of cases and controls.

   RESPONSES
AB We tested direct and indirect measures of benthic metabolism as indicators of stream ecosystem health across a known agricultural land-use disturbance gradient in southeast Queensland, Australia. Gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R-24) in benthic chambers in cobble and sediment habitats, algal biomass (as chlorophyll a) from cobbles and sediment cores, algal biomass accrual on artificial substrates and stable carbon isotope ratios of aquatic plants and benthic sediments were measured at 53 stream sites, ranging from undisturbed subtropical rainforest to catchments where improved pasture and intensive cropping are major land-uses. Rates of benthic GPP and R-24 varied by more than two orders of magnitude across the study gradient. Generalised linear regression modelling explained 80% or more of the variation in these two indicators when sediment and cobble substrate dominated sites were considered separately, and both catchment and reach scale descriptors of the disturbance gradient were important in explaining this variation. Model fits were poor for net daily benthic metabolism (NDM) and production to respiration ratio (P/R). Algal biomass accrual on artificial substrate and stable carbon isotope ratios of aquatic plants and benthic sediment were the best of the indirect indicators, with regression model R-2 values of 50% or greater. Model fits were poor for algal biomass on natural substrates for cobble sites and all sites. None of these indirect measures of benthic metabolism was a good surrogate for measured GPP. Direct measures of benthic metabolism, GPP and R-24, and several indirect measures were good indicators of stream ecosystem health and are recommended in assessing process-related responses to riparian and catchment land use change and the success of ecosystem rehabilitation actions.

AB We measured nitrogen (N) transport to and storage in nine lakes linked by the Qu'Appelle River, Saskatchewan, Canada, to quantify the unique effects of N on the eutrophication of phosphorus (P)-replete lakes. Stable isotope content (delta N-15) was measured for dissolved N, periphyton, particulate organic matter (POM), and sediment samples collected at 10 stations along Wascana Creek and the Qu'Appelle River, lotic ecosystems that receive wastewaters from the City of Regina and that drain into Pasqua Lake. Urban effluent (delta N-15 similar to 16 +/- 2 parts per thousand) enriched dissolved N isotope ratios of river water by up to 15 parts per thousand but was not stored in lotic sediments. Instead, urban N increased delta N-15 signatures of lotic periphyton and POM by 10-15% and was transported to Pasqua Lake, where sedimentary delta N-15 values increased from similar to 6.5% during the 19th century to 14.0 parts per thousand by the 1990s. This increase was linearly correlated both to the mass of dissolved N released from Regina (r(2) = 0.84, p < 0.0001) and to a 300 parts per thousand increase in the production of Pasqua Lake (as fossil pigments) since ca. 1880 (r(2) = 0.69, p < 0.0001). Similar isotopic enrichment was recorded in five downstream lakes, but not three reference ecosystems, although the degree of downstream enrichment declined rapidly, mainly as a result of sequestration of urban N in lake sediments. Together, these patterns demonstrate that urban N can directly degrade surface waters of P-sufficient lakes, but that these ecosystems can eliminate urban effects through permanent storage of wastewater N in their sediments.

AB The Quaternary cold periods in the Northwestern Pacific are thought to have heavily influenced the amount and distribution of intraspecific genetic variation in marine fishes. To estimate the demographic history and genetic structure of Lateolabrax maculatus and L. japonicus in the Northwestern Pacific, 256 individuals were sampled from 19 localities throughout the distribution range of the two species. Mitochondrial DNA variation was analyzed using DNA sequence data from the cytochrome b gene and control region. Nucleotide diversity was much higher in L. japonicus (0.030) than in L. maculatus (0.012). The demographic history of the two species was examined using neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analyses and results indicated Pleistocene population expansion in both species. Estimates of population expansion time suggested earlier population expansion in L. japonicus than in L. maculatus. Molecular variance analyses showed differential genetic structuring for these two closely related species. The results indicated that L. Japonicus is panmictic throughout its range. In contrast, populations of L. maculatus showed statistically significant levels of genetic structuring. Pattern of isolation by distance was observed in L. maculatus, suggesting that L. maculatus is in genetic equilibrium. In contrast, L. japonicus did not exhibit isolation by distance.

AB The term vulnerability has been used in a variety of contexts, including climate change impact assessment. In this paper those issues relevant to climate change impacts on agriculture and species are discussed. Outputs from models are used to assess the vulnerability of fanners and species to climate and socio-economic change by estimating their sensitivity and capacity to adapt to external factors as a means of identifying what causes the differences in their vulnerability.
   The results showed that the vulnerability of both farmers and species is dependent on the scenario under consideration. In agriculture, it is the socio-economic scenarios that particularly lead to different patterns of intensification, extensification and abandonment. For species, vulnerability is more related to the climate change scenarios. In both cases, the adaptation options and potential were associated with the different socio-economic futures and policy intervention. The conceptual linking of the two sectors shows that impacts in the agriculture sector and consequent adaptation could have a significant effect on the adaptation potential of species. This demonstrates the importance of cross-sectoral assessments of vulnerability and highlights the importance of sectoral integration in policy development and implementation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We performed extensive and realistic simulations of the colonization process of Europe by Neolithic farmers, as well as their potential admixture and competition with local Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. We find that minute amounts of gene flow between Palaeolithic and Neolithic populations should lead to a massive Palaeolithic contribution to the current gene pool of Europeans. This large Palaeolithic contribution is not expected under the demic diffusion (DD) model, which postulates that agriculture diffused over Europe by a massive migration of individuals from the Near East. However, genetic evidence in favour of this model mainly consisted in the observation of allele frequency clines over Europe, which are shown here to be equally probable under a pure DD or a pure acculturation model. The examination of the consequence of range expansions on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity reveals that an ascertainment bias consisting of selecting SNPs with high frequencies will promote the observation of genetic clines (which are not expected for random SNPs) and will lead to multimodal mismatch distributions. We conclude that the different patterns of molecular diversity observed for Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA can be at least partly owing to an ascertainment bias when selecting Y chromosome SNPs for studying European populations.

We employed six microsatellite markers to identify first generation hybrids and backcrosses between native crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and introduced goldfish (C. auratus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in the U.K. We also investigated the genetic characteristics of the taxonomically controversial gibel carp (Carassius spp.) from sites across Europe.
   3. Natural hybridisation between goldfish and crucian carp occurs frequently, although hybrids between all other species pairs were observed. Only 62% of British crucian carp populations (n = 21) consisted exclusively of pure crucian carp. In some populations hybrids were so frequent, that no pure crucian carp were caught, indicating a high competitive ability of hybrids.
   4. Most hybrids belonged to the F1 generation but backcrossing was evident at a low frequency in goldfish x crucian carp hybrids and goldfish x common carp hybrids. Furthermore, some local populations had high frequencies of backcrosses, raising the opportunity for introgression.
   5. Gibel carp from Germany and Italy belonged to two triploid clonal lineages that were genetically closely related to goldfish, whereas all individuals identified from British populations proved to be crucian carp x goldfish hybrids.
   6. Our study suggests that the release of closely related exotic cyprinids not only poses a threat to the genetic integrity and associated local adaptations of native species, but may also contribute to shifts in community structure through competitive interactions.

AB A new ordination method, called co-correspondence analysis, is developed to relate two types of communities (e.g., a plant community and an animal community) sampled at a common set of sites in a direct way. The method improves the simple, indirect approach of applying correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging) to the separate species data sets and correlating the resulting ordination axes. Co-correspondence analysis maximizes the weighted covariance between weighted averaged species scores of one community and weighted averaged species scores of the other community. It thus attempts to identify the. patterns that are common to both communities. Both a symmetric descriptive, and an asymmetric predictive form are developed. The symmetric form relates to co-inertia analysis and the asymmetric, predictive form to partial least-squares regression. In two examples the predictive power of co-correspondence analysis is compared with that of canonical correspondence analyses on syntaxonomic and environmental data. In the first example, carabid beetles in roadside verges are shown to be more closely related to plant species composition than to vegetation structure (biomass, height, roughness, among others), and, in the second example, bryophytes in spring meadows are shown to be more closely related to the species composition of the vascular plants than to the measured water chemistry.

AB Male birdsong has a great influence in the stimulation of female reproduction. However, female physiological responsiveness to song may depend on the degree of complexity of male song. This is expected because females of iteroparous organisms may increase their fitness by matching their reproductive investment to the predicted value of each reproductive attempt. To the extent that the expression of male ornaments is a signal of male quality, we expect females to increase their investment when paired to highly ornamented males. However, female investment may be cryptic and difficult to detect, such as androgen content in the eggs. In this study, we exposed female canaries (Serinus canaria) to attractive and unattractive song repertoires using a crossover design. As predicted, females invested greater concentrations of testosterone in their eggs when exposed to attractive repertoires than when exposed to unattractive repertoires. This implies that song repertoires convey important information about the reproductive value of a given male and suggests that testosterone deposition in egg yolk may be costly.

AB A demographic study was carried out on Bertholletia excelsa, the Brazil nut tree, in two primary forest sites in Northern Bolivia where Brazil nuts have been harvested for several decades. In spite of the large proportion (93%) of seeds that are harvested, reasonable densities of recently, emerged seedlings were found. Seeds of Bertholletia are contained in woody, fruits that are primarily opened by agoutis. Most fruits are left untouched on the forest floor for 1-2 y, before they are opened, possibly due to high energetic costs of fruit opening just after fruit fall. However, the proportion of viable seeds is strongly reduced in older fruits.
   Growth in diameter at breast height (dbh) was low for pole-sized trees (< 15 cm dbh) and adult trees (> 100 cm dbh) and peaked for intermediate-sized trees (30-60 cm). These trees often attained a growth rate of > 1.5 cm y(-1), which is high compared with other non-pioneer tropical trees. This, and the strong growth response to increased light availability found for seedlings and saplings, suggest that Bertholletia excelsa can be classified as a gap-dependent species. Matrix population models were constructed for both study populations. Population growth rates (lambda) were close to one, and were most sensitive to persistence in one size category. Age estimates revealed that age at first reproduction (at dbh > 60 cm) amounts to over 120 y, and age in the last category (dbh > 160 cm) to almost 300 y. Given the continuous rejuvenation of the Population, the stable population size, the high age at maturity and the long reproductive period, it is concluded that current levels of Brazil nut extraction may be sustained at least for several decades and perhaps for even longer periods.

AB Relationships of wolves (Canis lupus) and ungulates were studied in the Polish part of Bialowieza Primeval Forest with high densities of prey. The number of wolves ranged from 7 to 19, and the number of packs ranged from 2 to 4. Average densities were 2.3 wolves/100 km(2). Red deer (Cervus elaphus) was the main prey of wolves. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), moose (Alces alces), and European bison (Bison bonasus) were hunted less than expected based on their abundance. Mean mass of ungulates killed by wolves was 55 kg. Prey were consumed quickly, with 57% of kills completely eaten on the Ist day after killing. Average killing rate by wolves was 0.78 ungulate per wolf pack per day (0.14 prey item per wolf per day). Results of this study combined with the data obtained in the Belarussian part of Bialowieza Primeval Forest in 1946-1985 allowed for analysis of dietary response of wolves to changes in densities of ungulates. Wolves showed a response to abundance of red deer. The amount of other ungulates in their diet depended on the densities of red deer. From 1991 to 1996, wolves annually removed 57-105 red deer, 19-38 wild boar, 19-25 roe deer, and 0-2 moose per 100 km(2). Those amounts were equivalent to 9-13% of spring-summer densities of red deer, 4-8% of wild boar, 3-4% of roe deer, and 0-29% of moose. Additionally, hunters annually harvested 131-140 red deer, 44-114 roe deer, 1-7 moose, and 45-142 wild boar per 100 km(2). Effects of predation and harvest by hunters on ungulate mortality were likely additive and caused declines in ungulate populations during our study.

AB Climate and biophysical regulation of terrestrial plant production and interannual responses to anomalous events were investigated using the NASA Ames model version of CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) in a transient simulation mode. This ecosystem model has been calibrated for simulations driven by satellite vegetation index data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over the mid-1980s. Relatively large net source fluxes of carbon were estimated from terrestrial vegetation about 6 months to 1 year following El Nino events of 1983 and 1987, whereas the years 1984 and 1988 showed a drop in net primary production (NPP) of 1-2 Pg (10(15) g) C from their respective previous years. Zonal discrimination of model results implies that the northern hemisphere low latitudes could account for almost the entire 2 Pg C decrease in global terrestrial NPP predicted from 1983 to 1984. Model estimates further suggest that from 1985 to 1988, the northern middle-latitude zone (between 30 degrees and 60 degrees N) was the principal region driving progressive increases in NPP, mainly by an expanded growing season moving toward the zonal latitude extremes. Comparative regional analysis of model controls on NPP reveals that although Normalized Difference Vegetation Index "greenness" can alone account for 30%-90% of the variation in NPP interannual anomalies, temperature or radiation loading can have a fairly significant I-year lag effect on annual NPP at middle- to high-latitude zones, whereas rainfall amount and temperature drying effects may carry over with at least a 2-year lag time to influence NPP in semiarid tropical zones.

AB The environmental impacts of salmon net-pen aquaculture on the benthic environment were investigated at a commercial fish farm located in coastal Maine waters. This site has a sandy mud bottom and low current velocities, is subjected to episodic sediment resuspension, and was in production for 3 yr prior to this study. We examined both the increase in carbon flux to the benthos caused by the net-pen and the effects of the elevated flux on sediment biogeochemistry and the microbial and macrobenthic communities. The experimental design involved the establishment of two study sites, an ambient site ca. 100 m from the net-pen and a treatment site around the pen. Sediment traps deployed 1 m above the sediment-water interface indicated that carbon flux to the benthos was increased 1-fold to 6-fold (to a maximum of 5 g m(-2) d(-1)) at the edge of the net-pen with little or no increase in carbon flux 10 m from the pen. Unlike carbon flux rates, sediment organic matter inventories showed a complex pattern of change over time. Mineral surface area, organic carbon and nitrogen, digestible protein, and sterol content were initially (April 1991) lower beneath the pen than in ambient sediments. During 1991 ambient sediment accumulated organic matter until July after which it decreased, to a low during November. In contrast, organic matter inventories of sediment beneath the pen remained low until July and then increased to a high during November. These latter gains were associated with the development of bacterial mats at the sediment-water interface. Beneath the pen, microbial and macrofaunal communities were shifted toward those commonly associated with organic enrichment but seasonal trends and storm-related resuspension events also significantly affected these sediment communities. When abundant, most epibenthic organisms were more numerous near the pen than in adjacent ambient areas. These results suggest that net-pen aquaculture can alter the benthic ecosystem in Maine Coastal waters but indicate that the effects are spatially limited.

AB We found similarities in space use responses by individual root voles Microtus oeconomus and capercaillie grouse Tetrao urogallus to habitat fragmentation. Male capercaillies and some male voles responded to a fine-grained fragmentation pattern by expanding their home ranges to include more than one habitat fragment. Breeding female voles belonging to a northern, aggressive strain spread out over single habitat fragments (fission response) when the habitat was moderately coarse-grained The same response was shown by lekking capercaillie males in the spring; as their spring lek habitat gradually became more coarse-grained due to logging, coalitions of neighbouring males dissolved, resulting in solitary displaying individuals. Breeding female voles belonging to a southern, docile strain and capercaillie males (in the non-breeding season) responded to a coarse-grained habitat fragmentation by congregating with highly overlapping home ranges on remaining habitat patches. Our results suggest that experimentally tractable species (e.g. voles) may be used as Experimental Model Systems (EMS) to predict responses by other wildlife species (such as capercaillie grouse) which are less amenable to experimentation.

AB Fire is a powerful ecological and evolutionary force that regulates organismal traits, population sizes, species interactions, community composition, carbon and nutrient cycling and ecosystem function. It also presents a rapidly growing societal challenge, due to both increasingly destructive wildfires and fire exclusion in fire-dependent ecosystems. As an ecological process, fire integrates complex feedbacks among biological, social and geophysical processes, requiring coordination across several fields and scales of study.
   Here, we describe the diversity of ways in which fire operates as a fundamental ecological and evolutionary process on Earth. We explore research priorities in six categories of fire ecology: (a) characteristics of fire regimes, (b) changing fire regimes, (c) fire effects on above-ground ecology, (d) fire effects on below-ground ecology, (e) fire behaviour and (f) fire ecology modelling.
   We identify three emergent themes: the need to study fire across temporal scales, to assess the mechanisms underlying a variety of ecological feedbacks involving fire and to improve representation of fire in a range of modelling contexts.
   Synthesis: As fire regimes and our relationships with fire continue to change, prioritizing these research areas will facilitate understanding of the ecological causes and consequences of future fires and rethinking fire management alternatives.

AB Gross primary production (GPP)-the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) by leaves, and its conversion to sugars by photosynthesis-is the basis for life on land. Earth System Models (ESMs) incorporating the interactions of land ecosystems and climate are used to predict the future of the terrestrial sink for anthropogenic CO21. ESMs require accurate representation of GPP. However, current ESMs disagree on how GPP responds to environmental variations(1,2), suggesting a need for a more robust theoretical framework for modelling(3,4). Here, we focus on a key quantity for GPP, the ratio of leaf internal to external CO2 (chi). chi is tightly regulated and depends on environmental conditions, but is represented empirically and incompletely in today's models. We show that a simple evolutionary optimality hypothesis(5,6) predicts specific quantitative dependencies of chi on temperature, vapour pressure deficit and elevation; and that these same dependencies emerge from an independent analysis of empirical chi values, derived from a worldwide dataset of >3,500 leaf stable carbon isotope measurements. A single global equation embodying these relationships then unifies the empirical light-use efficiency model(7) with the standard model of C-3 photosynthesis(8), and successfully predicts GPP measured at eddy-covariance flux sites. This success is notable given the equation's simplicity and broad applicability across biomes and plant functional types. It provides a theoretical underpinning for the analysis of plant functional coordination across species and emergent properties of ecosystems, and a potential basis for the reformulation of the controls of GPP in next-generation ESMs.

AB The aim of the current study is to map landslide susceptibility over the Ziarat watershed in the Golestan Province, Iran, using Maximum Entropy (ME), as a machine learning model, with two sampling strategies: Mahalanobis distance (MEMD) and random sampling (MERS). To this aim, a total of 92 landslides in the watershed were recorded as point features using a GPS (Global Positioning System) device, along with several field surveys and available local data. By reviewing landslide-related studies and using principal component analysis, 12 landslide-controlling factors were chosen namely altitude, slope percent, slope aspect, lithological formations, proximity (to faults, streams, and roads), land use/cover, precipitation, plan and profile curvature and the state-ofthe-art topo-hydrological factor known as height above the nearest drainage (HAND). Two sampling methods were used to divide landslides into two sets of training (70%) and test (30%). The Area under the success rate curve (AUSRC) and the area under the prediction rate curve (AUPRC) were used to evaluate the results of the MEMD and MERS. The results showed that both MEMD and MERS strategies with the respective AUSRC values of 0.884 and 0.878, have good performance in modelling the landslide susceptibility in the study area. However, AUPRC test showed slightly different results in which MEMD with the value of 0.906 showed excellent predictive power in comparison with the MERS with the AUPRC value of 0.846. The higher AUPRC value in relation to AUSRC indicated the MEMD as the premier model in the current study. According to the MEMD, three landslide controlling factors including lithological formations, proximity to roads and precipitation with the respective contribution percentages of 25.1%, 23.3%, and 19.1%, contained more information in relation to the rest. Moreover, according to one-by-one factor removal test, lithological formations and proximity to faults were identified to have a unique information compared to the rest. According to the MEMD, about 13.8% of the study area is located within high to very high susceptibility classes which can be matter of great interest to decision makers and the local authorities for formulating land use planning strategies and implementing pragmatic measures.

AB Temperature is a primary driver of the distribution of biodiversity as well as of ecosystem boundaries(1,2). Declining temperature with increasing elevation in montane systems has long been recognized as a major factor shaping plant community biodiversity, metabolic processes, and ecosystem dynamics(3,4). Elevational gradients, as thermoclines, also enable prediction of long-term ecological responses to climate warming(5-7). One of the most striking manifestations of increasing elevation is the abrupt transitions from forest to treeless alpine tundra(8). However, whether there are globally consistent above-and belowground responses to these transitions remains an open question(4). To disentangle the direct and indirect effects of temperature on ecosystem properties, here we evaluate replicate treeline ecotones in seven temperate regions of the world. We find that declining temperatures with increasing elevation did not affect tree leaf nutrient concentrations, but did reduce ground-layer community-weighted plant nitrogen, leading to the strong stoichiometric convergence of ground-layer plant community nitrogen to phosphorus ratios across all regions. Further, elevation-driven changes in plant nutrients were associated with changes in soil organic matter content and quality (carbon to nitrogen ratios) and microbial properties. Combined, our identification of direct and indirect temperature controls over plant communities and soil properties in seven contrasting regions suggests that future warming may disrupt the functional properties of montane ecosystems, particularly where plant community reorganization outpaces treeline advance.

AB Gall-inducing insects are iconic examples in the manipulation and reprogramming of plant development, inducing spectacular morphological and physiological changes of host-plant tissues within which the insect feeds and grows. Despite decades of research, effectors involved in gall induction and basic mechanisms of gall formation remain unknown. Recent research suggests that some aspects of the plant manipulation shown by gall-inducers may be shared with other insect herbivorous life histories. Here, we illustrate similarities and contrasts by reviewing current knowledge of metabolic and morphological effects induced on plants by gall-inducing and leaf-mining insects, and ask whether leaf-miners can also be considered to be plant reprogrammers. We review key plant functions targeted by various plant reprogrammers, including plant-manipulating insects and nematodes, and functionally characterize insect herbivore-derived effectors to provide a broader understanding of possible mechanisms used in host plant manipulation. Consequences of plant reprogramming in terms of ecology, coevolution and diversification of plant-manipulating insects are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This review summarises the current knowledge on cryptic species of polychaetes, one of the most dominant taxa in marine communities, and gives a brief overview of the different methods that has been used for their disclosure. Cryptic species constitute an important part of biodiversity and they are common among all kinds of polychaetes, with different life history traits, and may have sympatric as well as allopatric distributions. It is emphasised that cryptic species must not be neglected for a variety of reasons, and even though the magnitude of cryptic species is largely unknown the available data on polychaetes clearly demonstrate that morphology alone seriously underestimate the number of species. It is suggested that future research should focus on appropriately designed case-studies using combined approaches, as well as on large-scale whole sample analyses using next-generation sequencing in order to be able to answer the many questions that still remains.

AB Thermal trait variation is of fundamental importance to forecasting the impacts of environmental change on lizard diversity. Here, we review the literature for patterns of variation in traits of upper and lower sub-lethal temperature limits, temperature preference and active body temperature in the field, in relation to space, time and phylogeny. Through time, we focus on the direction and magnitude of trait change within days, among seasons and as a consequence of acclimation. Across space, we examine altitudinal and latitudinal patterns, incorporating inter-specific analyses at regional and global scales. This synthesis highlights the consistency or lack thereof, of thermal trait responses, the relative magnitude of change among traits and several knowledge gaps identified in the relationships examined. We suggest that physiological information is becoming essential for forecasting environmental change sensitivity of lizards by providing estimates of plasticity and evolutionary scope.

AB Changes to land use affect streams through nutrient enrichment, increased inputs of sediment and, where riparian vegetation has been removed, raised water temperature. We manipulated all three stressors in experimental streamside channels for 30 days and determined the individual and pair-wise combined effects on benthic invertebrate and algal communities and on leaf decay, a measure of ecosystem functioning. We added nutrients (phosphorus+nitrogen; high, intermediate, natural) and/or sediment (grain size 0.2 mm; high, intermediate, natural) to 18 channels supplied with water from a nearby stream. Temperature was increased by 1.4 degrees C in half the channels, simulating the loss of upstream and adjacent riparian shade. Sediment affected 93% of all biological response variables (either as an individual effect or via an interaction with another stressor) generally in a negative manner, while nutrient enrichment affected 59% (mostly positive) and raised temperature 59% (mostly positive). More of the algal components of the community responded to stressors acting individually than did invertebrate components, whereas pair-wise stressor interactions were more common in the invertebrate community. Stressors interacted often and in a complex manner, with interactions between sediment and temperature most common. Thus, the negative impact of high sediment on taxon richness of both algae and invertebrates was stronger at raised temperature, further reducing biodiversity. In addition, the decay rate of leaf material (strength loss) accelerated with nutrient enrichment at ambient but not at raised temperature. A key implication of our findings for resource managers is that the removal of riparian shading from streams already subjected to high sediment inputs, or land-use changes that increase erosion or nutrient runoff in a landscape without riparian buffers, may have unexpected effects on stream health. We highlight the likely importance of intact or restored buffer strips, both in reducing sediment input and in maintaining cooler water temperatures.

AB 1. Conflict between people and large carnivores is an urgent conservation issue world-wide. Understanding the underlying ecological drivers of livestock depredation by large carnivores is greatly needed.
   2. We studied the spatial, foraging and behavioural ecology of African lions Panthera leo in the Botswana Makgadikgadi ecosystem. This ecosystem comprises a protected area, characterized by high seasonal fluctuation in wild prey abundance, and adjacent lands, which are used for livestock grazing and characterized by stable livestock abundance, but also a risk of anthropogenic mortality.
   3. Makgadikgadi lions preferentially preyed upon migratory wild herbivores when they were present; however, data from GPS (Global Positioning System) radiocollared lions revealed that the majority of the study lions did not follow the migratory herds but remained resident at one or other border of the park and switched to livestock (abundant and readily available), and to a lesser extent resident wild herbivores (relatively scarce), in periods of migratory wild herbivore scarcity.
   4. Resident lions' use of space differed between periods of wild prey abundance and scarcity. These changes were likely to increase the frequency of encounter with their primary prey in periods of primary prey abundance and with livestock in periods of primary prey scarcity.
   5. The risk of conflict with humans was a major driver of lion ecology in the human-dominated landscape surrounding the protected area. Resident lions generally avoided the close vicinity of cattle-posts. When they used such areas, they avoided temporal overlap with periods that humans were most active and travelled at high speed reducing the time spent in these areas.
   6. Synthesis and applications. This study suggests that lions balance the benefits of accessing livestock with the costs associated with livestock raiding. Hence, reduction in livestock availability through effective livestock husbandry in periods of wild prey scarcity should lead to reduced conflict.

AB Using the eddy covariance technique, three years (October 2005-September 2008) of water and energy flux measurements were obtained for a winter wheat/summer maize rotation cropland in the North China Plain. This region is critical for food production in China, and is prone to significant water shortages and drought. Seasonal and interannual variability in evapotranspiration (ET) were examined in terms of relevant controlling factors. The annual ET was 595 and 609 mm in the periods of 2005-2006 and 20062007, respectively. The average seasonal ET in the wheat and maize field was 401 and 212 mm, respectively. Seasonal variability in ET was primarily explained by the variations in equilibrium evaporation (ETeq) and canopy conductance (G(s)). Daily evapotranspiration ranged from 1.0 to 7.8 mm day(-1) during the wheat season and reached up to 5.1 mm day(-1) during the maize season. The maximum midday average G(s) was 32 mm s(-1) for wheat and 17 mm s(-1) for maize. During the rapid growth stages, the average midday LE/R-n (LE is latent heat flux, R-n is net radiation) was 83% for wheat and 57% for maize, indicating a higher water consumption for wheat than for maize. On an annual basis, latent heat flux accounted for about 59% of the net radiation, suggesting that more energy is partitioned into evapotranspiration in this agroecosystem site. Regional irrigation promoted sensible heat advection from the surrounding drier surface during the wheat seasons. Monthly ET totals enhanced by sensible heat advection accounted for 27% of the ETeq during the rapid growing season of wheat. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Stream ecosystem health monitoring and reporting need to be developed in the context of an adaptive process that is clearly linked to identified values and objectives, is informed by rigorous science, guides management actions and is responsive to changing perceptions and values of stakeholders. To be effective, monitoring programmes also need to be underpinned by an understanding of the probable causal factors that influence the condition or health of important environmental assets and values. This is often difficult in stream and river ecosystems where multiple stressors, acting at different spatial and temporal scales, interact to affect water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem processes.
   2. In this article, we describe the development of a freshwater monitoring programme in South East Queensland, Australia, and how this has been used to report on ecosystem health at a regional scale and to guide investments in catchment protection and rehabilitation. We also discuss some of the emerging science needs to identify the appropriate scale and spatial arrangement of rehabilitation to maximise river ecosystem health outcomes and, at the same time, derive other benefits downstream.
   3. An objective process was used to identify potential indicators of stream ecosystem health and then test these across a known catchment land-use disturbance gradient. From the 75 indicators initially tested, 22 from five indicator groups (water quality, ecosystem metabolism, nutrient cycling, invertebrates and fish) responded strongly to the disturbance gradient, and 16 were subsequently recommended for inclusion in the monitoring programme. The freshwater monitoring programme was implemented in 2002, funded by local and State government authorities, and currently involves the assessment of over 120 sites, twice per year. This information, together with data from a similar programme on the region's estuarine and coastal marine waters, forms the basis of an annual report card that is presented in a public ceremony to local politicians and the broader community.
   4. Several key lessons from the SEQ Healthy Waterways Programme are likely to be transferable to other regional programmes aimed at improving aquatic ecosystem health, including the importance of a shared common vision, the involvement of committed individuals, a cooperative approach, the need for defensible science and effective communication.
   5. Thematic implications: this study highlights the use of conceptual models and objective testing of potential indicators against a known disturbance gradient to develop a freshwater ecosystem health monitoring programme that can diagnose the probable causes of degradation from multiple stressors and identify the appropriate spatial scale for rehabilitation or protection. This approach can lead to more targeted management investments in catchment protection and rehabilitation, greater public confidence that limited funds are being well spent and better outcomes for stream and river ecosystem health.

AB Competition is a key process in plant populations and communities. We thus need, if we are to predict the responses of ecological systems to environmental change, a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of plant competition. Considering competition, however, only at the population level is not sufficient because plant individuals usually are different, interact locally, and can adapt their behaviour to the current state of themselves and of their biotic and abiotic environment. Therefore, simulation models that are individual-based and spatially explicit are increasingly used for studying competition in plant systems. Many different individual-based modelling approaches exist to represent competition, but it is not clear how good they are in reflecting essential aspects of plant competition. We therefore first summarize current concepts and theories addressing plant competition. Then, we review individual-based approaches for modelling competition among plants. We distinguish between approaches that are used for more than 10 years and more recent ones. We identify three major gaps that need to be addressed more in the future: the effects of plants on their local environment, adaptive behaviour, and below-ground competition. To fill these gaps, the representation of plants and their interactions have to be more mechanistic than most existing approaches. Developing such new approaches is a challenge because they are likely to be more complex and to require more detailed knowledge and data on individual-level processes underlying competition. We thus need a more integrated research strategy for the future, where empirical and theoretical ecologists as well as computer scientists work together on formulating, implementing, parameterization, testing, comparing, and selecting the new approaches.

AB 1. The relationships between biological traits of macroinvertebrates and environmental characteristics were investigated in streams with contrasting physical, chemical or landscape level attributes. We used an ordination technique, RLQ analysis, which links an environmental table (R) with traits table (Q) through an abundance table (L) to investigate the relationship between habitat characteristics and biological traits.
   2. A major environmental axis explaining the distribution of species and their distinctive biological features was obtained. This axis included variables of anthropogenic pressure (agricultural and urban uses) and natural variability (climatic and geologic) that are strongly intercorrelated in the study area, with a clear spatial component.
   3. The attributes of species from frequently disturbed systems (small size, multivoltinism, diapause, ovoviviparity, etc.) were associated with semi-arid areas whereas traits common in more stable and favourable environments (large body size, semi-voltinism, isolated eggs, etc.) were found in upland forested areas.
   4. The natural climatic variation was proposed as a disturbance axis of a theoretical habitat templet (driven by the intense hydrological disturbances typical of semi-arid streams), while anthropogenic pressure (mainly intensive agriculture) and high salinity, a natural consequence of geology, was proposed as an adversity axis. Different life-histories associated with contrasting environmental features were superimposed in this habitat templet.
   5. The ecological-evolutionary scenario in which stream macroinvertebrates have evolved and by which their communities are organized, is closely linked to disturbance, environmental harshness and human pressure.

AB Parasites represent a great proportion of the world's living organisms and are of overwhelming significance because of their impact on hosts (evolutionarily, medically, agronomical and economically). The knowledge of the population biology of such organisms is thus of fundamental importance to population biologists. Most parasites cannot be studied by direct methods and their biology has to be assessed via indirect means, most notably using molecular markers. In this review, we present the molecular tools, the null models employed, the statistical tools available and the kinds of inferences one can make when using molecular markers to study the ecology/epidemiology of host-parasite systems (molecular ecology/molecular epidemiology). We conclude with relevant examples, most issued from our laboratory, to illustrate the pros and cons of such methods for the study of parasites, vectors, micropathogens and their hosts and briefly discuss future needs.

AB Processes interacting across scales of space and time influence emergent patterns in ecological systems, but to obtain strong inference and empirical generalities, ecologists need to balance reality with the practicalities of design and analyses. This article discusses heterogeneity, scaling, and design analysis problems and offers potential solutions to improve empirically based research. In particular, we recommend bridging the dichotomy between correlative and manipulative studies by nesting manipulative studies within a correlative framework. We suggest that building on variation, by designing studies to detect variability, rather than fighting it often leads to an increase in generality. We also emphasize the importance of natural history information for determining likely scales of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and the probable occurrence of feedback loops, indirect effects, and interacting processes. Finally, we integrate these concepts and suggest planned iterations between multiscale studies to build up natural history information and test the strength of relationships across space and time. This offers a way forward in terms of heuristically developing models and determining ecological generalities.

AB Rapa Nui (Easter Island) has become a paragon for prehistoric human induced ecological catastrophe and cultural collapse. A popular narrative recounts an obsession for monumental statuary that led to the island's ecological devastation and the collapse of the ancient civilization. Scholars offer this story as a parable of today's global environmental problems. In this paper, I review new and emerging Rapa Nui evidence, compare ecological and recently acquired palaeo-environmental data from the Hawaiian and other Pacific Islands, and offer some perspectives for the island's prehistoric ecological transformation and its consequences. The evidence points to a complex historical ecology for the island; one best explained by a synergy of impacts, particularly the devastating effects of introduced rats (Rattus exulans). This perspective questions the simplistic notion of reckless over-exploitation by prehistoric Polynesians and points to the need for additional research. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal effects often explain a significant amount of variation in offspring phenotype, and can be important in the evolution of life histories. Incubation of eggs is an important maternal effect, and optimal growth and development of avian embryos takes place within a narrow range of incubation temperatures, but the effect of incubation microclimate on neonate phenotype remains relatively unexplored in birds.
   In this study of Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa Linnaeus) we examined effects of incubation temperature on the length of incubation period and neonate quality. We monitored nest temperatures and incubation periods of naturally incubated Wood Duck nests and found a strong inverse relationship between incubation period and average nest temperature.
   Next, we collected three unincubated eggs from each of 48 nests, and randomly assigned eggs from each nest to one of three incubation temperatures (34.6, 36.0 and 37.4 degrees C). Experimental incubation temperatures overlapped average nest temperatures of naturally incubated Wood Duck nests.
   Hatching success varied with incubation temperature and was lowest for eggs incubated at the lowest temperature. Incubation period of experimental eggs decreased with increasing temperature but was not affected by fresh egg mass.
   Wood Duck embryos catabolized an estimated 34-38% of egg lipids and 25-33% of egg protein during incubation. Percentage change of lipids increased with decreasing incubation temperature, but not significantly. Embryos incubated at lower temperatures used a greater percentage of protein than embryos incubated at higher temperatures.
   In analyses using fresh egg mass as the covariate, we found that wet and dry mass of ducklings increased with increasing incubation temperature. Decreases in lipid content of Wood Duck neonates with decreasing incubation temperature were not significant, but eggs incubated at low temperatures produced ducklings that had reduced protein mass and that were structurally larger than ducklings from eggs incubated at high temperatures.
   Our study illustrates the importance of incubation temperature on the development of Wood Duck embryos. Decisions made by incubating parents that influence egg temperature can modify incubation period and offspring phenotype. Investigations of incubation as a reproductive cost should consider how parental decisions influence both parents and offspring.

AB We sampled the understory community in an old-growth, temperate forest to test alternative hypotheses explaining the establishment of exotic plants. We quantified the individual and net importance of distance from areas of human disturbance, native plant diversity, and environmental gradients in determining exotic plant establishment. Distance from disturbed areas, both within and around the reserve, was not correlated to exotic species richness. Numbers of native and exotic species were positively correlated at large (50 m(2)) and small (10 m(2)) plot sizes, a trend that persisted when relationships to environmental gradients were controlled statistically. Both native and exotic species richness increased with soil pH and decreased along a gradient of increasing nitrate availability. Exotic species were restricted to the upper portion of the pH gradient and had individualistic responses to the availability of soil resources. These results are inconsistent with both the diversity-resistance and resource-enrichment hypotheses for invasibility. Environmental conditions favoring native species richness also favor exotic species richness, and competitive interactions with the native flora do not appear to limit the entry of additional species into the understory community at this site. It appears that exotic species with niche requirements poorly represented in the regional flora of native species may establish with relatively little resistance or consequence for native species richness.

AB The human enterprise is flooding Earth's ecosystems with exotic species. Human population size is often correlated with species introductions, whereas more proximate mechanisms, such as economic activities, are frequently overlooked. Here we present a hypothesis that links ecology and economics to provide a causal framework for the distribution of exotic plants in the United States. We test two competing hypotheses (the population-only and population-economic models) using a national data set of exotic plants, employing a statistical framework to simultaneously model direct and indirect effects of human population and ecological and economic variables. The population-only model included direct effects of human population and ecological factors as predictors of exotics. In contrast, the population-economic model included the direct effects of economic and ecological factors and the indirect effects of human population as predictors of exotics. The explicit addition of economic activity in the population-economic model provided a better explanation for the distribution of exotics than did the population-only model. The population-economic model explained 75% of the variation in the number of exotic plants in the 50 states and provided a good description of the observed number of exotic plants in the Canadian provinces and in other nations in 85% of the cases. A specific economic activity, real estate gross state product, had the strongest positive effect on the number of exotics. The strong influence of economics on exotics demonstrates that economics matter for resolving the exotic-species problem because the underlying causes, and some of the solutions, may lie in human-economic behaviors.

AB Although mitochondrial DNA markers have several properties that make them suitable for phylogeographic studies, they are not free of difficulties. Phylogeographic inferences within and between closely related species can be mislead by introgression and retention of ancestral polymorphism. Here we combine different phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and population genetic methods to extract the maximum information from the Liolaemus darwinii complex. We estimate the phylogeographic structure of L. darwinii across most of its distributional range, and we then estimate relationships between L. darwinii and the syntopic species L. laurenti and L. grosseorum. Our results suggest that range expansion of these lineages brought them into secondary contact in areas where they are presently in syntopy. Here we present the first evidence for introgression in lizards from temperate South America (of L. darwinii mitochondrial DNA into L. laurenti and L. grosseorum), and for incomplete lineage sorting (between L. darwinii and L. laurenti). We show that a combination of methods can provide additional support for inferences derived from any single method and thus provide more robust interpretations and narrow the range of plausible hypotheses about mechanisms and processes of divergence. Additional studies are needed in this group of lizards and in other codistributed groups to determine if Pleistocene climatic changes could be a general factor influencing the evolutionary history of a regional biota.

AB Sexual-selection theory assumes that there are costs associated with ornamental plumage coloration. While pigment-based ornaments have repeatedly been shown to be condition dependent, this has been more difficult to demonstrate for structural colours. We present evidence for condition dependence of both types of plumage colour in nestling blue tits (Parus caeruleus). Using reflectance spectrometry, we show that blue tit nestlings are sexually dichromatic, with males having more chromatic (more 'saturated') and ultraviolet (LTV)-shifted tail coloration and more chromatic yellow breast coloration. The sexual dimorphism in nestling tail coloration is qualitatively similar to that of chick-feeding adults from the same population. By contrast, the breast plumage of adult birds is not sexually dichromatic in terms of chroma. In nestlings, the chroma of both tail and breast feathers is positively associated with condition (body mass on day 14). The UV/blue hue of the tail feathers is influenced by paternally inherited genes, as indicated by a maternal half-sibling comparison. We conclude that the expression of both carotenoid-based and structural coloration seems to be condition dependent in blue tit nestlings, and that there are additional genetic effects on the hue of the UV/blue tail feathers. The signalling or other functions of sexual dichromatism in nestlings remain obscure. Our study shows that nestling blue tits are suitable model organisms for the study of ontogenetic costs and heritability of both carotenoid-based and structural colour in birds.

AB 1. The consequences of environmental variability for life-history evolution are predicted to depend on the pattern of covariation amongst life-history traits. Using data from a 20-year study of individually marked red-billed choughs, we investigate the short- and long-term life-history consequences of population-wide variation in reproductive conditions, and demonstrate clear among-cohort variation and covariation in life-history parameters.
   2. The mean number of offspring fledging per breeding event varied among years, and was correlated with environmental conditions (temperature and rainfall) during the months preceding breeding. As the variance in breeding performance did not differ among years and choughs did not miss breeding seasons, variation in environmental conditions affected the whole breeding population. Thus the quality of the chough's breeding environment varied amongst years.
   3. Juvenile survival, the probability of recruitment to the breeding population and breeding longevity varied amongst cohorts, and these were positively correlated with the quality of the cohort's natal environment. Offspring fledging under good conditions were more likely to survive to breeding age and recruit, and had longer breeding lives than offspring fledging under poor conditions.
   4. Age at first breeding varied amongst cohorts, and increased with population size at maturity rather than natal conditions.
   5. The total number of offspring that recruits ultimately fledged varied primarily with breeding longevity rather than recruitment age. Thus, the consistent positive covariation amongst life-history traits meant that the total number of offspring fledged by recruits during their breeding life varied amongst cohorts, and was correlated with the quality of a cohort's natal conditions. Choughs fledging under good conditions themselves ultimately fledged more offspring.
   6. Such environmentally determined variation in offspring fitness is expected to influence optimal patterns of parental investment. We discuss the predictions that environmental variability should select for investment in adult survival and for reduced reproductive effort in poor years.

AB Long-term ecological research is particularly valuable for understanding disturbance dynamics overlong time periods and placing those dynamics in a regional context. We highlighted three case studies from Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network sites that have contributed to understanding the causes and consequences of disturbance in ecological systems. The LTER Network significantly enhances the ability to study disturbance by (a) encompassing ecosystems subject to a wide range of disturbances, (b) providing a long-term baseline against which to detect change and measure ecosystem responses to disturbance, (c) permitting observation of slow or infrequent events, (d) facilitating the use of multiple research approaches, (e) providing a focus for modeling disturbance dynamics, and (f) contributing to land and resource management. Long-term research is crucial to understanding past, present, and future disturbance dynamics, and the LTER Network is poised to make continuing contributions to the understanding of disturbance.

AB The recently developed Bayesian multinomial calibration model, Bummer, was applied to the fossil chironomid assemblages of a lake situated at the present tree-line in northern Fennoscandia to reconstruct patterns in Holocene climates. The results are compared with inferences derived using non-Bayesian weighted averaging partial least-squares regression. The reconstruction exhibits both long-term trends as well as a series of shorter-term oscillations. Abrupt climatic excursions were particularly characteristic for the early Holocene period, with cooling episodes around 9200, 8600 and 8200 cal yr BP. The interval from ca 8000 to 5800 cal yr BP appeared to be warm and stable, but was followed by a pronounced climatic cooling around 5800 cal yr BP leading to a relatively long-lasting mid-Holocene temperature minimum between ca 5800 and 4000 cal yr BP. The reconstruction during the latter part of the Holocene is relatively featureless, which may partly be due to gradual shallowing of the lake by sedimentation that may have affected chironomid compositions, thereby masking the climate signal. The major climatic patterns in our reconstruction agree well with inferences from Greenland ice and marine sediments and are also in line with the previous reconstructions based on diatoms and pollen from the same core, although the finer-scale variations reflected by the three proxies do not always match. The overall results provide evidence for climatic complexity during the Holocene epoch and demonstrate that Bayesian modelling is highly suitable for reconstruction purposes.

AB Rapidly expanding water resource development in arid and semi-arid zones of Australia threatens the flow regime and ecological integrity of the few large dryland rivers and their immense floodplains. Efforts to manage and conserve the surface waters of these rivers are hampered by limited scientific data on the ecology of their flora and fauna and on their responses to the high natural variability of flow regime that typifies dryland rivers. Irregular floods connect channel and floodplain wetlands to differing degrees and for varying periods of time but the ecological significance of this connectivity is poorly understood. On Cooper Creek, a large dryland river in central Australia. we explored the degree to which assemblage composition varied with connectivity and hydrological regime. Shortly after protracted regional flooding, we sampled aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages from the principal microhabitats in 12 channel and floodplain wetlands. Ephemeral and temporary lakes tended to have fewer taxa than semi-permanent channel or terminal lake habitats. Although hydrological connection had only recently been lost for some wetlands, there was already evidence of divergence in aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Disruption of the natural variability in connectivity and hydrological regime by excessive water abstraction or river-flow regulation threatens the ecological integrity and aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of dryland rivers. Preservation of the irregular flow regime and sporadic connectivity underpins conservation of the mosaic of floodplain wetlands that play such a crucial role in the ecosystem functioning of rivers such as Cooper Creek.

AB The population structure of black-browed (Thalassarche melanophris and T. impavida) and grey-headed (T. chrysostoma) albatrosses was examined using both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite analyses. mtDNA sequences from 73 black-browed and 50 grey-headed albatrosses were obtained from five island groups in the Southern Ocean. High levels of sequence divergence were found in both taxa (0.55-7.20% in black-browed albatrosses and 2.10-3.90% in grey-headed albatrosses). Black-browed albatrosses form three distinct groups: Falklands, Diego Ramirez/South Georgia/Kerguelen, and Campbell Island (T. impavida). T. melanophris from Campbell Island contain birds from each of the three groups, indicating high levels of mixture and hybridization. In contrast, grey-headed albatrosses form one globally panmictic population. Microsatellite analyses on a larger number of samples using seven highly variable markers found similar population structure to the mtDNA analyses in both black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses. Differences in population structure between these two very similar and closely related species could be the result of differences in foraging and dispersal patterns. Breeding black-browed albatrosses forage mainly over continental shelves and migrate to similar areas when not breeding. Grey-headed albatrosses forage mainly at frontal systems, travelling widely across oceanic habitats outside the breeding season. Genetic analyses support the current classification of T. impavida as being distinct from T. melanophris, but would also suggest splitting T. melanophris into two groups: Falkland Islands, and Diego Ramirez/South Georgia/Kerguelen.

AB Biological invasions are causing significant ecological impacts and economical costs world-wide. Human activities are the primary cause of this conservation and environmental problem. We conducted a stepwise regression analysis between several land-use and socio-economic parameters and the density of alien species in European and North African countries. We found that the parameters that best explained the density of alien plants were the Human Development Index and imports. The extent of terrestrial transport networks and the percentage of protected areas were the land-use variables that best accounted for the density of alien plants. If we are going to influence policies dealing with biological invasions, more emphasis should be placed on the analysis of land-use and socio-economic determinants at different spatial scales and their changes throughout time.

AB The results of a multiproxy study reconstructing the climate history of the last 9300 years in northern Sweden are presented. It is based on diatom, chironomid and pollen analyses, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), of a radiocarbon dated sediment core from Sjuodjijaure (67 degrees 22'N, 18 degrees 04'E), situated 100 m above tree-line in the Scandes mountains. Mean July air temperature was reconstructed using transfer functions established for the region. The biological proxies show significant changes in composition during the Holocene and the inferred temperatures all follow the same general trend. For the period between about 9300 to 7300 cal. BP the reconstructions should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of convincing modem analogues in the training set. However the reconstruction suggest that July temperature was on average about the same as today, with several rapid short-term cold and warm periods. Cold periods were dated to about 8500, 8200 and 7600 cal. years BP and a warm period to about 7700 cal. BP. About 7300 cal. BP, a major shift to a warmer climate occurred. Pine migrated into the area, which was previously covered with birch forest. From the mid-Holocene until today the sediment record suggests a descending tree-limit and a gradual lowering of July temperature.

AB Despite growing concern, no consensus has emerged over the effects of habitat modification on species diversity in tropical forests. Even for comparatively well-studied taxa such as Lepidoptera disturbance has been reported to increase and decrease diversity with approximately equal frequency species diversity within landscapes depends on the spatial scale at which communities are sampled, and the effects of disturbance in tropical forests have been studied at a wide range of spatial scales. Yet the question of how disturbance affects diversity at different spatial scales has not been addressed We reanalyzed data from previous studies to examine the relationship between spatial scale and effects of disturbance on tropical-forest Lepidoptera. Disturbance had opposite effects on diversity, at large and small scales: as scale decreased, the probability of a positive effect of disturbance on diversity increased We also explicitly examined the relationship between spatial scale and the diversity of butterflies in selectively logged and unlogged forest in Maluku Province, Indonesia. Species richness increased with spatial scale in both logged and unlogged forest, but at a significantly faster rate in unlogged forest, whereas species evenness increased with scale in unlogged forest but did not increase with scale in logged forest. These data indicate that the effects of habitat modification on species diversity are heavily scale-dependent. As a result, recorded effects of disturbance were strongly influenced by the spatial scale at which species assemblages were sampled. Future studies need to account for this by explicitly examining the effects of disturbance at a number of different spatial scales. A further problem arises because the relationship between scale and diversity is likely to differ among taxa in relation to mobility This may explain to some extent why the measured effects of disturbance have differed between relatively mobile and immobile taxa.

AB Terrestrial biological diversity is supported by solar energy captured by plants growing in soil. This soil-based plant productivity also provides the foundation for human societies through production of food and renewable forms of energy. Variations in plant productivity, resulting from differences in inherent soil fertility, variations in climate and weather, and differences in chemical inputs and agricultural practices, produce patterns of biological diversity that are associated with the agricultural component of economic productivity. Ecological processes lead to a generally negative relation between the diversity of plant species and potential agricultural productivity at both local and global scales. One implication of this negative relation is that preservation of areas of high plant biodiversity does not require the sacrifice of productive agricultural lands.

AB Samples (679) from various forest sites in the atlantic temperate region (lowlands in the northern half of France) have been studied. Their Collembolan species composition 145 species, with only 43 rare species) was analysed by Benzecri's correspondence analysis, a multivariate method. Five groups of species, each associated with a given habitat, were determined: above the ground surface a distinction is evident between light species (open sites), hygrophilic species (moist forest sites) and corticolous species (dry forest sites); edaphic species may be divided into acidophilic species (mor, moder and acid mull humus) and neutroacidocline species (earthworm mull). A depth gradient may be traced from edaphic to atmobiotic species in both forest and open sites. As a conclusion, it is apparent that vegetation in itself does not directly influence Collembola but may effect them indirectly through humus formation.

AB Small mammals were livetrapped during 12 months in crop fields and weedy borders at 18 sites in central Argentina.  A total of 1,652 mammals of 14 species was captured during 33,060 trap-nights.  Six species of rodents comprised > 95% of captures.  Periodically disturbed fields of crops were dominated by Calomys musculinus and C. laucha, and to a lesser extent Mus musculus.  A second group composed of Akodon azarae, Bolomys obscurus, and Oligoryzomys flavescens primarily inhabited the more stable, weedy borders of cultivated fields.  Peaks in relative densities of C. musculinus, C. laucha, and M. musculus were observed in summer and early autumn, and populations declined to low numbers in winter, following harvest.  In contrast, maxima for A. azarae, B. obscurus, and O. flavescens were in late autumn and early winter, and numbers never declined to low values seen for the other species.  These characteristic differences in habitat associations and relative densities of pampas rodents may reflect colonizing potential, as both Calomys and Mus potentially are highly opportunistic genera.

AB Alt'itudinal gradients strongly affect plant biodiversity, but the effects on microbial patterns remain unclear, especially in the large scale. We therefore designed an altitudinal gradient experiment that covered three climate zones to monitor soil microbial community dynamics and to compare those with plant and soil characteristics. Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and ITS gene was used to analyze soil microbial (bacterial and fungal) diversity and composition, and fumigation-extraction was used to determine microbial biomass; the plant community metrics (i.e., percent cover, Shannon-Wiener, grass biomass, and carbon/nitrogen in leaf and biomass) and soil properties (i.e., soil moisture, soil temperature, bulk density, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available nitrogen) were determined. The results showed that carbon/nitrogen in microbial biomass was higher at medium altitude and was positively related to carbon and nitrogen in both soil and grass biomass along the altitudinal gradients. Soil bacterial alpha diversity was significantly higher at medium altitude but fungal alpha diversity did not affected by altitudinal gradients; the effect of altitudinal gradients on bacterial beta diversity was larger than that on fungal beta diversity, although both groups were significantly affected by altitudinal gradients. Moreover, Alpha-proteobacteria, Beta-proteobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes were significantly more abundant in higher altitude than in lower altitude, both Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria significantly declined with increasing altitude; other bacterial taxa such as Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, Gamma-proteobacteria, and Delta-proteobacteria were significantly higher at medium altitudes. For fungal taxa, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were the dominant phyla and responded insignificantly to the altitudinal gradients. The responses of microbial alpha diversity were mostly associated with plant Shannon index, organic carbon, and total nitrogen, whereas microbial beta diversity and composition mainly depended on soil moisture and temperature. Overall, these results suggest that soil bacteria rather than fungi can reflect changes in plant and soil characteristics along altitudinal gradients. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change triggers poleward shifts in species distribution leading to changes in biogeography. In the marine environment, fish respond quickly to warming, causing community-wide reorganizations, which result in profound changes in ecosystem functioning. Functional biogeography provides a framework to address how ecosystem functioning may be affected by climate change over large spatial scales. However, there are few studies on functional biogeography in the marine environment, and none in the Arctic, where climate-driven changes are most rapid and extensive. We investigated the impact of climate warming on the functional biogeography of the Barents Sea, which is characterized by a sharp zoogeographic divide separating boreal from Arctic species. Our unique dataset covered 52 fish species, 15 functional traits, and 3,660 stations sampled during the recent warming period. We found that the functional traits characterizing Arctic fish communities, mainly composed of small-sized bottom-dwelling benthivores, are being rapidly replaced by traits of incoming boreal species, particularly the larger, longer lived, and more piscivorous species. The changes in functional traits detected in the Arctic can be predicted based on the characteristics of species expected to undergo quick poleward shifts in response to warming. These are the large, generalist, motile species, such as cod and haddock. We show how functional biogeography can provide important insights into the relationship between species composition, diversity, ecosystem functioning, and environmental drivers. This represents invaluable knowledge in a period when communities and ecosystems experience rapid climate-driven changes across biogeographical regions.

AB The existence of biogeographic patterns among most free-living microbial taxa has been well established, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms that shape these patterns. Here, we examined soil bacterial beta-diversity across different habitats in the drylands of northern China. We evaluated the relative importance of environmental factors versus geographic distance to a distance-decay relationship, which would be explained by the relative effect of basic ecological processes recognized as drivers of diversity patterns in macrobial theoretical models such as selection and dispersal. Although the similarity of bacterial communities significantly declined with increasing geographic distance, the distance-decay slope and the relative importance of factors driving distance-decay patterns varied across different habitats. A strong distance-decay relationship was observed in the alpine grassland, where the community similarity was influenced only by the environmental factors. In contrast, geographic distance was solely responsible for community similarity in the desert. Even the average compositional similarity among locations in the desert was distinctly lower compared with those in other habitats. We found no evidence that dispersal limitation strongly influenced the beta-diversity of bacterial communities in the desert grassland and typical grassland. Together, our results provide robust evidence of habitat specificity for microbial diversity patterns and their underlying drivers. Our findings suggest that microorganisms also have multiple drivers of diversity patterns and some of which may be parallel to some fundamental processes for explaining biodiversity patterns in macroorganisms.

LA English
DT Review
ID INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL EXPERIENCE; PLASTICITY; INFORMATION;
   FITNESS; AGE; EVOLUTION; STRESS; ADOLESCENCE; PERSONALITY
AB Development in many organisms appears to show evidence of sensitive windows-periods or stages in ontogeny in which individual experience has a particularly strong influence on the phenotype (compared to other periods or stages). Despite great interest in sensitive windows from both fundamental and applied perspectives, the functional (adaptive) reasons why they have evolved are unclear. Here we outline a conceptual framework for understanding when natural selection should favour changes in plasticity across development. Our approach builds on previous theory on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, which relates individual and population differences in plasticity to two factors: the degree of uncertainty about the environmental conditions and the extent to which experiences during development ('cues') provide information about those conditions. We argue that systematic variation in these two factors often occurs within the lifetime of a single individual, which will select for developmental changes in plasticity. Of central importance is how informational properties of the environment interact with the life history of the organism. Phenotypes may be more or less sensitive to environmental cues at different points in development because of systematic changes in (i) the frequency of cues, (ii) the informativeness of cues, (iii) the fitness benefits of information and/or (iv) the constraints on plasticity. In relatively stable environments, a sensible null expectation is that plasticity will gradually decline with age as the developing individual gathers information. We review recent models on the evolution of developmental changes in plasticity and explain how they fit into our conceptual framework. Our aim is to encourage an adaptive perspective on sensitive windows in development.

AB The Great Lakes of East Africa are collectively the earth's most remarkable and species-rich freshwater feature. Intrinsic biological factors and extrinsic ecological opportunities allowed much of the lakes' spectacular biological diversity to evolve through evolutionary (often adaptive) radiation and explosive speciation. Beyond evolutionary patterns and processes that led to this remarkable biodiversity and its astonishing morphological disparity, we highlight ecosystem functioning and complex biotic interactions such as co-evolution. Comparative biogeographic patterns for vertebrates and invertebrates are discussed, as are patterns of diversity and disparity through the late Cenozoic. We demonstrate that the African Great Lakes, because of excellent fossil archives, are a phenomenal setting to integrate micro-and macroevolution. Unfortunately, these amazing ecosystems are also subject to various anthropogenic stressors at global and regional scales, which have already impacted their stability and threaten part of their extraordinary biodiversity with extinction.

AB A methodological framework is proposed for participatory scenario development on the basis of evidence from the literature, and is tested and refined through the development of scenarios for the future of UK uplands. The paper uses a review of previous work to justify a framework based around the following steps: i) define context and establish whether there is a basis for stakeholder engagement in scenario development; ii) systematically identify and represent relevant stakeholders in the process; iii) define clear objectives for scenario development with stakeholders including spatial and temporal boundaries; iv) select relevant participatory methods for scenario development, during initial scenario construction, evaluation and to support decision-making based on scenarios; and v) integrate local and scientific knowledge throughout the process. The application of this framework in case study research suggests that participatory scenario development has the potential to: i) make scenarios more relevant to stakeholder needs and priorities; ii) extend the range of scenarios developed; iii) develop more detailed and precise scenarios through the integration of local and scientific knowledge; and iv) move beyond scenario development to facilitate adaptation to future change. It is argued that participatory scenario development can empower stakeholders and lead to more consistent and robust scenarios that can help people prepare more effectively for future change.

AB Terrestrial biosphere models typically abstract the immense diversity of vegetation forms and functioning into a relatively small set of predefined semi-empirical plant functional types (PFTs). There is growing evidence, however, from the field ecology community as well as from modelling studies that current PFT schemes may not adequately represent the observed variations in plant functional traits and their effect on ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we introduce the Jena Diversity-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (JeDi-DGVM) as a new approach to terrestrial biosphere modelling with a richer representation of functional diversity than traditional modelling approaches based on a small number of fixed PFTs.
   JeDi-DGVM simulates the performance of a large number of randomly generated plant growth strategies, each defined by a set of 15 trait parameters which characterize various aspects of plant functioning including carbon allocation, ecophysiology and phenology. Each trait parameter is involved in one or more functional trade-offs. These trade-offs ultimately determine whether a strategy is able to survive under the climatic conditions in a given model grid cell and its performance relative to the other strategies. The biogeochemical fluxes and land surface properties of the individual strategies are aggregated to the grid-cell scale using a mass-based weighting scheme.
   We evaluate the simulated global biogeochemical patterns against a variety of field and satellite-based observations following a protocol established by the Carbon-Land Model Intercomparison Project. The land surface fluxes and vegetation structural properties are reasonably well simulated by JeDi-DGVM, and compare favourably with other state-of-the-art global vegetation models. We also evaluate the simulated patterns of functional diversity and the sensitivity of the JeDi-DGVM modelling approach to the number of sampled strategies. Altogether, the results demonstrate the parsimonious and flexible nature of a functional trade-off approach to global vegetation modelling, i.e. it can provide more types of testable outputs than standard PFT-based approaches and with fewer inputs.
   The approach implemented here in JeDi-DGVM sets the foundation for future applications that will explore the impacts of explicitly resolving diverse plant communities, allowing for a more flexible temporal and spatial representation of the structure and function of the terrestrial biosphere.

AB Food webs in agricultural systems are complex and trophic linkages are difficult to track using conventional methodologies. Here, we review three alternative approaches that allow empirical assessment of feeding interactions: DNA-based techniques, and stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. DNA-based methods, namely multiplex PCR and next-generation sequencing, allow identification of food types and host-parasitoid linkages, resulting in taxonomically highly resolved feeding networks. Stable isotopes and fatty acids reflect the assimilation of broader categories of resources, as metabolised into the consumers' tissue, together with the associated energy and nutrient fluxes in the food web. We discuss the strengths of the approaches but also highlight their limitations, providing practical advice on which technique is best suited to answer specific questions in examining food web interactions in agroecosystems. Future refinements of these techniques, especially when used in combination, could herald a new era in agricultural food web ecology, enabling management and environmental impact to be placed in the mechanistic context of trophic networks.

AB 1. Across plant species, drought tolerance and distributions with respect to water availability are strongly correlated with two physiological traits, the leaf water potential at wilting, that is, turgor loss point (ptlp), and the cell solute potential at full hydration, that is, osmotic potential (po). We present methods to determine these parameters 30 times more rapidly than the standard pressurevolume (pv) curve approach, making feasible community-scale studies of plant drought tolerance. 2. We optimized existing methods for measurements of pi o using vapour-pressure osmometry of freeze-thawed leaf discs from 30 species growing in two precipitation regimes, and developed the first regression relationships to accurately estimate pressurevolume curve values of both pi o and pi tlp from osmometer values. 3. The pi o determined with the osmometer (pi osm) was an excellent predictor of the pi o determined from the pv curve (pi pv,r2 = 0.80). Although the correlation of pi osm and pi pv enabled prediction, the relationship departed from the 1 : 1 line. The discrepancy between the methods could be quantitatively accounted for by known sources of error in osmometer measurements, that is, dilution by the apoplastic water, and solute dissolution from destroyed cell walls. An even stronger prediction of pi pv could be made using pi osm, leaf density (rho), and their interaction (r2 = 0.85, all P < 2 x 10-10). 4. The pi osm could also be used to predict pi tlp (r2 = 0.86). Indeed, pi osm was a better predictor of pi tlp than leaf mass per unit area (LMA; r2 = 0.54), leaf thickness (T; r2 = 0.12), rho (r2 = 0.63), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC; r2 = 0.60), which have been previously proposed as drought tolerance indicators. Models combining posm with LMA, T, rho, or LDMC or other pv curve parameters (i.e. elasticity and apoplastic fraction) did not significantly improve prediction of pi tlp. 5. This osmometer method enables accurate measurements of drought tolerance traits across a wide range of leaf types and for plants with diverse habitat preferences, with a fraction of effort of previous methods. We expect it to have wide application for predicting species responses to climate variability and for assessing ecological and evolutionary variation in drought tolerance in natural populations and agricultural cultivars.

SO MARINE POLICY

DT Article
DE Ocean policy; Stakeholder collaboration; Marine spatial planning
AB From 2009 to 2011, marine spatial planning (MSP) rapidly gained visibility in the United States as a promising ocean management tool. A few small-scale planning efforts were completed in state waters, and the Obama Administration proposed a framework for large-scale regional MSP throughout the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. During that same time period, the authors engaged a variety of U.S ocean stakeholders in a series of dialogs with several goals: to share information about what MSP is or could be, to hear stakeholder views and concerns about MSP, and to foster better understanding between those who depend on ocean resources for their livelihood and ocean conservation advocates. The stakeholder meetings were supplemented with several rounds of in-depth interviews and a survey. Despite some predictable areas of conflict, project participants agreed on a number of issues related to stakeholder engagement in MSP: all felt strongly that government planners need to engage outsiders earlier, more often, more meaningfully, and through an open and transparent process. Equally important, the project affirmed the value of bringing unlike parties together at the earliest opportunity to learn, talk, and listen to others with whom they rarely engage.

AB Ectomycorrhizal fungi dominate the humus layers of boreal forests. They depend on carbohydrates that are translocated through roots, via fungal mycelium to microsites in the soil, wherein they forage for nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi are therefore sensitive to disruptive disturbances that may restrict their carbon supply. By disrupting root connections, we induced a sudden decline in mycorrhizal mycelial abundance and studied the consequent effects on growth and activity of free living, saprotrophic fungi and bacteria in pine forest humus, using molecular community analyses in combination with enzyme activity measurements. Ectomycorrhizal fungi had decreased in abundance 14 days after root severing, but the abundance of certain free-living ascomycetes was three times higher within 5 days of the disturbance compared with undisturbed controls. Root disruption also increased laccase production by an order of magnitude and cellulase production by a factor of 5. In contrast, bacterial populations seemed little affected. The results indicate that access to an external carbon source enables mycorrhizal fungi to monopolise the humus, but disturbances may induce rapid growth of opportunistic saprotrophic fungi that presumably use the dying mycorrhizal mycelium. Studies of such functional shifts in fungal communities, induced by disturbance, may shed light on mechanisms behind nutrient retention and release in boreal forests. The results also highlight the fundamental problems associated with methods that study microbial processes in soil samples that have been isolated from living roots.

AB P>1. Mechanisms that affect the spatial distribution of animals are typically scale-dependent and may involve forage distribution. Forage quality and quantity are often inversely correlated and a much discussed trade-off is whether or not to select for high-quality forage at the expense of forage abundance. This discussion has rarely involved scale-dependence or been applied to Northern browsing herbivores. At small spatial scales, browsers are assumed to select for the best quality forage. But, as high-quality forage resources are often scarce and may become depleted, coarse-scale habitat selection is assumed to be driven by forage availability.

To evaluate if moose selection for forage quantity and quality is scale-dependent we modelled summer and winter habitat selection of 32 GPS-marked female moose (Alces alces) at two spatial scales (landscape-scale vs. within-home range-scale). We used mixed-effects resource selection functions (RSFs) and landscape-scale forage availability models of six tree species of varying quality for moose. We considered silver birch (Betula pendula), downy birch (Betula pubescens.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) as low quality browse species and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), aspen (Populus tremula), willow (Salix spp.) as high-quality species.
   3. As expected, the overall selection patterns for available browse biomass and quality varied across spatiotemporal scales. At the landscape-scale, moose selected for habitat with high available browse biomass of low quality species while at the within-home range-scale moose selected for sites with the highest quality browse species available. Furthermore, selection patterns during summer remained fairly stable, while during winter, selection at the within-home range-scale switched from sites with high quality to sites with lower quality browse species which suggests depletion of high-quality species. Consistent with expectations from seasonal resource depletion, site fidelity (bimonthly home range overlap) was much lower in winter than in summer.
   4. Coarse-scale habitat selection by moose as a function of forage variability revealed a scale-dependent trade-off between available browse quantity and browse quality. Moreover, resource depletion changed the winter selection criteria of free-ranging moose and we demonstrate how the behavioural response to such a dynamic process can be inferred from RSFs.

AB We used a combination of field and laboratory approaches to address how the bioturbation activity of two crustaceans, the ghost shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis and the fiddler crab Uca crenulata, affects the microbial diversity in the seabed of a coastal lagoon (Catalina Harbor, Santa Catalina Island, CA, USA). Detailed geochemical analyses, including oxygen microsensor measurements, were performed to characterize environmental parameters. We used a whole-assemblage fingerprinting approach (ARISA: amplified ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) to compare bacterial diversity along geochemical gradients and in relation to subsurface microniches. The two crustaceans have different burrowing behaviors. The ghost shrimp maintains complex, deep-reaching burrows and permanently lives subterranean, supplying its burrow with oxygen- rich water. In contrast, the fiddler crab constructs simpler, J-shaped burrows, which it does not inhabit permanently and does not actively ventilate. Our goal was to address how varying environmental parameters affect benthic microbial communities. An important question in benthic microbial ecology has been whether burrows support similar or unique communities compared with the sediment surface. Our results showed that sediment surface microbial communities are distinct from subsurface assemblages and that different burrow types support diverse bacterial taxa. Statistical comparisons by canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the availability of oxidants (oxygen, nitrate, ferric iron) play a key role in determining the presence and abundance of different taxa. When geochemical parameters were alike, microbial communities associated with burrows showed significant similarity to sediment surface communities. Our study provides implications on the community structure of microbial communities in marine sediments and the factors controlling their distribution.

AB Invasive alien plants of natural ecosystems, commonly referred to as weeds, can reduce the abundance and diversity of native flora and fauna, and alter ecosystem processes. Using Australia's 20 'Weeds of National Significance' (WoNS), we investigated how natural ecosystems responded following their management. We reviewed the literature and surveyed land managers involved in WoNS management programs by distributing a questionnaire through various e-mail networks. While most of the 95 papers reviewed measured the effect of management on the target WoNS, only 18 assessed the response of other plant species. In these studies, native plant species did not necessarily recover following management and in many instances the managed WoNS was replaced by other weed species. Three other studies investigated the response of invertebrate communities and an ecosystem process following WoNS management but none examined the response of vertebrates or microbial communities. A total of 168 replies were received to the land manager survey. Of the 142 land managers who evaluated their WoNS management program, 86 monitored the response of native plant species and/or other weeds, mostly using qualitative assessments. These managers reported no vegetation response after management of the WoNS (7%) or re-colonisation by a combination of native and weed species (52%) or only by native plants (33%) or the targeted WoNS (2%). Our results emphasise the need to select sites for weed management that are less degraded and thus have a higher likelihood of natural recovery and/or to incorporate activities that facilitate recovery of native plant communities in conjunction with weed removal.

AB It has been suggested that alien species with close indigenous relatives in the introduced range may have reduced chances of successful establishment and invasion (Darwin's naturalization hypothesis). Studies trying to test this have in fact been addressing four different hypotheses, and the same data can support some while rejecting others. In this paper, we argue that the phylogenetic pattern will change depending on the spatial and phylogenetic scales considered. Expectations and observations from invasion biology and the study of natural communities are that at the spatial scale relevant to competitive interactions, closely related species will be spatially separated, whereas at the regional scale, species in the same genera or families will tend to co-occur more often than by chance. We also argue that patterns in the relatedness of indigenous and naturalized plants are dependent on the continental/island setting, spatial occupancy levels, and on the group of organisms under scrutiny. Understanding how these factors create a phylogenetic pattern in invasions will help us predict which groups are more likely to invade where, and should contribute to general ecological theory.

AB Quantification of the fate of carbon (C) used by plant metabolism is necessary to improve predictions of terrestrial ecosystem respiration and its sources.
   Here, a dual isotope (C-13 and C-14) pulse-label was used to determine the allocation of new C to different respiratory pathways in the early and late growing seasons for two plant functional types, perennial grasses and shrubs, in the Owens Valley, CA, USA.
   Allocation differences between plant types exceeded seasonal allocation variation. Grasses respired 71 and 64% and shrubs respired 22 and 17% of the label below-ground in the early and late growing seasons, respectively. Across seasons and plant types, similar to 48-61% of the label recovered was respired in 24 h, similar to 68-84% in 6 d, and similar to 16-33% in 6-36 d after labeling.
   Three C pools were identified for plant metabolism: a fast pool with mean residence times (MRTs) of similar to 0.5 and similar to 1 d below- and above-ground, respectively; an intermediate pool with MRTs of 19.9 and 18.9 d; and a storage pool detected in new leaf early growing season respiration > 9 months after assimilation. Differences in allocation to fast vs intermediate C pools resulted in the mean age of C respired by shrubs being shorter (3.8-4.5 d) than that of the grasses (4.8-8.2 d).

AB Aim To estimate the relative importance of climate and soil nutritional variables for predicting the distribution of Acer campestre (L.) in French forests.
   Location France.
   Methods We used presence/absence information for A. campestre in 3286 forest plots scattered all over France, coupled with climatic and edaphic data. More than 150 climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, evapotranspiration, water balance) were obtained using a digital elevation model (DEM) and a geographical information system (GIS). Six direct soil variables (pH, C/N ratio, base saturation rate, concentrations of calcium, magnesium and potassium) were available from EcoPlant, a phytoecological data base for French forests. Using a forward stepwise logistic regression technique, we derived two distinct predictive models for A. campestre; the first with climatic variables alone and the second with both climatic and edaphic variables.
   Results The distribution of A. campestre was poorly modelled when including only climatic variables. The inclusion of edaphic variables significantly improved the quality of predictions for this species, allowing prediction of patches of presence/absence within the study region.
   Main conclusion Soil nutritional variables may improve the performance of fine-scale (grain) plant species distribution models.

AB The aim here was to separately assess mycorrhizal fungal and plant responses under elevated atmospheric CO2, and to test a mycocentric model that assumes that increased carbon availability to the fungus will not automatically feed back to enhanced plant growth performance.
   Meta-analyses were applied across independent studies. Responses were compared in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and ECM and AM plants.
   Responses of both mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizal plants to elevated CO2 were significantly positive. The response ratio for ECM fungi was 1.34 (an increase of 34%) and for AM fungi 1.21 (21%), indicating a significantly different response. The response ratio for ECM plants was 1.26, similar to that of AM plants (1.25). Fractional colonization proved to be an unsuitable fungal parameter. Evidence was found for the mycocentric view in ECM, but not in AM systems.
   Fungal identity and plant identity were important parameters that affected response ratios. The need for better descriptors of fungal and plant responses is emphasized.

AB Theoretical work predicts that complex habitats allow more species to co-exist in a given area. However, more field studies are still needed to clarify this relationship, especially in intertidal habitats. Furthermore, the potential separate effects of surface complexity and area on species richness and abundance have rarely been addressed. We tested the hypotheses that a more complex substratum or larger surface area will support a greater number of individuals and species of mobile macrofauna on three rocky shores in Hong Kong. Surface complexity, assessed by using fractals, was an important factor in species-area relationships. The number of species increased proportionally to habitat complexity and this relationship was homogeneous among different shores. Total abundance of animals, however, was more dependent on the available surface area. The slope of the size-frequency distribution of animals in samples taken on surfaces with different fractal dimensions (D) was significantly steeper with an increase in fractal dimension, showing that the relative abundance of small animals increased with surface complexity. Thus, surface complexity and area may be important in determining different aspects of the macrofaunal community structure on rocky shores. The resulting increase in surface area on more rough surfaces may introduce bias in density and species number assessments when two-dimensional sampling units (i.e., quadrats) are employed. It is necessary, therefore, to account for the surface complexity in the design and interpretation of the results of benthic studies. Using D as an index of surface complexity is very useful, but also involves some practical problems, e.g., surfaces may be anisotropic and different methods may give different estimates of D. Therefore, these different methods need to be calibrated before comparisons of D values between them are meaningful. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BACTERIAL-VIRUSES; ABUNDANCE
AB Background: Phages, viruses that infect prokaryotes, are the most abundant microbes in the world. A major limitation to studying these viruses is the difficulty of cultivating the appropriate prokaryotic hosts. One way around this limitation is to directly clone and sequence shotgun libraries of uncultured viral communities ( i. e., metagenomic analyses). PHACCS http:// phage.sdsu.edu/phaccs, Phage Communities from Contig Spectrum, is an online bioinformatic tool to assess the biodiversity of uncultured viral communities. PHACCS uses the contig spectrum from shotgun DNA sequence assemblies to mathematically model the structure of viral communities and make predictions about diversity.
   Results: PHACCS builds models of possible community structure using a modified Lander-Waterman algorithm to predict the underlying contig spectrum. PHACCS finds the most appropriate structure model by optimizing the model parameters until the predicted contig spectrum is as close as possible to the experimental one. This model is the basis for making estimates of uncultured viral community richness, evenness, diversity index and abundance of the most abundant genotype.
   Conclusion: PHACCS analysis of four different environmental phage communities suggests that the power law is an important rank-abundance form to describe uncultured viral community structure. The estimates support the fact that the four phage communities were extremely diverse and that phage community biodiversity and structure may be correlated with that of their hosts.

AB We evaluated leaf characteristics and herbivory intensities for saplings of fifteen tropical tree species differing in their successional position. Eight leaf traits were selected, related to the costs of leaf display (specific leaf area [SLA], water content), photosynthesis (N and P concentration per unit mass), and herbivory defence (lignin concentration, C:N ratio). We hypothesised that species traits are shaped by variation in abiotic and biotic (herbivory) selection pressures along the successional gradient. All leaf traits varied with the successional position of the species. The SLA, water content and nutrient concentration decreased, and lignin concentration increased with the successional position. Herbivory damage (defined as the percentage of damage found at one moment in time) varied from 0.9-8.5% among the species, but was not related to their successional position. Herbivory damage appeared to be a poor estimator of the herbivory rate experienced by species, due to the confounding effect of leaf lifespan. Herbivory rate (defined as percentage leaf area removal per unit time) declined with the successional position of the species. Herbivory rate was only positively correlated to water content, and negatively correlated to lignin concentration, suggesting that herbivores select leaves based upon their digestibility rather than upon their nutritive value. Surprisingly, most species traits change linearly with succession, while resource availability (light, nutrients) declines exponentially with succession.

AB Many recent studies suggest that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. Community characteristics that most strongly influence invasion are uncertain, however, due to covariation of diversity with competition and crowding. We examined separately the effects of species richness and dominance on invasion by an exotic legume, Melilotus officinalis, in intact, native Kansas grassland. We manipulated dominance of C-4 grasses by reducing their abundance (i.e. ramet densities) by similar to25 and 50%. In addition, richness was reduced by removing species that were mainly rare and uncommon as might be expected with environmental changes such as drought and fragmentation. In both years of the study (2001-2002), invasibility, measured as peak establishment of Melilotus, was not affected by a 3-fold reduction in species richness, nor was there an interaction between loss of species and reduced dominance on invasion. In contrast, reductions in abundance of the dominants significantly reduced invasibility of the grassland plots in both years. Because the abundance of dominants was highly correlated with measures of competition (i.e. ratio of dominant biomass to total biomass) and crowding (total stem densities), this pattern was opposite to that expected if competition were indeed limiting invasion. Rather, invasion appeared to be facilitated by the dominant species, most likely because reduced dominance increased environmental stress. Our results suggest that dominance is the key community characteristic determining invasibility, because highly competitive and space-filling species can either enhance or reduce susceptibility to invasion depending on whether dominants create a more competitive environment or alleviate stressful conditions.

AB For a new diploid or homoploid hybrid species to become established, it must diverge ecologically from parental genotypes. Otherwise the hybrid neospecies will be overcome by gene flow or competition. We initiated a series of experiments designed to understand how the homoploid hybrid species, Helianthus paradoxus , was able to colonize salt marsh habitats, when both of its parental species (H. annuus xH. petiolaris) are salt sensitive. Here, we report on the results of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of mineral ion uptake traits and survivorship in 172 BC2 hybrids between H. annuus and H. petiolaris that were planted in H. paradoxus salt marsh habitat in New Mexico. A total of 14 QTLs were detected for mineral ion uptake traits and three for survivorship. Several mineral ion QTLs mapped to the same position as the survivorship QTLs, confirming previous studies, which indicated that salt tolerance in Helianthus is achieved through increased Ca uptake, coupled with greater exclusion of Na and related mineral ions. Of greater general significance was the observation that QTLs with effects in opposing directions were found for survivorship and for all mineral ion uptake traits with more than one detected QTL. This genetic architecture provides an ideal substrate for rapid ecological divergence in hybrid neospecies and offers a simple explanation for the colonization of salt marsh habitats by H. paradoxus. Finally, selection coefficients of +0.126, -0.084 and -0.094 for the three survivorship QTLs, respectively, are sufficiently large to account for establishment of new, homoploid hybrid species.

AB We investigated the relationship between soil pH/calcium content and species richness of vascular plants in seven broadly defined Central European vegetation types, using Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction and a phytosociological data set of 11,041 vegetation sample plots from the Czech Republic. The vegetation types included (A) broad-leaved deciduous forests, (B) meadows, (C) dry grasslands, (D) reed-bed and tall-sedge vegetation, (E) fens and transitional mires, (F) perennial synanthropic vegetation and (G) annual synanthropic vegetation. Relationships between local species richness (alpha diversity) and pH/calcium were positive for vegetation types A and C, negative for D and G, unimodal for E, and insignificant for B and F. Ellenberg soil reaction values explained 37% of variation in local species richness for vegetation type E, 24% for A, 13% for D, but only less than 4% for the others. Species pool size, i.e., the number of species that can potentially occur in a given habitat, was calculated for each plot using Beals index of sociological favourability applied to a large phytosociological database. For most vegetation types, the relationships between species pool size and pH/calcium were similar to the relationships between local species richness and pH/calcium, with the exception of meadows (weak unimodal) and perennial synanthropic vegetation (weak negative).
   These patterns suggest that for those types of Central European vegetation that developed independently of human influence in the Pleistocene or early Holocene (dry grasslands, deciduous forests), there are larger pools of calcicole than calcifuge species. This pattern is also found at the level of local species richness, where it is, however, less clearly pronounced, possibly due to the predominance of a few widespread and generalist calcifuges in acidic habitats. The unimodal pattern found in mires may result from similar underlying mechanisms, but in high pH environments mineral-rich spring waters probably decrease species richness by having toxic effects on plant growth. By contrast, vegetation types developed under direct human influence (meadows, synathropic vegetation) show weak negative or no relationships of local species richness or species pool to pH/calcium gradient. These results support the hypothesis of PARTEL (Ecology 83: 2361-2366, 2002) and EWALD (Folia Geobot. 38: 357-366, 2003), that the modem calcicole/calcifuge disparity in the species pool of Central European flora has resulted from historical and evolutionary processes that took place on high pH soils. In the Pleistocene, calcareous soils dominated both the dry continental landscapes of Central Europe and glacial refugia of temperate flora, which were mostly situated in southern European mountain ranges with abundant limestone and dolomite. The negative pattern of species richness along the pH/calcium gradient found in reed-bed and tall-sedge vegetation, however, is not consistent with this historical explanation.

AB For unicellular organisms, a lack of effects of local species richness on ecosystem function has been proposed due to their locally high species richness and their ubiquitous distribution. High dispersal ability and high individual numbers may enable unicellular taxa to occur everywhere. Using our own and published data sets on uni- and multicellular organisms, we conducted thorough statistical analyses to test whether (1) unicellular taxa show higher relative local species richness compared to multicellular taxa, (2) unicellular taxa show lower slopes of the species:area relationships and species:individuals relationships, and (3) the species composition of unicellular taxa is less influenced by geographic distance compared to multicellular taxa. We found higher local species richness compared to the global species pool for unicellular organisms than for metazoan taxa. The difference was significant if global species richness was conservatively estimated but not if extrapolated, and therefore higher richness estimates were used. Both microalgae and protozoans showed lower slopes between species richness and sample size (area or individuals) compared to macrozoobenthos, also indicating higher local species richness for unicellular taxa. The similarity of species composition of both benthic diatoms and ciliates decreased with increasing geographic distance. This indicated restricted dispersal ability of protists and the absence of ubiquity. However, a steeper slope between similarity and distance was found for polychaetes and corals, suggesting a stronger effect of distance on the dispersal of metazoans compared to unicellular taxa. Ln conclusion, we found partly different species richness patterns among uni- and multicellular eukaryotes, but no strict ubiquity of unicellular taxa. Therefore, the effect of local unicellular species richness on ecosystem function has to be reanalyzed. Macroecological patterns suggested for multicellular organisms may differ in unicellular communities.

AB We develop a simple, analytical model for canopy resistance to canopy-atmosphere gas exchange that is well suited for incorporation into regional-scale land-surface parameterizations. This model exploits the conservative nature of canopy light-use efficiency (LUE) in carbon assimilation that is observed within broad categories of plant species. The model paradigm assumes that under standard environmental conditions, a canopy will operate at the field-measured LUE, but will deviate from this standard efficiency as conditions change. Effective LUE estimates generated by the model respond to variations in atmospheric humidity, CO2 concentration, the composition of solar irradiation (direct versus diffuse beam fractions), and soil moisture content. This modeling approach differs from scaled-leaf parameterizations in that a single estimate of nominal canopy LUE replaces both a detailed mechanistic description of leaf-level photosynthetic processes and the scaling of these processes from the leaf to canopy level. This results in a model that can be evaluated analytically, and is thus computationally efficient and requires few species-specific parameters. Both qualities lend themselves well to regional-and global-scale modeling efforts. For purposes of testing, this canopy resistance submodel has been embedded in the Atmosphere-Land Exchange (ALEX) surface energy balance model. The integrated model generates transpiration and carbon assimilation fluxes that compare well with estimates from iterative mechanistic photosynthetic models, and with Aux measurements made in stands of corn, soybean, prairie grasses, desert shrubs, rangeland, and black spruce. Comparisons between modeled and measured evapotranspiration (LE) and carbon assimilation (A(c)) fluxes yield mean-absolute-percent-differences of 24% (LE) and 33% (A(c)) for hourly daytime fluxes, and 12% (LE) and 18% (A(c)) for daily-integrated fluxes. These comparisons demonstrate robustness over a variety of vegetative and climatic regimes, suggesting that this simple analytical model of canopy resistance will be useful in regional-scale flux evaluations.

AB A migratory divide is a narrow region in which two populations showing different migratory directions meet and presumably also mate and hybridize. Banding of willow warblers, Phylloscopus trochilus, in Europe has demonstrated a migratory divide latitudinally across central Scandinavia. In autumn, southern birds migrate southwest to tropical West Africa, whereas northern birds migrate southeast to East and South Africa. The migratory divide is associated with concordant differences in size and plumage coloration. Based on morphology, we estimate the width of the transition zone between northern and southern willow warblers to be less than 350 km. We found indication of linkage disequilibria around the migratory divide, in that measures of body size were correlated with plumage coloration within the contact zone, but uncorrelated within the populations south or north of the contact zone. The presence of linkage disequilibria and the fact that several morphological dines occur together suggest that the hybrid zone is a result of secondary contact between populations that have differentiated in allopatry. This interpretation is in accord with the knowledge of the recolonization pattern of the Scandinavian peninsula after the last glaciation; animals and plants appeared to have colonized either from the south or from the north around the northern bay of the Baltic Sea. If northern and southern willow warblers resided in allopatric populations during late Pleistocene glaciations and the hybrid zone is a result of postglacial range expansions, we would expect some degree of genetic differentiation accumulated during the period in isolation. In contrast, northern and southern willow warblers are near panmictic in the frequencies of alleles of mitochondrial DNA and at two microsatellite loci. The observed pattern, clear morphological and behavioral differentiation without genetic differentiation at neutral loci, suggests either that the differences are maintained by strong selection on the expressed genes in combination with high levels of current gene flow or, in the case of weak gene flow, that the divergence in morphology and behavior is very recent.

AB We examine the population to population variability of intrinsic rate of natural increase, r(m), of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. The intrinsic rate of increase is positively related to temperature, contrary to the expectation that r(m) might increase as the high and low temperature limits of habitability for cod are approached. For the parameter regime considered, r(m) has a simple dependence on age-at-maturity and the number of replacements each spawner can produce at low population densities <(alpha)over bar>. It is shown that <(alpha)over bar> has no significant temperature dependence, and, thus the covariation of r(m) and temperature arises from the influence of temperature on age-at-maturity, We demonstrate that our estimates of r(m) are robust and thus may be of use in estimating the recovery time of depleted populations.

AB Clearcutting and shelterwood cutting of mature Norway spruce peatland forests were compared regarding the effects on the forest flora. Repeated observations of the field and bottom layer vegetation were made before and until 7 or 8 years after harvesting at four sites located along a gradient from southern to northern Sweden. Clearcutting resulted in a greater change of species composition compared with shelterwood cutting. Diversity, measured as Simpson's index, and species number per subplot were lower in the clearcut than in the shelterwood after 7 or 8 years. By applying Ellenberg's indicator values, it was concluded that shelterwood regimes may preserve species preferring shaded and moist conditions, whereas those species decreased after clearcutting. Species preferring high levels of nitrogen increased in the clearcut.
   According to both multivariate and univariate analyses, the vegetation changed in a similar direction at all sites, although the level of response differed considerably. Despite these similarities, there was a marked site effect, which was not surprising considering the large geographic variation between sites.
   It is concluded that shelterwood cutting might be a better alternative than clearcutting for forests on fertile peatland sites, with respect to conservation of vascular plants and bryophytes.

ID SEDIMENT RECORD; LAKES; RECONSTRUCTION
AB Surface-sediment samples for diatom analyses, along with water chemistry and other limnological data, were collected from 113 fresh and saline lakes on the southern Interior Plateau and in the southern Rocky Mountain Trench of British Columbia, and combined with an existing calibration data set of 102 lakes from the southern interior of British Columbia and 11 saline lakes from the northern Great Plains. Diatom-based salinity inference models (= transfer functions) were developed using weighted-averaging and weighted-averaging with tolerance downweighting regression and calibration. The effects of species deletions and data-set size on the predictive ability (root mean square error of prediction after bootstrapping (RMSE(boot))) of the models were evaluated by developing models using different species deletion criteria and by varying the number of lakes in the data set. The study emphasizes the value of training sets with a large number of lakes and of taxa to develop transfer functions with robust and reliable estimates of species optima and tolerances and to provide more and closer modem analogues for inferring salinity from diatom assemblages downcore. The new salinity transfer function generated from this larger data set (RMSE(boot) = 0.37, r(2) = 0.87) is an improvement over an earlier model developed from this region.

AB Woodpecker species as a group require several properties (dead wood, old deciduous and large trees) that are characteristic of natural forest, the presence of which are not compatible with intensive forest management. The occurrence of many woodpecker species may thus indicate a high degree naturalness of forests. Using woodpeckers as indicators requires that we understand how these species were distributed in naturally dynamic landscapes, as well as quantitative knowledge of their requirements. We review the basic biology of boreal/hemiboreal woodpeckers and compare the degree of specialization of the different woodpecker species with their population trends and with changes in habitat distribution in the boreal/hemiboreal landscape over the last century. The comparison shows that there is a close connection between the degree of specialization of woodpeckers, the changes in forests and recent population trends. Thus woodpecker species as a group are in conflict with intensive forest management. To keep viable populations of all woodpecker species in a landscape existing values must be preserved and natural features be built into future forests. Future research should include studies of distribution, abundance, habitat niche breadth and fitness of different woodpecker species in landscapes with different degrees of naturalness.

ID CONIFEROUS TAIGA; WOOD ANTS; COMMUNITIES; FINLAND
AB We assessed the colonisation of clearcut forests by ants by using pitfall-trap data collected from clearcut areas of different age in southern Finland.  We compared mature forests (age over 120 yr) with areas cleared 0, 2 and 10 yr before trapping.  We concluded that the old-forest wood-ant systems are destroyed by clear-cutting, and that this is probably based on the loss of food resources.  In the colonisation stage the role of stochasticity is counter-balanced by a number of deterministic species-specific factors in the succession of ant assemblages.  In the colonisation process pioneering species are capable of founding colonies independently by single queens, and they are followed by species known to found colonies by temporary parasitism.  In later successional stages new colonies are established mainly by fission.  In the succession, species richness was highest in the ten year-old clearcuts.  Later, species richness decreased, probably because of increased shade of the canopy cover.  The ant species we studied did not show clear seasonal segregation, probably because of the shortness of the northern summer.  Ecologically similar species pairs tended to show exclusive spatial distributions that may reflect interspecific competition.

AB The discriminating capacity (i.e. ability to correctly classify presences and absences) of species distribution models (SDMs) is commonly evaluated with metrics such as the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC), the Kappa statistic and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC and Kappa have been repeatedly criticized, but TSS has fared relatively well since its introduction, mainly because it has been considered as independent of prevalence. In addition, discrimination metrics have been contested because they should be calculated on presence-absence data, but are often used on presence-only or presence-background data. Here, we investigate TSS and an alternative set of metricssimilarity indices, also known as F-measures. We first show that even in ideal conditions (i.e. perfectly random presence-absence sampling), TSS can be misleading because of its dependence on prevalence, whereas similarity/F-measures provide adequate estimations of model discrimination capacity. Second, we show that in real-world situations where sample prevalence is different from true species prevalence (i.e. biased sampling or presence-pseudoabsence), no discrimination capacity metric provides adequate estimation of model discrimination capacity, including metrics specifically designed for modelling with presence-pseudoabsence data. Our conclusions are twofold. First, they unequivocally impel SDM users to understand the potential shortcomings of discrimination metrics when quality presence-absence data are lacking, and we recommend obtaining such data. Second, in the specific case of virtual species, which are increasingly used to develop and test SDM methodologies, we strongly recommend the use of similarity/F-measures, which were not biased by prevalence, contrary to TSS.

AB Aim: Tropical forests account for a quarter of the global carbon storage and a third of the terrestrial productivity. Few studies have teased apart the relative importance of environmental factors and forest attributes for ecosystem functioning, especially for the tropics. This study aims to relate aboveground biomass (AGB) and biomass dynamics (i.e., net biomass productivity and its underlying demographic drivers: biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) to forest attributes (tree diversity, community-mean traits and stand basal area) and environmental conditions (water availability, soil fertility and disturbance).
   Location: Neotropics.
   Methods: We used data from 26 sites, 201 1-ha plots and >92,000 trees distributed across the Neotropics. We quantified for each site water availability and soil total exchangeable bases and for each plot three key community-weighted mean functional traits that are important for biomass stocks and productivity. We used structural equation models to test the hypothesis that all drivers have independent, positive effects on biomass stocks and dynamics.
   Results: Of the relationships analysed, vegetation attributes were more frequently associated significantly with biomass stocks and dynamics than environmental conditions (in 67 vs. 33% of the relationships). High climatic water availability increased biomass growth and stocks, light disturbance increased biomass growth, and soil bases had no effect. Rarefied tree species richness had consistent positive relationships with biomass stocks and dynamics, probably because of niche complementarity, but was not related to net biomass productivity. Community-mean traits were good predictors of biomass stocks and dynamics.
   Main conclusions: Water availability has a strong positive effect on biomass stocks and growth, and a future predicted increase in (atmospheric) drought might, therefore, potentially reduce carbon storage. Forest attributes, including species diversity and community-weighted mean traits, have independent and important relationships with AGB stocks, dynamics and ecosystem functioning, not only in relatively simple temperate systems, but also in structurally complex hyper-diverse tropical forests.

AB Shade, in ecological sense, is not merely a lack of light, but a multi-faceted phenomenon that creates new and complex settings for community and ecosystem dynamics. Tolerating shade therefore affects plants' ability to cope with other stressors, and also shape its interactions with surrounding organisms. The aim of this broad review was to map our current knowledge about how shade affects plants, plant communities and ecosystems - to gather together knowledge of what we know, but also to point out what we do not yet know. This review covers the following topics: the nature of shade, and ecological and physiological complexities related to growing under a canopy; plants' capability of tolerating other stress factors while living under a shade - resource trade-offs and polytolerance of abiotic stress; ontogenetic effects of shade tolerance; coexistence patterns under the canopy - how shade determines the forest structure and diversity; shade-induced abiotic dynamics in understorey vegetation, including changing patterns of irradiance, temperature and humidity under the canopy; shade-driven plant-plant and plant-animal interactions - how shade mediates facilitation and stress, and how it creates differentiated environment for different herbivores and pollinators, including the role of volatile organic compounds. We also discuss the ways how vegetation in understorey environments will be affected by climate change, as shade might play a significant role in mitigating negative effects of climate change. Our review shows that living under a shade affects biotic and abiotic stress tolerance of plants, it also influences the outcomes of both symbiotic and competitive plant-plant and plant-animal interactions in a complex and dynamic manner. The current knowledge of shade-related mechanisms is rather ample, however there is much room for progress in integrating different implications of the multifaceted nature of shade into consistent and integral understanding how communities and ecosystems function.

AB 1. In 2003, 24 presence-absence beta-diversity metrics were reviewed and a number of trade-offs and redundancies identified. We present a parallel investigation into the performance of abundance-based metrics of b-diversity.
   2. beta-diversity is a multi-faceted concept, central to spatial ecology. There are multiple metrics available to quantify it: the choice of metric is an important decision.
   3. We test 16 conceptual properties and two sampling properties of a beta-diversity metric: metrics should be 1) independent of alpha-diversity and 2) cumulative along a gradient of species turnover. Similarity should be 3) probabilistic when assemblages are independently and identically distributed. Metrics should have 4) a minimum of zero and increase monotonically with the degree of 5) species turnover, 6) decoupling of species ranks and 7) evenness differences. However, complete species turnover should always generate greater values of beta than extreme 8) rank shifts or 9) evenness differences. Metrics should 10) have a fixed upper limit, 11) symmetry (beta(A,B) = beta(B,A)), 12) double-zero asymmetry for double absences and double presences and 13) not decrease in a series of nested assemblages. Additionally, metrics should be independent of 14) species replication 15) the units of abundance and 16) differences in total abundance between sampling units. When samples are used to infer beta-diversity, metrics should be 1) independent of sample sizes and 2) independent of unequal sample sizes. We test 29 metrics for these properties and five 'personality' properties.
   4. Thirteen metrics were outperformed or equalled across all conceptual and sampling properties. Differences in sensitivity to species' abundance lead to a performance trade-off between sample size bias and the ability to detect turnover among rare species. In general, abundance-based metrics are substantially less biased in the face of undersampling, although the presence-absence metric, beta(sim), performed well overall. Only beta(Baselga) (R turn), beta(Baselga) (B-C) (turn) and beta(sim) measured purely species turnover and were independent of nestedness. Among the other metrics, sensitivity to nestedness varied > 4-fold.
   5. Our results indicate large amounts of redundancy among existing beta-diversity metrics, whilst the estimation of unseen shared and unshared species is lacking and should be addressed in the design of new abundance-based metrics.

AB We present a comprehensive analysis of the changes in the structure and functioning of the soil microbial communities, as well as their driving factors along the northern slope of Changbai Mountain by analyzing soil phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiles and enzymatic activities. The four vertical zones of vegetation selected in this study were as follows: (1) mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCB) located below 1100 m (site A and B); (2) dark-coniferous spruce-fir forest (DCF) located between 1100-1700 m (site C); (3) Ermans birch forest (EB) located between 1700 and 2000 m (site D); and (4) alpine tundra (AT) located above 2000 m (sites E and F). The results showed that the total viable microbial PLFAs varied with altitude, with the highest value detected in the EB (site D) (76.8 nmol g (1)). The fungal/bacterial (F/B) and the Gram positive/Gram negative (G(+)/G) ratios increased with elevation. The lower values of F/B obtained in the MCB (site A) and in DCF (site C) for G(+)/G. The soil microbial community structure observed in the MCB (sites A and B) was different from that observed in the other four sites, with lower fungal biomass. The soil microbial activities such as beta-glucosidase (beta G), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), acid phosphatase (AP) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) in the MCB (sites A and B) were significantly higher than those documented in the other four sites. The substantial differences in the soil microbial community composition were significantly correlated with the mean annual temperature (MAT), the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and soil temperature, silt and clay fraction, total phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen. However, the variations in soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with soil nutrients. The MAP and nitrate nitrogen were the significant predictors of the variance in the soil microbial community and enzyme activity, respectively. The soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rate showed a significant positive relationship with the total microbial, bacterial, actinomycetes PLFAs and the soil enzyme activities. Our results suggest that studies incorporating the microbial community structure and soil enzyme activity with the SOM decomposition may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of biogeochemical processes.

AB Sperm experience intense and varied selection that dramatically impacts the evolution of sperm quality. Selection acts to ensure that sperm are fertilization-competent and able to overcome the many challenges experienced on their way towards eggs. However, simply being able to fertilize an egg is not enough to ensure male fertility in most species. Owing to the prevalence of female multiple mating throughout the animal kingdom, successful fertilization requires sperm to outcompete rival sperm. In addition, females can actively influence sperm quality, storage or utilization to influence male fertility. This review provides an overview of how these selective forces influence the evolution of sperm quality. After exploring the link between sperm traits and male fertility, we examine how post-mating competition between rival ejaculates influences the evolution of sperm quality. We then describe how complex genetic, social and sexual interactions influence sperm quality, focusing on the importance of seminal fluid and interactions between sperm and the female's reproductive tract. In light of the complexities of selection on sperm traits, greater use of multivariate approaches that incorporate male-male, sperm-sperm and sperm-female interactions to study sperm quality will enhance our understanding of how selection acts on sperm traits and factors influencing male fertility. Because the metric of male reproductive success-fertilization-is the same across the animal kingdom, we argue that information about sperm evolution gained from non-human animals has enormous potential to further our understanding of the factors that impact human fertility.

AB The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the state of knowledge of the geographical distribution of all infectious diseases of clinical significance to humans. A systematic review was conducted to enumerate cartographic progress, with respect to the data available for mapping and the methods currently applied. The results helped define the minimum information requirements for mapping infectious disease occurrence, and a quantitative framework for assessing the mapping opportunities for all infectious diseases. This revealed that of 355 infectious diseases identified, 174 (49%) have a strong rationale for mapping and of these only 7 (4%) had been comprehensively mapped. A variety of ambitions, such as the quantification of the global burden of infectious disease, international biosurveillance, assessing the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks and exploring the propensity for infectious disease evolution and emergence, are limited by these omissions. An overview of the factors hindering progress in disease cartography is provided. It is argued that rapid improvement in the landscape of infectious diseases mapping can be made by embracing non-conventional data sources, automation of geo-positioning and mapping procedures enabled by machine learning and information technology, respectively, in addition to harnessing labour of the volunteer 'cognitive surplus' through crowdsourcing.

AB Soil pH can be affected by land use change and acid deposition and is one of the primary regulators of nutrient cycling in the soil. In this study, two soils from adjacent forest and grassland sites in central Alberta were subjected to different pH treatments to evaluate the short-term effects of pH on soil gross N transformations using the N-15 tracing technique and calculated by the numerical model FLUAZ. For the forest soil, gross NH4+ immobilization increased faster than gross N mineralization rates with increasing soil pH, leading to a declining pattern in net N mineralization rates; however, none of those rates changed with pH in the grassland soil. In contrast, the increase in pH significantly stimulated gross and net nitrification rates while soil acidification decreased gross and net nitrification rates for both the forest and grassland soils. The ratio of gross nitrification to gross NH4+ immobilization rates (N/IA) was significantly increased by KOH addition but declined to nearly zero by HCl addition for each soil. The low and high KCI addition treatments partially or completely inhibited gross nitrification rates, respectively, but gross mineralization was less sensitive to salt additions than the nitrification process. We conclude that based on the short-term laboratory incubation experiments both pH and salt (osmotic effect) affected gross N transformations and pH had contrasting effects on gross and net nitrogen mineralization but not on nitrification in the adjacent forest and grassland soils.

AB Human activities have reorganized the earth's biota resulting in spatially disparate locales becoming more or less similar in species composition over time through the processes of biotic homogenization and biotic differentiation, respectively. Despite mounting evidence suggesting that this process may be widespread in both aquatic and terrestrial systems, past studies have predominantly focused on single taxonomic groups at a single spatial scale. Furthermore, change in pairwise similarity is itself dependent on two distinct processes, spatial turnover in species composition and changes in gradients of species richness. Most past research has failed to disentangle the effect of these two mechanisms on homogenization patterns. Here, we use recent statistical advances and collate a global database of homogenization studies (20 studies, 50 datasets) to provide the first global investigation of the homogenization process across major faunal and floral groups and elucidate the relative role of changes in species richness and turnover. We found evidence of homogenization (change in similarity ranging from -0.02 to 0.09) across nearly all taxonomic groups, spatial extent and grain sizes. Partitioning of change in pairwise similarity shows that overall change in community similarity is driven by changes in species richness. Our results show that biotic homogenization is truly a global phenomenon and put into question many of the ecological mechanisms invoked in previous studies to explain patterns of homogenization.

AB Increasing accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere has led to calls for terrestrial mechanisms for CO2 abatement and given that soils represent the largest terrestrial body of C on Earth, there is a great deal of interest in soils as a sink for atmospheric C. This emphasis on sequestration in boreal forest soils is understandable given the sheer mass of this C reservoir (similar to 1700 Pg of C) but diverts our attention from the importance of soil C in soil physical, chemical and biotic functions, and importantly, it ignores the possibility that soils may also represent a source of C. In this review, we address these issues through a discussion of the size and character of boreal forest soil C pool, its role in ecosystem function, the potential impacts of climate change on soil C, efforts to model these processes and the role of soil C in boreal resilience to the impacts of climate change. Soil C is fundamental to ecosystem function in terms of improving soil physical properties, increasing soil biotic activity and enhancing insulation all of which improve site productivity. Managing upland soils for C sequesteration will achieve little in terms of offsetting fossil fuel emissions but would likely improve soil quality. Most of the C stored in the boreal biome is found in permafrost and wetland soils and events related to climatic change could shift these soils from C sink to C source. Melting of permafrost soils with predicted warming trends within the circumpolar region could result in the release of 30-60 Pg C by the year 2040. Such predictions, however, are limited by uncertainty in both climatic changes and soil response to these changes. Prediction of shifts in soil C dynamics with climate change relies on our ability to link C transformations to N dynamics and climatic variables. Improvement in ecosystem models will advance our ability to assess the resilience of the boreal biome under future climatic conditions.

AB Little is known of the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of climate change on animals, yet it is clear that some species appear more resilient than others. As pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in British Columbia, Canada, have flourished in the current era of climate warming in contrast to other Pacific salmonids in the same watershed, this study investigated whether the continuing success of pink salmon may be linked with exceptional cardiorespiratory adaptations and thermal tolerance of adult fish during their spawning migration. Sex-specific differences existed in minimum and maximum oxygen consumption rates ((M) over dot(O2, min) and (M) over dot(O2, max), respectively) across the temperature range of 8 to 28 degrees C, reflected in a higher aerobic scope ((M) over dot(O2, max)-(M) over dot(O2, min)) for males. Nevertheless, the aerobic scope of both sexes was optimal at 21 degrees C (T-opt) and was elevated across the entire temperature range in comparison with other Pacific salmonids. As T-opt for aerobic scope of this pink salmon population is higher than in other Pacific salmonids, and historic river temperature data reveal that this population rarely encounters temperatures exceeding Topt, these findings offer a physiological explanation for the continuing success of this species throughout the current climate-warming period. Despite this, declining cardiac output was evident above 17 degrees C, and maximum attainable swimming speed was impaired above similar to 23 degrees C, suggesting negative implications under prolonged thermal exposure. While forecasted summer river temperatures over the next century are likely to negatively impact all Pacific salmonids, we suggest that the cardiorespiratory capacity of pink salmon may confer a selective advantage over other species.

AB Soils are the product of a complex suite of chemical, biological, and physical processes. In spite of the importance of soils for society and for sustaining life on earth, our knowledge of soil formation rates and of the influence of biological activity on mineral weathering and geochemical cycles is still limited. In this paper we provide a description of the Damma Glacier Critical Zone Observatory and present a first synthesis of our multi disciplinary studies of the 150-yr soil chronosequence. The aim of our research was to improve our understanding of ecosystem development on a barren substrate and the early evolution of soils and to evaluate the influence of biological activity on weathering rates. Soil pH, cation exchange capacity, biomass, bacterial and fungal populations, and soil organic matt er show clear gradients related to soil age, in spite of the extreme heterogeneity of the ecosystem. The bulk mineralogy and inorganic geochemistry of the soils, in contrast, are independent of soil age and only in older soils (>100 yr) is incipient weathering observed, mainly as a decreasing content in albite and biotite by coincidental formation of secondary chlorites in the clay fraction. Further, we document the rapid evolution of microbial and plant communities along the chronosequence.

AB We employ molecular methods to profile the diet of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, and describe spatial and temporal changes in diet over their maternity season. We identified 61 prey species of insects and 5 species of arachnid. The largest proportion of prey (similar to 32%) were identified as species of the mass-emerging Ephemeroptera (mayfly) genus Caenis. Bats roosting in agricultural settings had lower dietary richness than those occupying a roost located on a forest fragment in a conservation area. We detected temporal fluctuations in diet over the maternity season. Dipteran (fly) species dominated the diet early in the season, replaced later by species of mayfly. Because our methodology provides species-level identification of prey, we were able to isolate environmental indicator species in the diet and draw conclusions about the location and type of their foraging habitat and the health of these aquatic systems. The species detected suggested that the bats use variable habitats; members of one agricultural roost foraged on insects originating in rivers or streams while those in another agricultural roost and the forest roost fed on insects from pond or lake environments. All source water for prey was of fair to good quality, though no species detected are intolerant of pollution thus the habitat cannot be classified as pristine. Our study outlines a model system to investigate the abiotic and biotic interactions between habitat factors through this simple food chain to the top predator.

AB Conservation and development visions in and around protected areas generate confrontation and uncertainty that damage the biodiversity and ecosystem services which maintain human well-being. To address this issue, we applied the participatory scenario planning framework to the protected area of the Do ana social-ecological system in southwestern Spain. This work explores the social perceptions regarding the conditions, trends, trade-offs, and future of ecosystem services and human well-being, and seeks management strategies for the Do ana social-ecological system and its protected areas. We found that participatory scenario planning (1) can create different visions of the future of the system addressing its uncertainty and the main ecosystem services trade-offs, and (2) can propose consensual management strategies to determine a path toward a desirable future.

AB The increased translocation of plant species for biodiversity restoration and habitat creation has provoked a debate on provenance and genotypic diversity of the used plant material. Nonlocal provenances are often not adapted to the local environmental conditions, and low population genotypic diversity may result in genetic bottlenecks hampering successful establishment. We tested provenance differentiation of four plant species used in agri-environment schemes to increase biodiversity of agricultural landscapes (wildflower strips). Provenances were collected close to the experimental field and at four further sites of different distances ranging from 120 to 900 km. In two of these provenances, different levels of genotypic diversity were simulated by sowing seed from a high and low number of mother plants. We found a large provenance differentiation in fitness-related traits, particularly in seedling emergence. There was no evidence for a general superiority of the local population. The productivity was greater in populations of high genotypic diversity than in those of low diversity, but the effect was only significant in one species. Productivity was also more constant among populations of high diversity, reducing the risk of establishment failure. Our results indicate that the choice of an appropriate provenance and a sufficient genotypic diversity are important issues in ecological restoration. The use of local provenances does not always guarantee the best performance, but a spread of superior alien genotypes can be avoided. A sufficient genotypic diversity of the sown plants might be a biological insurance against fluctuations in ecosystem processes increasing the reliability of restoration measures.

AB Two types of physiological mechanisms can contribute to growth decline with age: (i) the mechanisms leading to the reduction of carbon assimilation (input) and (ii) those leading to modification of the resource economy. Surprisingly, the processes relating to carbon allocation have been little investigated as compared to research on the processes governing carbon assimilation. The objective of this paper was thus to test the hypothesis that growth decrease related to age is accompanied by changes in carbon allocation to the benefit of storage and reproductive functions in two contrasting broad-leaved species: beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). Age-related changes in carbon allocation were studied using a chronosequence approach. Chronosequences, each consisting of several even-aged stands ranging from 14 to 175 years old for beech and from 30 to 134 years old for sessile oak, were divided into five or six age classes. In this study, carbon allocations to growth, storage and reproduction were defined as the relative amount of carbon invested in biomass increment, carbohydrate increment and seed production, respectively. Tree-ring width and allometric relationships were used to assess biomass increment at the tree and stand scales. Below-ground biomass was assessed using a specific allometric relationship between root: shoot ratio and age, established from the literature review. Seasonal variations of carbohydrate concentrations were used to assess carbon allocation to storage. Reproduction effort was quantified for beech stands by collecting seed and cupule production. Age-related flagging of biomass productivity was assessed at the tree and stand scales, and carbohydrate quantities in trees increased with age for both species. Seed and cupule production increased with stand age in beech from 56 gC m(-2) year(-1) at 30 years old to 129 gC m(-2) year(-1) at 138 years old. In beech, carbon allocation to storage and reproductive functions increased with age to the detriment of carbon allocation to growth functions. In contrast, the carbon balance between growth and storage remained constant between age classes in sessile oak. The contrasting age-related changes in carbon allocation between beech and sessile oak are discussed with reference to the differences in growing environment, phenology and hydraulic properties of ring-porous and diffuse-porous species.

AB Background: Understanding the mechanisms that control species genetic structure has always been a major objective in evolutionary studies. The association between genetic structure and species attributes has received special attention. As species attributes are highly taxonomically constrained, phylogenetically controlled methods are necessary to infer causal relationships. In plants, a previous study controlling for phylogenetic signal has demonstrated that Wright's F-ST, a measure of genetic differentiation among populations, is best predicted by the mating system (outcrossing, mixed-mating or selfing) and that plant traits such as perenniality and growth form have only an indirect influence on F-ST via their association with the mating system. The objective of this study is to further outline the determinants of plant genetic structure by distinguishing the effects of mating system on gene flow and on genetic drift. The association of biparental inbreeding and inbreeding depression with population genetic structure, mating system and plant traits are also investigated.
   Results: Based on data from 263 plant species for which estimates of F-ST, inbreeding (F-IS) and outcrossing rate (t(m)) are available, we confirm that mating system is the main influencing factor of F-ST. Moreover, using an alternative measure of F-ST unaffected by the impact of inbreeding on effective population size, we show that the influence of tm on F-ST is due to its impact on gene flow (reduced pollen flow under selfing) and on genetic drift (higher drift under selfing due to inbreeding). Plant traits, in particular perenniality, influence F-ST mostly via their effect on the mating system but also via their association with the magnitude of selection against inbred individuals: the mean inbreeding depression increases from short-lived herbaceous to long-lived herbaceous and then to woody species. The influence of perenniality on mating system does not seem to be related to differences in stature, as proposed earlier, but rather to differences in generation time.
   Conclusion: Plant traits correlated with generation time affect both inbreeding depression and mating system. These in turn modify genetic drift and gene flow and ultimately genetic structure.

AB In the last century, the grasslands of southern South America were rapidly converted to croplands, starting a fragmentation process that is still ongoing. Almost no information is available on the spatial patterns and environmental controls of these processes. Our objective was to characterize the degree of fragmentation and to analyze the environmental controls of landscape composition of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, in southern South America. We classified land cover types using three Landsat TM scenes and we analyzed landscape structure using six metrics. Grassland is still the predominant land cover type in the Pampas, occupying 65.5% of the analyzed area. The abundance of the original land cover varied regionally, being higher in the south east (Flooding Pampa) and lower in the northern part of the area studied (Rolling Pampa). Landscape fragmentation was determined by crop production, therefore, was highest in the Rolling Pampa and lowest in the Flooding Pampa. The fragmentation patterns were associated to both climatic and edaphic factors. Fragmentation of native vegetation was mainly regulated by soil drainage, as in poorly drained soils, crop production is almost unfeasible. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In guppies (Poecilia reticulata) precopulatory sexual selection (via female choice) and post-copulatory selection (via sperm competition) both favour males with relatively high levels of carotenoid (orange) pigmentation, suggesting that colourful males produce more competitive ejaculates. Here we test whether there is a positive association between male orange pigmentation and sperm quality. Our analysis of sperm quality focused on sperm swimming speeds (using CASA: computer-assisted sperm analysis to estimate three parameters of sperm velocity in vitro), sperm viability (proportion of live sperm per stripped ejaculate) and sperm lengths. We found that males with relatively large areas of orange pigmentation had significantly faster and more viable sperm than their less ornamented counterparts, suggesting a possible link between dietary carotenoid intake and sperm quality. By contrast, we found no relationship between sperm length (head length and total sperm length) and male phenotype. These findings, in conjunction with previous work showing that highly ornamented male guppies sire higher quality offspring, suggest that female preference for colourful males and sperm competition work in concert to favour intrinsically higher quality males.

AB [ 1] Incident photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR) is a key variable needed by almost all terrestrial ecosystem models. Unfortunately, the current incident PAR products estimated from remotely sensed data at spatial and temporal resolutions are not sufficient for carbon cycle modeling and various applications. In this study, the authors develop a new method based on the look-up table approach for estimating instantaneous incident PAR from the polar-orbiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. Since the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance depends on both surface reflectance and atmospheric properties that largely determine the incident PAR, our first step is to estimate surface reflectance. The approach assumes known aerosol properties for the observations with minimum blue reflectance from a temporal window of each pixel. Their inverted surface reflectance is then interpolated to determine the surface reflectance of other observations. The second step is to calculate PAR by matching the computed TOA reflectance from the look-up table with the TOA values of the satellite observations. Both the direct and diffuse PAR components, as well as the total shortwave radiation, are determined in exactly the same fashion. The calculation of a daily average PAR value from one or two instantaneous PAR values is also explored. Ground measurements from seven FLUXNET sites are used for validating the algorithm. The results indicate that this approach can produce reasonable PAR product at 1 km resolution and is suitable for global applications, although more quantitative validation activities are still needed.

AB Here we present the within-site, seasonal, and interannual variations of the carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope ratios of leaves, wood, bark and litter from four sites in the Amazon region, Brazil. Samples were collected in Manaus (3 degrees 06'07"S; 60 degrees 01'30" W), Ji-Parana (10 degrees 53'07"S; 61 degrees 57'06" W), and Santarem (2 degrees 26'35" S; 54 degrees 42'30" W) with mean annual precipitation of 2207, 2040 and 1909 mm respectively. The overall average for all leaf samples was -32.3 +/- 2.5 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and +/- 5.8 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand for delta N-15 (n=756). The leaf delta values at these sites were often but not always statistically distinct from each other. The delta C-13 values varied from -37.8 parts per thousand to -25.9 parts per thousand. Pronounced differences in delta C-13 values occurred with height associated with differences in forest structure. The delta C-13 of leaf dry matter showed seasonal variations associated with the length of the dry season, despite the fact that total annual precipitation was similar among the studied sites. Leaf delta N-15 values ranged from +/- 0.9 parts per thousand to a maximum value of +10.9 parts per thousand, and the Santarem sites showed more enriched values than Manaus and Ji-Parana sites. No seasonal variation was detected in the delta N-15 of leaves, but significant differences were observed among sites and with changes in canopy height. The isotope ratio data are consistent with our current understanding of the roles of light, water availability, and recycling of soil-respired CO2 influences on delta C-13 and consistent with our understanding that an open nitrogen cycle can lead to high delta N-15 values despite a significant number of legumes in the vegetation.

AB 1 We examined among- and within-species effects of seed mass for seedling establishment from seed to 5 years of age in a field experiment at Paracou, French Guiana.
   2 Six seeds of each of eight species were weighed and planted into each of 120 plots (1 m(2)) throughout closed-canopy forest along 12 100-m transects in 1998.
   3 We described the microhabitat of each planting site using principal components derived from measurements of light availability, soil moisture, carbon and nitrogen content, and soil phosphorus availability. Although both survival and relative growth rate (RGR) increased with increasing light availability, no other microhabitat variable significantly affected seedling performance. Nor did the magnitude of microhabitat effects on survival or RGR differ among species.
   4 Larger-seeded species were more likely to survive from germination to 1 year as well as from 1 to 5 years of age. RGR for seedling height during the first year post-germination was not related to seed mass, but smaller-seeded species did grow slightly faster thereafter. Path analyses revealed that correlations between seed mass and performance were explained in part because larger seeds produced larger initial seedlings, which tended to survive better but grow more slowly.
   5 We also analysed within-species effects of seed mass for the larger-seeded Eperua grandiflora and Vouacapoua americana (both Caesalpiniaceae). Larger seeds produced larger seedlings in both species, but larger seeds survived better only for Eperua. Larger seedlings grew more slowly in both species, but did not offset the early (Eperua) and later (Vouacapoua) positive direct effects of seed mass on RGR that may represent contrasting strategies for reserve deployment.
   6 Our results demonstrate that seed size influences performance within and among species in part because of indirect effects of initial seedling size. However, we suggest that traits tightly correlated with seed mass at the species level, such as specific leaf area, leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity, may also contribute to interspecific performance differences.

AB Most metazoans engage in recombination every generation. In theory this is associated with considerable cost, such as the production of males, so that asexual organisms, which do not pay this cost, should be able to invade populations of sexuals. Some asexuals depend on sperm of sexual males to trigger embryogenesis, a reproductive mode called gynogenesis. The genetic information of males is typically not used. Theory predicts that such mating complexes are short-lived and highly unstable. Sperm dependency is not only the defining feature of the biology of gynogenetic metazoans, it is also a major puzzle in evolutionary biology. Organisms that apparently combine disadvantages of both sexuality and asexuality are a serious challenge to theory. A number of questions about these systems are still unresolved.

AB The seaweed Fucus serratus is hypothesized to have evolved in the North Atlantic and present populations are thought to reflect recolonization from a southern refugium since the last glacial maximum 18 000-20 000 years bp. We examined genetic structure across several spatial scales by analysing seven microsatellite loci in populations collected from 21 localities throughout the species' range. Spatial auto-correlation analysis of seven microsatellite loci revealed no evidence for spatial clustering of alleles on a scale of 100 m despite limited gamete dispersal in F. serratus of approximate to 2 m from parental individuals. Pairwise theta analysis suggested that the minimal panmictic unit for F. serratus was between 0.5 and 2 km. Isolation by distance was significant along some contiguous coastlines. Population differentiation was strong within the Skagerrak-Kattegat-Baltic Seas (SKB) (global theta = 0.17) despite a short history of approximate to 7500 years. A neighbour-joining tree based on Reynold's distances computed from the microsatellite data revealed a central assemblage of populations on the Brittany Peninsula surrounded by four well-supported clusters consisting of the SKB, the North Sea (Ireland, Helgoland), and two populations from the northern Spanish coast. Samples from Iceland and Nova Scotia were most closely aligned with northwest Sweden and Brittany, respectively. When sample sizes were standardized (N = 41), allelic diversity was twofold higher for Brittany populations than for populations to the north and threefold higher than southern populations. The Brittany region may be a refugium or a recolonized area, whereas the Spanish populations most likely reflect present-day edge populations that have undergone repeated bottlenecks as a consequence of thermally induced cycles of recolonization and extinction.

AB Scrippsiella trochoidea is a widely distributed neritic dinoflagellate that produces calcareous resting cysts. We assessed the level of intraspecific diversity at the molecular, morphological and physiological levels among 15 strains identified as S. trochoidea and isolated from the Gulf of Naples (Italy, Mediterranean Sea), and an additional isolate from the Faeroe Islands. We investigated the morphology of motile cells and cysts, mating modality, encystment success, and growth rates at different light irradiances. The ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was sequenced to infer phylogenetic relationships among the S. trochoidea strains and closely related species. The molecular analysis revealed a well-supported lineage comprising strains with a Scrippsiella plate pattern. Within this clade, a number of distinct ITS haplotypes were recorded but the relationships among them were only partially resolved. The 16 S. trochoidea isolates grouped into five single-strain clades and three multi-strain clades. The grouping of haplotypes in a series of distinct clades suggests the existence of cryptic species within what has previously been considered a single species, based on the morphological features of the motile cells and cysts. Some of the ITS haplotypes were distinguishable visually, based on minor morphological features of the motile cells and cysts, but in two cases morphologically almost identical strains fell into different clades. Our results showed that the majority of the strains are homothallic; only S. trochoidea v. aciculifera from the Faeroe Islands is heterothallic. Cyst production rates were notable for their diversity, even among strains grouping with the same ITS haplotype, as were growth rates at different light irradiances. Based on phylogenetic results, two new combinations are proposed: S. operosa (Deflandre) Montresor comb. nov. and S. infula (Deflandre) Montresor comb. nov.

AB Obtaining useful information about elusive or endangered species can be logistically difficult, particularly if relying entirely on field signs such as hair, feathers or faeces. However, recent developments in molecular technology add substantially to the utility of such 'non-invasive' samples, which provide a source of DNA that can be used to identify not only species but also individuals and their gender. This provides great potential to improve the accuracy of abundance estimates and determine behavioural parameters, such as home-range size, individual habitat and dietary preferences, and even some forms of social interaction. Non-invasive samples can also be a useful alternative to blood or tissue samples ( the collection of which traditionally has required trapping of animals) as genetic material for applications such as relatedness, population genetic and phylogenetic analyses. Despite the huge potential of non-invasive genetic sampling, the current technology does have limitations. The low quantity and quality of DNA often obtained from such sources results in an increased risk of genotyping errors, which may lead to incorrect inferences, particularly false identification of individuals. Appropriate precautions and pilot studies are required to minimise these risks, and in some cases it may be wise to employ traditional methods when they are adequate.

AB There is growing evidence that plant and animal species are arranged in hierarchies of relative competitive performance. More work is needed to determine which plant traits best predict relative competitive performance. We therefore measured relative competitive performance of 63 terrestrial herbaceous plant species using Trichostema brachiatum as a reference species (that is, phytometer or target species). The neighbour species came from a wide array of terrestrial vegetation types (e.g. rock barrens, alvars, old fields), and represented a wide array of growth forms (e.g. small rosette species such as Saxifraga virginiensis and large clonal graminoids such as Agropyron repens). The experiment was repeated with two pot sizes: large (control) and small (stress treatment). Relative competitive performance in large pots (controls) was highly correlated with that in small pots (stress treatment) (r = 0.90, p < 0.001). The hierarchy of relative competitive performance in the large pots was also highly correlated with the hierarchy in the small (stressed) pots (r, = 0.91, p < 0.001). Principal components analysis and multiple linear regression showed that plant size (measured by total biomass, above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, canopy area, height and leaf area index) and leaf shape (measured as length to width ratio, length, width) were the two characteristics that best predicted relative competitive performance (large pots, r(2) = 0.55; small pots, r(2) = 0.48).

AB Current knowledge suggests a high redundancy of soil organism communities, i.e. saturation of function at low levels of species richness. This does not imply, however, that research on soil organism biodiversity and its function is irrelevant. First, it is well established that several species of the decomposer community are functionally more important than others. The 'step' hypothesis developed in this paper shows that under these conditions random loss of species is much more likely to impact ecosystem processes than expected from the redundancy hypothesis. Second, redundant species may gain functional significance by interacting with functionally important species. Third, the number of 'important species' is increased by the multiplicity of functions carried out by soil biota. And finally, alteration in species composition will not be a random process. In fact, functionally important soil biota might be among the first to be affected by large-scale changes in land use. Even if we were to accept that conservation efforts should be confined to the functionally most important species, we would have no idea how to do so. Crossing the 'spatial barrier' seems to be the biggest challenge for future investigations on soil biodiversity, because traditional approaches of community ecology will not be sufficient to answer the questions originating from large-scale impoverishment of the soil fauna. Some examples of promising macroecological topics are discussed: (i) the impact of the regional species pool on local species richness, (ii) the relationship between alpha- and gamma -diversity, and (iii) abundance-occupancy relationships. It is argued that research in this direction will be essential for answering the question of how populations and communities must be organised to resist alterations of the soil habitat at the landscape-level.

AB 1. Bees are believed to be dominant pollen vectors in tropical forests, yet studies specific to bees in south-east Asia are rare. Regeneration and restoration of the rapidly disappearing lowland forests of this region are reliant on bees, thus there is an urgent need for forest bee data at the community level.
   2. Bee communities of eight forested sites in Johor (Malaysia) and Singapore were surveyed three times each from February to August 1999 at the below-canopy level. These sites ranged from relatively undisturbed primary lowland dipterocarp forests to late secondary forests and exotic forests, including an oil palm plantation. We attempted to elucidate the environmental factors that correlated with the distribution of bees.
   3. Bee abundance, in particular that of Apidae, was significantly higher in larger primary forests than other types of forests. However, bee species richness was higher in disturbed forests.
   4. The distribution of bees was apparently influenced by variables closely related to forest disturbance and resource abundance, such as the density of big trees (diameter at breast height 30-40 cm), temperature and flowering intensity of trees and shrubs.
   5. More stingless bees (Trigona spp.) were found where trees were larger and ambient conditions more constant but flowering intensities lower.
   6. The differences between the bee communities in forests of urban Singapore and primary forests in Johor may indicate that ecological processes in the forests of Singapore, in particular pollination, may be changing. However, pollination may not be totally intact in the primary forests surveyed, as their bee communities seemed to be depauperate.
   7. The role of important pollinators, especially bees, for the long-term survival of tropical lowland forests is poorly understood. Our study indicates that we urgently need more thorough understanding of pollination and pollinators, as some bee species appear to be disappearing from disturbed tropical lowland forests.

AB We examined the genetic population structure in eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), the dominant seagrass species of the northern hemisphere, over spatial scales from 12 km to 10 000 km using the polymorphism of DNA microsatellites. Twelve populations were genotyped for six loci representing a total of 67 alleles. Populations sampled included the North Sea (four), the Baltic Sea (three), the western Atlantic (two), the eastern Atlantic (one), the Mediterranean Sea (one) and the eastern Pacific (one). Microsatellites revealed substantial genetic variation in a plant group with low allozyme diversity. Average expected heterozygosities per population (monoclonal populations excluded) ranged from 0.32 to 0.61 (mean = 0.48) and allele numbers varied between 3.3 and 6.7 (mean = 4.7). Using the expected frequency of multilocus genotypes within populations, we distinguished ramets from genetic individuals (i.e. equivalent to clones). Differences in clonal diversity among populations varied widely and ranged from maximal diversity (i.e. all ramets with different genotype) to near or total monoclonality (two populations). All multiple sampled ramets were excluded from further analysis of genetic differentiation within and between populations. All but one population were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, indicating that Zostera marina is predominantly outcrossing. From a regression of the pairwise population differentiation with distance, we obtained an effective population size N-e of 2440-5000. The overall genetic differentiation among eelgrass populations, assessed as rho (a standardized estimate of Slatkin's R-ST) was 0.384 (95% CI 0.34-0.44, P < 0.001). Genetic differentiation was weak among three North Sea populations situated 12-42 km distant from one another, suggesting that tidal currents result in an efficient exchange of propagules. In the Baltic and in Nova Scotia, a small but statistically significant fraction of the genetic variance was distributed between populations (rho = 0.029-0.053) at scales of 15-35 km. Pairwise genetic differentiation between European populations were correlated with distance between populations up to a distance of 4500 km (linear differentiation-by-distance model, R-2 = 0.67). In contrast, both Nova Scotian populations were genetically much closer to North Sea and Baltic populations than expected from their geographical distance (pairwise rho = 0.03-0.08, P < 0.01). A biogeographical cluster of Canadian with Baltic/North Sea populations was also supported using a neighbour-joining tree based on Cavalli-Sforza's chord distance. Relatedness between populations may be very different from predictions based on geographical vicinity.

AB 1. Surface-sediment assemblages of subfossil chironomid head capsules from fifty-four primarily shallow and nutrient-rich Danish lakes were analysed using multivariate numerical techniques. The species data, comprising forty-one chironomid taxa, were compared to environmental monitoring data in order chironomid faunal composition and lake trophic state.
   2. The subfossil assemblages were compared to the chironomid bathymetric distributions along transects from four lakes. Correspondence analysis and similarity coefficients showed that the subfossil assemblages, sampled in the lake centre, reflect the chironomid communities in the littoral at a depth of 2-7 m.
   3. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) was used to classify the Danish lakes into five groups defined by trophic state, lake depth and pH. Eighteen chironomid taxa showed significant differences in abundance among the five groups. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed the chlorophyll a concentration ([Chl a]) and Secchi depth to be the variables best correlated to the faunal data, and fourteen taxa were significantly correlated to [Chl a].
   4. The strong correlation between chironomid data and the In-transformed ([Chl a]) was used to create a weighted averaging (WA) model to infer lake trophic state. Several models were tested by cross validation (leave-one-out jack-knifing), and a simple WA model using inverse de-shrinking had a RMSEPjack of 0.65 (In units) and a r(jack)(2) of 0.67.
   5. The results can be used in the assessment and reconstruction of lake trophic state for long-term monitoring and palaeoecological investigations of shallow, temperate lakes in the mesotrophic to hypertrophic nutrient range.

AB Testing estimates of year-to-year variation in global net primary production (NPP) poses some challenges. Large-scale, multiyear records of production are not readily available for natural systems but are for agricultural systems, We use records of agricultural yields at selected sites to test NPP estimates produced by CASA, a global-scale production model driven by both meteorological data and the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We also test estimates produced by the Miami model, which has underlain several analyses of biosphere response to interannual changes in climate. In addition, we test estimates against tree ring data for one boreal site for which data from both coniferous and deciduous species were available. The agricultural tests demonstrate that CASA can reasonably estimate interannual variation in production. The Miami model estimates variation more poorly. However, differences in NDVI-processing algorithms substantially affect CASA's estimates of interannual variation. Of the four versions tested, the FASIR NDVI most closely reproduced yield data and showed the least correlation with changes in equatorial crossing time of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites, One issue raised is the source of the positive trends evident in CASA's NDVI-based estimates of global NPP. The existence of these trends is consistent with potential stimulation of terrestrial production by factors such as CO2 enrichment, N fertilization, or temperature warming, but the magnitude of the global trends seen is significantly greater than suggested by constraints imposed by atmospheric fluxes.

AB The effects of plants on the biosphere, atmosphere and geosphere are key determinants of terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, despite substantial progress made regarding plant belowground components, we are still only beginning to explore the complex relationships between root traits and functions. Drawing on the literature in plant physiology, ecophysiology, ecology, agronomy and soil science, we reviewed 24 aspects of plant and ecosystem functioning and their relationships with a number of root system traits, including aspects of architecture, physiology, morphology, anatomy, chemistry, biomechanics and biotic interactions. Based on this assessment, we critically evaluated the current strengths and gaps in our knowledge, and identify future research challenges in the field of root ecology. Most importantly, we found that belowground traits with the broadest importance in plant and ecosystem functioning are not those most commonly measured. Also, the estimation of trait relative importance for functioning requires us to consider a more comprehensive range of functionally relevant traits from a diverse range of species, across environments and over time series. We also advocate that establishing causal hierarchical links among root traits will provide a hypothesis-based framework to identify the most parsimonious sets of traits with the strongest links on functions, and to link genotypes to plant and ecosystem functioning.

AB Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6834314, was associated with serum liver enzymes in the general population, presumably reflecting liver fat or injury. We studied rs6834314 and its nearest gene, 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13), to identify associations with histological features of NAFLD and to characterize the functional role of HSD17B13 in NAFLD pathogenesis. The minor allele of rs6834314 was significantly associated with increased steatosis but decreased inflammation, ballooning, Mallory-Denk bodies, and liver enzyme levels in 768 adult Caucasians with biopsy-proven NAFLD and with cirrhosis in the general population. We found two plausible causative variants in the HSD17B13 gene. rs72613567, a splice-site SNP in high linkage with rs6834314 (r(2) = 0.94) generates splice variants and shows a similar pattern of association with NAFLD histology. Its minor allele generates simultaneous expression of exon 6-skipping and G-nucleotide insertion variants. Another SNP, rs62305723 (encoding a P260S mutation), is significantly associated with decreased ballooning and inflammation. Hepatic expression of HSD17B13 is 5.9-fold higher (P = 0.003) in patients with NAFLD. HSD17B13 is targeted to lipid droplets, requiring the conserved amino acid 22-28 sequence and amino acid 71-106 region. The protein has retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) activity, with enzymatic activity dependent on lipid droplet targeting and cofactor binding site. The exon 6 deletion, G insertion, and naturally occurring P260S mutation all confer loss of enzymatic activity. Conclusion: We demonstrate the association of variants in HSD17B13 with specific features of NAFLD histology and identify the enzyme as a lipid droplet-associated RDH; our data suggest that HSD17B13 plays a role in NAFLD through its enzymatic activity.

TI Recovery of trees from drought depends on belowground sink control

AB Climate projections predict higher precipitation variability with more frequent dry extremes(1). CO2 assimilation of forests decreases during drought, either by stomatal closure(2) or by direct environmental control of sink tissue activities(3.) Ultimately, drought effects on forests depend on the ability of forests to recover, but the mechanisms controlling ecosystem resilience are uncertain(4). Here, we have investigated the effects of drought and drought release on the carbon balances in beech trees by combining CO2 flux measurements, metabolomics and (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling. During drought, net photosynthesis (A(N)), soil respiration(R-S) and the allocation of recent assimilates below ground were reduced. Carbohydrates accumulated in metabolically resting roots but not in leaves, indicating sink control of the tree carbon balance. After drought release, R-S recovered faster than A(N) and CO2 fluxes exceeded those in continuously watered trees for months. This stimulation was related to greater assimilate allocation to and metabolization in the rhizosphere. These findings show that trees prioritize the investment of assimilates below ground, probably to regain root functions after drought. We propose that root restoration plays a key role in ecosystem resilience to drought, in that the increased sink activity controls the recovery of carbon balances.

AB Declines in migratory species are a pressing concern worldwide, but the mechanisms underpinning these declines are not fully understood. We hypothesised that species with greater within-population variability in migratory movements and destinations, here termed migratory diversity', might be more resilient to environmental change. To test this, we related map-based metrics of migratory diversity to recent population trends for 340 European breeding birds. Species that occupy larger non-breeding ranges relative to breeding, a characteristic we term migratory dispersion', were less likely to be declining than those with more restricted non-breeding ranges. Species with partial migration strategies (i.e. overlapping breeding and non-breeding ranges) were also less likely to be declining than full migrants or full residents, an effect that was independent of migration distance. Recent rates of advancement in Europe-wide spring arrival date were greater for partial migrants than full migrants, suggesting that migratory diversity may also help facilitate species responses to climate change.

AB Communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are strongly affected by land use intensity and soil type. The impact of tillage practices on AMF communities is still poorly understood, especially in organic farming systems. Our objective was to investigate the impact of soil cultivation on AMF communities in organically managed clay soils of a long-term field experiment located in the Sissle valley (Frick, Switzerland) where two different tillage (reduced and conventional mouldboard plough tillage) and two different types of fertilization (farmyard manure & slurry, or slurry only) have been applied since 2002. In addition, a permanent grassland and two conventionally managed croplands situated in the neighborhood of the experiment were analyzed as controls. Four different soil depths were studied including top-soils (0-10 and 10-20 cm) of different cultivation regimes and undisturbed sub-soils (20-30 and 30-40 cm). The fungi were directly isolated from field soil samples, and additionally spores were periodically collected from long-term trap culture (microcosm) systems. In total, >50,000 AMF spores were identified on the species level, and 53 AMF species were found, with 38 species in the permanent grassland, 33 each in the two reduced till organic farming systems, 28-33 in the regularly plowed organic farming systems, and 28-33 in the non-organic conventional farming systems. AMF spore density and species richness increased in the top-soils under reduced tillage as compared to the ploughed plots. In 10-20 cm also the Shannon-Weaver AMF diversity index was higher under reduced tillage than in the ploughed plots. Our study demonstrates that AMF communities in clay soils were affected by land use type, farming system, tillage as well as fertilization strategy and varying with soil depth. Several AMF indicator species especially for different land use types and tillage strategies were identified from the large data set. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal effects are now universally recognised as a form of nongenetic. parental influence on offspring but, until recently, paternal effects were regarded as an anomaly. Although it is now clear that paternal effects are both widespread and important, their proximate basis and evolutionary consequences have received little attention and remain poorly understood. In particular, because many paternal effects are mediated by maternal responses such as differential allocation, the boundary between paternal and maternal effects is sometimes blurred. We distinguish here three basic types of paternal effect and clarify the role of maternal responses in these effects. We also outline key questions that can serve as a road map for research on the proximate basis and evolutionary implications of paternal effects.

AB Questions Functional redundancy in assemblages may insure ecosystem processes after perturbation, potentially causing temporary or permanent local species extinctions. Yet, functional redundancy has only been inferred by indirect evidence or measured by methods that may not be the most appropriate. Here, we apply an existing method to measure functional redundancy, which is the fraction of species diversity not expressed by functional diversity, to assess whether functional redundancy affects community resilience after disturbance.
   Location Subtropical grassland, south Brazil (30 degrees 0546S, 51 degrees 4037W).
   Method: Species traits and community composition were assessed in quadrats before grazing and after community recovery. Grazing intensity (G) was measured in each quadrat. We used traits linked to grazing intensity to define functional redundancy (FR) as the difference of Gini-Simpson index of species diversity (D) and Rao's quadratic entropy (Q). Also, with the same traits, we defined community functional stability (S) as the similarity between trait-based community composition before grazing and 47 and 180 d after grazing ending. Using path analysis we assessed different postulated causal models linking functional diversity (Q), functional redundancy (FR), grazing intensity (G) and community-weightedmean traits to community stability (S) under grazing.
   Results: Path analysis revealed the most valid causal model FR -> S <- G, with a significant positive path coefficient for FR -> S and a marginally significant negative one for S <- G. Since FR and G were independent in their covariation and in their effects on S, the model discriminated community resistance to grazing (the effect of G on S) from community resilience after grazing caused by functional redundancy (indicated by the effect of FR on S).
   Conclusion: We show that expressing functional redundancymathematically is a useful tool for testing causal models linking diversity to community stability. The results support the conclusion that functional redundancy enhanced community resilience, therefore corroborating the insurance hypothesis.

AB Broad-scale environmental changes are altering patterns of natural selection in the wild, but few empirical studies have quantified the demographic cost of sustained directional selection in response to these changes. We tested whether population growth in a wild bird is negatively affected by climate change-induced phenological mismatch, using almost four decades of individual-level life-history data from a great tit population. In this population, warmer springs have generated a mismatch between the annual breeding time and the seasonal food peak, intensifying directional selection for earlier laying dates. Interannual variation in population mismatch has not, however, affected population growth. We demonstrated a mechanism contributing to this uncoupling, whereby fitness losses associated with mismatch are counteracted by fitness gains due to relaxed competition. These findings imply that natural populations may be able to tolerate considerable maladaptation driven by shifting climatic conditions without undergoing immediate declines.

AB Viable populations of species occur in a given place if three conditions are met: the environment at the place is suitable; the species is able to colonize it; co-occurrence is possible despite or because of interactions with other species. Studies investigating the effects of climate change on species have mainly focused on measuring changes in climate suitability. Complex interactions among species have rarely been explored in such studies. We extend network theory to the analysis of complex patterns of co-occurrence among species. The framework is used to explore the robustness of networks under climate change. With our data, we show that networks describing the geographic pattern of co-occurrence among species display properties shared by other complex networks, namely that most species are poorly connected to other species in the network and only a few are highly connected. In our example, species more exposed to climate change tended to be poorly connected to other species within the network, while species more connected tended to be less exposed. Such high connectance would make the co-occurrence networks more robust to climate change. The proposed framework illustrates how network analysis could be used, together with co-occurrence data, to help addressing the potential consequences of species interactions in studies of climate change and biodiversity. However, more research is needed to test for links between co-occurrence and network interactions.

AB High levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition may result in greater terrestrial carbon (C) storage. In a northern hardwood ecosystem, exposure to over a decade of simulated N deposition increased C storage in soil by slowing litter decay rates, rather than increasing detrital inputs. To understand the mechanisms underlying this response, we focused on the saprotrophic fungal community residing in the forest floor and employed molecular genetic approaches to determine if the slower decomposition rates resulted from down-regulation of the transcription of key lignocellulolytic genes, by a change in fungal community composition, or by a combination of the two mechanisms. Our results indicate that across four Acer-dominated forest stands spanning a 500-km transect, community-scale expression of the cellulolytic gene cbhI under elevated N deposition did not differ significantly from that under ambient levels of N deposition. In contrast, expression of the ligninolytic gene lcc was significantly down-regulated by a factor of 2-4 fold relative to its expression under ambient N deposition. Fungal community composition was examined at the most southerly of the four sites, in which consistently lower levels of cbhI and lcc gene expression were observed over a two-year period. We recovered 19 basidiomycete and 28 ascomycete rDNA 28S operational taxonomic units; Athelia, Sistotrema, Ceratobasidium and Ceratosebacina taxa dominated the basidiomycete assemblage, and Leotiomycetes dominated the ascomycetes. Simulated N deposition increased the proportion of basidiomycete sequences recovered from forest floor, whereas the proportion of ascomycetes in the community was significantly lower under elevated N deposition. Our results suggest that chronic atmospheric N deposition may lower decomposition rates through a combination of reduced expression of ligninolytic genes such as lcc, and compositional changes in the fungal community.

AB Conservation planning of critical habitats for wildlife species at risk is a priority topic that requires the knowledge of how animals select and use their habitat, and how they respond to future developmental changes in their environment. This paper explores the role of a habitat-modeling methodological approach, agent-based modeling, which we advocate as a promising approach for ecological research. Agent-based models (ABMs) are capable of simultaneously distinguishing animal densities from habitat quality, can explicitly represent the environment and its dynamism, can accommodate spatial patterns of inter- and intra-species mechanisms, and can explore feedbacks and adaptations inherent in these systems. ABMs comprise autonomous, individual entities; each with dynamic, adaptive behaviors and heterogeneous characteristics that interact with each other and with their environment. These interactions result in emergent outcomes that can be used to quantitatively examine critical habitats from the individual- to population-level. ABMs can also explore how wildlife will respond to potential changes in environmental conditions, since they can readily incorporate adaptive animal-movement ecology in a changing landscape. This paper describes the necessary elements of an ABM developed specifically for understanding wildlife habitat selection, reviews the current empirical literature on ABMs in wildlife ecology and management, and evaluates the current and future roles these ABMs can play, specifically with regards to scenario planning of designated critical habitats.

AB Current individual tree growth models rarely consider the mode of tree competition, which can be size-asymmetric when growth is limited by light or size-symmetric when belowground resources are scarce. Even with the same competition index, growth reactions may vary considerably due to a prevailing resource limitation, as the dominant trees in a stand benefit disproportionately more on light-limited sites. To scrutinize and model the relationship between mode of competition and site conditions, 34 long-term experiments with 120 plots dating back to 1871 were used The data cover the dominating tree species in central Europe along a broad range of ecological conditions For Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst). Scots pine (Pinta sylvestris L.), and sessile oak (Quercus petrea (Matt) Liebl.), stronger light competition can be shown on fertile sites compared with sites with poorer conditions Based on these findings, we constructed an enhanced version of a classic potential modifier growth model. Simulations for archetypical stands yield a transition from size-asymmetric to size-symmetric competition along the gradient from fertile to poor sites that is not covered by traditional models It was concluded that by integrating the interaction between competition and site quality, individual tree models become more site sensitive, a prerequisite for their application under fluctuating environmental conditions

AB Acoustic communication is fundamental in avian territory defence and mate attraction. In urban environments where sound transmissions are more likely to be masked by low-frequency anthropogenic noise, acoustic adaptations may be advantageous. However, minor modifications to a signal could affect its efficacy. While recent research has shown that there is divergence between songs from noisy and quiet areas, it is unknown whether these differences affect the response to the signal by its receivers. Here, we show that there is a difference in spectral aspects of rural and urban song in a common passerine, the great tit Parus major, at 20 sites across the UK. We also provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that such environmentally induced differences in song influence the response of male territory holders. Males from quiet territories exhibited a significantly stronger response when hearing song from another territory holder with low background noise than from those with high background noise. The opposite distinction in response intensity to homotypic versus heterotypic song was observed in males from noisy territories. This behavioural difference may intensify further signal divergence between urban and rural populations and raises important questions concerning signal evolution.

AB We propose here some refinements of the ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA) to describe precisely one organism's habitat selection. The ENFA is based on the concept of the ecological niche, and provides a measure of the realised niche within the available space from the computation of two parameters, the marginality and the specialization. By measuring the departure of the ecological niche from the average available habitat, the marginality identifies the preference of the individual, population, or species for specific conditions of the environment among the whole set of possibilities. The specialization appears as a consequence of the narrowness of the niche on some environmental variables. The ENFA is a factorial analysis that extracts one axis of marginality and several axes of specialization. We present here the use of biplots (i.e., the projection of both the pixels of the map and the environmental variables in the subspace extracted by the ENFA) as a way to identify the key-variables for management, assessing which habitat features are of prime importance and should be preserved or reinforced. With the help of this tool, we are now able to describe much more precisely the habitat selection of the organism under focus. In our application to the lynx in the Vosges mountains, based on sightings as well as other indices of lynx presence, we thus underlined a strong avoidance of agricultural areas by the lynx. We also highlighted the relative indifference of the lynx to the proximity of artificial areas and at the opposite, the sensitivity to the proximity of highways. The ENTA provides a suitable way to measure habitat use/selection under a large range of ecological contexts and should be used to define precisely the ecological niche and therefore identify the characteristics searched for by the organism under study.

AB A simple argument based on the distribution of individuals amongst discrete resource sites is used to show how the form of single species population models depends on the type of competition between, and the spatial clustering of, the individuals. For scramble competition between individuals, we confirm earlier demonstrations that the Ricker model is a direct consequence of a uniform random distribution of individuals across resources. By introducing spatial clustering of individuals according to a negative binomial distribution, we are able to derive the Hassell model. Furthermore, the tent map model is seen to be a consequence of scramble competition and an ideal-free distribution of individuals. To model contest competition under different degrees of spatial clustering we derive a new three-parameter model, of which the Beverton-Holt and Skellam models are special cases, where one of the parameters relates directly to the clustering distribution. Other population models, such as the quadratic model and the theta-Ricker models, cannot be derived in our framework. Taken together our derivations of population models allows us to make a more rigorous prescription for model choice when fitting to particular datasets.

AB We evaluated the roles of the abiotic environment and dispersal in the assembly of fern communities at contrasting spatial scales within an old-growth, temperate deciduous forest. Specifically, we examined correlations among the geographic location of sampling plots separated by either 135-3515 m (mesoscale) or 4-134 m (fine scale), the abiotic environmental characteristics of the plots, and their constituent fern species. Ferns had predictable distributions along a soil moisture gradient at both spatial scales: six of eight common fern species showed repeatable environmental optima along the soil moisture gradient. By sampling in such a way as to decouple the correlation between distance and environmental variation, we showed the dominant role of environmental variables such as soil moisture in determining fern distributions at the mesoscale. At the fine scale, however, strong spatial autocorrelation in the abiotic environment precluded assigning any definitive role for either dispersal or environmental determinism alone in affecting fern distributions. The expectations of neutral theory that are rooted in dispersal limitation and those of niche theory that are rooted. in environmental adaptation converge at fine spatial scales where natural environments have strong spatial structure. The structure of the environment at fine spatial scales may foster the persistence of dispersal-limited plants in the community; neighboring environments are likely to be similar, and thus suitable for propagules dispersing short distances. While patterns of fern distribution in this locality are not consistent with purely neutral or random models of species coexistence, alternative models that rely on strict niche requirements without accounting for dispersal effects and the inherent spatial structure of the environment are inadequate because they neglect the important interaction of these factors. This outcome supports the relevance of developing theory that considers the joint effects of environmental determinism and dispersal on the distribution and abundance of plant species.

AB To investigate the effect of inorganic fertilizer and composted manure amendments on the N isotope composition (delta(15)N) of crop and soil, maize (Zea mays L.) was cultivated under greenhouse conditions for 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 days. Composted pig manure (delta(15)N = + 13.9parts per thousand) and urea (-2.3parts per thousand) were applied at 0 and 0 kg N ha(-1) (C0U0), 0 and 150 kg N ha(-1) (C0U2), 150 and 0 kg N ha(-1) (C2U0), and 75 and 75 kg N ha(-1) (C1U1), respectively. The delta(15)N of total soil-N was not affected by both amendments, but delta(15)N of NH4+ and NO3- provided some information on the N isotope fractionation in soil. During the early growth stage, significant differences (P < 0.05) in delta N-15 among maize subjected to different treatments were observed. After 30 days of growth, the delta N-15 values of maize were +6.6 parts per thousand for C0U0, +1.1% for C0U2, +7.7% for C2U0, and +4.5 parts per thousand for C1U1. However, effects of urea and composted manure application on maize delta N-15 progressively decreased with increasing growth period, probably due to isotope fractionation accompanying N losses and increased uptake of soil-derived N by maize. After 70 days of growth, delta N-15 of leaves and grains of maize amended with composted pig manure were significantly (P <0.05) higher than those with urea. The temporal variations in delta(15)N of maize amended with urea and composted manure indicate that plant delta(15)N is generally not a good tracer for N sources applied to field. Our data can be used in validation of delta(15)N fractionation models in relation to N source inputs.

AB The United Nations framework convention on climate change (FCCC) commits signatory nations to monitor changes in all fluxes and sinks of carbon, including those related to vegetation and soil. This paper describes a system for monitoring carbon in New Zealand's forests and shrublands (6.3 and 2.6 million ha. respectively), which was tested on a 60 km-wide transect across the South Island. A 9 km(2) grid was superimposed onto a land-cover map (SPOT imagery) to obtain 62 ground-sampling points. New permanent plots were established at 43 of these points and 18 existing plots were revisited (one site was inaccessible). On each plot, the dimensions of all trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris (CWD) were measured, and these measurements converted to per-hectare C-stocks using regression relationships. C-stocks in fine litter and mineral soil were quantified using data from New Zealand's national soil-C monitoring system that quantifies national-scale soil-C stocks using a soil-C database stratified by soil type. climate, and land-cover; we used these data to derive values for the transect.
   The total C-stock in all pools was 290 t/ha in forests and 163 t/ha in shrublands, 58 and 30% of which was living biomass (respectively). The living biomass components had the greatest variances, so precision could be improved by increasing the sample size of trees, particularly large trees. The C-stock of CWD was highly variable among plots, but was a relatively small component of the total C-stock (10% forest and 3% shrubland). For the moment, we know little about the uncertainty associated with measuring C-sequestration (i.e. change in C-stocks over time), but this information will become available when plots are resampled.
   Our network of permanent plots is designed deliberately to be simple and measurements of interest to conservation biologists, such as species composition and structure are included in the hope of protecting it against inevitable shifts in policy and focus. We discuss methodological issues including generalized allometric relationship, the propagation of errors, and better integration of remote-sensing and ground-based approaches, all of which have been considered in the development of this system.

AB Phalaris arundinacea (Poaceae) is aggressively invading wetlands across North America. We tested the hypotheses that open canopies and increased nutrients facilitate vegetative establishment in the field, using a phytometer (6 rhizome fragments/plot. 24 plots/wetland). In each of three wetlands, phytometers received three levels of an NPK fertilizer or served as controls. Emergence and survival differed among sites (P=0.0005), but not due to NPK addition. P. arundinacea survival was highest in a wet prairie with a late-developing canopy, but limited by prolonged flooding in one sedge meadow and by an early-growing, dense plant canopy in a second. These patterns were explained in greenhouse experiments, where both flooding (P<0.0001) and heavy shade (P=0.0002) decreased P. arundinacea aboveground biomass by up to 73% and 97%. respectively. Rhizome fragment survival was reduced by 30% under flooded conditions and 25% under heavy shade. We then tested the hypothesis that a clonal subsidy facilitates vegetative expansion into heavy shade. Established clones were allowed access to bare soil under four levels of shade and two levels of NPK fertilizer in a two-factor greenhouse experiment. Young ramets attached to parent clones readily grew into heavy shade, and the high nutrient treatment increased aboveground growth (P<0.0001) and distance of ramet spread (P=0.0051) by nearly 50%. Under low nutrient conditions. root biomass increased by 30% (P<0.0001). P. arundinacea's rapid expansion into a variety of wetland types is likely a function of clonal subsidy, morphological plasticity, and nutrient availability: young ramets that emerge under shaded conditions are supported by parental subsidies; where nutrients are plentiful. P. arundinacea can maximize aboveground growth to capture more light; and where nutrients are scarce. it can increase belowground foraging.

AB Terrestrial food webs based on living plants may well represent 75% of global terrestrial biodiversity. The majority of component species are specialists and a large proportion is parasitic as herbivores and carnivores, with consequences for high sensitivity to heterogeneity on a variety of scales. Relatively large primary producers support relatively small insect herbivores and carnivores, with plants providing both food and habitat, making resource-driven effects very strong. Complexity of resources provided by plants, with influences up the food web, is generated by at least seven major factors: (i) plants as food; (ii) plants as habitat; (iii) the physical traits of plants such as size, toughness and trichomes; (iv) traits of plants that require evolutionary responses by herbivores in terms of crypsis, phenological synchrony, life history and behavioral adaptations; (v) the constitutive chemicals in plants; (vi) the induced changes in plants caused by herbivory; and (vii) landscape and biogeographic variation in vegetation types and food web richness. No other trophic level has such a wide-ranging impact on other trophic levels. But such broad impact makes the term 'food web' overly narrow and inadequate. The term 'interaction web' is preferable, aiding recognition of the many kinds of interactions that pass up food webs from living plants. Any claim that top-down impact is stronger than bottom-up influences is necessarily couched in a narrow sense of biomass or numbers reduction.

AB Individual-based models (IBMs) have long been proposed as a key tool for understanding and predicting ecosystem complexities, yet the contribution of this approach to basic or applied ecology has been less than anticipated. Fundamental reasons for the disappointing contribution of IBMs have been, in the current absence of a theoretical foundation for IBMs, conceptual flaws in model formulation and the failure to address critical computer implementation issues. Researchers in the new field of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) study how complex behaviors emerge in systems of relatively simple interacting individuals. Research on GAS, while still new and informal, has identified key concepts for making individual-based systems realistic. I propose that explicit consideration of the following concepts from CAS should make the design of IBMs less ad hoc and more likely to produce models of value for basic and applied ecology: (1) Emergence: what behaviors and population dynamics should emerge from the model's mechanistic representation of key processes vs. being imposed on the model as empirical relations? How should individual traits be modeled so that realistic population responses emerge?; (2) Adaptation: given the model's temporal and spatial scales, what adaptive processes of individuals should be modeled? What mechanisms do individuals use to adapt in response to what environmental forces?; (3) Fitness and strategy: what measures of fitness are appropriate to use as the basis for modelling decision making? Should fitness measures change with life history state?; (4) State-based responses: how should decision processes depend on an individual's state?; (5) Prediction: anticipating decision outcomes appears essential for modelling many behaviors; what are realistic assumptions about how organisms predict the consequences of decisions?; (6) Computer implementation: what user interfaces are necessary to make the model, and especially individual behaviors, observable and testable? How will the model's full design and computer implementation be documented and tested so results are reproducible and valid? (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For two years, we measured soil moisture, pH, salinity, and ion concentrations bimonthly from 55 vegetation plots in six Mediterranean salt marshes of SE Spain. Edaphic characteristics during dry and wet seasons were compared within six selected plant communities. The dominant species in each of these communities were Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum, Limonium sp, Sarcocornia fruticosa, Halocnemum strobilaceum, and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. Although soil salt concentrations were lower during the wet season, different patterns of temporal variation in total dissolved salts, sodium adsorption ratio, Cl-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were observed in the soils occupied by different plant communities. The variation patterns for SO42- were the same in all plant communities. The Ca2+/Mg2+, Ca2+/Na+, and SO42-/Cl- ratios increased during the wet season because of the more pronounced decrease in Cl-, Na+, and Mg2+ concentrations relative to Ca2+, and SO42-. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) related the species distribution with certain soil conditions. The edaphic variables that best explained the data were maximum soil moisture, mean K+/Na+ ratio, mean Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio, maximum pH, and maximum K+. Two different environments were identified: dry salt marsh and wet salt marsh. To examine soil ionic gradients in these two environments, two further CCA were applied. The variables that best explained soil-vegetation relationships in the dry salt marsh were mean K+/Na+ ratio, mean Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio, maximum K+, and minimum Ca2+/Na+ ratio. Some representative dry salt marsh species were Lygeum spartum, Atriplex glauca, Suaeda vera, and Frankenia corymbosa. The variables explaining the data set in the wet salt marsh were maximum sodium adsorption ratio, maximum Mg2+ content, mean Ca2+ content, and mean Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio. Species such as Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Sarcoconia fruticosa, Juncus maritimus, and Tamarin boveana were representative of this environment.

AB Seedlings and old trees of Scots pine in self-regenerating, old, virgin boreal forest in northern Sweden were compared in terms of the species composition of their associated ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. The natural regeneration of seedlings was mimicked by annual seeding for 10 yr (1986-1995) in intact field vegetation at three sites. In 1995, all seedlings were harvested, and 171 were examined for mycorrhizas. Twenty-five soil cores were taken in order to study the mycorrhizas on the established trees. Most short roots were mycorrhizal. Using mycorrhizal morphology and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) analysis, we were able to distinguish 43 ectomycorrhizal taxa. Fourteen of these taxa were identified using a sporocarp and mycelial culture based internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-RFLP reference database, and another three were identified by mycorrhizal morphology. Cenococcum geophilum, Piloderma croceum and Suillus variegatus were present on the seedlings, irrespective of age, as well as on the old trees. Al one forest, 23 ectomycorrhizal taxa were found as mycorrhizas, of which 10 occurred on both seedlings and old trees. These 10 species accounted for 92 and 73% of the mycorrhizas on the seedlings and old trees, respectively. A 3-yr survey of ectomycorrhizal sporocarps at the same site revealed 62 EM taxa. The degree of similarity between the composition of EM species reflected by sporocarps and by mycorrhizas, was low. Ectomycorrhizal species present in our ITS-RFLP database constituted 7.5-19% of the mycorrhizas on seedlings and old trees, whereas they constituted 80-95% of the total production of epigeous sporocarps. The unidentified taxa comprised 70-87% of the mycorrhizas. Our findings support the view that the species composition of mycorrhizas colonizing naturally regenerated seedlings in forests is similar to that of mycorrhizas colonizing surrounding trees. We suggest that the concept of the mycelial network be expanded in order to embrace both the significance of interconnections between different trees as well as the continuity or perpetuation of EM fungal communities.

TI Effects on population persistence: the interaction between environmental

ID SINGLE-SPECIES POPULATIONS; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; EXTINCTION;
   METAPOPULATIONS; STOCHASTICITY; ECOLOGY; BLUE
AB It is accepted that accurate estimation of risk of population extinction, or persistence time, requires prediction of the effect of fluctuations in the environment on population dynamics. Generally, the greater the magnitude, or variance, of environmental stochasticity, the greater the risk of population extinction. Another characteristic of environmental stochasticity, its colour, has been found to affect population persistence. This is important because real environmental variables, such as temperature, are reddened or positively temporally autocorrelated. However, recent work has disagreed about the effect of reddening environmental stochasticity. Ripa & Lundberg (1996) found increasing temporal autocorrelation (reddening) decreased the risk of extinction, whereas a simple and powerful intuitive argument (Lawton 1988) predicts increased risk of extinction with reddening. This study resolves the apparent contradiction, in two ways, first, by altering the dynamic behaviour of the population models. Overcompensatory dynamics result in persistence times increasing with increased temporal autocorrelation; undercompensatory dynamics result in persistence times decreasing with increased temporal autocorrelation. Secondly, in a spatially subdivided population, with a reasonable degree of spatial heterogeneity in patch quality, increasing temporal autocorrelation in the environment results in decreasing persistence time for both types of competition. Thus, the inclusion of coloured noise into ecological models can have subtle interactions with population dynamics.

AB The flight capacity of Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) was measured in the laboratory by using computer-linked flight mills. Codling moths showed a large variation in flight capacity between individuals. We defined arbitrarily a longest single flight (LSF) of more than 5 km as an index for long-flyers. About 16.7% of virgin and 10.0% of mated males and 20.0% of virgin and 7.4% of mated females undertook such flights. Based on the LSF and the total distance flown (TDF) we concluded that males and females have little or no difference in flight capacity and that both the within- and between-habitat flights are similar in number and magnitude for both sexes. In the field, females are therefore potentially able to undertake flights of up to 11 km, as reported for males by other authors. This ability was highest at ages of 2-7 days after emergence, i.e. the first third of their lifetime, for virgin and mated male moths and for virgin female moths. Mated females showed peak flight capacity between 1 and 3 days after eclosion, which corresponded with the major egg-laying period. Few long flights were undertaken before oviposition. These findings do not agree with the oogenesis flight syndrome described by other authors, and this theory is believed not to apply to C.pomonella. Our laboratory results are discussed in relation to field experiments in general and hypotheses are developed about the significance of long-flyers for this species.

AB Increased predation has been suggested as a proximate factor causing the decline of vertebrate diversity in many human-altered landscapes. Previous studies on this topic have provided conflicting results, perhaps as a consequence of the limited spatial scale used in these investigations. We incorporated a multiscaled approach (using site, plot (1.44 km(2)), and landscape (54 km(2))) to investigate the distribution of activity of medium-sized carnivores relative to habitat edges and the numeric responses of these predators to habitat diversity. Among the taxa surveyed, raccoons (Procyon lotor) did not show an affinity for habitat edges at any spatial scale. However, raccoons were more abundant in landscapes characterized by a diversity of cover types. Free-ranging domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis domesticus) did not respond to the proximity of habitat edges in summer but showed a strong affinity for edge habitats (especially those associated with human dwellings) during winter. Wild canids (Vulpes vulpes and Canis latrans) also selected sites in close proximity to edges in winter and were more abundant in diverse landscapes. Although human-dominated habitats (agricultural areas, grass-brushland, and developed sites) represented only 7-27% of the three landscapes studied, populations of generalist predators (raccoons and wild canids) increased as landscapes became more diverse. As a result, even moderate levels of habitat fragmentation may elevate predation rates and subsequently alter the composition of prey communities.

AB GCM-based scenarios of anthropogenic global climate change are used for the assessment of potential changes in areas vulnerable to malaria and schistosomiasis transmission. The study shows that the transmission potential of both vector-borne diseases is very sensitive to climate changes on the periphery of the present endemic areas and at higher altitudes within these areas. The health impact will be most pronounced in populations living in the less economically developed temperate areas in which endemicity is low or absent.

AB Edge habitats may be considered 'ecological traps' for breeding birds if they attract many birds because of apparently favorable nesting conditions but have higher nest predation levels than interior habitats, Four alternative, nonexclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain why edges might have higher predation levels than interior habitats: (1) predator activity is higher in areas with higher prey density (density-dependent predation), (2) predators are more abundant on edges than in forest interior, (3) the predator community is richer in species on edges than in forest interior; and (4) predators forage along travel lanes (linear geographical features) such as edges. Here we evaluated whether forest-farm edges in southern Illinois ave ecological traps, and examined the relevance of these four hypotheses at our study sire with several different experiments during May-July 1992 using artificial nests (n = 605) bailed with quail eggs and placed on the ground, in shrubs, or in saplings.
   Our results showed that, in general, the forest-farm edges of southwestern Illinois did not attract significantly more individuals or species of nesting songbirds, but they did have higher nest predation levels than forest interior sites, primarily as a result of higher predation levels on sapling nests. We did not find evidence strongly supporting any of the four hypotheses suggested as explanations for higher nest predation levels near edges. Two data sets showed that predation levels on artificial nests were density-independent. Forest-farm edges had neither more total species of potential nest predators nor more individual predators. However, there were more species of avian predators on edges than in interior sites. Correlations between predator abundance and nest predation levels on individual transects were weak. The travel lane hypothesis was not supported because nest predation levels were either not affected by distance from linear geographical features (roads and ravines) or were significantly less when close to than when far from presumptive travel lanes.
   High spatial heterogeneity in predation levels, numbers of singing birds, and potential nest predators may have obscured general patterns and suggest a need for larger sample sizes. Edges may be detrimental to some species of singing birds but nor to others, and for different reasons.

AB Bioenergetic models of growth endeavor to integrate food-processing transactions with energy expenditures imposed by abiotic and biotic factors. Some components of these models have lagged behind others in the synthesis of new information. A case in point is heat increment, a measure of metabolic work primarily for the postabsorptive processes that follow the ingestion of food. Importantly, the energy requirements for grasping, chewing, and swallowing food are technically distinct from those for heat increment but are experimentally difficult to separate from them. In order to take special account of these mechanical aspects, we suggest modifying the term "heat increment" (also known as specific dynamic action) to the less-precise "apparent heat increment." Bioenergetic models ivariably incorporate the assumption that apparent heat increment, relative to food intake, is independent of other variables. Laboratory studies have revealed that apparent heat increment is not always a fixed proportion of gross energy intake. Values reported range from 3 to 41% for fish fed natural diets and from 11 to 29% for those given formulated diets. Generally, apparent heat increment increases with meal size and body weight, but declines with body weight when food intake is fixed. Apparent heat increment increases with temperature. It is related to the proportion of dietary protein either directly or in an asymptotic manner. In some cases, increases in dietary lipid reduce apparent heat increment by reducing protein catabolism. In most modeling situations, consequently, the practice of adopting a fixed value for apparent heat increment relative to ingested or digestible energy leads to spurious outputs. We recommend that creators of future bioenergetic models consider the findings reviewed in this article.

AB New information on the lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and fipronil on organisms is presented in this review, complementing the previous Worldwide Integrated Assessment (WIA) in 2015. The high toxicity of these systemic insecticides to invertebrates has been confirmed and expanded to include more species and compounds. Most of the recent research has focused on bees and the sublethal and ecological impacts these insecticides have on pollinators. Toxic effects on other invertebrate taxa also covered predatory and parasitoid natural enemies and aquatic arthropods. Little new information has been gathered on soil organisms. The impact on marine and coastal ecosystems is still largely uncharted. The chronic lethality of neonicotinoids to insects and crustaceans, and the strengthened evidence that these chemicals also impair the immune system and reproduction, highlights the dangers of this particular insecticidal class (neonicotinoids and fipronil), with the potential to greatly decrease populations of arthropods in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Sublethal effects on fish, reptiles, frogs, birds, and mammals are also reported, showing a better understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity of these insecticides in vertebrates and their deleterious impacts on growth, reproduction, and neurobehaviour of most of the species tested. This review concludes with a summary of impacts on the ecosystem services and functioning, particularly on pollination, soil biota, and aquatic invertebrate communities, thus reinforcing the previous WIA conclusions (van der Sluijs et al. 2015).

AB Mountains are hotspots of biodiversity. Yet, evaluating their importance in global biodiversity inventories requires the adoption of a pertinent definition of mountains. Here, we first compare the well-established WCMC and GMBA definitions, which both use geographical information systems. We show that the WCMC approach arrives at twice the global mountain area and much higher human population numbers than the GMBA one, which is explained by the inclusion of (mostly) low latitude hill country below 600 m elevation. We then present an inventory of the world's mountains based on the GMBA definition. In this inventory, each of the 1003 entries corresponds to a polygon drawn around a mountain or a mountain range and includes the name of the delineated object, the area of mountainous terrain it covers stratified into different bioclimatic belts (all at 2.5' resolution), and demographic information. Taken together, the 1003 polygons cover 13.8 Mio km(2) of mountain terrain, of which 3.3 Mio km(2) are in the alpine and nival belts. This corresponds to 83.7% of the global mountain area sensu GMBA, and 94% of the alpine/nival area. The 386 Mio people inhabiting mountainous terrain within polygons represent 75% of the people globally inhabiting mountains sensu GMBA. This inventory offers a robust framework for the integration of mountain biota in regional and larger scale biodiversity assessments, for biogeography, bioclimatology, macroecology, and conservation research, and for the exploration of a multitude of socio-ecological and climate change-related research questions in mountain biota, including the potential pressure on alpine ecosystems.

AB Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) is of great importance to global change research and also food and fuel security. Previous studies have demonstrated that values of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from hyperspectral data provide a direct measure of ecosystem GPP. However, global analysis of the relationship between satellite SIF and model-based GPP indicates that the relationship between the two parameters is highly dependent on the plant functional type (PFT). The overarching goal of this study is to examine the potential of far-red SIF retrieved at 760nm (SIF760) to track the diurnal variations in GPP for C3 and C4 crops, and to investigate whether the GPP SIF relationship is dependent on the type of photosynthesis. GPP values are estimated from flux tower records and daily SIF760 data are derived from ground-based spectral measurements. The results show that GPP and SIF760 have similar diurnal patterns and are linearly correlated for C3 and C4 crops. However, the ratio of epsilon(P) to epsilon(F) (the slope of the linear SIF-based GPP model, GPP= epsilon(P)/epsilon(F) x SIF) for C3 wheat is about 46% of that for C4 maize. The findings from the diurnal variation experiments imply that theeF is weakly sensitive to the photosynthetic pathway type (PsP type) and that the large difference in sp between C3 and C4 crops leads to the difference in the slopes. Our studies confirm the capability of the remotely sensed SIF signals to act as a direct proxy for GPP and suggest that the PsP type should be considered when trying to accurately quantify the ecosystem productivity using the straightforward empirical approach.

AB Global change has made it important to understand the factors that shape species' distributions. Central to this area of research is the question of whether species' range limits primarily reflect the distribution of suitable habitat (i.e. niche limits) or arise as a result of dispersal limitation. Over-the-edge transplant experiments and ecological niche models are commonly used to address this question, yet few studies have taken advantage of a combined approach for inferring the causes of range limits. Here, we synthesise results from existing transplant experiments with new information on the predicted suitability of sites based on niche models. We found that individual performance and habitat suitability independently decline beyond range limits across multiple species. Furthermore, inferences from transplant experiments and niche models were generally concordant within species, with 31 out of 40 cases fully supporting the hypothesis that range limits are niche limits. These results suggest that range limits are often niche limits and that the factors constraining species' ranges operate at scales detectable by both transplant experiments and niche models. In light of these findings, we outline an integrative framework for addressing the causes of range limits in individual species.

AB Conflicts between biodiversity conservation and other human activities are intensifying as a result of growing pressure on natural resources and concomitant demands by some for greater conservation. Approaches to reducing conflicts are increasingly focusing on engaging stakeholders in processes that are perceived as fair, i.e. independent and where stakeholders have influence, and which in turn can generate trust between stakeholders. Hitherto, there has been limited empirical research supporting the claim that conservation conflicts can be reduced by building trust through fair participation. Using quantitative and qualitative empirical data from three case studies, we analysed whether fair participation processes were directly related to conflict resolution and if this relationship was mediated by trust. Our research provided empirical quantitative evidence that increased trust through fair processes makes conflict resolution more likely. The qualitative analysis revealed caveats to this finding, including the different understandings of the definition of conflict by stakeholders, the complex nature of trust in conservation conflicts where most stakeholders have high levels of ecological knowledge, and the atypical nature (i.e. presence of a local champion) of one of the case studies. Building and maintaining trust with landowners and managers may be central to conserving biodiversity. Such trust-building requires effort and resources, opportunities for appropriate dialogue between stakeholders and a willingness to share power in terms of knowledge and policy implementation, especially when local stakeholders are dependent on and knowledgeable about natural resources.

AB Using statistical data from 285 cities in China, this paper studies the spatial correlation and interaction between manufacturing agglomeration and environmental pollution. Using a widely used spatial correlation index, bivariate Moran's 1, we first estimate the spatial correlation between manufacturing agglomeration and environmental pollution. We show that there is significant spatial correlation between them, and distinct patterns of local spatial concentration are identified. Then, we use a spatial simultaneous equations (SSE) model to analyze the interaction between manufacturing agglomeration and environmental pollution. We show that manufacturing agglomeration aggravates environmental pollution, while environmental pollution restrains manufacturing agglomeration. In addition, manufacturing agglomeration and environmental pollution in any one city can be affected by manufacturing agglomeration and environmental pollution in surrounding cities through spatial spillover. Finally, we put forward specific suggestions based on the conclusions for more sustainable development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The composition of the gut microbiota has recently been associated with health and disease, particularly with obesity. Some studies suggested a higher proportion of Firmicutes and a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes in obese compared to lean people; others found discordant patterns. Most studies, however, focused on Americans or Europeans, giving a limited picture of the gut microbiome. To determine the generality of previous observations and expand our knowledge of the human gut microbiota, it is important to replicate studies in overlooked populations. Thus, we describe here, for the first time, the gut microbiota of Colombian adults via the pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), comparing it with results obtained in Americans, Europeans, Japanese and South Koreans, and testing the generality of previous observations concerning changes in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes with increasing body mass index (BMI).
   Results: We found that the composition of the gut microbiota of Colombians was significantly different from that of Americans, Europeans and Asians. The geographic origin of the population explained more variance in the composition of this bacterial community than BMI or gender. Concerning changes in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes with obesity, in Colombians we found a tendency in Firmicutes to diminish with increasing BMI, whereas no change was observed in Bacteroidetes. A similar result was found in Americans. A more detailed inspection of the Colombian dataset revealed that five fiber-degrading bacteria, including Akkermansia, Dialister, Oscillospira, Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiales, became less abundant in obese subjects.
   Conclusion: We contributed data from unstudied Colombians that showed that the geographic origin of the studied population had a greater impact on the composition of the gut microbiota than BMI or gender. Any strategy aiming to modulate or control obesity via manipulation of this bacterial community should consider this effect.

AB Predicting whether a predator is capable of affecting the dynamics of a prey species in the field implies the analysis of the complete diet of the predator, not simply rates of predation on a target taxon. Here, we employed the Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing technology to investigate the diet of a generalist arthropod predator. A complete dietary analysis requires the use of general primers, but these will also amplify the predator unless suppressed using a blocking probe. However, blocking probes can potentially block other species, particularly if they are phylogenetically close. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that enough prey sequence could be obtained without blocking probes. In communities with many predators, this approach obviates the need to design and test numerous blocking primers, thus making analysis of complex community food webs a viable proposition. We applied this approach to the analysis of predation by the linyphiid spider Oedothorax fuscus in an arable field. We obtained over two million raw reads. After discarding the low-quality and predator reads, the libraries still contained over 61000 prey reads (3% of the raw reads; 6% of reads passing quality control). The libraries were rich in Collembola, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Nematoda. They also contained sequences derived from several spider species and from horticultural pests (aphids). Oedothorax fuscus is common in UK cereal fields, and the results showed that it is exploiting a wide range of prey. Next-generation sequencing using general primers but without blocking probes provided ample sequences for analysis of the prey range of this spider and proved to be a simple and inexpensive approach.

AB The spatial scale at which organisms respond to human activity can affect both ecological function and conservation planning. Yet little is known regarding the spatial scale at which distinct behaviors related to reproduction and survival are impacted by human interference. Here we provide a novel approach to estimating the spatial scale at which a top predator, the puma (Puma concolor), responds to human development when it is moving, feeding, communicating, and denning. We find that reproductive behaviors (communication and denning) require at least a 4 x larger buffer from human development than non-reproductive behaviors (movement and feeding). In addition, pumas give a wider berth to types of human development that provide a more consistent source of human interference (neighborhoods) than they do to those in which human presence is more intermittent (arterial roads with speeds >35 mph). Neighborhoods were a deterrent to pumas regardless of behavior, while arterial roads only deterred pumas when they were communicating and denning. Female pumas were less deterred by human development than males, but they showed larger variation in their responses overall. Our behaviorally explicit approach to modeling animal response to human activity can be used as a novel tool to assess habitat quality, identify wildlife corridors, and mitigate human-wildlife conflict.

AB Combining photovoltaic panels (PVPs) and crops on the same land unit were recently proposed as an alternative to the conversion of cropland into photovoltaic plants. This could alleviate the increasing competition for land between food and energy production. In such agrivoltaic systems, an upper layer of PVPs partially shades crops at ground level. The aim of this work was to (i) assess the effect on crop yield of two PVPs densities, resulting in two shade levels equal to 50% and 70% of the incoming radiation and (ii) identify morphological and physiological determinants of the plant response to shade. Experiments were conducted on four varieties of lettuces (two crisphead lettuces and two cutting lettuces), during two seasons. In all cases, the relative lettuce yield at harvest was equal or higher than the available relative radiation. Lettuce yield was maintained through an improved Radiation Interception Efficiency (RIE) in the shade, while Radiation Conversion Efficiency (RCE) did not change significantly. Enhanced RIE was explained by (i) an increase in the total leaf area per plant, despite a decrease in the number of leaves and (ii) a different distribution of leaf area among the pool of leaves, the maximal size of leaves increasing in the shade. Our result provides a framework for the selection of adapted varieties according to their morphological traits and physiological responses to PVP shade, in order to optimize agrivoltaic systems.

AB This study defines criteria for the use of benthic foraminifera (protists) as a quick and efficient biomonitoring tool to implement marine legislation. Various sampling and preparation procedures are investigated in an attempt to find the optimal methodology for environmental monitoring using soft-sediment foraminifera with the objective of assessing ecological quality status (EcoQS). Twenty-seven sampling stations in silled basins along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast, NE North Sea, are investigated for environmental parameters and living (stained, including soft-shelled forms) and dead benthic foraminifera. Diversity, expressed as the effective number of species (exp H'(bc)) and community composition are used to evaluate EcoQS using living (stained) benthic foraminifera. Correlation studies show that bottom-water dissolved oxygen concentration at the time of sampling ([O-2](tos)) is the main environmental factor controlling variation in diversity. Variables such as grain size, C/N, TOC and TN are less important. Correlation between foraminiferal diversity and [O-2](tos), as well as correlation between community data and [O-2](tos), suggest that benthic foraminifera represent an efficient bio-monitoring tool to evaluate EcoQS. A clear pattern from "bad" to "high" EcoQS is established using the strong link between the benthic foraminiferal diversity and the bottom-water oxygen gradient. The study shows that EcoQS can be evaluated quickly and accurately using the following method: sample the top 1 cm of sediment, dry-pick about 250 living (stained) individuals of >125 mu m-sized fossilisable (i.e. most of those remaining subsequent to drying) foraminifera from each of three replicates. exp(H'(bc)) based on living benthic foraminifera is a promising tool to assess EcoQS. For fossil assemblages, exp(H'(bc)) has potential for evaluating temporal changes in in situ PaleoEcoQS and for defining reference conditions from pre-impacted times. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Plant species composition and community functional structure (i.e. trait composition at the community level) result from a hierarchy of environmental filters that constrain which species and traits tend to be dominant in a given habitat. We quantified variation in community functional structure along natural gradients of soil resources using several above- and below-ground parameters and explored links among these attributes to determine whether plant resource economics can be applied at the community level in a Mediterranean rangeland of southern France. Limitation by nitrogen, soil water and soil depth were the main ecological factors driving the functional response at the community level. Most of the community functional parameters considered in this study were more dependent on nitrogen limitation than on the other two factors, mostly related with the acquisitionconservation trade-off at both the leaf and the root level. We found a strong coordination between above-ground and below-ground components, with a high level of concordance along the resource gradients explored. As an example, tissue dry matter content both in leaves and roots was positively related to nitrogen limitation. These findings indicate that the leaf economic spectrum paradigm (resource conservation in resource-poor habitats versus resource acquisition in resource-rich habitats) can be extrapolated to the below-ground component and extends to a plant community spectrum. Changes in the functional structure of communities were promoted by two complementary components of variation: (i) the replacement of species with highly contrasting resource-use strategies and, to a lesser extent, (ii) the intraspecific variation in several above-ground traits. Synthesis. This study showed that soil water and nutrient limitations are the main drivers controlling functional community structure in the Mediterranean rangelands studied and that shifts in this structure were mainly due to species turnover. In addition, we provided evidence for a plant community economics spectrum, based on a strong coordination between above- and below-ground components in these resource-limited communities.

AB Gene-expression divergence between species shapes morphological evolution, but the molecular basis is largely unknown. Here we show cis- and trans-regulatory elements and chromatin modifications on gene-expression diversity in genetically tractable Arabidopsis allotetraploids. In Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, both cis and trans with predominant cis-regulatory effects mediate gene-expression divergence. The majority of genes with both cis- and trans-effects are subjected to compensating interactions and stabilizing selection. Interestingly, cis- and trans-regulation is associated with chromatin modifications. In F1 allotetraploids, Arabidopsis arenosa trans factors predominately affect allelic expression divergence. Arabidopsis arenosa trans factors tend to upregulate Arabidopsis thaliana alleles, whereas Arabidopsis thaliana trans factors up- or down-regulate Arabidopsis arenosa alleles. In resynthesized and natural allotetraploids, trans effects drive expression of both homoeologous loci into the same direction. We provide evidence for natural selection and chromatin regulation in shaping gene-expression diversity during plant evolution and speciation.

AB Extinction risk is inversely associated with maximum per capita population growth rate (r(max)). However, this parameter is not known for most threatened species, underscoring the value in identifying correlates of r(max) that, in the absence of demographic data, would indirectly allow one to identify species and populations at elevated risk of extinction and their associated recovery potential. We undertook a comparative life-history analysis of 199 species from three taxonomic classes: Chondrichthyes (e. g., sharks; n = 82), Actinopterygii (teleost or bony fishes; n 47), and Mammalia (n 70, including 16 marine species). Median r(max) was highest for (and similar between) terrestrial mammals (0.71) and teleosts (0.43), significantly lower among chondrichthyans (0.26), and lower still in marine mammals (0.07). Age at maturity was the primary (and negative) correlate of r(max). In contrast, although body size was negatively correlated with r(max) in chondrichthyans and mammals, evidence of an association in teleosts was equivocal, and fecundity was not related to r(max) in fishes, despite recurring assertions to the contrary. Our analyses suggest that age at maturity can serve as a universal predictor of extinction risk in fishes and mammals when r(max) itself is unknown. Moreover, in contrast to what is generally expected, the recovery potential of teleost fishes does not differ from that of terrestrial mammals. Our findings are supportive of the application of extinction-risk criteria that are based on generation time and that are independent of taxonomic affinity.

AB This study investigates the distribution of modern pollen assemblages in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, based on surface soil samples collected at 1202 sites along an altitudinal gradient of 10 -5500 m asl, where mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 12 to 1840 mm and mean annual temperature (MAT) from -7 to 21.5 degrees C. A total of 153 pollen taxa were found with relative abundances greater than 1% in at least two samples. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine the main environmental variables influencing pollen distributions. The results reveal that MAP is the most significant dominant variable. However, MAT, altitude (ALT), July temperature (MT7), and relative humidity (HHH) are also significant variables that clearly follow the gradients in the CCA ordination, suggesting that pollen assemblages probably not only reflect a single climatic parameter, but also a variety of other climatic inter-related parameters.
   Transfer functions, based on locally weighted weighted averaging (LWWA), were developed for MAP (R-2-boot = 0.89, RMSEP = 109 mm), MAT (R-2-boot = 0.78, RMSEP = 2.3 degrees C), ALT (R-2-boot = 0.73, RMSEP = 597 m), HHH (R-2-boot = 0.82, RMSEP = 4.5%), and July mean precipitation (MP7) (R-2-boot = 0.87, RMSEP = 23 mm). Overall, our results confirm that pollen can provide reliable estimates of the primary climatic parameters. The application of the LWWA model to the fossil records of Chen Co Lake allowed quantitative inferences to be made about Holocene climatic changes in the southern Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that LWWA is a robust calibration method for quantitative palaeo-environmental reconstruction based on pollen data in the regions.

AB The importance of different functional traits of macrobenthos in benthic processes of the Southern Bight of the North Sea was investigated to estimate the effects of density declines and species loss on benthic ecosystem functioning. Two laboratory experiments were performed: before (winter, temperature = 10 degrees C) and after (summer, temperature = 18 degrees C) sedimentation of the spring phytoplankton bloom. Single species treatments of key species (Abra alba, Lanice conchilega and Nephtys sp.) with different functional traits were added to microcosms at 3 density levels (natural, lower, lowest) to account for possible density declines. Sediment-water exchanges of oxygen and nutrients, denitrification and bioturbation were measured. In absence of fauna, benthic mineralisation in the summer experiment was 2.0 times higher than in winter. Fauna stimulated microbial respiration more in summer (up to 100% in L, conchilega treatments) than in winter (negligible fauna effect). As chlorophyll a concentrations were similar in both seasons, the stronger fluxes in summer must be explained by a higher macrobenthic activity owing to the elevated temperature and better condition of the animals. Stimulation of mineralisation by the 3 species in the microcosms was different, and behaviour-related. Owing to its irrigation activity, the tube dweller L. conchilega had more pronounced influences on benthic respiration, nutrient release and denitrification than did the biodiffusers, A. alba and Nephtys sp. A. alba appeared to be a more effective bioturbator than Nephtys sp. Processes such as benthic respiration, nutrient fluxes, denitrification and bioturbation seem to be related to animal densities and therefore decreases in densities can possibly have implications for ecosystem functioning.

AB P>Adaptive trait introgression is increasingly recognized as common. However, it is unclear whether adaptive genetic exchanges typically affect only a single trait, or instead affect multiple aspects of the phenotype. Here, we examine introgression of abiotic tolerance traits between two hybridizing North American sunflower species, Helianthus annuus and Helianthus debilis.
   In two common gardens in the hybrid range, we measured 10 ecophysiological, phenological, and architectural traits for parents and their natural and artificial hybrids, and examined how fitness covaried with trait values.
   Eight of the 10 traits showed patterns consistent with introgression from H. debilis into H. annuus, and suggested that H. debilis-like traits allowing rapid growth and reproduction before summer heat and drought have been favored in the hybrid range. Natural selection currently favors BC1 hybrids with H. debilis-like branching traits.
   We demonstrate that introgression has altered multiple aspects of the H. annuus phenotype in an adaptive manner, has affected traits relevant to both biotic and abiotic environments, and may have aided expansion of the H. annuus range into central Texas, USA.

AB The study of population genetics of invasive species offers opportunities to investigate rapid evolutionary processes at work, and while the ecology of biological invasions has enjoyed extensive attention in the past, the recentness of molecular techniques makes their application in invasion ecology a fairly new approach. Despite this, molecular biology has already proved powerful in inferring aspects not only relevant to the evolutionary biologist but also to those concerned with invasive species management. Here, we review the different molecular markers routinely used in such studies and their application(s) in addressing different questions in invasion ecology. We then review the current literature on molecular genetic studies aimed at improving management and the understanding of invasive species by resolving of taxonomic issues, elucidating geographical sources of invaders, detecting hybridisation and introgression, tracking dispersal and spread and assessing the importance of genetic diversity in invasion success. Finally, we make some suggestions for future research efforts in molecular ecology of biological invasions.

AB The traditional trophic cascades model is based on consumer - resource interactions at each link in a food chain. However, trophic-level interactions, such as mesocarnivore release resulting from intraguild predation, may also be important mediators of cascades. From September 2001 to August 2004, we used spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in wolf distribution and abundance in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to evaluate whether mesopredator release of coyotes ( Canis latrans), resulting from the extirpation of wolves ( Canis lupus), accounts for high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana) fawns observed in some areas. Results of this ecological perturbation in wolf densities, coyote densities, and pronghorn neonatal survival at wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites support the existence of a species-level trophic cascade. That wolves precipitated a trophic cascade was evidenced by fawn survival rates that were four-fold higher at sites used by wolves. A negative correlation between coyote and wolf densities supports the hypothesis that interspecific interactions between the two species facilitated the difference in fawn survival. Whereas densities of resident coyotes were similar between wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites, the abundance of transient coyotes was significantly lower in areas used by wolves. Thus, differential effects of wolves on solitary coyotes may be an important mechanism by which wolves limit coyote densities. Our results support the hypothesis that mesopredator release of coyotes contributes to high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn fawns, and demonstrate the importance of alternative food web pathways in structuring the dynamics of terrestrial systems.

AB To better understand temporal variations in species diversity and composition, ecological attributes, and environmental influences for the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale community, we studied 50,900 fossil specimens belonging to 158 genera (mostly monospecific and non-biomineralized) representing 17 major taxonomic groups and 17 ecological categories. Fossils were collected in situ from within 26 massive siliciclastic mudstone beds of the Greater Phyllopod Bed (Walcott Quarry - Fossil Ridge). Previous taphonomic studies have demonstrated that each bed represents a single obrution event capturing a predominantly benthic community represented by census- and time-averaged assemblages, preserved within habitat. The Greater Phyllopod Bed (GPB) corresponds to an estimated depositional interval of 10 to 100 KA and thus potentially preserves community patterns in ecological and short-term evolutionary time.
   The community is dominated by epibenthic vagile deposit feeders and sessile suspension feeders, represented primarily by arthropods and sponges. Most species are characterized by low abundance and short stratigraphic range and usually do not recur through the section. It is likely that these are stenotopic forms (i.e., tolerant of a narrow range of habitats, or having a narrow geographical distribution). The few recurrent species tend to be numerically abundant and may represent eurytopic organisms (i.e., tolerant of a wide range of habitats, or having a wide geographical distribution). Rarefaction curves demonstrate variation in species richness through the GPB and suggest that more stenotopic species could still be discovered with additional sampling. Comparisons between richness and evenness trends suggest that the community is relatively stable overall, despite gradual species turnover through time, especially in assemblages from younger beds. Less diverse assemblages with low species evenness possibly represent the onset of less favourable environmental conditions.
   Fossil occurrences in individual beds were analysed using a range of statistical techniques (Correspondence Analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis, Minimum Spanning Tree, Indicator Species Analysis, Mantel Test) to extract community patterns. Results suggest the presence of four fossil assemblages based on distinct species associations. The different assemblages presumably reflect variations in environmental and ecological conditions, some acting through time, leading to species turnover. "Disturbances" (e.g., changes in paleo-redox conditions), differences in substrate firmness, and limited taphonomic biases are probably the main factors contributing to community structure. The influence of ecological factors, however, is also predicted from non-random patterns of species recurrences in successive events. Preliminary comparisons with Lower Cambrian Chengjiang-type assemblages of southern China suggest that the overall structure and ecology of Cambrian communities remained relatively stable until at least the Middle Cambrian in subtidal siliciclastic soft substrate environments.
   Comparisons with modern marine benthic ecosystems further suggest the Burgess Shale community was probably highly dependent on immigration from a regional pool of species after each burial event. This could support the view that species availability, habitat characteristics, and recolonisation processes were more important in structuring the community in the long-term than species interactions or environmental variations at a local scale.

AB Phenotypic plasticity has long been suggested to facilitate biological invasions where a general purpose genotype or 'Jack-of-all-trades' strategy could facilitate invasion should native species be, on average, more specialized. Current understanding of the importance of phenotypic plasticity is limited by methodological difficulties yet glasshouse experiments, paralleling those used in evolutionary biology, are increasingly being used to assess whether invasive species have high phenotypic plasticity or not. Unfortunately, these studies have several major limitations.
   In general, glasshouse experiments have quantified relatively labile means of expressing phenotypes, such as plant biomass, rather than changes in plant development. As some environments favour plant growth and reproduction more than others, simply quantifying allometric or physiological responses relating to differential plant growth may not reveal much about phenotypic plasticity.
   Plasticity is often a comparative rather than an absolute measure. A range of comparators have been used, for example, unrelated natives, congeneric natives, other congeneric aliens or conspecifics from the source region. Thus, unlike many life-history traits used in analyses of invasion, phenotypic plasticity is strongly context-dependent and limits comparison across different studies.
   Phenotypic plasticity is assumed to lead to a greater breadth of environmental conditions across which a species can maintain positive population growth and increase the likelihood of invasiveness. Yet, most studies examine only a partial subset of the full environmental range experienced by the species. If the reaction norm of a target species and its comparator vary independently across an environmental gradient, this partial approach can present different interpretations of phenotypic plasticity.
   Rather than simply quantifying greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive species, research questions should be directed at better understanding its role in the geographic distribution, successful colonization, population persistence and/or high local abundance of invasive species in the introduced range. These issues require integrated measures of plant performance rather than crude differences in individual traits across an environmental gradient. As yet, there is only limited appreciation of the role of phenotypic plasticity in any one of these areas and there is a need to extend studies beyond glasshouse experiments.

AB Avian migration, which involves billions of birds flying vast distances, is known to influence all aspects of avian life. Here we investigate how birds fit moult into an annual cycle determined by the need to migrate. Large variation exists in moulting patterns in relation to migration: for instance, moult can occur after breeding in the summer or after arrival in the wintering quarters. Here we use an optimal annual routine model to investigate why this variation exists. The modelled bird's decisions depend on the time of year, its energy reserves, breeding status, experience, flight feather quality and location. Our results suggest that the temporal and spatial variations in food are an important influence on a migratory bird's annual cycle. Summer moult occurs when food has a high peak on the breeding site in the summer, but it is less seasonal elsewhere. Winter moult occurs if there is a short period of high food availability in summer and a strong winter peak at different locations (i.e. the food is very seasonal but in opposite phase on these areas). This finding might explain why only long-distance migrants have a winter moult.

AB We investigated the uptake of aluminum (Al) and transport to shoots in two inbred maize lines (Zea mays L., VA-22 and A(4/67)) differing in At tolerance. Seedlings were grown for 7 days in hydroponic culture with nutrient solution that contained 0, 240, 360, and 480 mu M Al at pH 4.2. After 7 days of exposure to Al, roots of sensitive maize line (A4/67) plants accumulated 2-2.5 times more At than roots of tolerant line (VA-22) plants. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) showed that the tolerant line retained higher concentrations of Ca2+ , Mg2+, and K+ compared with the sensitive line. In response to At treatment, proline (Pro) concentration increased three-fold in roots of tolerant plants, while a slight increase was observed in roots of sensitive-tine plants. A substantial carbon surplus (two-fold increase) was observed in roots of the At-tolerant maize line. Carbohydrate concentration remained almost unchanged in roots of At-sensitive tine plants. At treatment triggered the enhancement of lipid peroxidation in the sensitive line, while no change in lipid peroxidation level was observed in the tolerant maize line. These data provide further support to the hypothesis that a mechanism exists that excludes At from the roots of the tolerant maize line, as well as, a internal mechanism of tolerance that minimizes accumulation of lipid peroxides through a higher Pro and carbohydrate content related to osmoregulation and membrane stabilization.

AB Background. The evolutionary role of postcopulatory sexual selection in shaping male reproductive traits, including sperm morphology, is well documented in several taxa. However, previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the influence of sperm competition on variation among species. In this study we tested the hypothesis that intraspecific variation in sperm morphology is driven by the level of postcopulatory sexual selection in passerine birds. Methodology/Findings. Using two proxy measures of sperm competition level, (i) relative testes size and (ii) extrapair paternity level, we found strong evidence that intermale variation in sperm morphology is negatively associated with the degree of postcopulatory sexual selection, independently of phylogeny. Conclusions/Significance. Our results show that the role of postcopulatory sexual selection in the evolution of sperm morphology extends to an intraspecific level, reducing the variation towards what might be a species-specific 'optimum' sperm phenotype. This finding suggests that while postcopulatory selection is generally directional (e.g., favouring longer sperm) across avian species, it also acts as a stabilising evolutionary force within species under intense selection, resulting in reduced variation in sperm morphology traits. We discuss some potential evolutionary mechanisms for this pattern.

AB Questions: 1. Which habitats have the highest degree of invasion? 2. Do native species-rich communities have also a high degree of invasion? 3. Do the patterns of association between native and alien species richness vary between habitats.
   Location: Catalonia region (NE Spain).
   Methods: We conducted a large regional analysis of 15655 phytosociological releves to detect differences in the degree of invasion between European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats representative of temperate and Mediterranean European areas.
   Results: Alien species were present in less than 17 % of the releves and represented less than 2 % of the total number of species per habitat. The EUNIS habitats with the highest alien species richness were arable land and gardens followed by anthropogenic forb-rich habitats, riverine and lakeshore scrubs, southern riparian galleries and thickets and trampled areas. In contrast, the following habitats had never any alien species: surface running waters, raised and blanket bogs, valley mires, poor fens and transition mires, base-rich fens, alpine and sub-alpine grasslands, sub-alpine moist or wet tall-herb and fern habitats, alpine and sub-alpine scrub habitats and spiny Mediterranean heaths. There was a unimodal relationship between the mean native and mean alien species richness per EUNIS habitat with a high number of aliens in habitats with intermediate number of native species and a low number of aliens at both extremes of the native species gradient. Within EUNIS habitats, the relationship was positive, negative or non-significant depending on the habitat type without any clear pattern related to the number of native species. Alien species richness was not related to plot size, neither between habitats nor within habitats.
   Conclusions: The analysis emphasised that the habitats with a higher degree of invasion were the most disturbed ones and that in general habitats rich in native species did not harbour less invaders than habitats poor in native species.

AB Historically, New Zealand was dominated by forest below the alpine treeline, but about 1000 years of Polynesian and European colonisation has resulted in the destruction of nearly three-quarters of the indigenous forest cover. In this study, the historical patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation were assessed in relation to major topographical, climatic and anthropogenic variables that may drive forest loss. Deforestation has occurred almost equally on the two main islands, the North and South Islands, although the remaining indigenous forest is more fragmented in the North Island. Most deforestation has occurred in regions with a high-density of road networks, although gradients in climatic water availability and soil fertility also had weak effects. Deforestation rates over the period 1997-2002 were very low (nationwide deforestation rate of just -0.01% p.a.), but varied widely among political districts. Expansion of plantation forestry was the single most important driver of recent deforestation. Only 10 of 73 political districts are afforded long-term protection of native forest cover (having more than 30% forest cover that is managed by the Department of Conservation). Forest cover in the majority of New Zealand landscapes has been reduced below the level of an expected 'extinction threshold' (circa 30% native habitat cover) in 55 political districts, and long-term trajectories predict that ongoing deforestation threatens to force another five districts below the critical threshold within the next 45 years. Except for the most heavily deforested regions, relatively modest annual rates of habitat restoration could bring forest cover back above the extinction threshold by the year 2050.

AB The history of life has been marked by several spectacular radiations, in which many lineages arise over a short period of time. A possible consequence of Such rapid splitting in the recent Past is that the intrinsic barriers that prevent gene flow between many species may have too little time to develop fully, leading to extensive hybridization among recently evolved lineages. The salamander genus Plethodon in eastern North America has been proposed as a possible example of this scenario, but without explicit statistical tests. In this paper, we present a nearly comprehensive phylogeny for the 45 extant species of eastern Plethodon, based on DNA sequences of mitochondrial (two genes, 1335 base pairs) and nuclear genes (two genes, Lip to 3481 base pairs). We then use this phylogeny to examine rates and patterns of diversification and hybridization. We find significantly rapid diversification within the glutinosus species group. Examining patterns of natural hybridization in light of the phylogeny shows considerable hybridization within this clade, including introgression between species that are morphologically distinct and distantly related. Reproductive isolation increases over time and may be very weak among the most recently diverged species. These results suggest that the origin of species and the evolution of intrinsic reproductive isolating mechanisms, rather than being synonymous, may be decoupled in some cases (i.e., rapid origin of lineages Outstrips the "speciation clock"). In contrast to the conclusions of a recent review of adaptive radiation and hybridization, we suggest that extensive hybridization sometimes may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of rapid diversification.

AB We show that ecosystem-specific aboveground net primary productivity (SANPP, g g(-1) day(-1), productivity on a per gram basis) can be predicted from species-level measures of potential relative growth rate (RGR(max)), but only if RGR(max) is weighted according to the species' relative abundance. This is in agreement with Grime's mass-ratio hypothesis. Productivity was measured in 12 sites in a French Mediterranean post-agricultural succession, while RGR(max) was measured on 26 of the most abundant species from this successional sere, grown hydroponically. RGR(max) was only weakly correlated (r(2) = 0.12, P < 0.05) with field age when species abundance was not considered, but the two variables were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.81, P < 0.001) when the relative abundance of species in each field was taken into account. SANPP also decreased significantly with field age. This resulted in a tight relationship (r(2) = 0.77, P < 0.001) between productivity and RGR(max) weighted according to species relative biomass contribution. Our study shows that scaling-up from the potential properties of individual species is possible, and that information on potential and realized species traits can be integrated to predict ecosystem functioning.

AB We assessed the effectiveness of forest reserves (i.e., protected old secondary and primary forests), fragments (i.e., scattered ruderal vegetation), and urban parks (i.e., artificially revegetated habitats) in conserving butterfly diversity in a highly urbanized tropical landscape (i.e., Singapore), by testing the hypothesis that forest reserves have the highest butterfly species richness among these habitats. We investigated which environmental factors (e.g., canopy cover) affect the distribution of butterflies across the habitats; and also tested the hypothesis that butterfly communities of different habitats have distinct ecological traits. Further, we examined the important determinants (e.g., area) of butterfly richness in urban parks, by testing the hypothesis that the number of potential larval host plant species occurring in the park is the best predictor of butterfly species richness. Rarefaction analyses showed that forest reserves had the highest number of species, number of unique species, density of species, and community evenness among the habitats, implying that, in urban landscapes, the least human-disturbed habitats should be given the highest conservation priority. Forest reserves and urban parks adjoining forests collectively accounted for 91% of all butterfly species recorded in this study, suggesting that their preservation will likely achieve maximum complementarity for effective butterfly conservation. Ordination analyses revealed that different butterfly species responded differently to environmental factors (e.g., canopy cover), highlighting the importance of maintaining environmental heterogeneity for the conservation of different butterfly species. Classification tree analysis indicated that butterfly communities of different habitats (e.g., forests, urban parks) have distinct ecological traits (e.g., host plant specificity), whereby urban avoiders were 89% likely to be forest dependent and 63% likely to be monophagous, while urban adapters were 87% likely to be cosmopolitan and 67% likely to be oligo- or polyphagous. Regression analyses showed that the number of potential larval host plant species and isolation from forests were important determinants of butterfly species richness in urban parks, indicating that urban parks should be revegetated with a diversity of potential larval host plants and should be situated as near as possible to a forest, in order to maximize their conservation value.

AB Transitions between plant species assemblages are often continuous with the form of the transition dependent on the 'slope' of environmental gradients and on the style of self-organization in vegetation. Image segmentation can present misleading or even erroneous results if applied to continuous spatial changes in vegetation. Even methods that allow for multiple-class memberships of pixels presuppose the existence of ideal types of species assemblages that constitute mixtures-an assumption that does not fit the case of continua where any section of a gradient is as 'pure' as any other section like in modulations of grassland species composition.
   Thus, we attempted to spatially model floristic gradients in Bavarian meadows by extrapolating axes of an unconstrained ordination of species data. The models were based on high-resolution hyperspectral airborne imagery. We further modelled the distribution of plant functional response types (Ellenberg indicator values) and the cover values of selected species. The models were made with partial least squares (PLS) regression analyses. The realistic utility of the regression models was evaluated by full leave-one-out cross-validation.
   The modelled floristic gradients showed a considerable agreement with ground-based observations of floristic gradients (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.66 for the first two axes of ordination). Apart from mapping the most important continuous floristic differences, we mapped gradients in the appearance of plant functional response groups as represented by averaged Ellenberg indicator values for soil pH (R-2 = 0.76), water supply (R-2 = 0.66) and nutrient supply (R-2 = 0.75), while models for the cover of single species were weak.
   Compared to many other vegetation attributes, plant species composition is difficult to detect with remote sensing techniques. This is partly caused by a lack of compatibility between methods of vegetation ecology and remote sensing. We believe that the present study has the potential to increase compatibility as neither spectral nor vegetation information gets lost by a classifying step. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Little is known about the relative influence of landscape structure on the spatial distribution and abundance of marine organisms. To address this problem, we applied landscape ecology concepts and methods, together with conventional sampling techniques and path analysis, to test alternative hypotheses of linkages between marine nekton and landscape structure in Moreton Bay, Queensland (Australia). We quantified substratum structure at 3 spatial scales: (1) whole landscape mosaic (10s of hectares); (2) habitat type (benthic class) (100S m(2) to hectares) and (3) within-patch scale (cm(2) to m(2)). Substratum structure at all scales was important for assemblage density and number of species, with the landscape structure of individual habitat types explaining more of the spatial variation than either within-patch structure or the structure of the whole landscape mosaic. Density and the number of species of seagrass residents were strongly influenced by landscape composition quantified as the proportion of all seagrass habitat (r(2) = 0.40 and 0.48 respectively) and the proportion of long-leaved Zostera capricorni (r(2) = 0.34 and 0.30 respectively) seagrass in the landscape. An abrupt decline in assemblage density and number of species was evident at < 20% seagrass cover. More species of fish used mangroves with adjacent continuous seagrass beds than mangroves with adjacent patchy seagrasses or unvegetated sandflats. Several species of fish using mangroves at high tide were more strongly influenced by the spatial configuration of mangrove patches and the composition of adjacent substratum than the internal structure of mangrove patches. The study highlights the need for a hierarchical landscape approach when investigating animal-environment relations in marine landscapes.

AB Avian eggs contain, among many components, significant concentrations of androgens and other maternal hormones. These hormones can have profound influences in the development of the embryo and the nestling, and even shape the phenotype of the adult bird. In this review I evaluate the research that has been developed in the last ten years in this field, and I suggest several lines of research that might be worth following in the future. Evidence shows that high levels of androgens in eggs speed up embryonic development, boost muscular growth and begging rates in nestlings. A study in captivity with canaries Serinus domesticus has identified an influence of egg androgen in the social hierarchy of the adult bird. Research is needed to ascertain long-term effects of egg androgens in the wild, but the picture is a promising one. Several studies have found a positive correlation between female hormone levels and those of the egg. However, it is still not clear whether this is the re! sult of passive transfer or, on the contrary, there are mechanisms that control the transfer of hormones from the mother to the egg. Whatever the mechanism, several experiments show that females lay eggs with higher concentrations of androgens when paired to attractive mates. This pattern of differential allocation suggests that egg androgens are a costly resource, and that there are limiting factors for the mother or the offspring. Research has uncovered several other interesting patterns, such as differences between male and female bearing eggs in androgen levels, or a positive covariance with breeding density in different colonies of the same species. Another exciting issue concerns the uneven distribution of egg androgen within the same clutch. It has been suggested that females could use this mechanism to control aggression and competition among nestlings. To summarise, egg androgen allocation constitutes a powerful mechanism which females could use to modify offspring ph! enotype. Large between-species differences in egg androgen concentrations suggest that a comparative analysis may be the best tool to understand the role of the many ecological and evolutionary factors that may have shaped the evolution of this character.

AB Plants possess a remarkable capacity to alter their phenotype in response to the highly heterogeneous light conditions they commonly encounter in natural environments. In the present study with the weedy annual plant Sinapis arvensis, we (a) tested for the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity in morphological and life history traits in response to low light and (b) explored possible fitness costs of plasticity. Replicates of 31 half-sib families were grown individually in the greenhouse under full light and under low light (40% of ambient) imposed by neutral shade cloth. Low light resulted in a large increase in hypocotyl length and specific leaf area (SLA), a reduction in juvenile biomass and a delayed onset of flowering. Phenotypic selection analysis within each light environment revealed that selection favoured large SLA under low light, but not under high light, suggesting that the observed increase in SLA was adaptive. In contrast, plasticity in the other traits measured was maladaptive (i.e. in the opposite direction to that favoured by selection in the low light environment). We detected significant additive genetic variance in plasticity in most phenotypic traits and in fitness (number of seeds). Using genotypic selection gradient analysis, we found that families with high plasticity in SLA had a lower fitness than families with low plasticity, when the effect of SLA on fitness was statistically kept constant. This indicates that plasticity in SLA incurred a direct fitness cost. However, a cost of plasticity was only expressed under low light, but not under high light. Thus, models on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity will need to incorporate plasticity costs that vary in magnitude depending on environmental conditions.

AB In this paper, we present an integrated account of the diurnal variation in the stable isotopes of water (delta D and delta (18) O) and dry matter (delta (15) N, delta (13) C, and delta (18) O) in the long-distance transport fluids (xylem sap and phloem sap), leaves, pod walls, and seeds of Lupinus angustifolius under field conditions in Western Australia. The delta D and delta (18) O of leaf water showed a pronounced diurnal variation, ranging from early morning minima near 0parts per thousand for both delta D and delta (18) O to early afternoon maxima of 62 and 23parts per thousand, respectively. Xylem sap water showed no diurnal variation in isotopic composition and had mean values of -13.2 and -2.3parts per thousand for delta D and delta (18) O. Phloem sap water collected from pod tips was intermediate in isotopic composition between xylem sap and leaf water and exhibited only a moderate diurnal fluctuation. Isotopic compositions of pod wall and seed water were intermediate between those of phloem and xylem sap water. A model of average leaf water enrichment in the steady state (Craig & Gordon, pp. 9-130 in Proceedings of a Conference on Stable Isotopes in Oceanographic Studies and Palaeotemperatures , Lischi and Figli, Pisa, Italy, 1965; Dongmann et al ., Radiation and Environmental Biophysics 11, 41-52, 1974; Farquhar & Lloyd, pp. 47-70 in Stable Isotopes and Plant Carbon-Water Relations , Academic Press, San Diego, CA, USA, 1993) agreed closely with observed leaf water enrichment in the morning and early afternoon, but poorly during the night. A modified model taking into account non-steady-state effects (Farquhar and Cernusak, unpublished) gave better predictions of observed leaf water enrichments over a full diurnal cycle. The delta (15) N, delta (13) C, and delta (18) O of dry matter varied appreciably among components. Dry matter delta (15) N was highest in xylem sap and lowest in leaves, whereas dry matter delta (13) C was lowest in leaves and highest in phloem sap and seeds, and dry matter delta (18) O was lowest in leaves and highest in pod walls. Phloem sap, leaf, and fruit dry matter delta (18) O varied diurnally, as did phloem sap dry matter delta (13) C. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the non-steady-state when modelling biological fractionation of stable isotopes in the natural environment.

AB Logging is considered the most important threat to species in boreal forests. In contrast to eastern Canada, where most boreal forests remain largely untouched, in Fennoscandia it is possible to assess the cumulative, long-term effects of intensive forestry on wildlife, But harvesting of stands is rapidly changing Canadian boreal forests, which represent an important proportion of the world's boreal forests. We show that Fennoscandia and eastern Canada present striking similarities in terms of forest-age structure, natural-disturbance regime, and structure of bird assemblages, and we provide an assessment of the long-term effects of forestry on eastern Canadian birds of the boreal forest. We used life-history traits from habitat, nesting site, and geographical range to calculate an index of sensitivity to changes induced by modern forestry for boreal species of each region. Tropical migrants commonly found in eastern Canadian boreal forests have life-history trails that are not threat factors in relation to changes caused by modern forestry. Therefore, the general belief that tropical migrants in North America are more sensitive to landscape changes than those in Europe may not hold for species found in the boreal coniferous forests of eastern Canada. Nine Fennoscandian species present high levels of sensitivity, and at least eight eastern Canadian species are of similar concern, In both regions, most of the sensitive species are resident cavity nesters. Given the important similarities between the two regions, the northern expansion of commercial forestry in eastern Canada is likely to result in the significant decline of several resident species, as has occurred in Fennoscandia.

AB We examined the response of montane butterflies to a 1300-m elevational gradient in the Toiyabe Range, a mountain range in the central Great Basin. We tested whether elevational ranges of montane butterflies conform to Rapoport's elevational rule (species at higher elevations have greater elevational ranges). We also tested whether the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis (emigrants from higher elevation populations inflate the species richness of lower-elevation sites) could explain the species richness patterns we observed. In addition, we predicted whether global climate change is likely to perturb current elevational gradients in butterfly species richness. Species presence data were collected from 105 100-m vertical elevational bands in 17 canyons. Elevation and species richness were significantly negatively correlated, although species richness peaked at intermediate elevations, and butterflies in species-rich areas had significantly narrower elevational ranges than species in more depauperate areas. Toiyabe Range butterflies conformed to Rapoport's elevational rule. The Rapoport effect we documented did not result from sampling bias. However, the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis cannot fully explain the elevational gradient in species richness. Environmental severity at either end and favorable conditions near the middle of the elevational gradient likely contributed to high species richness at intermediate elevations. Our models indicated that few butterfly taxa will be lost from the Toiyabe Range in the face of climate change. To maintain present species richness and maximize the potential of Great Basin butterflies to adapt to rapid climate change, we recommend that habitat protection and restoration efforts target not only high elevation Wilderness Areas but also intermediate elevations.

AB Whole-genome resequencing (WGR) is a powerful method for addressing fundamental evolutionary biology questions that have not been fully resolved using traditional methods. WGR includes four approaches: the sequencing of individuals to a high depth of coverage with either unresolved or resolved haplotypes, the sequencing of population genomes to a high depth by mixing equimolar amounts of unlabelled-individual DNA (Pool-seq) and the sequencing of multiple individuals from a population to a low depth (IcWGR). These techniques require the availability of a reference genome. This, along with the still high cost of shotgun sequencing and the large demand for computing resources and storage, has limited their implementation in nonmodel species with scarce genomic resources and in fields such as conservation biology. Our goal here is to describe the various WGR methods, their pros and cons and potential applications in conservation biology. WGR offers an unprecedented marker density and surveys a wide diversity of genetic variations not limited to single nucleotide polymorphisms (e.g., structural variants and mutations in regulatory elements), increasing their power for the detection of signatures of selection and local adaptation as well as for the identification of the genetic basis of phenotypic traits and diseases. Currently, though, no single WGR approach fulfils all requirements of conservation genetics, and each method has its own limitations and sources of potential bias. We discuss proposed ways to minimize such biases. We envision a not distant future where the analysis of whole genomes becomes a routine task in many nonmodel species and fields including conservation biology.

AB Fishes are the most diverse group of vertebrates, play key functional roles in aquatic ecosystems, and provide protein for a billion people, especially in the developing world. Those functions are compromised by mounting pressures on marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Because of its economic and food value, fish biomass production provides an unusually direct link from biodiversity to critical ecosystem services. We used the Reef Life Survey's global database of 4,556 standardized fish surveys to test the importance of biodiversity to fish production relative to 25 environmental drivers. Temperature, biodiversity, and human influence together explained 47% of the global variation in reef fish biomass among sites. Fish species richness and functional diversity were among the strongest predictors of fish biomass, particularly for the largebodied species and carnivores preferred by fishers, and these biodiversity effects were robust to potentially confounding influences of sample abundance, scale, and environmental correlations. Warmer temperatures increased biomass directly, presumably by raising metabolism, and indirectly by increasing diversity, whereas temperature variability reduced biomass. Importantly, diversity and climate interact, with biomass of diverse communities less affected by rising and variable temperatures than species-poor communities. Biodiversity thus buffers global fish biomass from climate change, and conservation of marine biodiversity can stabilize fish production in a changing ocean.

AB Despite the crucial role of carbon transport in whole plant physiology and its impact on plant-environment interactions and ecosystem function, relatively little research has tried to examine how phloem physiology impacts plant ecology. In this review, we highlight several areas of active research where inquiry into phloem physiology has increased our understanding of whole plant function and ecological processes. We consider how xylem-phloem interactions impact plant drought tolerance and reproduction, how phloem transport influences carbon allocation in trees and carbon cycling in ecosystems and how phloem function mediates plant relations with insects, pests, microbes and symbiotes. We argue that in spite of challenges that exist in studying phloem physiology, it is critical that we consider the role of this dynamic vascular system when examining the relationship between plants and their biotic and abiotic environment.
   This review highlights the important but understudied role of phloem physiology in mediating how plants interact with their biotic and abiotic environment and shaping larger ecological patterns. We focus on three critical areas of current research: interactions between the xylem and phloem, carbon fluxes both in plants and at the ecosystem scale and interactions between plants and their biotic environment. The goal of this review is to draw attention to the critical role of carbon transport in plant physiological ecology and outline many of the questions that remain to be answered about this critical part of the plant vascular system.

AB The role human activities play in reshaping biodiversity is increasingly apparent in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the responses of entire marine assemblages are not well-understood, in part, because few monitoring programs incorporate both spatial and temporal replication. Here, we analyse an exceptionally comprehensive 29-year time series of North Atlantic groundfish assemblages monitored over 5 degrees latitude to the west of Scotland. These fish assemblages show no systematic change in species richness through time, but steady change in species composition, leading to an increase in spatial homogenization: the species identity of colder northern localities increasingly resembles that of warmer southern localities. This biotic homogenization mirrors the spatial pattern of unevenly rising ocean temperatures over the same time period suggesting that climate change is primarily responsible for the spatial homogenization we observe. In this and other ecosystems, apparent constancy in species richness may mask major changes in species composition driven by anthropogenic change.

AB A city is the most dramatic manifestation of human activities on the environment. This human-dominated organism degrades natural habitats, simplifies species composition, disrupts hydrological systems and modifies energy flow and nutrient cycling. Sustainable urban development (SUD) is seen as a panacea to minimise these externalities caused by widespread human activities on the environment. The concept of SUD has been around over a considerably long time as the need to adopt environmentally sustainable behaviours made the international community commit to it. However, to date such development has not been achieved in large scales anywhere around the globe. This review paper aims to look at the SUD concept from the lens of planning and development integration to generate new insights and directions. The paper reports the outcome of the review of the literature on planning and development approaches-i.e. urban planning, ecological planning, urban development, SUD-and proposes a new process to support the efforts for achieving SUD-i.e. integrated urban planning and development process. The findings of this review paper highlight that adopting such holistic planning and development process generate a potential to further support the progress towards achieving sustainability agendas of our cities.

AB ABSTRACT
   Vital rates of large herbivores normally respond to increased resource limitation by following a progressive sequence of effects on life-history characteristics from survival of young, age at first reproduction, reproduction of adults, to adult survival. Expected changes in life-history characteristics, however, should operate through changes in nutritional condition, which is the integrator of nutritional intake and demands represented primarily by the deposition and catabolism of body fat. Elucidating seasonal patterns of nutritional condition and its relative influence on individual and population performance should improve our understanding of life-history strategies and population regulation of ungulates, provide insight into the capacity of available habitat to support population growth, and allow assessment of the underlying consequences of mortality on population dynamics. We acquired longitudinal data on individual female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and linked those data with environmental and population characteristics. Our goal was to provide a nutritional basis for understanding life-history strategies of these large mammals, and to aid in the conservation and management of large herbivores in general. We studied a migratory population of mule deer that overwintered in Round Valley on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and was subject to a highly variable climate and predation from a suite of large carnivores. We intensively monitored nutritional and life-history characteristics of this population during 1997-2009 as it recovered from a population crash, which occurred during 1985-1991. Deer in Round Valley migrated to high-elevation summer ranges on both sides of the crest of the Sierra Nevada (Sierra crest), where a rain shadow resulted in a mesic and more forested range on the west side compared with xeric conditions east of the Sierra crest. Average survival of neonatal mule deer to 140 days of age during 2006-2008 was 0.33 (SE = 0.091), but was lower for neonates on the west side (0.13, SE = 0.092) compared with those on the east side (0.44, SE = 0.11) of the Sierra crest. Birth mass and nutritional condition of mothers had a positive effect on survival of young; however, those effects were evident only for neonates born east of the crest where predation pressure was less intense compared with the west side. Black bear (Ursus americanus) predation was the main cause of mortality for west-side young (mortality rate = 0.63, SE = 0.97) compared with canid and felid predation for east-side young (0.29, SE = 0.076). Mean autumn recruitment of young during 1997-2008 was lower for females on the west side (0.42, SE = 0.037) than for females on the east side (0.70, SE = 0.041) of the crest, and was affected positively by March ingesta-free body fat (IFBFat) of individual females. At the level of the population, ratios of young-to-adult females (1991-2009) were highly variable and strongly related to March IFBFat of adult females during the current and preceding year. Reproduction by yearling females was sensitive to per capita availability of forage during summer (as 1-yr-old individuals), thereby influencing whether a sufficient body mass for ovulation was obtained. Litter size remained high (1.69, SE = 0.027) during the study, but was influenced positively by forage availability, negatively by summer temperature, and was greater for females that resided on the west side of the Sierra crest during summer than those on the east side. In contrast, pregnancy rates remained unchanged across years of study (0.
   98, SE = 0.005). Survival of prime-age (2- to 9-yr-old) females was 0.90 (SE = 0.021) in summer, 0.94 (SE = 0.012) in winter, and 0.87 (SE = 0.025) annually. Although relatively stable across years, both winter and summer survival were influenced positively by the preceding April snowpack relative to the density of the population. Mean IFBFat of adult females was 7.2% (SE = 0.077) in March 1997-2009 and 9.7% (SE = 0.23) in November 2002-2008. Nutritional condition offered a mechanistic link between factors that influence resource limitation and population performance, because condition of adult females in autumn and late winter was sensitive to the nutritional history of individual animals as related to forage growth, population density, migratory tactic, reproductive costs, and nutritional carryover. Nutritional condition of adult females in March also was the most parsimonious predictor of finite rate of population growth (lambda) during the forthcoming year. The relative magnitude of effect of nutritional condition on survival and reproduction was mostly in accordance with the predicted changes of vital rates in response to resource limitation for populations of large herbivores. Our results indicate that management and conservation of large herbivore populations could be improved by integrating indices of nutritional condition into current monitoring and research programs. We offer a method to estimate the proximity of a population to nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) that is based on nutritional status of the population relative to population performance (termed animal-indicated NCC). The proximity of the population to animal-indicated NCC represents the short-term capacity of the environment to support population growth. A nutritional approach to monitor and manage populations offers a direct link to the capacity of the habitat, and reduces the need to estimate population abundance or set goals according to population size. We also propose that the consequences of mortality (degree of additive or compensatory mortality) on population dynamics can be assessed by comparing the estimated nutritional capacity for survival and recruitment of young to that measured empirically, because more young are produced than what the habitat can support when nutrition is limiting. Our approach is useful for quantifying effects of predation, and provides a basis for determining the efficacy of predator control to enhance ungulate populations. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB Growing urban sprawl is a serious concern worldwide for a number of environmental and economic reasons and is a major challenge on the way to sustainable land use. To address this increasing problem, there is an urgent need for quantitative measurement. Every meaningful method to measure the degree of urban sprawl needs to be based on a clear definition of "urban sprawl" disentangling causes and consequences of urban sprawl from the phenomenon of urban sprawl itself, as urban sprawl has differing causes and consequences in different regions and regulatory contexts. Weighted Urban Proliferation (WUP) - the novel method presented in this paper - is based on the following definition of urbarrsprawl: the more area built over in a given landscape (amount of built-up area) and the more dispersed this builtup area in the landscape (spatial configuration), and the higher the uptake of built-up area per inhabitant or job (lower utilization intensity in the built-up area), the higher the degree of urban sprawl. However, there is a lack of reliable measures of urban sprawl that integrate these three dimensions in a single metric. Therefore, these three independent dimensions need to be combined according to the qualitative assessment of sprawl to create a suitable metric - which is exactly what the WUP metric does using two weighting functions.
   Switzerland serves as an example of applying this method to examine the current state, for comparisons among regions, for historical analysis, and for assessing planning scenarios. The degree of urban sprawl in Switzerland increased by 155% between 1935 and 2002, and without rigorous measures, scenarios of future urban sprawl show that it is likely to further increase by more than 50% until 2050. Examples from parts of Switzerland demonstrate that sprawl can be reduced. As a consequence of intense public discussion, the Swiss Spatial Planning Act was revised in 2013 to make it tighter. We conclude that the new method is more suitable than previous methods to quantify the indicator "urban sprawl" in monitoring systems, e.g., it has now been implemented in monitoring systems in Switzerland. The new WUP method is highly suitable for performance control of limits to urban sprawl once they are implemented and for application to other countries around the globe. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Landscape metrics are widely used to investigate the spatial structure of landscapes. Numerous metrics are currently available, yet only little empirical research has comparatively examined their indicator value for species richness for several taxa at several scales. Taking a Mediterranean forest landscape - Dadia National Park (Greece) - as a case study area, we explored the performance of 52 landscape level landscape metrics as indicators of species richness for six taxa (woody plants, orchids, orthopterans, amphibians, reptiles, and small terrestrial birds) and for overall species richness. We computed the landscape metrics for circular areas of five different extents around each of 30 sampling plots. We applied linear mixed models to evaluate significant relations between metrics and species richness and to assess the effects of the extent of the considered landscape on the performance of the metrics. Our results showed that landscape metrics were good indicators for overall species richness, woody plants, orthopterans and reptiles. Metrics quantifying patch shape, proximity, texture and landscape diversity resulted often in well-fitted models, while those describing patch area, similarity and edge contrast rarely contributed to significant models. Spatial scale affected the performance of the metrics, since woody plants, orthopterans and small terrestrial birds were usually better predicted at smaller extents of surrounding landscape, and reptiles frequently at larger ones. The revealed pattern of relations and performances will be useful to understand landscape structure as a driver and indicator of biodiversity, and to improve forest and landscape management decisions in Mediterranean and other forest mosaics.

TI Measuring fractions of beta diversity and their relationships to
   nestedness: a theoretical and empirical comparison of novel approaches
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article

AB Beta diversity and nestedness are central concepts of ecology and biogeography and evaluation of their relationships is in the focus of contemporary ecological and conservation research. Beta diversity patterns are originated from two distinct processes: the replacement (or turnover) of species and the loss (or gain) of species leading to richness differences. Nested distributional patterns are generally thought to have a component deriving from beta diversity which is independent of replacement processes. Quantification of these phenomena is often made by calculating a measure of beta diversity, and the resulting value being subsequently partitioned into a contribution by species replacement plus a fraction shared by beta diversity and nestedness. Three methods have been recently proposed for such partitioning, all of them based on pairwise comparisons of sites. In this paper, the performance of these methods was evaluated on theoretical grounds and tested by a simulation study in which different gradients of dissimilarity, with known degrees of species replacement and species loss, were created. Performance was also tested using empirical data addressing land-use induced changes in endemic arthropod communities of the Terceira Island in the Azores. We found that the partitioning of cc (dissimilarity in terms of the Jaccard index) into two additive fractions, -3 (dissimilarity due to species replacement) plus rich (dissimilarity due to richness differences) reflects the species replacement and species loss processes across the simulated gradients in an ecologically and mathematically meaningful way, whilst the other two methods lack mathematical consistency and prove conceptually self-contradictory. Moreover, the first method identified a selective local extinction process for endemic arthropods, triggered by land-use changes, while the latter two methods overweighted the replacement component and led to false conclusions. Their basic flaw derives from the fact that the proposed replacement and nestedness components (deemed to account for species loss) are not scaled in the same way as the measure that accounts for the total dissimilarity (SOrensen and Jaccard indices). We therefore recommend the use of cc=-3+rich, since its components are scaled in the same units and their responses are proportional to the replacement and the gain/loss of species.

AB Question When can we assume that inter-specific trait variation is higher than intra-specific trait variation in plant community ecology? Location Old-growth deciduous forest in the Gault Nature Reserve, Mount St. Hilaire (Quebec, Canada,4532.957N, 7308.884W), with a shorter environmental gradient than normally exists in community studies. Methods We measured 15 functional traits on all tree saplings occurring in 39 (57-m radius) sample plots. Using variance decomposition from mixed models and from sums of squares of community-weighted traits, we determined the relative importance of temporal, spatial, inter-specific, intra-specific and intra-individual variation in each trait. In total, we collected trait information on 3317 leaves from 786 twigs sampled on 422 saplings. Results For 12 of 15 traits, over 50% of the total variance existed between species and inter-specific variation was always the most important source of variation. However for 14 traits, intra-specific and environmental variation represented up to 28% of the total variation. Variation in community-weighted trait means was mostly generated by changes in species composition, but intra-specific trait variation was the dominate cause for leaf nitrogen, specific leaf area and tree branching. The intra-individual and temporal sources of variation were not important. Conclusions Trait variation should be dominated by inter-specific differences in most studies since they involve systems with more pronounced environmental gradients, higher species richness and more -diversity than used here. However, in studies with short gradients, or when using more plastic traits, it will be necessary to measure trait values for each site. It is important to quantify the -diversity of the environmental gradients in question in order to compare results across studies.

AB Although it is well known that plants and animals harbor microbial symbionts that can influence host traits, the factors regulating the structure of these microbial communities often remain largely undetermined. This is particularly true for insect-associated microbial communities, as few cross-taxon comparisons have been conducted to date. To address this knowledge gap and determine how host phylogeny and ecology affect insect-associated microbial communities, we collected 137 insect specimens representing 39 species, 28 families, and 8 orders, and characterized the bacterial communities associated with each specimen via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial taxa within the phylum Proteobacteria were dominant in nearly all insects sampled. On average, the insect-associated bacterial communities were not very diverse, with individuals typically harboring fewer than 8 bacterial phylotypes. Bacterial communities also tended to be dominated by a single phylotype; on average, the most abundant phylotype represented 54.7% of community membership. Bacterial communities were significantly more similar among closely related insects than among less-related insects, a pattern driven by within-species community similarity but detected at every level of insect taxonomy tested. Diet was a poor predictor of bacterial community composition. Individual insect species harbored remarkably unique communities: the distribution of 69.0% of bacterial phylotypes was limited to unique insect species, whereas only 5.7% of phylotypes were detected in more than five insect species. Together these results suggest that host characteristics strongly regulate the colonization and assembly of bacterial communities across insect lineages, patterns that are driven either by co-evolution between insects and their symbionts or by closely related insects sharing conserved traits that directly select for similar bacterial communities.

AB Background: Geographic variation in the thermal environment impacts a broad range of biochemical and physiological processes and can be a major selective force leading to local population adaptation. In the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus, populations along the coast of California show differences in thermal tolerance that are consistent with adaptation, i.e., southern populations withstand thermal stresses that are lethal to northern populations. To understand the genetic basis of these physiological differences, we use an RNA-seq approach to compare genome-wide patterns of gene expression in two populations known to differ in thermal tolerance.
   Results: Observed differences in gene expression between the southern (San Diego) and the northern (Santa Cruz) populations included both the number of affected loci as well as the identity of these loci. However, the most pronounced differences concerned the amplitude of up-regulation of genes producing heat shock proteins (Hsps) and genes involved in ubiquitination and proteolysis. Among the hsp genes, orthologous pairs show markedly different thermal responses as the amplitude of hsp response was greatly elevated in the San Diego population, most notably in members of the hsp70 gene family. There was no evidence of accelerated evolution at the sequence level for hsp genes. Among other sets of genes, cuticle genes were up-regulated in SD but down-regulated in SC, and mitochondrial genes were down-regulated in both populations.
   Conclusions: Marked changes in gene expression were observed in response to acute sub-lethal thermal stress in the copepod T. californicus. Although some qualitative differences were observed between populations, the most pronounced differences involved the magnitude of induction of numerous hsp and ubiquitin genes. These differences in gene expression suggest that evolutionary divergence in the regulatory pathway(s) involved in acute temperature stress may offer at least a partial explanation of population differences in thermal tolerance observed in Tigriopus.

AB Due to the omnipresent risk of epidemics, insect societies have evolved sophisticated disease defences at the individual and colony level. An intriguing yet little understood phenomenon is that social contact to pathogen-exposed individuals reduces susceptibility of previously naive nestmates to this pathogen. We tested whether such social immunisation in Lasius ants against the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is based on active upregulation of the immune system of nestmates following contact to an infectious individual or passive protection via transfer of immune effectors among group members-that is, active versus passive immunisation. We found no evidence for involvement of passive immunisation via transfer of antimicrobials among colony members. Instead, intensive allogrooming behaviour between naive and pathogen-exposed ants before fungal conidia firmly attached to their cuticle suggested passage of the pathogen from the exposed individuals to their nestmates. By tracing fluorescence-labelled conidia we indeed detected frequent pathogen transfer to the nestmates, where they caused low-level infections as revealed by growth of small numbers of fungal colony forming units from their dissected body content. These infections rarely led to death, but instead promoted an enhanced ability to inhibit fungal growth and an active upregulation of immune genes involved in antifungal defences (defensin and prophenoloxidase, PPO). Contrarily, there was no upregulation of the gene cathepsin L, which is associated with antibacterial and antiviral defences, and we found no increased antibacterial activity of nestmates of fungus-exposed ants. This indicates that social immunisation after fungal exposure is specific, similar to recent findings for individual-level immune priming in invertebrates. Epidemiological modeling further suggests that active social immunisation is adaptive, as it leads to faster elimination of the disease and lower death rates than passive immunisation. Interestingly, humans have also utilised the protective effect of low-level infections to fight smallpox by intentional transfer of low pathogen doses ("variolation" or "inoculation").

AB Because the maintenance of proper developmental temperatures during avian incubation is costly to parents, embryos of many species experience pronounced variation in incubation temperature. However, the effects of such temperature variation on nestling development remain relatively unexplored. To investigate this, we artificially incubated wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus L.) clutches at 35.0 degrees, 36.5 degrees, or 38.0 degrees C for two-thirds of the incubation period. We returned clutches to their original nests before hatching and subsequently recorded nestling growth and resting metabolic rate. The length of the incubation period decreased with temperature, whereas hatching success increased. Nestlings from the lowest incubation temperature group had shorter tarsus lengths at 2 weeks of age, but body mass and wing length were not affected by temperature. In addition, nestlings from the lowest temperature group had a significantly higher resting metabolic rate compared with mid- and high-temperature nestlings, which may partly explain observed size differences between the groups. These findings suggest that nest microclimate can influence nestling phenotype, but whether observed differences carry over to later life-history stages remains unknown.

AB As inbreeding is costly, it has been suggested that polyandry may evolve as a means to reduce the negative fitness consequences of mating with genetically related males. While several studies provide support for this hypothesis, evidence of pure post-copulatory mechanisms capable of biasing paternity towards genetically unrelated males is still lacking; yet these are necessary to support inbreeding avoidance models of polyandry evolution. Here we showed, by artificially inseminating a group of female guppies with an equal number of sperm from related (full-sib) and unrelated males, that sperm competition success of the former was 10 per cent lower, on average, than that of the unrelated male. The paternity bias towards unrelated males was not due to differential embryo survival, as the size of the brood produced by control females, which were artificially inseminated with the sperm of a single male, was not influenced by their relatedness with the male. Finally, we collected ovarian fluid (OF) from virgin females. Using computer-assisted sperm analysis, we found that sperm velocity, a predictor of sperm competition success in the guppy, was significantly lower when measured in a solution containing the OF from a sister as compared with that from an unrelated female. Our results suggest that sperm-OF interaction mediates sperm competition bias towards unrelated mates and highlight the role of post-copulatory mechanisms in reducing the cost of mating with relatives in polyandrous females.

AB The diversity of highly active bacterial communities in cryoconite holes on three Arctic glaciers in Svalbard was investigated using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the 16S rRNA locus. Construction and sequencing of clone libraries allowed several members of these communities to be identified, with Proteobacteria being the dominant one, followed by Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes. T-RFLP data revealed significantly different communities in holes on the (cold) valley glacier Austre Broggerbreen relative to two adjacent (polythermal) valley glaciers, Midtre Lovenbreen and Vestre Broggerbreen. These population compositions correlate with differences in organic matter content, temperature and the metabolic activity of microbial communities concerned. No within-glacier spatial patterns were observed in the communities identified over the 2-year period and with the 1 km-spaced sampling. We infer that surface hydrology is an important factor in the development of cryoconite bacterial communities.

AB P>The focus of the trait-based approach to study community ecology has mostly been on trait comparisons at the interspecific level. Here we quantified intraspecific variation and covariation of leaf mass per area (LMA) and wood density (WD) in monospecific forests of the widespread tree species Nothofagus pumilio to determine its magnitude and whether it is related to environmental conditions and ontogeny. We also discuss probable mechanisms controlling the trait variation found.
   We collected leaf and stem woody tissues from 30-50 trees of different ages (ontogeny) from each of four populations at differing elevations (i.e. temperatures) and placed at each of three locations differing in soil moisture.
   The total variation in LMA (coefficient of variation (CV) = 21.14%) was twice that of WD (CV = 10.52%). The total variation in traits was never less than 23% when compared with interspecific studies. Differences in elevation (temperature) for the most part explained variation in LMA, while differences in soil moisture and ontogeny explained the variation in WD. Traits covaried similarly in the altitudinal gradient only.
   Functional traits of N. pumilio exhibited nonnegligible variation; LMA varied for the most part with temperature, while WD mostly varied with moisture and ontogeny. We demonstrate that environmental variation can cause important trait variation without species turnover.

AB 1. Meta-analysis is a powerful and informative tool for basic and applied research. It provides a statistical framework for synthesizing and comparing the results of studies which have all tested a particular hypothesis. Meta-analysis has the potential to be particularly useful for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, as individual experiments often rely on small sample sizes due to the constraints of time and manpower, and therefore have low statistical power.
   2. The rewards of conducting a meta-analysis can be significant. It can be the basis of a systematic review of a topic that provides a powerful exploration of key hypotheses or theoretical assumptions, thereby influencing the future development of a field of research. Alternatively, for the applied scientist, it can provide robust answers to questions of ecological, medical or economic significance. However, planning and conducting a meta-analysis can be a daunting prospect and the analysis itself is invariably demanding and labour intensive. Errors or omissions made at the planning stage can create weeks of extra work.
   3. While a range of useful resources is available to help the budding meta-analyst on his or her way, much of the key information and explanation is spread across different articles and textbooks. In order to help the reader use the available information as efficiently as possible (and so avoid making time-consuming errors) this article aims to provide a 'road map' to the existing literature. It provides a brief guide to planning, organizing and implementing a meta-analysis which focuses more on logic and implementation than on maths; it is intended to be a first port of call for those interested in the topic and should be used in conjunction with the more detailed books and articles referenced. In the main, references are cited and discussed with an emphasis on useful reading order rather than a chronological history of meta-analysis and its uses.
   4. No prior knowledge of meta-analysis is assumed in the current article, though it is assumed that the reader is familiar with ANOVA and regression-type statistical models.

AB Pyrosequencing was used to study the effect of rotation and tillage on total bacterial communities. We designed primers to the bacterial 16s rDNA and amplified DNA from soil samples from a long-term tillage/rotation trial in Kansas for two seasons. The 2 x 2 factorial trial had two rotation treatments (wheat wheat and wheat soybean) and two tillage treatments (conventional and no-till). A total of 20,180 16s rDNA sequences were generated and 2337 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assembled using a 97% similarity cut-off. The phylum Proteobacteria represented 38% of 299 identified taxa. The second most abundant phylum was Acidobacteria, making up 20% of the sequences, the majority of which were Acidobacteria Group 1. The phyla Actinobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes comprised 12% and 3.5% of the sequences. Other groups detected included TM7, Nitrospira, Verruco-microbia, and Bacteroidetes. Some clusters of Acidobacteria Group 1 were more frequent in continuous wheat versus wheat soybean rotation, some Acidobacteria Group 2 were more frequent in no-till, and some Acidobacteria Group 4 were more frequent in wheat soybean rotation. These results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Pyrosequencing provided taxonomic information about the overall bacterial community, and detected community shifts resulting from different cropping practices. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A fundamental challenge in ecology is to understand the mechanisms that govern patterns of relative species abundance. Previous numerical simulations have suggested that complex niche-structured models produce species abundance distributions (SADs) that are qualitatively similar to those of very simple neutral models that ignore differences between species. However, in the absence of an analytical treatment of niche models, one cannot tell whether the two classes of model produce the same patterns via similar or different mechanisms. We present an analytical proof that, in the limit as diversity becomes large, a strong niche model give rises to exactly the same asymptotic form of SAD as the neutral model, and we verify the analytical predictions for a Panamanian tropical forest data set. Our results strongly suggest that neutral processes drive patterns of relative species abundance in high-diversity ecological communities, even when strong niche structure exists. However, neutral theory cannot explain what generates high diversity in the first place, and it may not be valid in low-diversity communities. Our results also confirm that neutral theory cannot be used to infer an absence of niche structure or to explain ecosystem function.

AB P>Rare species are assumed to have little impact on community interactions and ecosystem processes. However, very few studies have actually attempted to quantify the role of rare species in ecosystems. Here we compare effects of soil community assemblages on plant-herbivore interactions and show that reduction of rare soil microbes increases both plant biomass and plant nutritional quality. Two crop plant species growing in soil where rare microbes were reduced, had tissues of higher nutritional quality, which theoretically makes them more susceptible to pest organisms such as shoot-feeding aphids and root-feeding nematodes. Reduction of rare microbes increased aphid body size in the absence of nematodes; nematodes always reduced aphid body size independent of the soil microbial community. This study is the first to show that rare soil microbes are not redundant but may play a role in crop protection by enhancing aboveground and belowground plant defence. It remains to be tested whether these are direct effects of rare soil microbes on plants and herbivores, or indirect effects via shifts in the microbial soil community assemblages.

AB Adaptive divergence between adjoining populations reflects a balance between the diversifying effect of divergent selection and the potentially homogenizing effect of gene flow. In most models of migration-selection balance, gene flow is assumed to reflect individuals' inherent capacity to disperse, without regard to the match between individuals' phenotypes and the available habitats. However, habitat preferences can reduce dispersal between contrasting habitats, thereby alleviating migration load and facilitating adaptive divergence. We tested whether habitat preferences contribute to adaptive divergence in a classic example of migration-selection balance: parapatric lake and stream populations of three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Using a mark-transplant-recapture experiment on morphologically divergent parapatric populations, we showed that 90% of lake and stream stickleback returned to their native habitat, reducing migration between habitats by 76%. Furthermore, we found that dispersal into a nonnative habitat was phenotype dependent. Stream fish moving into the lake were morphologically more lake-like than those returning to the stream (and the converse for lake fish entering the stream). The strong native habitat preference documented here increases the extent of adaptive divergence between populations two- to fivefold relative to expectations with random movement. These results illustrate the potential importance of adaptive habitat choice in driving parapatric divergence.

AB Growth responses to twentieth century climate variability of the three main European tree species Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, and Pinus sylvestris within two temperate low mountain forest sites were analyzed, with particular emphasis on their dependence upon ecological factors and temporal stability in the obtained relationships. While site conditions in Central (similar to 51A degrees N, 9A degrees E, KEL) and West (50.5A degrees N, 6.5A degrees E, EIF) Germany are similar, annual precipitation totals of a parts per thousand...700 mm and a parts per thousand...1,000 mm describe a maritime-continental gradient. Ring-width samples from 228 trees were collected and PCA used to identify common growth patterns. Chronologies were developed and redundancy analysis and simple correlation coefficients calculated to detect twentieth century temperature, precipitation, and drought fingerprints in the tree-ring data. Summer drought is the dominant driver of forest productivity, but regional and species-specific differences indicate more complex influences upon tree growth. F. sylvatica reveals the highest climate sensitivity, whereas Q. petraea is most drought tolerant. Drier growth conditions in KEL result in climate sensitivity of all species, and Q. petraea shifted from non-significant to significant drought sensitivity during recent decades at EIF. Drought sensitivity dynamics of all species vary over time. An increase of drought sensitivity in tree growth was found in the wetter forest area EIF, whereas a decrease occurred in the middle of the last century for all species in the drier KEL region. Species-specific and regional differences in long-term climate sensitivities, as evidenced by temporal variability in drought sensitivity, are potential indicators for a changing climate that effects Central-West German forest growth, but meanwhile hampers a general assessment of these effects.

AB Suture zones, shared regions of secondary contact between long-isolated lineages, are natural laboratories for studying divergence and speciation. For tropical rainforest, the existence of suture zones and their significance for speciation has been controversial. Using comparative phylogeographic evidence, we locate a morphologically cryptic suture zone in the Australian Wet Tropics rainforest. Fourteen out of 18 contacts involve morphologically cryptic phylogeographic lineages, with mtDNA sequence divergences ranging from 2 to 15 per cent. Contact zones are significantly clustered in a suture zone located between two major Quaternary refugia. Within this area, there is a trend for secondary contacts to occur in regions with low environmental suitability relative to both adjacent refugia and, by inference, the parental lineages. The extent and form of reproductive isolation among interacting lineages varies across species, ranging from random admixture to speciation, in one case via reinforcement. Comparative phylogeographic studies, combined with environmental analysis at a fine-scale and across varying climates, can generate new insights into suture zone formation and to diversification processes in species-rich tropical rainforests. As arenas for evolutionary experimentation, suture zones merit special attention for conservation.

AB To evaluate the importance of urban woodlands to serve as potential sites for biodiversity conservation, we analysed bird, carabid beetle and small mammal community responses to urbanisation at different spatial scales. We analysed the relationships between the variations of the structure (species richness S, diversity H' and dominance D) of animal communities of woodlands distributed along a rural-urban gradient, and the variations along this same gradient of (1) the vegetation within woodlands, (2) the landscape at 100 m and (3) 600 m around the woodlands. We identified the spatial scales whose variations along the gradient most affected each animal community structure, and characterised community responses to these variations. Our results showed that urbanisation affected taxa differently according to their dispersal ability. Carabid beetles, less mobile, seem to be sensitive to increasing fragmentation and built surfaces from periurban to town centre which could make their movement within the urban landscape difficult. Birds, mobile species, seem to be more sensitive to variations of the vegetation structure within woodlands from periurban to town centre that could affect their capacity to maintain in habitat patches. Although our study did not allow relating the small mammal community structure to urbanisation, it suggests that this taxa is sensitive to urban local disturbances. A relevant management scale of woodlands can be specified for each taxa conservation. Urban woodlands accommodate over 50% of the species present in periurban woodlands, and effective management could enhance this number. Woodlands seem to be a good choice for promoting biodiversity conservation in towns.

AB 1. Explaining spatial and temporal differences in species assemblages is a central aim of ecology. It requires a sound understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying the relationship of species with their environment. A species trait is widely acknowledged to be the key that links pattern and process, although the enormous variety of traits hampers generalization about which combination of traits are adaptive in a particular environment.
   2. In three steps, we used species traits to match species and environment, and chose lentic freshwater ecosystems to illustrate our approach. We first identified key environmental factors and selected the species traits that enable the organism to deal with them. Secondly, we investigated how investments in these traits are related (e.g. through trade-offs). Thirdly, we outlined 13 life-history strategies, based on biological species traits, their interrelations known from life-history theory and their functional implications.
   3. Species traits and environmental conditions are connected through life-history strategies, with different strategies representing different solutions to particular ecological problems. In addition, strategies may present an integrated response to the environment as they are based on many different traits and their interrelationships. The presence and abundance of (species exhibiting) different life-history strategies in a location may therefore give direct information about how a particular environment is experienced by the species present.
   4. Life-history strategies can be used to (i) explain differences in species assemblages either between locations or in different periods; (ii) compare waterbodies separated by large geographical distances, which may comprise different regional species pools or span species distribution areas and (iii) reduce often very complex, biodiverse assemblages into a few meaningful, easily interpretable relationships.

AB 1. Rats have reached about 80% of the world's islands and are among the most successful invasive mammals. Rats are opportunistic predators that are notorious for their impact on a variety of animal and plant species. However, little documented evidence on the complexities of these interactions is available.
   2. In our study, we assessed the impact of black rats Rattus rattus introduced on a small uninhabited island with a relatively simple ecosystem, Surprise Island, New Caledonia. We also compared the diet of R. rattus in the presence and absence of breeding seabirds, assessing the dietary compensation for this potentially important food source. From 2002 to 2005, we used live trapping studies combined with stable isotope analysis and conventional diet analyses (direct observations, gut and faecal contents) to characterize the diet of rats.
   3. Our results suggest a heavy predatory impact on seabirds, which could constitute as much as 24% of the rat diet. Moreover, in the absence of birds, rats compensated marginally by preying more heavily on other components of their diet but mostly acquired a new resource. They shifted their diet by preying heavily upon another endangered species, the hatchlings of sea turtles Chelonia mydas, which could constitute the main resource in the diet of R. rattus in those periods. Abundance, body condition and distribution of the rats were consistent with heavy predation upon this additional resource.
   4. Synthesis and applications. In island ecosystems invasive rats prey mainly upon seabird eggs and chicks, thereby threatening their populations. Although rats are certainly capable of surviving on terrestrial foods outside the seabird nesting season, their ability to prey upon ephemeral but abundant resources, such as hatchling sea turtles, may contribute to maintaining their populations. This may explain their success on Surprise Island, an ecosystem of extreme conditions, and suggests that biologists and managers working with threatened species should be aware of the possibility of temporary diet shifts by introduced rodents that may cause unexpected heavy predation on these species. This dietary shift from one endangered taxa to another has major implications for the conservation of seabirds and sea turtles world-wide and more generally for the biodiversity of invaded insular communities.

AB Nest predation is an important factor in the ecology of passerines and can be a large source of mortality for birds. I provide an overview of factors affecting nest predation of passerines in North America with the goal that it may provide some insight into the ecology and management of woodland birds in the United Kingdom. Although several factors influence productivity, nest success is perhaps the most widely measured demographic characteristic of open-cup-nesting birds, and nest predation is usually the largest cause of nest failure. The identity of predator species, and how their importance varies with habitat and landscape factors, must be known for managers and scientists to design effective conservation plans and place research on nest predation in the appropriate context. Recent studies using video surveillance have made significant contributions to our understanding of the relative importance of different predator taxa in North America. Spatial and temporal variation in nest predation can be better understood when landscapes are placed in a biogeographical context and local habitat and nest-site effects are placed in a landscape context. Low productivity resulting from high nest predation is one of several potential causes of bird population declines in North America and the UK. Although the 'forest fragmentation paradigm' from the eastern US may not apply directly to the UK, thinking about avian demographics from a multiscale perspective, and consideration of factors affecting nest predation with knowledge of the dominant predator species, may provide insight into population declines.

AB While poleward species migration in response to recent climatic warming is widely documented, few studies have examined entire range responses of broadly distributed sessile organisms, including changes on both the trailing (equatorward) and the leading (poleward) range edges. From a detailed population census throughout the entire geographical range of Aloe dichotoma Masson, a long-lived Namib Desert tree, together with data from repeat photographs, we present strong evidence that a developing range shift in this species is a 'fingerprint' of anthropogenic climate change. This is explained at a high level of statistical significance by population level impacts of observed regional warming and resulting water balance constraints. Generalized linear models suggest that greater mortalities and population declines in equatorward populations are virtually certainly the result, due to anthropogenic climate change, of the progressive exceedance of critical climate thresholds that are relatively closer to the species' tolerance limits in equatorward sites. Equatorward population declines are also broadly consistent with bioclimatically modelled projections under anticipated anthropogenic climate change but, as yet, there is no evidence of poleward range expansion into the area predicted to become suitable in future, despite good evidence for positive population growth trends in poleward populations. This study is among the first to show a marked lag between trailing edge population extinction and leading edge range expansion in a species experiencing anthropogenic climate change impacts, a pattern likely to apply to most sessile and poorly dispersed organisms. This provides support for conservative assumptions of species' migration rates when modelling climate change impacts for such species. Aloe dichotoma's response to climate change suggests that desert ecosystems may be more sensitive to climate change than previously suspected.

AB Explaining the variance of local communities in a spatial-environmental matrix is one of the core interests of ecology today. Recent progress in metacommunity theory has made a substantial contribution to this field, however good empirical data in support of available theories are still relatively scarce. In this study we sampled a cluster of 36 temporary rock pools four times during one season to assess invertebrate metacommunity structure and dynamics and to search for steering processes and variables. Both Mantel tests and redundancy models indicate that local abiotic factors were dominant over spatial factors in explaining community structure and both were acting independently. Spatial variables were only important for passive dispersers and significantly explained 11% of variation in this community component. Pools connected by temporary overflows hosted more similar communities of passive dispersers than unconnected ones while community dissimilarity significantly increased with inter-pool distance. A negative curvilinear relation was discovered between taxon richness and isolation in passive dispersers, providing some support for existing theoretical models of Mouquet and Loreau. Of different metacommunity perspectives, a combination of species sorting and mass effects best explains the observed patterns. Additionally, priority effects and monopolization may buffer against the homogenising effects of dispersal and contribute to the distinctness of isolated communities. This is one of the first studies to present evidence for spatial patterns in aquatic communities on such a small spatial scale (a rock ledge of +/- 9000 m(2)). Bridging the gap between theory and observed patterns in natural systems is one of the main challenges for future metacommunity research. Small aquatic habitats such as pitcher plants and freshwater rock pools may well have an important role to play as model systems to study ecological processes in a natural spatially explicit environment.

AB Among vertebrates, short-term elevations of glucocorticoid hormones (corticosterone or cortisol) facilitate a suite of physiological and behavioral changes aimed at overcoming environmental perturbations or other stressful events. However, chronically elevated glucocorticoids can have deleterious physiological consequences, and it is still unclear as to what constitutes an adaptive physiological response to long-term stress. In this study, we experimentally exposed European wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus to a source of long-term stress (simulated through a 2- to 4-week period of captivity) and tested whether glucocorticoid physiology predicted two major components of rabbit fitness: body condition and survival probability. Following exposure to long-term stress, moderately elevated serum corticosterone and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites levels in the wild rabbits were negatively associated with body condition, but positively associated with subsequent survival upon release. Our results suggest that the cost of maintaining elevated corticosterone levels in terms of decreased body condition is balanced by the increased chance of survival upon release.

AB Dumpling squid, Euprymna tasmanica, show consistent individual differences in behaviour that can be classified according to indices reflecting shy-bold, activity and reactivity responses. Using crosses of wild-caught single males to multiple females with known behavioural phenotypes, this study estimated patterns of additive genetic and residual variance in these behavioural traits from offspring of squid in two contexts, a threat (antipredator) and feeding (foraging) test. Genetic contributions to behavioural expression were dependent on test context. Behaviours in antipredator contexts had significant heritabilities (h(2) = 0.2-0.8) while behaviours from foraging contexts had lesser additive genetic and greater residual components (h(2) = 0.05-0.08). Personality trait variation in females was not related to her fecundity. Female boldness in foraging situations, which co-varied with body size, explained small but significant variation (similar to 21%) in brood hatching success, while successful fertilization was determined by positive assortion of mate pairs according to their shy-bold phenotype. These results are discussed in terms of the ecological and evolutionary significance of animal 'personality' traits in wild populations of animals.

AB 1. Leaf traits are commonly associated with the life history, distribution and resource requirements of a species. To improve our understanding of the ecological and physiological differences between tropical savanna and forest trees, we compared leaf traits of species native to savanna and gallery (riverine) forests in the Cerrado region of central Brazil.
   2. Congeneric species pairs from 14 different taxonomic families were studied, each with a savanna species and a forest species present at the study site. Only individuals growing in savanna conditions under full sun were studied. We measured foliar nutrients, delta(13)C, delta(15)N and specific leaf area (SLA: leaf area per unit leaf mass). We used phylogenetically independent contrasts to compare savanna and forest species and to test for correlations among species traits.
   3. Overall, leaves of forest species had 17% higher N concentration, 32% higher P concentration, and 37% higher K concentration, despite growing in similar soils. Concentrations of all three elements were strongly and positively correlated with SLA.
   4. Forest species had 52% greater SLA, on average, than savanna species, which accounts for the higher foliar nutrient concentrations of these species.
   5. Savanna species had higher delta(13)C values than forest species, indicating higher water-use efficiency. The SLA was negatively correlated with delta(13)C, suggesting that SLA may also account for the higher water-use efficiency of savanna species.
   6. There was no difference in foliar delta(15)N between savanna and forest species, but foliar delta(15)N was negatively correlated with soil pH.
   7. These results contribute to recent studies showing that tropical savanna and forest species represent two distinct functional types, with large differences in ecology and physiology, that have important consequences for the dynamics of savanna-forest boundaries.

AB In Europe, concordant geographical distribution among genetic lineages within different species is rare, which suggests distinct reactions to Quaternary ice ages. This study aims to determine whether such a discrepancy also affects a pair of sympatric species, which are morphologically and taxonomically closely related but which have slight differences in their ecological habits. The phylogeographic structures of two European rodents, the Yellow-necked fieldmouse (A. flavicollis) and the woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) were, therefore, compared on the basis of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (mtDNA cyt b) sequences (965 base pairs) from 196 specimens collected from 59 European localities spread throughout the species distributions. The results indicate that the two species survived in different ways through the Quaternary glaciations. A. sylvaticus survived in the Iberian Peninsula from where it recolonized almost all Europe at the end of the last glaciation. Conversely, the refuge from which A. flavicollis recolonized Europe, including northern Spain, during the Holocene corresponds to the Italo-Balkan area, where A. sylvaticus suffered a serious genetic bottleneck. This study confirms that even closely related species may have highly different phylogeographic histories and shows the importance of ecological plasticity of the species for their survival through climate change. Finally, it suggests that phylogeographic distinctiveness may be a general feature of European species.

AB Characterizing the potential effects of human activities on natural systems is a central problem in applied ecology. This requires the development of analytical procedures able to separate human perturbation from natural spatio-temporal variability displayed by most populations, Beyond-BACI experimental designs provide a framework to address these issues but, to date, their use is limited to the analysis of human impacts on the abundance of single species or other univariate measures. Here, we describe in detail an asymmetrical design that included 1 impact location (1) and a set of 3 controls (Cs), sampled at a hierarchy of spatial scales 4 times over a period of 15 mo, We focused on shallow subtidal assemblages of sessile organisms exposed to sewage discharge along a stretch of coast in southern Italy. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate (1) the comparison of variance components for the assessment of impacts and (2) the use of recently developed multivariate methods (distance-based premutational MANOVA) in the analysis of multivariate species data in response to a complex asymmetrical design. Results indicated that temporal changes in the whole assemblage at I were distinct from those occurring at Cs, and that the nature of this difference (although not its size) was fairly consistent through time. A suite Of tdxa was identified as important in characterizing the differences found between I and Cs. Some algae (e.g. Colpomenia sinuosa, Gelidium sp. and Pterocladiella sp.), in particular, occurred uniquely at I. Univariate analyses indicated significant Time xI-v-Cs interactions for several taxa, and significantly smaller spatial variation at the scale of quadrats at I compared to Cs. In contrast, the small-scale spatial variation in the number of taxa was significantly greater at I than at Cs. The findings of this study have important implications for future multivariate and univariate analyses in environmental impact assessment.

AB We examined the spatial patterns of 297 human-caused grizzly bear mortalities from 1971 to 2002 within the Central Rockies ecosystem (CRE) of Canada to explore relationships between mortalities and variables reflecting human development, terrain, and vegetation. Using logistic regression, we modelled the distribution of grizzly bear mortalities based on local landscape attributes as well as examining variation among demographic status, seasons, and mortality type. Grizzly bear mortalities were concentrated in three main regions of the CRE: (1) Lake Louise; (2) Banff town site; and (3) Alberta Provincial lands near the Red Deer River. We found no evidence for environmental differences in mortality locations between sexes or seasons, while sub-adult male and legal harvest mortalities were more dispersed than other mortalities. Models describing the relative risk of mortality were positively associated with human access, water, and edge features, while negatively associated with terrain ruggedness and greenness indices. Model predictions fit well with independent data. Overall, relatively little of the landscape was secure from human-caused mortality for grizzly bears. This would be most directly remedied by controlling human access. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated leaf physiological traits of dominant canopy trees in four lowland Panamanian forests with contrasting mean annual precipitation (1,800, 2,300, 3,100 and 3,500 mm). There was near complete turn-over of dominant canopy tree species among sites, resulting in greater dominance of evergreen species with long-lived leaves as precipitation increased. Mean structural and physiological traits changed along this gradient as predicted by cost-benefit theories of leaf life span. Nitrogen content per unit mass (N-mass) and light- and CO2-saturated photosynthetic rates per unit mass (P-mass) of upper canopy leaves decreased with annual precipitation, and these changes were partially explained by increasing leaf thickness and decreasing specific leaf area (SLA). Comparison of 1,800 mm and 3,100 mm sites, where canopy access was available through the use of construction cranes, revealed an association among extended leaf longevity, greater structural defense, higher midday leaf water potential, and lower P-mass, N-mass, and SLA at wetter sites. Shorter leaf life spans and more enriched foliar delta(15)N values in drier sites suggest greater resorption and re-metabolism of leaf N in drier forest. Greater dominance of short-lived leaves with relatively high P-mass in drier sites reflects a strategy to maximize photosynthesis when water is available and to minimize water loss and respiration costs during rainless periods. Overall, our study links coordinated change in leaf functional traits that affect productivity and nutrient cycling to seasonality in lowland tropical forests.

AB Since prehistoric times, natural and man made fires have been important factors of natural disturbance in many forest ecosystems, like those on the southern slopes of the Alps. Their effect on scarce, endangered or stenotopic species and on the diversity of invertebrate species assemblages which depend on a mosaic of successional habitat stages, is controversially discussed. In southern Switzerland, in a region affected by regular winter fires, we investigated the effect of the fire frequency on a large spectrum of taxonomic groups. We focussed on total biodiversity, taxonomic groups specific to certain habitat types, and on scarce and endangered species. Overall species richness was significantly higher in plots with repeated fires than in the unburnt control sites. Plots with only one fire in the last 30 yr harboured intermediate species numbers. Fire frequency had a significantly positive effect on species richness of the guilds of interior forest species and forest edge specialists. Species of open landscape, open forests and interior forests were not influenced by fire frequency. A positive effect of fire on species richness was observed for ground beetles (Carabidae), hoverflies (Syrphidae), bees and wasps (Hymenoptera aculeata, without Formicidae), and spiders (Araneae). True bugs (Heteroptera), lacewings (Neuroptera) and the saproxylic beetle families Cerambycidae, Buprestidae and Lucanidae showed positive trends, but no statistically significant effects of fire on species numbers or/and abundances. Negative effects of fire on species numbers or/and abundances were found only for isopods and weevils (Curculionidae). A compromise for forest management is suggested, which considers the risk of damage by fire to people and goods, while avoiding the risk of damage to biodiversity by imitating the effects of sporadic fires and providing a mosaic forest with open gaps of different successional stages.

AB Traditional models of sexual selection propose that partner choice increases both average male and average female fitness in a population. Recent theoretical and empirical work, however, has stressed that sexual conflict may be a potent broker of sexual selection. When the fitness interests of males and females diverge, a reproductive strategy that increases the fitness of one sex may decrease the fitness of the other sex. The chase-away hypothesis proposes that sexual conflict promotes sexually antagonistic, rather than mutualistic, coevolution, whereby manipulative reproductive strategies in one sex are counteracted by the evolution of resistance to such strategies in the other sex. In this paper, we consider the criteria necessary to demonstrate the chase-away hypothesis. Specifically, we review sexual conflict with particular emphasis on the chase-away hypothesis; discuss the problems associated with testing the predictions of the chase-away hypothesis and the extent to which these predictions and the predictions of traditional models of sexual selection are mutually exclusive; discuss misconceptions and mismeasures of sexual conflict; and suggest an alternative approach to demonstrate sexual conflict, measure the intensity of sexually antagonistic selection in a population, and elucidate the coevolutionary trajectories of the sexes.

AB We performed a combined analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite loci among lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) populations in order to assess the levels of congruence between both types of markers in defining patterns of genetic structuring, introgressive hybridization and inferring population origins in the hybrid zone of the St. John River basin. a second objective was to test the hypothesis that secondary contact between glacial lineages always resulted in the occurrence of sympatric dwarf and normal whitefish ecotypes. Fish were sampled from 35 populations and polymorphism was screened at mtDNA and sir microsatellite loci for a total of 688 and 763 whitefish, respectively. Four lakes harbouring a single whitefish population of normal ecotype admired with mtDNA haplotypes of different lineages were found. This confirmed that secondary contact between whitefish evolutionary lineages did not always result in the persistence of reproductively isolated ecotypes. Microsatellites further supported the definition of distinct glacial lineages by identifying lineage-specific allelic size groups. They also further supported the hypothesis that ecotypes originated from either a single founding lineage (sympatric divergence) or following secondary contacts between lineages (allopatric divergence), depending on the lake. In general, however, the pattern of population differentiation and introgressive hybridization observed at microsatellites was in sharp contrast with that depicted by mtDNA variation. Both factorial correspondence analysis and analysis of admixture proportion revealed a much more pronounced pattern of introgressive hybridization than depicted by mtDNA analyses. Variable levels of introgression indicated that environmental differences may be as important as the historical contingency of secondary contact in explaining the persistence of sympatric ecotypes and the differential pattern of introgressive hybridization among lakes. Whitefish populations from the St. John River basin hybrid zone represent a rare illustration of a continuum of both morphological and genetic differentiation within a given taxon, spanning from complete introgression to possibly complete reproductive isolation, depending on lakes. Thus, each lake may be viewed as a different temporal snapshot taken throughout the gradual process of speciation.

AB Crabs of the subfamily Sesarminae are important components of mangrove ecosystems in the Indo-west Pacific, Africa, the Caribbean and South America. By retaining a large proportion of mangrove leaf-litter within mangrove forests, they profoundly influence the functioning of mangrove ecosystems. Despite obvious importance to ecosystem functioning, Little is known about predation on sesarmid crabs. Three large, predatory fishes of tropical Indo-Pacific estuaries, the groupers Epinephelus coioides and E. malabaricus and the snapper Lutjanus argentimaculatus are known to feed on brachyuran crabs. However, the contribution of sesarmids to the brachyuran component of the diets of these fishes is unknown. To determine the extent to which these fishes prey on sesarmid crabs, the gut contents and stable isotope values (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of E. coioides, E. malabaricus, and L. argentimaculatus from 3 mangrove estuary systems on the northeast coast of tropical Australia were investigated. All 3 species fed extensively on sesarmid crabs. Sesarmid crabs were the dominant food items for E. malabaricus and L, argentimaculatus, occurring in 50 % of the stomachs that contained prey, and being the most common prey in terms of overall numbers. Although still the dominant prey, sesarmids occurred in only 30 % of E. coioides stomachs. As well as being numerically dominant, sesarmids were large relative to other prey types. The 3 species also had stable isotope values enriched by about +0.75 to +2 delta(13)C and +1.5 to +2,5 delta(15)N, which were also consistent with extensive feeding on these crabs. Most other sympatric species had quite different diets and stable isotope profiles. Extensive feeding on sesarmid crabs by these fishes has a range of implications for the ecology of tropical mangrove ecosystems. Food webs are apparently more complex, and food chains leading from mangroves to top predators may be shorter than previously thought. Furthermore, a substantial part of the mangrove productivity sequestered by sesarmid crabs may be exported from mangrove ecosystems as a result of offshore migration by these fishes. The low incidence of piscivory in these fishes adds support to theories that reduced predation pressure may enhance the nursery ground value of tropical mangrove systems for fishes.

AB We examined the ability of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) to preferentially infest or reject various phytoplankton species and nonliving particles. Our objective was to determine if preferential ingestion by zebra mussels could explain the changes observed in the Hudson River since their invasion: (1) decline of cyanobacteria, Microcystis in particular, (2) rise to dominance by diatoms, and (3) very small change in total seston load. We found that zebra mussels are capable of efficiently sorting and rejecting particles. Not only were clearance rates higher when the cyanobacterium Microcystis was present in suspension, but Microcystis was preferentially ingested over almost all other particle types tested. Diatoms were generally rejected as diffuse pseudofeces which were easily resuspended, even in still water. The rejection of cattail (Typha) detritus by zebra mussels corresponds to the rejection by oysters (Crassostrea virginica) of cord grass (Spartina) detritus particles (Ward et al. 1998). Pseudofeces of clay or detritus particle types were also very diffuse. In a few cases, however, clay or detritus particles, rather than phytoplankton cells, were preferentially ingested by zebra mussels. The interaction of selective feeding by zebra mussels with resuspension of diffuse biodeposits by tidal mixing may explain the differential decline of phytoplankton groups and nonliving particles in the Hudson River.

AB Understanding edge effects in different remnants of natural vegetation is crucial for the management of many fragmented landscapes. We compared edges of different wooded habitats in a fragmented tropical rainforest in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Selected habitats in a pasture matrix included four forest fragments (>50 ha), four linear forest remnants along streams (riparian forest), and eight isolated remnant forest trees (four fenced and four without fences). Edge habitats were defined in terms of microclimate, vegetation structure, and floristic composition. In forest-pasture sites, significant edge effects were detected for some variables but depth of influence varied Compared to the other habitats, riparian sites and isolated trees without fences exhibited distinct edge conditions. isolated trees fenced for 54 months, however, exhibited some microenvironmental conditions similar tc, those of forest interior. In total, 244 woody plant species were recorded in the sampled area (<1 ha), and these represented 56% of woody, species reported for Los Tuxtlas reserve. Only two species, Acalypha diversifolia and Siparuna andina, occurred in the interior, edge, and pasture of all studied landscape units. Twelve species occurred in all edges and pastures (e.g., Acacia mayana, Tabernaemontana arborea, Cupania glabra, Stemmadenia donnell-smithii). Twenty-six species were found exclusively at edges whereas 44 species were recorded only in interiors. Fenced, isolated trees can provide a suitable habitat for the establishment of several primary-forest trees (e.g., Nectandra spp). Many primary-forest species were found in the fragmented habitats we studied, suggesting that these species are not lost in fragmented landscapes and that plant diversity loss is probably proceeding slowly,. Collectively, riparian strips and isolated trees in a pasture matrix could effectively function as a focus for rainforest regeneration. Riparian strips and frees, therefore, need to be incorporated into landscape designs for maintaining and enhancing ecological diversity.

AB 1 If, within a vegetation type, fire regimes are climate dependent, then fire patterns should be synchronous at regional scales. If they are not synchronous, then fires may be dependent on local processes such as human-induced disturbances.
   2 Two fire chronologies were developed using 34-radiocarbon dating measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) from wood charcoal buried in soil. These charcoal fragments were sampled in two study sites 10 km apart in the Maurienne valley (Southern Vanoise massif, Savoy, France).
   3 Asynchronous temporal fire patterns were seen at Aussois and Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne. This demonstrates the dependence of fires on local- or stand-scale environmental forcing; any direct relationship with climate is therefore rejected.
   4 Slash-and-burn practices are probably the main source of Holocene fires in the Maurienne valley. However, deforestation did not occur throughout a site in any period, nor simultaneously at the same elevation in two different sites 10 km apart. The cultural landscape was shaped as early as the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, between 6000 and 3000 sp.
   5 Deforestation at both study sites probably occurred in many stages in many small areas. The fire intervals were c. 500-1000 years. Deforested areas increased in extent over 2000-4000 years, until the present-day cultural landscape was established. This process stopped c. 2500 sp at Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne but is still active at Aussois.

AB A fundamental question in plant ecology is if and how the intensity of competition changes with productivity. This question has been the source of considerable discussion during the last two decades, yet few experiments have tested whether competition intensity changes with productivity in nature. Even fewer studies have separated competition into its above- and belowground components in the field. We used a field experiment to measure total competition intensity and its above- and belowground components in two wetlands that represent extremes in habitat productivity: an infertile sandy shoreline and a fertile bay. Transplants of Lythrum salicaria and Carer crinita were grown with no neighbors, with roots of neighbors only, and with roots and shoots of neighbors; their growth rates were used to measure competition intensity (CI). The experiment was carried out to answer the following main questions: (1) Is there a difference in total, above- and ground competition intensity in two wetlands that differ in standing crop? and (2) Is there an effect of standing crop on total, above- and belowground competition intensity when the data from the two wetlands are combined?
   Results based on the average of both species show that total and aboveground competition intensity were greater in the high standing crop wetland, but belowground competition did not differ between wetlands (CITOTAL: P < 0.00001, CIABOVE: P = 0.0013, CIBELOW:P = 0.58). Total and aboveground competition intensity were significantly affected by standing crop in the wetlands studied but belowground competition intensity was not (Cl-TOTAL: P = 0.0001, CIABOVE: P = 0.0001, CIBELOW: P = 0.89). Results based on the two species separately show that species vary in their sensitivity to competition in wetland communities.

AB Analysing communities of soil bacteria under differing nutrient concentrations, the authors show that extensive growth with high levels of nutrients results in stronger interactions among species, leading to declines in biodiversity and stability.
   Organisms-especially microbes-tend to live together in ecosystems. While some of these ecosystems are very biodiverse, others are not, and while some are very stable over time, others undergo strong temporal fluctuations. Despite a long history of research and a plethora of data, it is not fully understood what determines the biodiversity and stability of ecosystems. Theory and experiments suggest a connection between species interaction, biodiversity and the stability of ecosystems, where an increase in ecosystem stability with biodiversity could be observed in several cases. However, what causes these connections remains unclear. Here, we show in microbial ecosystems in the laboratory that the concentrations of available nutrients can set the strength of interactions between bacteria. High nutrient concentrations allowed the bacteria to strongly alter the chemical environment, causing on average more negative interactions between species. These stronger interactions excluded more species from the community, resulting in a loss of biodiversity. At the same time, the stronger interactions also decreased the stability of the microbial communities, providing a mechanistic link between species interaction, biodiversity and stability in microbial ecosystems.

AB Researchers often mention the utility and need for R-squared measures of explained variance for multilevel models (MLMs). Although this topic has been addressed by methodologists, the MLM R-squared literature suffers from several shortcomings: (a) analytic relationships among existing measures have not been established so measures equivalent in the population have been redeveloped 2 or 3 times; (b) a completely full partitioning of variance has not been used to create measures, leading to gaps in the availability of measures to address key substantive questions; (c) a unifying approach to interpreting and choosing among measures has not been provided, leading to researchers' difficulty with implementation; and (d) software has inconsistently and infrequently incorporated available measures. We address these issues with the following contributions. We develop an integrative framework of R-squared measures for MLMs with random intercepts and/or slopes based on a completely full decomposition of variance. We analytically relate 10 existing measures from different disciplines as special cases of 5 measures from our framework. We show how our framework fills gaps by supplying additional total and level-specific measures that answer new substantive research questions. To facilitate interpretation, we provide a novel and integrative graphical representation of all the measures in the framework; we use it to demonstrate limitations of current reporting practices for MLM R-squareds, as well as benefits of considering multiple measures from the framework in juxtaposition. We supply and empirically illustrate an R function, r2MLM, that computes all measures in our framework to help researchers in considering effect size and conveying practical significance.
   Translational Abstract
   R-squared measures are useful indications of effect size that are ubiquitously reported for single-level regression models. For multilevel models (MLMs), wherein observations are nested within clusters (e.g., students nested within schools), researchers likewise often mention the utility and necessity of R-squared measures; however, they find it difficult to relate, interpret, and choose among alternative existing measures, especially in the context of random slopes. Though methodologists have addressed this topic, the MLM R-squared literature suffers from several shortcomings: (a) the relationships among existing measures have not been established, leading to certain measures being redeveloped multiple times; (b) previous sets of measures have not considered all of the different ways that variance can be explained in MLMs, leading to gaps in the availability of measures to address key substantive questions; (c) a unifying approach to interpreting and choosing among measures has not been provided; and (d) existing software rarely incorporates available measures. In this article, we develop an integrative framework of R-squared measures for MLMs with random intercepts and/or slopes that addresses each of these shortcomings. We show that 10 existing measures are special cases of those from our framework, and show how our framework fills gaps by also supplying novel total and level-specific measures that answer important research questions. To facilitate interpretation, we introduce a unified graphical representation of all of the measures in our framework. We also demonstrate limitations of current R-squared reporting practices, and explain how considering our full framework overcomes these. We supply and illustrate new software that computes all of our measures to help researchers in considering effect size in MLM applications.

AB The increasing use of species distribution modeling (SDM) has raised new concerns regarding the inaccuracies, misunderstanding, and misuses of this important tool. One of those possible pitfalls - collinearity among environmental predictors - is assumed as an important source of model uncertainty, although it has not been subjected to a detailed evaluation in recent SDM studies. It is expected that collinearity will increase uncertainty in model parameters and decrease statistical power. Here we use a virtual species approach to compare models built using subsets of PCA-derived variables with models based on the original highly correlated climate variables. Moreover, we evaluated whether modelling algorithms and species data characteristics generate models with varying sensitivity to collinearity. As expected, collinearity among predictors decreases the efficiency and increases the uncertainty of species distribution models. Nevertheless, the intensity of the effect varied according to the algorithm properties: more complex procedures behaved better than simple envelope models. This may support the claim that complex models such as Maxent take advantage of existing collinearity in finding the best set of parameters. The interaction of the different factors with species characteristics (centroid and tolerance in environmental space) highlighted the importance of the so-called "idiosyncrasy in species responses" to model efficiency, but differences in prevalence may represent a better explanation. However, even models with low accuracy to predict suitability of individual cells may provide meaningful information on the estimation of range-size, a key species-trait for macroecological studies. We concluded that the use of PCA-derived variables is advised both to control the negative effects of collinearity and as a more objective solution for the problem of variable selection in studies dealing with large number of species with heterogeneous responses to environmental variables.

AB Forest trees compete for light and soil resources, but photoassimilates, once produced in the foliage, are not considered to be exchanged between individuals. Applying stable carbon isotope labeling at the canopy scale, we show that carbon assimilated by 40-meter-tall spruce is traded over to neighboring beech, larch, and pine via overlapping root spheres. Isotope mixing signals indicate that the interspecific, bidirectional transfer, assisted by common ectomycorrhiza networks, accounted for 40% of the fine root carbon ( about 280 kilograms per hectare per year tree-to-tree transfer). Although competition for resources is commonly considered as the dominant tree-to-tree interaction in forests, trees may interact in more complex ways, including substantial carbon exchange.

TI Global functional diversity of freshwater fish is concentrated in the

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID PATTERNS; TRAIT
AB Worldwide biodiversity assessments have mainly focused on species richness but little is known about the diversity of species roles, i.e. functional diversity, while this is a key facet to understanding the consequences of global changes on the ecosystem services to human societies. Here, we report the world pattern of functional diversity of freshwater fish using a database encompassing morphological characteristics of more than 9,000 species. The Neotropical realm hosts more than 75% of global functional diversity while other realms each host less than 25%. This discrepancy is mediated by high functional uniqueness in some diversified Neotropical fish orders. Surprisingly, functional diversity patterns were weakly related to functional vulnerability. In the Neotropics the loss of threatened species will cause a limited loss of functional diversity (<10%) whereas in the Nearctic and Palearctic realms, decline of the functional diversity will reach 43% and 33%, respectively, conferring a high functional vulnerability to these realms. Conservation of the Neotropical fish diversity is a key target to maintain world fish functional diversity, but this should not hide the pressing need to conserve the vulnerable fish faunas of the rest of the world, in which functional diversity is to a large extent supported by threatened species.

AB Microbiomes play a critical role in promoting a range of host functions. Microbiome function, in turn, is dependent on its community composition. Yet, how microbiome taxa are assembled from their regional species pool remains unclear. Many possible drivers have been hypothesized, including deterministic processes of competition, stochastic processes of colonization and migration, and physiological host-effect' habitat filters. The contribution of each to assembly in nascent or perturbed microbiomes is important for understanding host-microbe interactions and host health. In this study, we characterized the bacterial communities in a euryhaline fish and the surrounding tank water during salinity acclimation. To assess the relative influence of stochastic versus deterministic processes in fish microbiome assembly, we manipulated the bacterial species pool around each fish by changing the salinity of aquarium water. Our results show a complete and repeatable turnover of dominant bacterial taxa in the microbiomes from individuals of the same species after acclimation to the same salinity. We show that changes in fish microbiomes are not correlated with corresponding changes to abundant taxa in tank water communities and that the dominant taxa in fish microbiomes are rare in the aquatic surroundings, and vice versa. Our results suggest that bacterial taxa best able to compete within the unique host environment at a given salinity appropriate the most niche space, independent of their relative abundance in tank water communities. In this experiment, deterministic processes appear to drive fish microbiome assembly, with little evidence for stochastic colonization.

AB Here, we incorporate facilitation into trait-based community assembly theory by testing two mutually compatible facilitative mechanisms: changes in the environmental filter, causing either an increase in the range of trait values (i.e. a range expansion effect) and/or a shift in trait distributions (i.e. a range shift effect); and changes in trait spacing, suggesting an effect on niche differentiation. We analyzed the distribution of three functional traits leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area and lateral spread of plant communities dominated by a cushion-forming foundation species at four sites differing in elevation and aspect. We found support for environmental filtering and niche differentiation mechanisms by cushions, with filtering effects (in particular range shifts) increasing with environmental severity at higher elevation. The effect size of cushions on trait distribution was similar to that of environmental gradients caused by elevation and aspect. The consideration of intraspecific trait variability improved the detection of cushion effects on trait distributions. Our results highlight the importance of facilitation in the modification of taxonomic and functional diversity of ecological communities, and indicate that facilitation can occur through combined effects on environmental filtering and niche differentiation, with strong environmental context dependence of each mechanism.

AB Global warming has created a need for studies along climatic gradients to assess the effects of temperature on ecological processes. Altitudinal and latitudinal gradients are often used as such, usually in combination with air temperature data from the closest weather station recorded at 1.52 m above the ground. However, many ecological processes occur in, at, or right above the soil surface. To evaluate how representative the commonly used weather station data are for the microclimate relevant for soil surface biota, we compared weather station temperatures for an altitudinal (500900 m a.s.l.) and a latitudinal gradient (4968 degrees N) with data obtained by temperature sensors placed right below the soil surface at five sites along these gradients. The mean annual temperatures obtained from weather stations and adjusted using a lapse rate of -5.5 degrees C km-1 were between 3.8 degrees C lower and 1.6 degrees C higher than those recorded by the temperature sensors at the soil surface, depending on the position along the gradients. The monthly mean temperatures were up to 10 degrees C warmer or 5 degrees C colder at the soil surface. The within-site variation in accumulated temperature was as high as would be expected from a 300 m change in altitude or from a 4 degrees change in latitude or a climate change scenario corresponding to warming of 1.63.8 degrees C. Thus, these differences introduced by the decoupling are significant from a climate change perspective, and the results demonstrate the need for incorporating microclimatic variation when conducting studies along altitudinal or latitudinal gradients. We emphasize the need for using relevant temperature data in climate impact studies and further call for more studies describing the soil surface microclimate, which is crucial for much of the biota.

AB A 274-lake calibration data-set for chironomid-based temperature reconstruction is presented which is based on the taxonomic amalgamation of a 117-lake data-set from Switzerland and a 157-lake data-set from Norway and Svalbard. Taxonomic consistency of the two data-sets was ensured by joint microscope sessions by the two involved analysts, re-identifying chironomid assemblages in the Swiss data-set to reach an identical taxonomic resolution as in the Norwegian data, and by double-checking selected samples of the Norwegian calibration data-set. The combined Swiss-Norwegian calibration data-set contains information on the distribution of 154 chironomid taxa over a July air temperature range of 3.5-18.4 degrees C, a pH range of 4.7-8.8, and an altitudinal range of 5-2815 m asl from lakes in temperate, subarctic, arctic, and alpine environments. Inference models developed based on this data-set using weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression outperformed inference models based on maximum likelihood regression. After outlier deletion WA-PLS regression predicted July air temperature with a bootstrapped (cross-validated) root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.40 degrees C. Inference models developed from the separate regional data-sets have an RMSEP of 1.16 and 1.43 degrees C for the Norwegian and the Swiss calibration data-set, respectively. The WA-PLS inference model based on the Norwegian data-set adequately predicted July air temperature based on chironomid assemblages in the Swiss data-set (RMSEP 2.05 degrees C; r(2) 0.74). In contrast, the WA-PLS model based on the Swiss chironomid assemblages performed poorly in inferring July air temperatures based on the Norwegian chironomid assemblages (RMSEP 2.70 degrees C; r(2) 039). We attribute this discrepancy to the large proportion of chironomid taxa in Norwegian samples not represented in the Swiss data-set, the larger range of both pH and lake types included in the Norwegian calibration data-set, and the lack of some chironomid taxa with an arctic and boreal distribution in the Swiss data-set. The WA-PLS inference model based on the combined Swiss-Norwegian calibration data-set is the largest taxonomically consistent chironomid-based inference model available to date and outperforms other existing models if the r(2) and RMSEP relative to the overall temperature gradient are examined. We demonstrate that the combined model can reconstruct a larger range of temperatures when applied to fossil assemblages than models based on the Norwegian or Swiss calibration data-sets only. The combined data-set includes the majority of chironomid taxa expected in late Pleistocene and Holocene sediments of lakes from Northern, Eastern, and Central Europe as well as from southern European mountain lakes. The newly developed WA-PLS inference model is therefore well suited for developing continental-scale reconstructions of late Quaternary temperature change based on chironomid records from different parts of Europe.

AB Although the maintenance of diversity of living systems is critical for ecosystem functioning, the accelerating pace of global change is threatening its preservation. Standardized methods for biodiversity assessment and monitoring are needed. Species diversity is one of the most widely adopted metrics for assessing patterns and processes of biodiversity, at both ecological and biogeographic scales. However, those perspectives differ because of the types of data that can be feasibly collected, resulting in differences in the questions that can be addressed. Despite a theoretical consensus on diversity metrics, standardized methods for its measurement are lacking, especially at the scales needed to monitor biodiversity for conservation and management purposes. We review the conceptual framework for species diversity, examine common metrics, and explore their use for biodiversity conservation and management. Key differences in diversity measures at ecological and biogeographic scales are the completeness of species lists and the ability to include information on species abundances. We analyse the major pitfalls and problems with quantitative measurement of species diversity, look at the use of weighting measures by phylogenetic distance, discuss potential solutions and propose a research agenda to solve the major existing problems.

AB Large herbivores are keystone species in many forest areas, as they shape the structure, species diversity and functioning of those ecosystems. The European bison Bison bonasus has been successfully restored after extinction in the wild at the beginning of 20th century. As free-ranging populations of the species were re-established mainly in forest habitats, knowledge of the impact by the largest European terrestrial mammal on tree stands is essential. This helps to make management and conservation decisions for viable population maintenance of the species in the wild. Using a novel DNA-based method of herbivore diet analysis, the trnL approach (DNA-barcoding), we investigated the influence of different foraging conditions (access to supplementary fodder) on bison diet in winter and its potential impact on woody species. Faecal samples were collected from different bison treatment groups: (1) intensively fed; (2) less intensively fed; (3) non-fed utilising forest habitats; and (4) non-fed utilising agricultural areas surrounding the Forest. These were analysed to estimate the proportion of different plant groups consumed by bison. Bison groups differed significantly in their diet. The amount of woody materials (trees and shrubs) consumed by bison increased with decreasing access to supplementary fodder, ranging from 16% in intensively fed bison to 65% in non-fed bison utilising forest habitats. Inversely, the amount of herbs, grasses and sedges decreased from 82% in intensively fed bison to 32% in non fed bison utilising forest habitats. The species of trees mainly browsed by bison, Carpinus/Corylus, Betula sp. and Salix sp., were of lower economic importance for forest management. The impact of bison on tree species needs further investigation, however, we can predict that browsing by bison, mainly on Carpinus/Corylus, makes an insignificant impact on forestry due to the high and increasing representation of this species in the forest understory. Supplementary feeding has several negative effects on bison ecology and health, therefore reduced and distributed supplementary feeding should be applied as the management practice in the Bialowieza Forest.

AB Understanding the impacts of plant community characteristics on soil carbon dioxide efflux (R) is a key prerequisite for accurate prediction of the future carbon (C) balance of terrestrial ecosystems under climate change. However, developing a mechanistic understanding of the determinants of R is complicated by the presence of multiple different sources of respiratory C within soil - such as soil microbes, plant roots and their mycorrhizal symbionts - each with their distinct dynamics and drivers. In this review, we synthesize relevant information from a wide spectrum of sources to evaluate the current state of knowledge about plant community effects on R, examine how this information is incorporated into global climate models, and highlight priorities for future research. Despite often large variation amongst studies and methods, several general trends emerge.
   Mechanisms whereby plants affect R may be grouped into effects on belowground C allocation, aboveground litter properties and microclimate. Within vegetation types, the amount of C diverted belowground, and hence R, may be controlled mainly by the rate of photosynthetic C uptake, while amongst vegetation types this should be more dependent upon the specific C allocation strategies of the plant life form. We make the case that plant community composition, rather than diversity, is usually the dominant control on R in natural systems. Individual species impacts on R may be largest where the species accounts for most of the biomass in the ecosystem, has very distinct traits to the rest of the community and/or modulates the occurrence of major natural disturbances. We show that climate vegetation models incorporate a number of pathways whereby plants can affect R, but that simplifications regarding allocation schemes and drivers of litter decomposition may limit model accuracy. We also suggest that under a warmer future climate, many plant communities may shift towards dominance by fast growing plants which produce large quantities of nutrient rich litter. Where this community shift occurs, it could drive an increase in R beyond that expected from direct climate impacts on soil microbial activity alone.
   We identify key gaps in knowledge and recommend them as priorities for future work. These include the patterns of photosynthate partitioning amongst belowground components, ecosystem level effects of individual plant traits, and the importance of trophic interactions and species invasions or extinctions for ecosystem processes. A final, overarching challenge is how to link these observations and drivers across spatio-temporal scales to predict regional or global changes in R over long time periods. A more unified approach to understanding R, which integrates information about plant traits and community dynamics, will be essential for better understanding, simulating and predicting patterns of R across terrestrial ecosystems and its role within the earth-climate system.

AB Aim
   We wanted to test whether urbanization has similar effects on biodiversity in different locations, comparing the responses of ground beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) assemblages with an urbanization gradient. We also wanted to see if urbanization had a homogenizing effect on ground beetle assemblages.
   Locations
   Nine forested temperate locations in Europe, Canada and Japan.
   Methods
   Published results of the Globenet Project were used. At all locations, three stages were identified: (1) a forested (rural) area, (2) a suburban area where the original forest was fragmented and isolated, and (3) remnants of the original forest in urban parks. These habitats formed an urbanization series. Study arrangements (number and operation of traps) and methods (pitfall trapping) were identical, conforming to the Globenet protocol. Assemblage composition and diversity patterns were evaluated. Diversity relationships were analysed by the Renyi diversity ordering method considering all ground beetles and - separately - the forest specialist species. Taxonomic homogenization was examined by multivariate methods using assemblage similarities.
   Results
   Overall biodiversity (compared by species richness and diversity ordering) showed inconsistent trends by either urbanization intensity or by geographic position. However, when only forest species were compared, diversity was higher in the original rural (forested) areas than in urban forest fragments. Within-country similarities of carabid assemblages were always higher than within-urbanization stage similarities.
   Main conclusions
   Urbanization does not appear to cause a decrease in ground beetle diversity per se. Forest species decline as urbanization intensifies but this trend is masked by an influx of non-forest species. The rural faunas were more similar to the urban ones within the same location than similar urbanization stages were to each other, indicating that urbanization did not homogenize the taxonomic composition of ground beetle faunas across the studied locations.

AB Powerful and accurate detection of first-generation (F1) hybrids and backcrosses in nature is needed to achieve a better understanding of the function and dynamics of introgression. To document the frequency of ongoing interspecific gene exchange between two Mediterranean evergreen oaks, the cork oak (Quercus suber) and the holm oak (Q. ilex), we analyzed 1487 individuals originating from across the range of the two species using eight microsatellite loci and two Bayesian clustering approaches (implemented in the programs STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS). Simulated data were used to assess the differences between the two clustering methods and to back up the choice of the threshold value for the posterior probability to discriminate admixed from pure individuals. We found that the use of STRUCTURE resulted in the highest power to detect hybrids, whereas NEWHYBRIDS provided the highest accuracy. Irrespective of the approach, the two species were clearly distinguished as independent genetic entities without any prior information. In contrast with previous reports, we found no evidence for unidirectional introgression. The overall hybridization rate was very low (< 2% of introgressed individuals). Only two individuals were identified as F1 hybrids and five as early backcrosses. This work shows that the combined application of the two complementary Bayesian approaches and their systematic validation with simulations, fit for the case at hand, helps gain resolution in the identification of admixed individuals.

AB Leaf-level determinants of species environmental stress tolerance are still poorly understood. Here, we explored dependencies of species shade (T-shade) and drought (T-drought) tolerance scores on key leaf structural and functional traits in 339 Northern Hemisphere temperate woody species.
   In general, T-shade was positively associated with leaf life-span (L-L), and negatively with leaf dry mass (M-A), nitrogen content (N-A), and photosynthetic capacity (A(A)) per area, while opposite relationships were observed with drought tolerance. Different trait combinations responsible for T-shade and T-drought were observed among the key plant functional types: deciduous and evergreen broadleaves and evergreen conifers.
   According to principal component analysis, resource-conserving species with low N content and photosynthetic capacity, and high L-L and M-A, had higher T-drought, consistent with the general stress tolerance strategy, whereas variation in T-shade did not concur with the postulated stress tolerance strategy.
   As drought and shade often interact in natural communities, reverse effects of foliar traits on these key environmental stress tolerances demonstrate that species niche differentiation is inherently constrained in temperate woody species. Different combinations of traits among key plant functional types further explain the contrasting bivariate correlations often observed in studies seeking functional explanation of variation in species environmental tolerances.

AB Understanding seedling performance across resource gradients is crucial for defining the regeneration niche of plant species under current environmental conditions and for predicting potential changes under a global change scenario. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to determine how seedling survival and growth of two evergreen and two deciduous Quercus species vary along gradients of light and soil properties in two Mediterranean forests with contrasting soils and climatic conditions. Half the seedlings were subjected to an irrigation treatment during the first year to quantify the effects on performance of an alteration in the summer drought intensity. Linear and non-linear models were parameterized and compared to identify major resources controlling seedling performance. We found both site-specific and general patterns of regeneration. Strong site-specificity was found in the identity of the best predictors of seedling survival: survival decreased linearly with increasing light (i.e. increasing desiccation risk) in the drier site, whereas it decreased logistically with increasing spring soil water content (i.e. increasing waterlogging risk) in the wetter site. We found strong empirical support for multiple resource limitation at the drier site, the response to light being modulated by the availability of soil resources (water and P). Evidence for regeneration niche partitioning among Quercus species was only found at the wetter site. However, at both sites Quercus species shared the same response to summer drought alleviation through water addition: increased first-year survival but not final survival (i.e. after two years). This suggests that extremely dry summers (i.e. the second summer in the experiment) can cancel out the positive effects of previous wetter summers. Therefore, an increase in the intensity and frequency of summer drought with climate change might cause a double negative impact on Quercus regeneration, due to a general reduction in survival probability and the annulment of the positive effects of (infrequent) 'wet' years. Overall, results presented in this study are a major step towards the development of a mechanistic model of Mediterranean forest dynamics that incorporates the idiosyncrasies and generalities of tree regeneration in these systems, and that allow simulation and prediction of the ecological consequences of resource level alterations due to global change.

AB The origin of new species can be influenced by both deterministic and stochastic factors. Mate choice and natural selection may be important deterministic causes of speciation (as opposed to the essentially stochastic factors of geographic isolation and genetic drift). Theoretical models predict that speciation is more likely when mate choice depends on an ecologically important trait that is subject to divergent natural selection, although many authors have considered such mating/ecology pleiotropy, or "magic-traits" to be unlikely. However, phenotypic signals are important in both mate choice and ecological processes such as avoiding predation. In chemically defended species, it may be that the phenotypic characteristics influencing mate choice are the same signals being used to transmit a warning to potential predators, although few studies have demonstrated this in wild populations. We tested for assortative mating between two color morphs of the Strawberry Poison-Dart Frog, Dendrobates pumilio, a group with striking geographic variation in aposematic color patterns. We found that females significantly prefer individuals of their own morph under two different light treatments, indicating strong assortative mating based on multiple coloration cues that are also important ecological signals. This study provides a rare example of one phenotypic trait affecting both ecological viability and nonrandom mating, indicating that mating/ecology pleiotropy is plausible in wild populations, particularly for organisms that are aposematically colored and visually orienting.

AB Empirical evidence supporting the commonality of gene x gene interactions, coupled with frequent failure to replicate results from previous association studies, has prompted statisticians to develop methods to handle this important subject. Nonparametric methods have generated intense interest because of their capacity to handle high-dimensional data. Genome-wide association analysis of large-scale SNP data is challenging mathematically and computationally. In this paper, we describe major issues and questions arising from this challenge, along with methodological implications. Data reduction and pattern recognition methods seem to be the new frontiers in efforts to detect gene x gene interactions comprehensively. Currently, there is no single method that is recognized as the 'best' for detecting, characterizing, and interpreting gene x gene interactions. Instead, a combination of approaches with the aim of balancing their specific strengths may be the optimal approach to investigate gene x gene interactions in human data. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

AB Background noise should in theory hinder detection of auditory cues associated with approaching danger. We tested whether foraging chaffinches Fringilla coelebs responded to background noise by increasing vigilance, and examined whether this was explained by predation risk compensation or by a novel stimulus hypothesis. The former predicts that only inter-scan interval should be modified in the presence of background noise, not vigilance levels generally. This is because noise hampers auditory cue detection and increases perceived predation risk primarily when in the head-down position, and also because previous tests have shown that only interscan interval is correlated with predator detection ability in this system. Chaffinches only modified interscan interval supporting this hypothesis. At the same time they made significantly fewer pecks when feeding during the background noise treatment and so the increased vigilance led to a reduction in intake rate, suggesting that compensating for the increased predation risk could indirectly lead to a fitness cost. Finally, the novel stimulus hypothesis predicts that chaffinches should habituate to the noise, which did not occur within a trial or over 5 subsequent trials. We conclude that auditory cues may be an important component of the trade-off between vigilance and feeding, and discuss possible implications for anti-predation theory and ecological processes.

AB Members of the Planctomycetes, which were once thought to occur primarily in aquatic environments, have been discovered in soils on five continents, revealing that these Bacteria are a widespread and numerically abundant component of microbial communities in soil. We examined the diversity of Planctomycetes in soil samples obtained from experimental plots at an agricultural site in order to assess the extent of Planctomycetes diversity in soil, to determine whether management effects such as past land cover and compost addition affected the composition of the Planctomycetes community, and to determine whether the observations made could provide insight into the ecological distribution of these organisms. Analysis of Planctomycetes 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a total of 312 +/- 35 unique phylotypes in the soil at the site examined. The majority of these Planctomycetes sequences were unique, and the sequences had phylogenetic affiliations that included all major lineages in the Planctomycetaceae, as well as several novel groups of deeply divergent Planctomycetes. Both soil management history and compost amendment had significant effects on the Planctomycetes diversity, and variations in soil organic matter, Ca2+ content, and pH were associated with variations in the Planctomycetes community composition. In addition, Planctomycetes richness increased in proportion to the area sampled and was correlated with the spatial heterogeneity of nitrate, which was associated with the soil management history at the orchard site examined. This report provides the first systematic assessment of the diversity of Planctomycetes in soil and also provides evidence that the diversity of this group increases with area as defined by the general power law description of the taxon-area relationship.

ID ADAPTIVE RADIATION; EVOLUTION; CONSERVATISM; PATTERNS
AB A significant proportion of the global diversity of flowering plants has evolved in recent geological time, probably through adaptive radiation into new niches. However, rapid evolution is at odds with recent research which has suggested that plant ecological traits, including the beta- (or habitat) niche, evolve only slowly. We have quantified traits that determine within-habitat alpha diversity (alpha niches) in two communities in which species segregate on hydrological gradients. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of these data shows practically no evidence of a correlation between the ecological and evolutionary distances separating species, indicating that hydrological alpha niches are evolutionarily labile. We propose that contrasting patterns of evolutionary conservatism for alpha- and beta-niches is a general phenomenon necessitated by the hierarchical filtering of species during community assembly. This determines that species must have similar alpha niches in order to occupy the same habitat, but different alpha niches in order to coexist.

AB 1.The impact of climate change on the distribution, abundance, phenology and ecophysiology of species is already well documented, whereas the influence of climate change on habitat choice and utilization has received little attention. Here we report the changing habitat associations of a thermally constrained grassland butterfly, Hesperia comma, over 20 years.
   2. Between 1982 and 2001-2, the optimum percentage of bare ground within habitat used for egg-laying shifted from 41% to 21%.
   3. Egg-laying rates are temperature-dependent and females actively adjust microhabitat usage in response to temperature variations; relatively warmer host plants are chosen or oviposition at low ambient temperatures, and cooler host plants at high ambient temperatures.
   4. Climate warming has increased the availability of thermally suitable habitat for H. comma at the cool, northern edge of the species' distribution, therefore increasing: (a) egg-laying rate and potentially the realized rate of population increase; (b) effective area of habitat patches as more microhabitats within a given vegetation fragment are now suitable for egg-laying; (c) buffering of populations against environmental variation as eggs are laid within a wider range of microhabitats; and (d) the number of habitat patches in the landscape that are currently available for colonization (including the use of more northerly facing aspects; Thomas et al., Nature, 2001, 411, 577-581).
   5. Conservationists often assume the habitat requirements of a species to be constant, and manage habitats to maintain these conditions. For many species, these requirements are likely to change in response to climate warming, and care must be taken not to manage habitats based on outdated prescriptions.

AB circle Leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen concentration (on mass and area bases, N-mass and N-area, respectively), photosynthetic capacity (A(mass) and A(area)) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) are key foliar traits, but few data are available from cold, high-altitude environments.
   circle Here, we systematically measured these leaf traits in 74 species at 49 research sites on the Tibetan Plateau to examine how these traits, measured near the extremes of plant tolerance, compare with global patterns.
   circle Overall, Tibetan species had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations and photosynthetic capacities compared with a global dataset, but they had a slightly lower A(mass) at a given N-mass. These leaf trait relationships were consistent with those reported from the global dataset, with slopes of the standardized major axes A(mass)-LMA, N-mass-LMA and A(mass)-N-mass identical to those from the global dataset. Climate only weakly modulated leaf traits.
   circle Our data indicate that covarying sets of leaf traits are consistent across environments and biogeographic regions. Our results demonstrate functional convergence of leaf trait relationships in an extreme environment.

AB To understand the influence of dams on connectivity of riparian plant communities along rivers, we examined plant dispersal by water (hydrochory) and riparian plant community attributes upstream and downstream from dams on two rivers in the southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. Drifting plant propagules were collected from the water column along reaches upstream and downstream from dams to examine the longitudinal and temporal variation in seed-pool species composition and concentration of water-transported seeds. Similarities between species composition of the hydrochoric seed pool and local standing riparian vegetation were used to evaluate the degree of longitudinal connectivity along river corridors and to isolate the relative contributions of local versus regional species pools to hydrochoric species composition. Furthermore, several synthetic attributes (longevity, origin, life-form and dispersal mode) and species composition of riparian plant communities were examined to explore the effects of interrupted propagule dispersal on standing vegetation.
   We estimated that as many as 120 million seeds were transported via hydrochory along free-flowing reaches of the Rocky Mountain streams in a single growing season. Seed concentration (seeds/m(3)) in the water column was reduced by 70-94% along reaches downstream from dams compared to free-flowing reaches. The similarity in species composition of hydrochoric seeds and local standing vegetation was nearly two times greater downstream from reservoirs compared to upstream. This suggests that hydrochory complements local species pools by importing seeds from throughout the upstream catchment area along freeflowing river reaches, but that hydrochoric seeds are derived primarily from local sources along regulated river reaches. Species richness recovers as a function of downstream distance from contributions of standing vegetation and seeds from tributary streams. Hydrochory may extend the period over which viable seeds of a parent population are dispersed. Even after dispersal of parent populations has terminated, seeds may continue to be available due to residence time in water transport. This extension of the 'effective dispersal window' of some species may exceed two weeks or more and may influence the likelihood of successful establishment.
   In this study, synthetic attributes of riparian vegetation did not differ significantly between free-flowing and regulated reaches, whereas formal statistical comparisons of community composition upstream and downstream from reservoirs indicate that there are differences in community composition upstream and downstream from dams. These findings suggest that the consequences of 50 to 100 years of fragmentation result in community-wide effects along Rocky Mountain streams and that these effects may be partially explained by dam-caused disruption in connectivity of plant populations.

AB Ecosystem responses to past climate change can provide insight into plausible scenarios of response to future change and can elucidate factors that may influence the overall predictability of such responses. I explore the utility of paleoecological studies for addressing questions about the predictability of ecosystem responses to climate change using Alaskan tree line ecosystems as a case study. Published studies were used to develop a regional analysis of patterns of recent tree line advance, and to estimate lags between recruitment onset and forest development beyond tree line. Tree line advance is ubiquitous, but asynchronous in time, occurring significantly earlier in the White Mountains in interior Alaska than in western Alaska or the Alaska Range. The mean lag between initiation of recruitment and forest development was estimated at approximately 200 years, similar to what modeling studies have found. Although continued advance of white spruce forests is the most likely scenario of future change, variability in the rate of forest response to warming may be likely due to limitation of spruce establishment in highly permafrost-affected sites, changes in seed dispersal and early establishment, and recent changes in the growth responses of individual trees to temperature. All of these factors may cause spruce populations to exhibit nonlinear responses to future warming, and uncritical extrapolation from recent trends is thus unwarranted.

AB The paucity of empirical data on processes in species life cycles demands tools to extract insight from field observations. Such insights help inform policy on invasive species and on impacts of climate change at regional and local scales. We used the CLIMEX model to infer the response of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), to temperature and moisture from its range in the United States. We tested hypotheses on the mechanisms that limit the distribution of the ant and estimated the potential global area at risk from invasion. The ant can spread further in the United States, including north along the west coast, where patterns of infestation will differ from those in the east. We analyzed the risk of colonization in Australia and New Zealand, where the ant was recently discovered. The patterns of infestation of the ant in Oceania will differ from those in the eastern United States, with slower growth and less winter mortality. This study adds to earlier temperature-based models by incorporating a moisture response; by replacing arbitrary categories of colony size to predict overwintering success with a site-specific model based on the balance between annual growth and survival; and by comparing different hypotheses on low temperature-related mechanisms that limit the geographical distribution. It shows how the response of a species to climate can be synthesized from field observations to provide useful insights into its population dynamics. Such analyses provide a basis for making decisions on regional management of invasive species and an informative context for local studies.

AB The influence of charcoal on biotic processes in soils remains poorly understood. Charcoal is a natural product of wildfires that burned on a historic return interval of similar to100 years in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests of northern Sweden. Fire suppression and changes in forest stand management have resulted in a lack of charcoal production in these ecosystems. It is thought that charcoal may alter N mineralization and nitrification rates, however, previous studies have not been conclusive. Replicated field studies were conducted at three late-succession field sites in northern Sweden and supporting laboratory incubations were conducted using soil humus collected from these sites. We used activated carbon (AC), as a surrogate for natural-occurring fire-produced charcoal. Two rates of AC (0 and 2000 kg ha(-1)), and glycine (0 and 100 kg N as glycine ha(-1)) were applied in factorial combination to field microplots in a randomized complete block pattern. Net nitrification, N mineralization, and free phenol concentrations were measured using ionic and non-ionic resin capsules, respectively. These same treatments and also two rates of birch leaf litter (0 and 1000 kg ha(-1)) were applied in a laboratory incubation and soils from this incubation were extracted with KCl and analyzed for NH4+ and NO3-. Nitrification rates increased with AC amendments in laboratory incubations, but this was not supported by field studies. Ammonification rates, as measured by NH4+ accumulation on ionic resins, were increased considerably by glycine applications, but some NH4+ was apparently lost to surface sorption to the AC. Phenolic accumulation on non-ionic resin capsules was significantly reduced by AC amendments. We conclude that charcoal exhibits important characteristics that affect regulating steps in the transformation and cycling of N. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The distribution of genetic variation and the phylogenetic relationships between 18 populations of the arctic-alpine plant Trollius europaeus were analysed in three main regions (Alps, Pyrenees and Fennoscandia) by using dominant AFLP markers. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the genetic variability was found within populations (64%), although variation among regions (17%) and among populations within regions (19%) was highly significant (P < 0.001). Accordingly, the global fixation index F-ST averaged over loci was high (0.39). The among-population differentiation indicates restricted gene flow, congruent with limited dispersal of specific globeflower's pollinating flies (Chiastocheta spp.). Within-population diversity levels were significantly higher in the Alps (mean Nei's expected heterozygosity H-E = 0.229) than in the Pyrenees (H-E = 0.197) or in Fennoscandia (H-E = 0.158). This finding is congruent with the species-richness of the associated flies, which is maximum in the Alps. We discuss the processes involved in shaping observed patterns of genetic diversity within and among T. europaeus populations. Genetic drift is the major factor acting on the small Pyrenean populations at the southern edge of T. europaeus distribution, while large Fennoscandian populations result probably from a founder effect followed by demographic expansion. The Alpine populations represent moderately fragmented relics of large southern ancestral populations. The patterns of genetic variability observed in the host plant support the hypothesis of sympatric speciation in associated flies, rather than recurrent allopatric speciations.

AB 1. Transfer of carbon from freshwater to terrestrial ecosystems can occur through predation on adult aquatic insects, but the significance of this trophic pathway to the energetics of riparian communities is poorly understood. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to explore linkages between aquatic insect production and the nutrition of web-building and free-living spiders alongside two streams in the North Island of New Zealand.
   2. delta(13) C values for riparian tree leaves (means for each site = -32.2 and -30.3parts per thousand) were distinct from those of lichens collected from stream channel rocks and instream algae, both of which were similar (-23.4 to -22.4parts per thousand). delta(15) N values for leaves were similar at both sites (-3.4 and -2.7parts per thousand), but algae were considerably more depleted in delta(15) N atonesite suggesting significant differences in instream nitrogen sources between the twostreams.
   3. Isotope values for potential aquatic prey of spiders indicated that aquatic algal production was their primary carbon source at both sites. Terrestrial invertebrates collected and assumed to be potential prey reflected a range of carbon sources and represented several trophic levels.
   4. At one site, delta(13) C values indicated a primarily algae-aquatic insect pathway of carbon transfer to both web-building and free-living spider guilds. The other site appeared to have a primarily terrestrial carbon pathway for the free-living spider guild, and a mixed aquatic-terrestrial pathway for the web-building guild.
   5. Overall, web-building spiders were estimated to obtain around 61% of their body carbon from aquatic production compared with 55% for free-living spiders. Our findings suggest that consumption of prey derived from aquatic sources can provide significant nutrition for spiders living along some stream channels. This pathway may represent an important feedback mechanism contributing to the energetics of riparian communities at sites where aquatic insect production is high.

AB In birds and many other animals, there are large interspecific differences in the magnitude of annual variation in population size, Using time-series data on populations of solitary bird species, we found that fluctuations in population size of solitary birds were affected by the deterministic characteristics of the population dynamics as well as the stochastic factors. In species with highly variable populations, annual variation in recruitment was positively related to the return rate of adults between successive breeding seasons. In stable populations, more recruits were found in years with low return rates of breeding adults. This identifies a gradient, associated with the position of the species along a "slow-fast" continuum of life history variation, from highly variable populations with a recruitment-driven demography to stable, strongly density-regulated populations with a survival-restricted demography. These results suggest that patterns in avian population fluctuations can be predicted from a knowledge of life-history characteristics and/or temporal variation in certain demographic traits.

AB Allelic variation at seven hypervariable tri- and tetranucleotide microsatellite loci was used to determine levels of population differentiation between 14 populations of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) in northeast Scotland, UK. Despite the potential for long-distance dispersal in grouse, and a semicontinuous habitat, significant population divergence was observed (mean R-ST = 0.153; P < 0.01) and an isolation-by-distance effect detected (Mantel test: P< 0.001). Examination of the spatial trend in principal component scores derived from allele frequencies among populations highlighted a barrier to gene flow that was confounding a simple isolation-by-distance effect. This barrier corresponded to an area of unsuitable habitat for grouse associated with a river system that bisected the study area. Mean genetic relatedness was higher for males than for females in all but one of the study populations, suggesting that the territorial behaviour and natal philopatry displayed by cocks have a manifold effect in generating the observed spatial genetic structure. Lower female relatedness values suggest a higher level of female-mediated gene flow, which is sufficient to prevent the loss of genetic variation from within populations and the onset of inbreeding effects. The potential consequences of local subdivision for red grouse populations are discussed.

AB Six scat-analysis methods were compared and tested for differential assessment of a wolf Canis lupus diet in the Northern Apennine Mountains, Italy. A sample of 217 wolf scats was analysed using standardised laboratory techniques, and the recovered undigested remains were quantified according to the following diet measurements: frequency of occurrence, dry weight (estimated and measured), relative volume, and biomass ingested (two methods). With the exception of one of the biomass methods, there was no significant disagreement between the procedures examined. However, some discrepancies between rankings from different methods indicated the sources of bias that should be accounted for to avoid misleading conclusions. Frequency data can be corrected to reduce some of the associated forms of bias, whereas rankings by weight and volume appear affected by the structure of undigested remains. Although to different extents, all the methods which rank food items according to direct measures of the undigested remains, i.e. by frequency, weight, and volume, suffer from the surface to volume ratio bias of varying prey sizes. Linear-regression biomass models correct for the surface/volume bias, but there are some drawbacks when applying them, and they are limited to mammalian prey. Applicability of the biomass models should be evaluated on the basis of diet composition and prey sizes, and results carefully interpreted in concert with other field-collected information. Interpretation of scat-analysis data in order to assess the diet of wolves, as well as of other carnivores, would be greatly enhanced by comparing results obtained with two or more methods.

AB Protandry, here defined as the earlier emergence of males, is a common feature in life histories and could be the result of sexual selection on males to maximize matings, or alternatively an incidental by-product of other selection pressures on the sexes. If protandry is selected for per se, theory predicts that it should be associated with seasonal environments where there is little overlap between generations. The degree of protandry should be insensitive to environmental conditions. Moreover, on the assumption that males and females grow at the same rate as larvae, a trade-off between development time and size is expected to result in a strong association between protandry and female-biased sexual size dimorphism. These predictions were tested by a combination of comparative and experimental studies on five populations of the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria, from central and south Sweden, England, Spain, and the island of Madeira. Protandry was associated with seasonal environments, as it was only exhibited in the three northernmost populations. Protandry in these populations remained largely constant in a variety of temperatures, both under direct development, when protandry results from a sex difference in development time through the egg, larval, and pupal stages, and under diapause development, when it results from a sex difference in pupal development time only. These results indicate that protandry is selected for per se through sexual selection in seasonal environments. Similar female-biased size dimorphism occurred in protandrous and non-protandrous populations alike, and hence sexual size dimorphism in P. aegeria is not a result of selection for protandry, nor the causal factor behind protandry. Protandry and sexual size dimorphism appear to be largely decoupled traits in the life history evolution of P. aegeria. This is achieved by means of variation in pupal developmental time and variation in the relative growth rates of the sexes. Variation in growth rates is likely to be a general phenomenon and may make possible independent optimization of size and development time (age at sexual maturity), and accordingly influence expected patterns of size-related trade-offs.

AB Carabid beetles were collected with grids of pitfall traps during two seasons in five habitats in the ecotone between aspen parkland and boreal mixedwood forest in central Alberta. The 23 abundant species (54 species in total) were divided into the following four distributional types: (1) Pterostichus adstrictus Eschz. was numerous in all five habitats (habitat generalist); (2) Platynus decentis Say, Calathus ingratus Dej., and Scaphinotus marginatus Fisch. were abundant in all four forest habitats (forest generalists); (3) another 10 species were common in one or two forest habitats (forest specialists); (4) nine species, representing mainly Agonum, Amara, and Bembidion, were restricted to a recently cleared timothy-clover grassland (meadow species). Soil moisture seemed to be important in determining habitat associations of the species among the forest types. Captures of most species were aggregated also within habitats, and the consistency of aggregation among particular traps suggests that it is mainly a response to subtle microhabitat differences. All abundant species, except S. marginatus, showed a peak of capture in May-June. Number of species, corrected for sample size by rarefaction, was highest in the meadow (27.5) and lowest in the dry upland aspen forest (11.9). Species diversity was highest in meadow and the lakeside forest habitats, but carabid assemblages of thc four forest habitats were more similar to each other than to the meadow assemblage.

AB The hypothesized relationship between the relative strength of sexual selection and life-history strategies is reexamined. The potential effectiveness of sexual selection depends not only on the relative survivorship of immature stages, but also on other components of fitness. The effects of fecundity and timing of maturation must be evaluated together with the survivorship in order to determine the reponsiveness of alternative life-history configurations to the force of sexual selection. More-over, the r-K continuum is an inadequate model for comparisons of life-history strategies. A general three-dimensional demographic model provides a more comprehensive conceptual framework for life-history comparisons. The three-parameter demographic model is similar to several earlier two-dimensional life-history schemes and appears to describe a broad spectrum of the life-history strategies exhibited in nature. Most higher taxa tend to be dominated by only one or two of the three endpoint strategies: "equilibrium" (large investment in relatively few individual offspring), "opportunistic" (small size and rapid maturation), and "periodic" (pulsed production of large numbers of small offspring). A survey of teleost fishes and examples from several other higher taxa supports McLain's (1991) contention that the strength of sexual selection is influenced by life-history strategy. Conspicuous males are common among relative equilibrium and opportunistic strategists, but are essentially absent among species associated with the high-fecundity, periodic reproductive strategy. The absence of sexually selected traits in high-fecundity broadcast spawners implies that differential survivorship among immature life stages is nonrandom in all cases.

AB genodiveversion 3.0 is a user-friendly program for the analysis of population genetic data. This version presents a major update from the previous version and now offers a wide spectrum of different types of analyses.genodivehas an intuitive graphical user interface that allows direct manipulation of the data through transformation, imputation of missing data, and exclusion and inclusion of individuals, population and/or loci. Furthermore,genodiveseamlessly supports 15 different file formats for importing or exporting data from or to other programs. One major feature ofgenodiveis that it supports both diploid and polyploid data, up to octaploidy (2n = 8x) for some analyses, but up to hexadecaploidy (2n = 16x) for other analyses. The different types of analyses offered bygenodiveinclude multiple statistics for estimating population differentiation (phi(ST),F-ST,FMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEST,G(ST),GMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEST,GMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEST,D-est,R-ST,rho), analysis of molecular variance-basedK-means clustering, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, hybrid index, population assignment, clone assignment, Mantel test, Spatial Autocorrelation, 23 ways of calculating genetic distances, and both principal components and principal coordinates analyses. A unique feature ofgenodiveis that it can also open data sets with nongenetic variables, for example environmental data or geographical coordinates that can be included in the analysis. In addition,genodivemakes it possible to run several external programs (lfmm,structure,instructandvegan) directly from its own user interface, avoiding the need for data reformatting and use of the command line.genodiveis available for computers running Mac OS X 10.7 or higher and can be downloaded freely from: .

AB Introgression is emerging as an important source of novel genetic variation, alongside standing variation and mutation. It is adaptive when such introgressed alleles are maintained by natural selection. Recently, there has been an explosion in the number of studies on adaptive introgression. In this review, we take a plant perspective centred on four lines of evidence: (i) introgression, (ii) selection, (iii) phenotype and (iv) fitness. While advances in genomics have contributed to our understanding of introgression and porous species boundaries (task 1), and the detection of signatures of selection in introgression (task 2), the investigation of adaptive introgression critically requires links to phenotypic variation and fitness (tasks 3 and 4). We also discuss the conservation implications of adaptive introgression in the face of climate change. Adaptive introgression is particularly important in rapidly changing environments, when standing genetic variation and mutation alone may only offer limited potential for adaptation. We conclude that clarifying the magnitude and fitness effects of introgression with improved statistical techniques, coupled with phenotypic evidence, has great potential for conservation and management efforts.

AB Biochar and activated carbon, both carbonaceous pyrogenic materials, are important products for environmental technology and intensively studied for a multitude of purposes. A strict distinction between these materials is not always possible, and also a generally accepted terminology is lacking. However, research on both materials is increasingly overlapping: sorption and remediation are the domain of activated carbon, which nowadays is also addressed by studies on biochar. Thus, awareness of both fields of research and knowledge about the distinction of biochar and activated carbon is necessary for designing novel research on pyrogenic carbonaceous materials. Here, we describe the dividing ranges and common grounds of biochar, activated carbon and other pyrogenic carbonaceous materials such as charcoal based on their history, definition and production technologies. This review also summarizes thermochemical conversions and non-thermal pre- and post-treatments that are used to produce biochar and activated carbon. Our overview shows that biochar research should take advantage of the numerous techniques of activation and modification to tailor biochars for their intended applications.

AB Commensal intestinal microbes are collectively beneficial in preventing local tissue injury and augmenting systemic antimicrobial immunity. However, given the near-exclusive focus on bacterial species in establishing these protective benefits, the contributions of other types of commensal microbes remain poorly defined. Here, we show that commensal fungi can functionally replace intestinal bacteria by conferring protection against injury to mucosal tissues and positively calibrating the responsiveness of circulating immune cells. Susceptibility to colitis and influenza A virus infection occurring upon commensal bacteria eradication is efficiently overturned by mono-colonization with either Candida albicans or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protective benefits of commensal fungi are mediated by mannans, a highly conserved component of fungal cell walls, since intestinal stimulation with this moiety alone overrides disease susceptibility in mice depleted of commensal bacteria. Thus, commensal enteric fungi safeguard local and systemic immunity by providing tonic microbial stimulation that can functionally replace intestinal bacteria.

AB In a world of shrinking habitats and increasing competition for natural resources, potentially dangerous predators bring the challenges of coexisting with wildlife sharply into focus. Through interdisciplinary collaboration among authors trained in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, we reviewed current approaches to mitigating adverse human-predator encounters and devised a vision for future approaches to understanding and mitigating such encounters. Limitations to current approaches to mitigation include too much focus on negative impacts; oversimplified equating of levels of damage with levels of conflict; and unsuccessful technical fixes resulting from failure to engage locals, address hidden costs, or understand cultural (nonscientific) explanations of the causality of attacks. An emerging interdisciplinary literature suggests that to better frame and successfully mitigate negative human-predator relations conservation professionals need to consider dispensing with conflict as the dominant framework for thinking about human-predator encounters; work out what conflicts are really about (they may be human-human conflicts); unravel the historical contexts of particular conflicts; and explore different cultural ways of thinking about animals. The idea of cosmopolitan natures may help conservation professionals think more clearly about human-predator relations in both local and global context. These new perspectives for future research practice include a recommendation for focused interdisciplinary research and the use of new approaches, including human-animal geography, multispecies ethnography, and approaches from the environmental humanities notably environmental history. Managers should think carefully about how they engage with local cultural beliefs about wildlife, work with all parties to agree on what constitutes good evidence, develop processes and methods to mitigate conflicts, and decide how to monitor and evaluate these. Demand for immediate solutions that benefit both conservation and development favors dispute resolution and technical fixes, which obscures important underlying drivers of conflicts. If these drivers are not considered, well-intentioned efforts focused on human-wildlife conflicts will fail.

AB While immune checkpoint blockade elicits efficacious responses in many patients with cancer, it also produces a diverse and unpredictable number of immune-related adverse events (IRAE). Mechanisms driving IRAEs are generally unknown. Because CTLA-4 blockade leads to proliferation of circulating T cells, we examined in this study whether ipilimumab treatment leads to clonal expansion of tissue-reactive T cells. Rather than narrowing the T-cell repertoire to a limited number of clones, ipilimumab induced greater diversification in the T-cell repertoire in IRAE patients compared with patients without IRAEs. Specifically, ipilimumab triggered increases in the numbers of clonotypes, including newly detected clones and a decline in overall T-cell clonality. Initial broadening in the repertoire occurred within 2 weeks of treatment, preceding IRAE onset. IRAE patients exhibited greater diversity of CD4(+) and CD8-T cells, but showed no differences in regulatory T-cell numbers relative to patients without IRAEs. Prostate-specific antigen responses to ipilimumab were also associated with increased T-cell diversity. Our results show how rapid diversification in the immune repertoire immediately after checkpoint blockade can be both detrimental and beneficial for patients with cancer. (C)2016 AACR.

This study assessed the health levels of wetland ecosystem at the Hangzhou Bay, China using the pressure-state-response (PSR) model through synthesizing remote sensing and statistical data. Ten ecological and social-economic indicators were selected to build the wetland health assessment system. Weights of these indicators and PSR model components as well as the normalized wetland health score were assigned and calculated based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. We analyzed the spatio-temporal changes in wetland ecosystem health status during the past 20 years (1990-2010) from the perspectives of ecosystem pressure, state and response. The results showed that the overall wetland health score was in a fair health level, but displayed large spatial variability in 2010. The wetland health score declined from good health level to fair health level from 1990 to 2000, then restored slightly from 2000 to 2010. Overall, wetland health levels showed a decline from 1990 to 2010 for most administrative units. The temporal change patterns in wetland ecosystem health varied significantly among administrative units. Our results could help to clarify the administrative responsibilities and obligations and provide scientific guides not only for wetland protection but also for restoration and city development planning at the Hangzhou Bay area.

AB High-throughput sequencing of B-cell immunoglobulin repertoires is increasingly being applied to gain insights into the adaptive immune response in healthy individuals and in those with a wide range of diseases. Recent applications include the study of autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As sequencing technologies continue to improve, these repertoire sequencing experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens-to hundreds-of-millions of sequences. These data require specialized bioinformatics pipelines to be analyzed effectively. Numerous methods and tools have been developed to handle different steps of the analysis, and integrated software suites have recently been made available. However, the field has yet to converge on a standard pipeline for data processing and analysis. Common file formats for data sharing are also lacking. Here we provide a set of practical guidelines for B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing analysis, starting from raw sequencing reads and proceeding through pre-processing, determination of population structure, and analysis of repertoire properties. These include methods for unique molecular identifiers and sequencing error correction, V(D)J assignment and detection of novel alleles, clonal assignment, lineage tree construction, somatic hypermutation modeling, selection analysis, and analysis of stereotyped or convergent responses. The guidelines presented here highlight the major steps involved in the analysis of B-cell repertoire sequencing data, along with recommendations on how to avoid common pitfalls.

AB The hypotheses that beta diversity should increase with decreasing latitude and increase with spatial extent of a region have rarely been tested based on a comparative analysis of multiple datasets, and no such study has focused on stream insects. We first assessed how well variability in beta diversity of stream insect metacommunities is predicted by insect group, latitude, spatial extent, altitudinal range, and dataset properties across multiple drainage basins throughout the world. Second, we assessed the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in driving variation in assemblage composition within each drainage basin. Our analyses were based on a dataset of 95 stream insect metacommunities from 31 drainage basins distributed around the world. We used dissimilarity-based indices to quantify beta diversity for each metacommunity and, subsequently, regressed beta diversity on insect group, latitude, spatial extent, altitudinal range, and dataset properties (e.g., number of sites and percentage of presences). Within each metacommunity, we used a combination of spatial eigenfunction analyses and partial redundancy analysis to partition variation in assemblage structure into environmental, shared, spatial, and unexplained fractions. We found that dataset properties were more important predictors of beta diversity than ecological and geographical factors across multiple drainage basins. In the within-basin analyses, environmental and spatial variables were generally poor predictors of variation in assemblage composition. Our results revealed deviation from general biodiversity patterns because beta diversity did not show the expected decreasing trend with latitude. Our results also call for reconsideration of just how predictable stream assemblages are along ecological gradients, with implications for environmental assessment and conservation decisions. Our findings may also be applicable to other dynamic systems where predictability is low.

AB A universal feature of the response to stress and nutrient limitation is transcriptional upregulation of genes that encode proteins important for survival. Under many such conditions, the overall protein synthesis level is reduced, thereby dampening the stress response at the level of protein expression(1). For example, during glucose starvation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), translation is rapidly repressed, yet the transcription of many stress-and glucose-repressed genes is increased(2,3). Here we show, using ribosomal profiling and microscopy, that this transcriptionally upregulated gene set consists of two classes: one class produces messenger RNAs that are translated during glucose starvation and are diffusely localized in the cytoplasm, including many heat-shock protein mRNAs; and the other class produces mRNAs that are not efficiently translated during glucose starvation and are concentrated in foci that co-localize with P bodies and stress granules, a class that isenriched for mRNAs involved in glucose metabolism. Surprisingly, the information specifying the differential localization and protein production of these two classes of mRNA is encoded in the promoter sequence: promoter responsiveness to heat-shock factor 1 (Hsf1) specifies diffuse cytoplasmic localization and higher protein production on glucose starvation. Thus, promoter sequences can influence not only the levels of mRNAs but also the subcellular localization of mRNAs and the efficiency with which they are translated, enabling cells to tailor protein production to the environmental conditions.

TI The enemy release hypothesis as a hierarchy of hypotheses
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID PLANT INVASIONS; RESISTANCE; ECOLOGY; SUCCESS; SIZE; TIME
AB In ecology, a hypothesis is usually not discarded if a few studies reject it, as long as there are other studies supporting it. How to assess the usefulness of ecological hypotheses is therefore not straightforward. Using the enemy release hypothesis as an example, we show how creating a hierarchy of hypotheses (HoH) can help reviewing and evaluating evidence for and against an ecological hypothesis. In a HoH, a broad, overarching hypothesis branches into more specific and better testable sub-hypotheses. The enemy release hypothesis is a major hypothesis in invasion ecology and posits that the absence of enemies in the exotic range of an alien species is a cause of its invasion success. Based on a systematic review of empirical tests of this hypothesis, we divided it into sub-hypotheses, differentiating among 1) indicators for enemy release, 2) types of comparisons, and 3) types of enemies. We identified 176 empirical tests and weighted each test according to the number of alien species studied and the research method (experimental vs observational, field vs enclosure vs laboratory). For the broadly formulated enemy release hypothesis, we found nearly as much supporting (36%) as questioning evidence (43%). At the sub-hypotheses level, however, we found that some sub-hypotheses are strongly supported by empirical evidence, whereas others receive hardly any support. These differences are further emphasized for some types of habitat and focal taxonomic groups. Our findings suggest that several specific formulations (i.e. sub-hypotheses) of the broad enemy release hypothesis are useful, whereas other formulations should be viewed more critically. In general, the approach outlined here can help evaluate major ecological hypotheses and their specific sub-hypotheses. Our study also highlights the need for a scientific debate on how much supporting evidence is sufficient to consider an ecological hypothesis to be useful.

AB Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to mitigate negative environmental effects caused by increased agricultural intensification in Europe. However, there is still debate on whether currently available incentives are efficiently enhancing farmland biodiversity. Moreover, agri-environment schemes often lead to a yield reduction, which has been argued to potentially increase pressure on non-cropped habitats, with unintended negative environmental consequences. Here, we argue that AES should build on more explicit goals regarding (1) biodiversity protection as such and (2) provisioning of ecosystem services benefiting agricultural production. We discuss how this can be achieved by an efficient spatial allocation of AES measures to the benefit of biodiversity, ecosystem service providers and agricultural production. We differentiate between biodiversity conservation schemes, which target species of conservation concern, and ecosystem service schemes which explicitly target ecosystem service providers important for environmentally sustainable agriculture, most of which are common species. We construct a simplistic, conceptual model, based on well-founded ecological principles, to illustrate how to allocate biodiversity conservation schemes and ecosystem service schemes spatially, depending on where they are needed in order to meet the goals of protecting biodiversity per se and promoting environmentally sustainable agriculture. By understanding the functional importance of different types of AES we can achieve much more effective schemes in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cichlid fishes constitute one of the most species-rich families of vertebrates. In addition to complex social behaviour and morphological versatility, they are characterised by extensive diversity in colouration, both within and between species. Here, we review the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying colour variation in this group and the selective pressures responsible for the observed variation. We specifically address the evidence for the hypothesis that divergence in colouration is associated with the evolution of reproductive isolation between lineages. While we conclude that cichlid colours are excellent models for understanding the role of animal communication in species divergence, we also identify taxonomic and methodological biases in the current research effort. We suggest that the integration of genomic approaches with ecological and behavioural studies, across the entire cichlid family and beyond it, will contribute to the utility of the cichlid model system for understanding the evolution of biological diversity.

AB As a spatial concept, density is a useful tool in predicting and controlling land use. However, policymakers, practitioners, academics and citizens are often uncertain about how density, and especially higher densities, can be best utilised to create and nurture the design of urban environments. Barriers related to definitions, calculations, concepts and correlations with relevant issues prevent people from understanding density beyond a simple ratio of units to area. More needs to be done to show that density plays a key role in planning, architecture and urban design, and that discussions of density cannot be done in isolation of a whole host issues found in the built and natural environment. To that end, this paper aims to clarify some of the issues surrounding density, particularly about available definitions, calculating terms, the advantages and disadvantages of increasing densities in cities and uncovering relationships between density and issues pertinent to the design of urban environments. With these relationships in mind, a new way of visualising density is then offered-through a taxonomy of density-that categorises density into its component parts, allowing scholars, policymakers and practitioners to understand what aspects of density have been examined and what gaps are still present. Finally, a re-conceptualisation of density is presented, illustrating that density is more than a quantitative calculation that exists on its own; rather, for density to be considered as an integral part of the urban environment, both 'hard' (i.e., quantitative) and 'soft' (i.e., qualitative, contextual) elements must be included.

AB Considerable epidemiological, experimental and clinical data have amassed showing that the risk of developing disease in later life is dependent on early life conditions, mainly operating within the normative range of developmental exposures. This relationship reflects plastic responses made by the developing organism as an evolved strategy to cope with immediate or predicted circumstances, to maximize fitness in the context of the range of environments potentially faced. There is now increasing evidence, both in animals and humans, that such developmental plasticity is mediated in part by epigenetic mechanisms. However, recognition of the importance of developmental plasticity as an important factor in influencing later life health-particularly within the medical and public health communities-is low, and we argue that this indifference cannot be sustained in light of the growing understanding of developmental processes and the rapid rise in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic disease globally.

AB Analyses of the increasingly available genomic data continue to reveal the extent of hybridization and its role in the evolutionary diversification of various groups of species. We show, through extensive coalescent-based simulations of multilocus data sets on phylogenetic networks, how divergence times before and after hybridization events can result in incomplete lineage sorting with gene tree incongruence signatures identical to those exhibited by hybridization. Evolutionary analysis of such data under the assumption of a species tree model can miss all hybridization events, whereas analysis under the assumption of a species network model would grossly overestimate hybridization events. These issues necessitate a paradigm shift in evolutionary analysis under these scenarios, from a model that assumes a priori a single source of gene tree incongruence to one that integrates multiple sources in a unifying framework. We propose a framework of coalescence within the branches of a phylogenetic network and show how this framework can be used to detect hybridization despite incomplete lineage sorting. We apply the model to simulated data and show that the signature of hybridization can be revealed as long as the interval between the divergence times of the species involved in hybridization is not too small. We reanalyze a data set of 106 loci from 7 in-group Saccharomyces species for which a species tree with no hybridization has been reported in the literature. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that hybridization occurred during the evolution of this group, explaining a large amount of the incongruence in the data. Our findings show that an integrative approach to gene tree incongruence and its reconciliation is needed. Our framework will help in systematically analyzing genomic data for the occurrence of hybridization and elucidating its evolutionary role.

AB Delays in the start of the growing season reduce the period available for growth and the amount of xylem production. However, a higher number of developing tracheids could prolong cell differentiation and, consequently, lengthen the growing season. The relationship between the amount and duration of cell production in the xylem remains an unresolved issue. The aim of this study was to resolve the chicken-or-egg causality dilemma about duration of growth and cell production through simple- and double-cause models. This was achieved by (1) analysing the intra-annual growth dynamics of the xylem in Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP during 2006-2009 in two contrasting sites of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, and (2) extracting the dates of onset and ending of xylem formation and the number of radial cells along the tree ring.
   A higher number of cells was linked to an earlier onset (r = 0.74) and later ending (r = 0.61) of cell differentiation. The absence of a relationship between the residuals of the onset and ending of xylogenesis (r(p) = -0.06) indicated that cell production influenced the correlation between the two phenophases of the xylem.
   These results demonstrated that a higher number of cells produced delay the ending of xylem maturation, so extending the duration of wood formation.

AB In human-dominated landscapes, species with large spatial requirements, such as large carnivores, have to deal with human infrastructure and activities within their home ranges. This is the case for the brown bear (Ursus arctos L., 1758) in Scandinavia, which is colonizing more human-dominated landscapes, leading inevitably to an overlap between their home ranges and anthropogenic structures. In this study, we investigated fine-scale habitat selection by brown bears to examine how they deal with this potential disturbance. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, we studied (i) habitat selection of female brown bears within their home range and (ii) the influence of diurnal variation in human disturbance on fine-scale habitat use. As expected, females selected habitats within their home range that provided abundant food resources and minimized human-caused disturbance. In addition, our temporal analysis of habitat selection revealed an avoidance of disturbed areas and a selection of slopes by bears during periods of highest human activities, i. e., during daylight hours. We clearly demonstrate the importance of considering the fluctuations in human activity when studying habitat selection, especially at fine spatial scales. Failing to do so may considerably reduce the power to detect important fine-scale habitat-selection behaviors.

AB P> Due to species-specificity of the outcomes of biotic interactions, it is difficult to generalize from observed biotic interactions at the individual plant level to the effect of those interactions at the community level. To evaluate the importance of biotic interactions in shaping plant communities, it is necessary to understand how the outcomes of the complex interactions observed at the individual level can influence community structure.
   Here, we propose a trait-based framework that identifies and organises mechanisms affecting community structure (here described with relative abundances of plant functional traits - i.e. the distribution of trait values at the community level). We applied our approach to a single leaf trait, specific leaf area (SLA), to link individual responses to plant interactions with community structure (SLA distribution observed at the community level) and to test whether biotic interactions can predict the functional composition of subalpine grasslands. We evaluated the generality of our model through a cross-validation with a set of eight subalpine grasslands independent from the four fields used to build the model.
   We found that competition and facilitation were able to explain the functional composition of subalpine grasslands, and the relevant fitness components (survival or growth) explaining this link changed depending on the limiting resources. When soil water availability was limiting, positive plant-plant interactions acting on survival were able to explain community structure. In contrast, when no water limitation was observed competition acting on individual growth was the main driver of community structure.
   Our framework enables evaluation of the consequences of biotic interactions observed at individual level on community structure, thereby indicating when and where different types of plant-plant interactions are important.

TI Pre- and Postnatal Nutritional Histories Influence Reproductive
   Maturation and Ovarian Function in the Rat
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: While prepubertal nutritional influences appear to play a role in sexual maturation, there is a need to clarify the potential contributions of maternal and childhood influences in setting the tempo of reproductive maturation. In the present study we employed an established model of nutritional programming to evaluate the relative influences of prenatal and postnatal nutrition on growth and ovarian function in female offspring.
   Methods: Pregnant Wistar rats were fed either a calorie-restricted diet, a high fat diet, or a control diet during pregnancy and/or lactation. Offspring then were fed either a control or a high fat diet from the time of weaning to adulthood. Pubertal age was monitored and blood samples collected in adulthood for endocrine analyses.
   Results: We report that in the female rat, pubertal timing and subsequent ovarian function is influenced by the animal's nutritional status in utero, with both maternal caloric restriction and maternal high fat nutrition resulting in early pubertal onset. Depending on the offspring's nutritional history during the prenatal and lactational periods, subsequent nutrition and body weight gain did not further influence offspring reproductive tempo, which was dominated by the effect of prenatal nutrition. Whereas maternal calorie restriction leads to early pubertal onset, it also leads to a reduction in adult progesterone levels later in life. In contrast, we found that maternal high fat feeding which also induces early maturation in offspring was associated with elevated progesterone concentrations.
   Conclusions: These observations are suggestive of two distinct developmental pathways leading to the acceleration of pubertal timing but with different consequences for ovarian function. We suggest different adaptive explanations for these pathways and for their relationship to altered metabolic homeostasis.

AB Variations among individuals in phenotypic quality and fitness often confound analyses of life-history strategies assessed at the population level. We used detailed long-term data from three populations of large herbivores with generation times ranging from four to nine years to quantify heterogeneity in individual quality among females, and to assess its influence on mean annual reproductive success over the lifetime (MRS). We also determined how environmental conditions in early life shaped individual quality and tested A. Lomnicki's hypothesis that variance in individual quality should increase when environmental conditions deteriorate. Using multivariate analyses (PCA), we identified one (in sheep and deer) or two (in goats) covariations among life-history traits (longevity, success in the last breeding opportunity, adult mass, and social rank) as indexes of individual quality that positively influenced MRS of females. Individual quality was reduced by unfavorable weather, low resource availability, and high population density in the year of birth. Early-life conditions accounted for 35-55% of variation in individual quality. In roe deer, we found greater variance in individual quality for cohorts born under unfavorable conditions as opposed to favorable ones, but the opposite was found in bighorn sheep and mountain goats. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneity in female quality can originate from environmental conditions in early life and can markedly influence the fitness of females in species located at different positions along the slow-fast continuum of life-history strategies.

AB The great spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen (N) processing introduces large uncertainties for quantifying N cycles in large scales, e.g. a watershed scale, and hence challenges the present techniques in measuring ecosystem N mass balance. The dual isotopes of nitrate (delta O-18 and delta N-15) integrate signals for both nitrate sources and N processing, making them promising for studies on large scale N cycling. Here, the dual isotopes, as well as some ion tracers, from a subtropical river in south China were reported to identify the main nitrate sources and to assess the possible occurrence and degree of denitrification in the context of monsoon climate. Our results indicated that nitrification of reduced fertilizer N in soil zones was the main nitrate source, with sewage and manure as another important source in dry winter. Seasonal changes of denitrification was apparent by the similar to 1:2 enrichment of O-18 and N-15 from April to August, and suggested to occur over the watershed rather than in the river. The lowest denitrification (10%) occurred in April, when the fertilizer application was strongest and the monsoon rainfall abruptly increased, causing enhancement of leaching. The highest denitrification (48%) took place in August due to the high soil temperature and moisture. In December, denitrification was significant (26%) perhaps due to the high enough temperature for microbial activities, whereas the low soil moisture appeared to limit the degree of denitrification. This study suggests that the seasonal variations in denitrification should be taken into account when estimating regional N mass balance.

AB We describe pragmatic and reliable methods to examine the influence of patch-scale heterogeneities on the uncertainty in long-term eddy-covariance (EC) carbon flux data and to scale between the carbon flux estimates derived from land surface optical remote sensing and directly derived from EC flux measurements on the basis of the assessment of footprint climatology. Three different aged Douglas-fir stands with EC flux towers located on Vancouver Island and part of the Fluxnet Canada Research Network were selected. Monthly, annual and interannual footprint climatologies, unweighted or weighted by carbon fluxes, were produced by a simple model based on an analytical solution of the Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. The dimensions and orientation of the flux footprint depended on the height of the measurement, surface roughness length, wind speed and direction, and atmospheric stability. The weighted footprint climatology varied with the different carbon flux components and was asymmetrically distributed around the tower, and its size and spatial structure significantly varied monthly, seasonally and inter-annually. Gross primary productivity (GPP) maps at 10-m resolution were produced using a tower-mounted multi-angular spectroradiometer, combined with the canopy structural information derived from airborne laser scanning (Lidar) data. The horizontal arrays of footprint climatology were superimposed on the 10-m-resolution GPP maps. Monthly and annual uncertainties in EC flux caused by variations in footprint climatology of the 59-year-old Douglas-fir stand were estimated to be approximately 15-20% based on a comparison of GPP estimates derived from EC and remote sensing measurements, and on sensor location bias analysis. The footprint-variation-induced uncertainty in long-term EC flux measurements was mainly dependent on the site spatial heterogeneity. The bias in carbon flux estimates using spatially-explicit ecological models or tower-based remote sensing at finer scales can be estimated by comparing the footprint-weighted and EC-derived flux estimates. This bias is useful for model parameter optimizing. The optimization of parameters in remote-sensing algorithms or ecosystem models using satellite data will, in turn, increase the accuracy in the upscaled regional carbon flux estimation.

AB Hybridization and polyploidy are now hypothesized to have regularly stimulated speciation in angiosperms, but individual or combined involvement of these two processes seems to involve significant differences in pathways of formation, establishment and evolutionary consequences of resulting lineages. We evaluate here the classical cytological hypothesis that ploidy in hybrid speciation is governed by the extent of chromosomal rearrangements among parental species.
   Within a phylogenetic framework, we calculate genetic divergence indices for 50 parental species pairs and use these indices as surrogates for the overall degree of genomic divergence (that is, as proxy for assessments of dissimilarity of the parental chromosomes).
   The results confirm that genomic differentiation between progenitor taxa influences the likelihood of diploid (homoploid) versus polyploid hybrid speciation because genetic divergence between parents of polyploids is found to be significantly greater than in the case of homoploid hybrid species.
   We argue that this asymmetric relationship may be reinforced immediately after hybrid formation, during stabilization and establishment. Underlying mechanisms potentially producing this pattern are discussed.

AB Using cline fitting and divergence population genetics, we tested a prediction of Haldane's rule: autosomal alleles should introgress more than z-linked alleles or mitochondrial haplotypes across the Passerina amoena/Passerina cyanea (Aves: Cardinalidae) hybrid zone. We screened 222 individuals collected along a transect in the Great Plains of North America that spans the contact zone for mitochondrial (two genes), autosomal (four loci) and z-linked (two loci) markers. Maximum-likelihood cline widths estimated from the mitochondrial (223 km) and z-linked (309 km) datasets were significantly narrower on average than the autosomal cline widths (466 km). We also found that mean coalescent-based estimates of introgression were larger for the autosomal loci (0.63 genes/generation, scaled to the mutation rate mu) than for both the mitochondrial (0.27) and z-linked loci (0.59). These patterns are consistent with Haldane's rule, but the among-locus variation also suggests many independently segregating loci are required to investigate introgression patterns across the genome. These results provide the first comprehensive comparison of mitochondrial, sex-linked, and autosomal loci across an avian hybrid zone and add to the body of evidence suggesting that sex chromosomes play an important role in the formation and maintenance of reproductive isolation between closely related species.

AB Among animals, evidence for homoploid hybrid speciation (HHS, i.e. the creation of a hybrid lineage without a change in chromosome number) was limited until recently to the virgin chub, Gila seminuda, and some controversial data in support of hybrid status for the red wolf, Canis rufus. This scarcity of evidence, together with pessimistic attitudes among zoologists about the evolutionary importance of hybridisation, prompted the view that HHS is extremely rare among animals, especially as compared with plants. However, in recent years, the literature on animal HHS has expanded to include several new putative examples in butterflies, ants, flies and fishes. We argue that this evidence suggests that HHS is far more common than previously thought and use it to provide insights into some of the genetic and ecological aspects associated with this type of speciation among animals.

AB Direct estimation of photosynthetic light-use efficiency (WE) from space would be of significant benefit to LUE-based models which use inputs from remote sensing to estimate terrestrial productivity. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has shown promise in tracking LUE at the leaf- to small canopy levels, but its use at regional to global scales still remains a challenge. In this study, we used different formulations of PRI calculated from the MODIS ocean band centered at 531 nm and a set of alternative reference bands at 488, 551, and 678 nm to explore the relationship between PRI and LUE where WE was measured at eight eddy covariance flux towers located in the boreal forest of Saskatchewan, Canada. The magnitude and variability of WE was significantly lower at the times when useful MODIS ocean band images were available (i.e. around midday under clear-sky conditions) relative to the rest of the growing season. PR1678 (reference band at 678 nm) showed the strongest relationship (r(2)=0.70) with LUE90a (i.e. 90-minute mean WE calculated using Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, APAR), but only when all sites were combined. Overall, the relationships between the MODIS PRIs and LUE90a were always stronger for observations closer to the backscatter direction and there were no significant differences in the strength of the correlations whether LUE was calculated based on incident PAR or on APAR. Predictions of ecosystem photosynthesis at the time of the MODIS overpasses were significantly improved by multiplying either PAR or APAR by MODIS PRI (r(2) improved from 0.09 to 0.44 and 0.54 depending on the PRI formulation). We used our PRI-LUE model to create a regional LUE90a map for the three cover types covering 47,500 km(2) around the flux sites. The MODIS PRI-derived LUE90a map appeared to capture more realistic spatial heterogeneity of LUE across the landscape compared to a daily WE map derived using the look-up table in the MODIS GPP (MOD17) algorithm. While our LUE map is only a snapshot of minimum regional LUE90a values, with appropriate gap-filling methods it could be used to improve regional-scale monitoring of GPR Moreover, the strong relationship between midday and daily WE on clear days (r(2)=0.93) indicates that instantaneous MODIS observations of LUE90a could be used to estimate daily WE. Finally, pixel shadow fraction from the 5-Scale geometric-optical model was closely related to both MODIS PRI and tower-derived LUE suggesting that differences in stand leaf area and in diffuse illumination among flux sites play a role in the relationship we observed between LUE and MODIS PRI.

AB Landscape fragmentation due to urban development, transportation infrastructure, and agriculture poses a threat to environmental integrity. There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making. Effective mesh size (m(eff)) is an ecologically relevant metric that quantifies landscape fragmentation based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a region are located in the same non-fragmented patch. We investigated variation in meff measured by transportation districts, municipal counties, and six spatial levels of watersheds within the state of California. Four fragmentation geometries were developed by overlaying highways, roads, urbanized areas, agricultural areas, and natural fragmenting features. Two m(eff) calculation methods were compared: one where planning unit boundaries fragment the landscape (CUT), the other allowing for cross-boundary connections (CBC). The CUT procedure always produced lower m(eff) values than CBC, with greater differences occurring in smaller planning units, confirming the bias introduced using boundaries with landscape metrics. Calculated m(eff) values varied from 0 to 20 885 km(2) across 6994 units in California. Roads contributed the most to fragmentation, while agriculture contributed little, as California's agricultural areas are already heavily fragmented by roads. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative, and intuitive method for transportation, land use and environmental planners to analyze cumulative impacts of multiple fragmenting features across a range of spatial scales within a variety of planning units. This approach could be used for analyzing the impact of future land development scenarios, and integrated into regional planning processes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Bayesian network approach is used to conduct decision analysis of nutrient abatement measures in the Morsa catchment, South Eastern Norway. The paper demonstrates the use of Bayesian networks as a meta-modelling tool in integrated river basin management (IRBM) for structuring and combining the probabilistic information available in existing cost-effectiveness studies, eutrophication models and data, non-market valuation studies and expert opinion. The Bayesian belief network is used to evaluate eutrophication mitigation costs relative to benefits, as part of the economic analysis under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Pros and cons of Bayesian networks as reported in the literature are reviewed in light of the results from our Morsa catchment model. The reported advantages of Bayesian networks in promoting integrated, inter-disciplinary evaluation of uncertainty in IRBM, as well as the apparent advantages for risk communication with stakeholders, are offset in our case by the cost of obtaining reliable probabilistic data and meta-model validation procedures.

AB Species diversity is thought to stabilize functioning of plant communities. An alternative view is that stability depends more on dynamics of dominant species than on diversity. We compared inter-annual variability (inverse of stability) of aboveground biomass in paired restored and remnant tallgrass prairies at two locations in central Texas, USA. Data from these two locations were used to test the hypothesis that greater richness and evenness in remnant than restored prairies would reduce variability in aboveground biomass in response to natural variation in rainfall. Restored prairies were chosen to be similar to paired remnant prairies in characteristics other than species diversity that affect temporal variability in biomass. Variability was measured as the coefficient of variation among years (square root of variance/mean; CV), where variance in community biomass equals the sum of variances of individual plant species plus the summed covariances between species pairs. Species diversity over five years was greater by a factor of 2 or more in remnant than restored prairies because richness and evenness were greater in remnant than restored prairies. Still, the CV of community biomass during spring and CV of annual biomass production did not differ consistently between prairie types. Neither the sum of species covariances nor total community biomass differed between prairies. Biomass varied relatively little in restored compared to remnant prairies because biomass of the dominant species in restored prairies (the grass Schizachyrium scoparium) varied less than did biomass of other dominant and sub-dominant species. In these grasslands, biomass response to natural variation in precipitation depended as much on characteristics of a dominant grass as on differences in diversity.

AB Aim To explore species richness patterns in liverworts and mosses along a central Himalayan altitudinal gradient in Nepal (100-5500 m a.s.l.) and to compare these patterns with patterns observed for ferns and flowering plants. We also evaluate the potential importance of Rapoport's elevational rule in explaining the observed richness patterns for liverworts and mosses.
   Location Nepal, Central Himalaya.
   Methods We used published data on the altitudinal ranges of over 840 Nepalese mosses and liverworts to interpolate presence between maximum and minimum recorded elevations, thereby giving estimates of species richness for 100-m altitudinal bands. These were compared with previously published patterns for ferns and flowering plants, derived in the same way. Rapoport's elevational rule was assessed by correlation analyses and the statistical significance of the observed correlations was evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations.
   Results There are strong correlations between richness of the four groups of plants. A humped, unimodal relationship between species richness and altitude was observed for both liverworts and mosses, with maximum richness at 2800 m and 2500 m, respectively. These peaks contrast with the richness peak of ferns at 1900 m and of vascular plants, which have a plateau in species richness between 1500 and 2500 m. Endemic liverworts have their maximum richness at 3300 m, whereas non-endemic liverworts show their maximum richness at 2700 m. The proportion of endemic species is highest at about 4250 m. There is no support from Nepalese mosses for Rapoport's elevational rule. Despite a high correlation between altitude and elevational range for Nepalese liverworts, results from null simulation models suggest that no clear conclusions can be made about whether liverworts support Rapoport's elevational rule.
   Main conclusions Different demands for climatic variables such as available energy and water may be the main reason for the differences between the observed patterns for the four plant groups. The mid-domain effect may explain part of the observed pattern in moss and liverwort richness but it probably only works as a modifier of the main underlying relationship between climate and species richness.

AB Elevational gradients hold enormous potential for understanding general properties of biodiversity. Like latitudinal gradients, the hypotheses for diversity patterns can be grouped into historical explanations, climatic drivers, and spatial hypotheses. The spatial hypotheses include the species-area effect and spatial constraint ( mid-domain effect null models). I test these two spatial hypotheses using regional diversity patterns for mammals ( non-volant small mammals and bats) along 34 elevational gradients spanning 24.4 degrees S-40.4 degrees N latitude. There was high variability in the fit to the species-area hypothesis and the mid-domain effect. Both hypotheses can be eliminated as primary drivers of elevational diversity. Area and spatial constraint both represent sources of error rather than mechanisms underlying these mammalian diversity patterns. Similar results are expected for other vertebrate taxa, plants, and invertebrates since they show comparable distributions of elevational diversity patterns to mammalian patterns.

AB Examples of male mate choice are becoming increasingly common, even in polygynous species. We create a series of population genetic models to examine the evolutionary equilibria and dynamics resulting from male mate choice during polygyny, alone and in the context of mutual mate choice by both sexes. We find that unless males with a preference are able to increase their overall courtship output, male preference will be lost. This loss can be counteracted if males choose females not based on arbitrary traits, but based on a trait that indicates high fertility or viability. We also conclude that if male and female preferences and traits are all controlled by different loci, the male and female mate choice systems are decoupled; the presence of a male preference then has no influence on the equilibria or dynamics of female mate choice. If male and female traits are coupled by pleiotropy, it becomes possible for a male preference to be maintained, regardless of whether preferences between the sexes are pleiotropic or controlled by separate loci.

AB Successional replacement of intolerant species by shade tolerators along gap-understorey gradients is commonly associated with increasingly higher low-light carbon acquisition capacities of more tolerant species. This doctrine has recently been challenged because of evidence demonstrating larger leaf dry mass per unit area (M-A), lower photosynthetic capacities and inferior whole plant relative growth rates (RGR) in both high and low irradiance in seedlings of shade-tolerators. However, as the individuals of shade-tolerant species often need to endure canopy shade for many years before gap formation, testing of the carbon gain hypothesis of shade tolerance requires examination of species carbon gain potentials during the entire plant ontogeny.
   Light vs. M-A relationships throughout ontogeny demonstrate that saplings and canopy individuals of shade tolerators do have lower M-A than intolerant species, and moderately higher photosynthetic capacities in low light, resulting in greater whole plant carbon gain capacities at lower light. The apparent discrepancy between results from studies on seedlings vs. saplings/trees is due to M-A increasing at a faster rate in shade intolerators during ontogeny. A strong positive linkage between seed size and species shade tolerance further implies that shade tolerators have larger initial size, absolute growth rate and survivorship in low light despite their lower RGR.
   The evidence reviewed collectively suggests that the carbon balance concept of species' successional position is valid for both seedlings and saplings, and that the apparent discrepancies in species rankings on the basis of structural and physiological characteristics are driven by variations in initial size and rate of ontogeny. Analyses of species shade tolerance potentials should therefore consider how any suite of adaptive traits varies with ontogeny.

AB Contemporary North American drainage basins are composites of formerly isolated drainages, suggesting that fragmentation and fusion of palaeodrainage systems may have been an important factor generating current patterns of genetic and species diversity in stream-associated organisms. Here, we combine traditional molecular-phylogenetic, multiple-regression, nested clade, and molecular-demographic analyses to investigate the relationship between phylogeographic variation and the hydrogeological history of eastern North American drainage basins in semiaquatic plethodontid salamanders of the Eurycea bislineata species complex. Four hundred forty-two sequences representing 1108 aligned bases from the mitochondrial genome are reported for the five formally recognized species of the E. bislineata complex and three outgroup taxa. Within the ingroup, 270 haplotypes are recovered from 144 sampling locations. Geographic patterns of mtDNA-haplotype coalescence identify 13 putatively independent population-level lineages, suggesting that the current taxonomy of the group underestimates species-level diversity. Spatial and temporal patterns of phylogeographic divergence are strongly associated with historical rather than modern drainage connections, indicating that shifts in major drainage patterns played a pivotal role in the allopatric fragmentation of populations and build-up of lineage diversity in these stream-associated salamanders. More generally, our molecular genetic results corroborate geological and faunistic evidence suggesting that palaeodrainage connections altered by glacial advances and headwater erosion occurring between the mid-Miocene and Pleistocene epochs explain regional patterns of biodiversity in eastern North American streams.

AB Invasion of the exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum into stands of the native perennial grass Hilaria jamesii significantly reduced the abundance of soil biota, especially microarthropods and nematodes. Effects of invasion on active and total bacterial and fungal biomass were variable, although populations generally increased after 50+ years of invasion. The invasion of Bromus also resulted in a decrease in richness and a species shift in plants, microarthropods, fungi, and nematodes. However, despite the depauperate soil fauna at the invaded sites, no effects were seen on cellulose decomposition rates, nitrogen mineralization rates, or vascular plant growth. When Hilaria was planted into soils from riot-invaded, recently invaded, and historically invaded sites (all currently or once dominated by Hilaria), germination and survivorship were not affected. In contrast, aboveground Hilaria biomass was significantly. greater in recently invaded soils than in the other two soils. We attributed the Hilaria response to differences in soil nutrients present before the invasion, especially soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as these nutrients were elevated in the soils that produced the greatest Hilaria biomass. Our data suggest that it is not soil biotic richness per se that determines soil process rates or plant productivity, but instead that either (1) the presence of a few critical soil food web taxa can keep ecosystem function high, (2) nutrient loss is very slow in this ecosystem, and/or (3) these processes are microbially driven. However, the presence of Bromus may reduce key soil nutrients over time and thus may eventually suppress native plant success.

AB In order to clarify the role of picocyanobacteria in aquatic biogeochemical processes (e.g., calcite precipitation), cell surface properties need to be investigated. An experimental study of the cell surface characteristics of two Synechococcus-type unicellular autotrophic picocyanobacterial strains was carried out. One strain was isolated from Lake Plon and contained phycocyanin, the other strain came from Lago Maggiore and was rich in phycoerythrin. Potentiometric titrations were conducted to determine the different types of sites present on the bacteria cell walls. Infrared spectroscopy allowed characterization of the various functional groups (R-NH2, R-COOH, R-OH, R-PO2) and investigations of zeta potential provided insight into the isoelectrical points of the strains. Titrations reveal three distinct sites on the bacterial surfaces of phycocyanin- and phycoerythrin-rich strains with pK values of 4.8 +/- 10.3/5.0 +/- 0.2, 6.6 +/- 0.2/6.7 +/- 0.4, and 8.8 +/- 0.1/8.7 +/- 0.2, corresponding to carboxyl, phosphate, and amine groups with surface densities of 2.6 +/- 0.4/7.4 +/- 1.6 x 10(-4), 1.9 +/- 0.5/4.4 +/- 0.8 x 10(-4), and 2.5 +/- 0.4/4.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(-4) mol/g of dry bacteria. The deprotonation constants are similar to those of bacterial strains and site densities are also within an order of magnitude of other strains. The phycoerythrin-rich strain had a higher number of binding sites than the phycocyanin-rich strain. The results showed that picocyanobacteria may adsorb either calcium cations or carbonate anions and therefore strongly influence the biogeochemical cycling of calcite in pelagic systems.

AB Central European lowland wet meadows are habitats of great conservation interest, however, their phytosociological status has been to a large extent dependent on specific phytosociologgical traditions indifferent countries. In order to bridge the gaps between different national schemes of vegetation classification, a statistical analysis of variation in species composition of these meadows in the Czech Republic, E Austria, Slovakia, Hungary and NE Croatia was performed, using a data set of 387 geographically stratified vegetation releves sampled at altitudes < 350 m. Principal coordinates analysis was used to identify and partial out the noise component in the variation in this data set. The releves were classified by cluster analysis. A new method for identifying the, optimal number of clusters was developed, based on species fidelity to particular clusters. This method suggested the optimum level of classification with three clusters and secondary optimum levels with five and nine clusters. Classification based on three clusters separated the traditional phytosociological alliances of Calthion palustris and Molinion caeruleae. both with a suboceanic phytogeographical affinity and a group of flooded meadows of large river alluvia, with a continental affinity. The latter group included the traditional alliances of Agrostion albae. Alopecurion pratensis. Cnidion venosi Deschampsion cespitosae and Veronico longifoliae-Lysimachion vulgaris. however. the internal heterogeneity of this group did not reflect putative boundaries between these alliances as proposed in the phytosociologgical literature. Therefore we suggest to unite these allicances in a single alliance. Deschampsion cespitosae Horvatic 1930 (the oldest valid name). Classification with nine clusters was interpreted at the level of broad phytosociological associations. Particular clusters were characterized by statistically defined groups of diagnostic species and related to macroclimatic variables.

AB The tribe Bovini comprises cattle and cattle-like species. Reconstructions of their phylogeny have so far been incomplete and have yielded conflicting conclusions about the relationship of American bison and wisent (European bison). We have compared the sequences of three mitochondrial and two Y-chromosomal DNA segments. Mitochondrial DNA indicates that four distinct maternal lineages diverged after an early split-off of the buffalo species, leading to (1) taurine cattle and zebu, (2) wisent, (3) American bison and yak, and (4) banteng, gaur, and gayal, respectively. At a higher level, lineages (1) and (2) and lineages (3) and (4) are probably associated. In contrast, Y-chromosomal sequences indicate a close association of American and European bison, which is in agreement with their morphological similarity, complete fertility of hybrid offspring, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints of nuclear DNA. One explanation for the anomalous divergence of the mitochondrial DNA from the two bison species is lineage sorting, which implies that two distinct mitochondrial lineages coexisted in the bison-yak branch until the recent divergence of American bison and wisent. Alternatively, the wisent may have emerged by species hybridization initiated by introgression of bison bulls in another ancestral species. This "transpatric" mode of species formation would be consistent with the recent appearance of the wisent in the fossil record without clearly identifiable ancestors.

AB [1] In order to establish suitability of forest ecosystems for long-term storage of C, it is necessary to characterize the effects of predicted increased atmospheric CO2 levels on the pools and fluxes of C within these systems. Since most C held in terrestrial ecosystems is in the soil, we assessed the influence of Free Air Carbon Enrichment (FACE) treatment on the total soil C content (C-total) and incorporation of litter derived C (C-new) into soil organic matter (SOM) in a fast growing poplar plantation. C-new was estimated by the C3/C4 stable isotope method. C-total contents increased under control and FACE respectively by 12 and 3%, i.e., 484 and 107 gC/m(2), while 704 and 926 gC/m(2) of new carbon was sequestered under control and FACE during the experiment. We conclude that FACE suppressed the increase of C-total and simultaneously increased C-new. We hypothesize that these opposite effects may be caused by a priming effect of the newly incorporated litter, where priming effect is defined as the stimulation of SOM decomposition caused by the addition of labile substrates.

AB In the coastal grasslands of western France, extensive mixed grazing by cattle and horses has been practised for many centuries. The vegetation of these old embanked grasslands varies along a topographical gradient with a hygrophilous plant community in low-lying depressions seasonally flooded, a mesophilous community on high level flats that are never flooded, and a meso-hygrophilous community on slopes where the soil remains saline. Recently, fewer horses have been grazed on these pastures and so a 6-year study was designed to investigate the effects of monospecific and mixed grazing by horses and cattle on plant community structure, composition and diversity. Mixed grazing produced the most species-rich and structurally diverse swards. Mixed grazing enhanced the development of rosette, sub-halophyte and halophyte species where the soil is saline, due to additive effects between the two herbivore species. Mixed grazing also limited the strongly competitive Elymus repens and Agrostis stolonifera on horse latrine areas, cattle grazing, thus showing a compensatory effect. The combination of additive and compensatory effects with mixed grazing could be used to manage plant diversity, heterogeneity in vegetation structure and communities of conservation value at the scale of the grassland ecosystem.

AB Agent-based simulation (ABS) is being increasingly used in environmental management. However, the efficient and effective use of ABS for environmental modelling is hindered by the fact that there is no fixed and clear definition of what an ABS is or even what an agent should be. Terminology has proliferated and definitions of agency have been drawn from an application area (Distributed Artificial Intelligence) which is not wholly relevant to the task of environmental simulation. This situation leaves modellers with little practical support for clearly identifying ABS techniques and how to implement them.
   This paper is intended to provide an overview of agent-based simulation in environmental modelling so that modellers can link their requirements to the current state of the art in the techniques that are currently used to satisfy them. Terminology is clarified and then simplified to two key existing terms, agent-based modelling and multi-agent simulation, which represent subtly different approaches to ABS, reflected in their respective artificial life (A-life) and distributed artificial intelligence roots. A representative set of case studies are reviewed, from which a classification scheme is developed as a stepping-stone to developing a taxonomy. The taxonomy can then be used by modellers to match ABS techniques to their requirements. (C) 2003 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Clinal variation in quantitative traits is often attributed to the effects of spatially varying selection. However, identical patterns can be produced by the interplay between purely stochastic processes (i.e. drift in combination with spatially restricted gene flow). One means of distinguishing between adaptive and nonadaptive causes of geographical variation is to compare relative levels of between-population divergence in quantitative traits and neutral DNA markers. Such comparisons can be used to test whether levels of trait divergence attributable to additive genetic effects (as measured by Q(ST)) exceed null expectations based on the level of divergence at neutral marker loci (as measured by F-ST). The purpose of this study was to use an approach based on 'Q(ST) vs. F-ST ' contrasts to test for evidence of diversifying selection on body size of an Indian fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae). Specifically, relative levels of between-population divergence in body size and microsatellite DNA markers were compared to assess whether the observed pattern of clinal size variation could be explained by a neutral model of isolation by distance. Q(ST) for body size was calculated using unbiased estimators of within- and between-population variance of principal component scores. The association between body size variation and geographical / environmental distance was tested using pairwise and partial matrix correspondence tests (MCTs). Independent variables (representing causal hypotheses) were constructed as between-locality distance matrices. The effects of neutral genetic divergence were assessed by including a matrix of pairwise F-ST as an independent variable. Partial MCTs revealed highly significant associations between phenotypic divergence (Q(ST)) and both geographical and environmental distance, even when the effects of neutral genetic divergence (F-ST) were partialled out. Results of the tests confirmed that migration-drift equilibrium is not a sufficient explanation for the latitudinal pattern of clinal size variation in C. sphinx. The geographical patterning of pairwise Q(ST) is most likely attributable to spatially varying selection and/or the direct influence of latitudinally ordered environmental effects.

AB Experimental results of diversity estimates in a set of populations often exhibit contradictory patterns when different marker systems are used. Using simulations we identified potential causes for these discrepancies. These investigations aimed also to detect whether different sampling strategies of markers within the genome resulted in different estimates of the diversity at the whole genome level. The simulations consisted in generating a set of populations undergoing various evolutionary scenarios which differed by population size, migration rate and heterogeneity of gene flow. Population diversity was then computed for the whole genome and for subsets of loci corresponding to different marker techniques. Rank correlation between the two measures of diversity were investigated under different scenarios. We showed that the heterogeneity of genetic diversity either between loci (genomic heterogeneity, GH) or among populations (population heterogeneity, PH) varied greatly according to the evolutionary scenario considered. Furthermore, GH and PH were major determinants of the level of rank correlation between estimates of genetic diversities obtained using different kinds of markers. We found a strong positive relationship between the level of the correlation and PH, whatever the marker system. It was also shown that, when GH values were constantly low during generations, a reduced number of microsatellites was enough to predict the diversity of the whole genome, whereas when GH increased, more loci were needed to predict the diversity and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers would be more recommended in this case. Finally the results are discussed to recommend strategies for gene diversity surveys.

AB Nine ecosystem process models were used to predict CO2 and water vapor exchanges by a 150-year-old black spruce forest in central Canada during 1994-1996 to evaluate and improve the models. Three models had hourly time steps, five had daily time steps, and one had monthly time steps. Model input included site ecosystem characteristics and meteorology. Model predictions were compared to eddy covariance (EC) measurements of whole-ecosystem CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration, to chamber measurements of nighttime moss-surface CO2 release, and to ground-based estimates of annual gross primary production, net primary production, net ecosystem production (NEP), plant respiration, and decomposition. Model-model differences were apparent for all variables. Model-measurement agreement was good in some cases but poor in others. Modeled annual NEP ranged from -11 g C m(-2) (weak CO2 source) to 85 g C m(-2) (moderate CO2 sink). The models generally predicted greater annual CO2 sink activity than measured by EC, a discrepancy consistent with the fact that model parameterizations represented the more productive fraction of the EC tower "footprint." At hourly to monthly timescales, predictions bracketed EC measurements so median predictions were similar to measurements, but there were quantitatively important model-measurement discrepancies found for all models at subannual timescales. For these models and input data, hourly time steps (and greater complexity) compared to daily time steps tended to improve model-measurement agreement for daily scale CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration (as judged by root-mean-squared error). Model time step and complexity played only small roles in monthly to annual predictions.

AB We compared 13 traits of invasive exotic, noninvasive exotic, and ecologically similar native species to determine if there are generalizable differences among these groups that relate to persistence and spread of exotic species in tallgrass prairie plant communities. When species were grouped as invasive (two species), noninvasive (five species), and native (six species), no differences were found for the suite of traits examined, likely because of the high variability within and between groups. However, when exotic species, regardless of invasiveness, were compared with the native species, specific leaf area was ca. 40% higher for the exotic species, a result that is consistent with that of other studies. This pattern was also observed for five of seven pairwise comparisons of exotic and native species with similar life history traits. In contrast, total end-of-season biomass was as much as three times higher for the native species in five of seven of the native-exotic species pairs. For other traits, differences between exotic and native species were species-specific and were generally more numerous for noninvasive than for invasive exotic species pair-wise comparisons. Thus, contrary to predictions, exotic species capable of successfully invading tallgrass prairie did not differ considerably from native species in most traits related to resource utilization and carbon gain. Moreover, invasive exotic species, those capable of displacing native species and dominating a community, were not distinct for the observed traits from their native counterparts. These results indicate that other traits, such as the ability to respond to resource pulses or herbivory, may explain more effectively why certain invasive species are able to invade these communities aggressively.

AB The role that, entomology has played in the historical (1800s-1970s) development of ecological theories that march species traits with environmental constraints is reviewed along three lineages originating from the ideas of a minister (Malthus TR. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. London: Johnson) and a chemist (Liebig J. 1840. Die Organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie. Braunschweig: Vieweg). Major developments in lineage 1 focus on habitat as a filter fur species traits, succession, nonequilibrium and equilibrium conditions, and generalizations about the correlation of traits to environmental constraints. In lineage 2, we trace the evolution of the niche concept and focus on ecophysiological traits, biotic interactions, and environmental conditions. Finally, we describe the conceptual route from early demographic studies of human and animal populations to the r-K concept in lineage 3. In the 1970s, the entomologist Southwood merged these three lineages into the "habitat templet concept" (Southwood TRE. 1977. J. Anim. Ecol. 46:337-65), which has stimulated much subsequent research in entomology and general ecology. We conclude that insects have been a far more important resource for the development of ecological theory than previously acknowledged.

AB The larvae of freshwater mussels are obligate ectoparasites on fishes while adults are sedentary and benthic. Dispersal of mussels is dependent on the movement of fish hosts, a regional process, but growth and reproduction should be governed by local processes. Thus, mussel assemblage attributes should be predictable from the regional distribution and abundance of fishes. At a broad spatial scale in the Red River drainage, USA, mussel species richness and fish species richness were positively associated; maximum mussel richness was limited by fish richness, but was variable beneath that constraint. Measured environmental variables and the associated local fish assemblages each significantly accounted for the regional variation in mussel assemblages. Furthermore, mussel assemblages showed strong spatial autocorrelation. Variation partitioning revealed that pure fish effects accounted for 15.4% of the variation in mussel assemblages: pure spatial and environmental effects accounted for 16.1% and 7.8%. respectively. Shared variation among fish, space and environmental variables totaled 40%. Of this shared variation, 36.8% was associated with the fish matrix. Thus. the variation in mussel assemblages that was associated with the distribution and abundance of fishes was substantial ( > 50%), indicating that fish community structure is an important determinant of mussel community structure. Although animals commonly disperse plants and, thus, influence the structure of plant communities, our results show a strong macroecological association between two disparate animal groups with one strongly affecting the assemblage structure of the other.

AB Species pairs of whitefish (Coregonus sp.) found in postglacial lakes are used to illustrate the benefits of combining molecular and ecological approaches iel studies of adaptive radiation. A detailed mitochondrial DNA phylogeographic analysis revealed that this species complex is composed of five major phylogenetic groups identifying races that survived the Pleistocene glaciations in distinct refugia. It also provided evidence for parallel evolution of sympatric ecotypes, involving both allopatric and sympatric origins. This strongly indicated the role of natural selection in driving their divergence. A comparative analysis of niche partitioning supported the hypothesis that the persistence of differential ecological opportunity throughout their ontogeny may be the selective force promoting the extent of specialization reached by whitefish ecotypes. The possibility that these same ecological processes are also responsible; was supported by a negative for determining the extent of their reproductive isolation correlation between the extent of gene flow, estimated from microsatellite loci, and that of morphological specialization between ecotypes in different lakes. Previous experimental studies, however, revealed that embryonic mortality rates were 2 to 5 times higher hybrid compared to pure crosses of ecotypes from distinct glacial races. This indicates that both genetic and ecological mechanisms may jointly act to determine speciation rate in whitefish. It is hoped that this study will not only stimulate further the interest of evolutionary ecologists for molecular genetics, but also that of molecularists for ecology. Promoting the fusion of such apparently remote fields of research may represent the must important achievement of molecular ecology as a discipline. (C) 1999 The Linnean Society of London.

AB The microhabitat of six cyprinids in a braided side-channel of the Upper Rhone River, France, was studied June to September 1985, using 'point abundance sampling' by electrofishing. Correspondence analysis of the samples-by-species data and Jacob's electivity index (calculated from the availability and exploitation of eight environmental variables) revealed three groups of species: (1) Leuciscus cephalus and Alburnus alburnus, which used relatively similar microhabitat during both larval and 0 + juvenile development; (2) Rutilus rutilus, Leuciscus leuciscus and Chondrostoma nasus, which used different microhabitats as larvae but whose microhabitat overlapped notably during 0 + juvenile development; (3) and Gobio gobio, whose juvenile microhabitat overlapped only marginally with that of other 0 + juveniles (no data were available on larvae). Overlap in microhabitat use by 0 + juveniles increased notably during a period of reduced discharge, when the amount of available vegetal and ligneous structures decreased; while most species exploited the increased area of shallow waters, juvenile A. alburnus appeared to be the only species that exploited the deeper waters off the channel's steeper banks. Although not quantified, numerous field observations of predation threat, particularly during the period of reduced discharge (which reduced the amount of cover), suggest that predation risk may influence the microhabitat use of young fishes. Compared with similar species in European lakes, the overlap in microhabitat use of these fluvial cyprinids appears to be more intensive.

AB Global change impacts on biogeochemical cycles have been widely studied, but our understanding of whether the responses of plant elemental composition to global change drivers differ between above-and belowground plant organs remains incomplete. We conducted a meta-analysis of 201 reports including 1,687 observations of studies that have analyzed simultaneously N and P concentrations changes in leaves and roots in the same plants in response to drought, elevated [CO2], and N and P fertilization around the world, and contrasted the results within those obtained with a general database (838 reports and 14,772 observations) that analyzed the changes in N and P concentrations in leaves and/or roots of plants submitted to the commented global change drivers. At global level, elevated [CO2] decreased N concentrations in leaves and roots and decreased N: P ratio in roots but no in leaves, but was not related to P concentration changes. However, the response differed among vegetation types. In temperate forests, elevated [CO2] was related with lower N concentrations in leaves but not in roots, whereas in crops, the contrary patterns were observed. Elevated [CO2] decreased N concentrations in leaves and roots in tundra plants, whereas not clear relationships were observed in temperate grasslands. However, when elevated [CO2] and N fertilization coincided, leaves had lower N concentrations, whereas root had higher N concentrations suggesting that more nutrients will be allocated to roots to improve uptake of the soil resources not directly provided by the global change drivers. N fertilization and drought increased foliar and root N concentrations while the effects on P concentrations were less clear. The changes in N and P allocation to leaves and root, especially those occurring in opposite direction between them have the capacity to differentially affect above-and belowground ecosystem functions, such as litter mineralization and above-and belowground food webs.

AB The use of molecular taxonomy for identifying recently diverged species has transformed the study of speciation in fungi. The pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides spp has been hypothesized to be composed of five phylogenetic species, four of which compose the brasiliensis species complex. Nuclear gene genealogies support this divergence scenario, but mitochondrial loci do not; while all species from the brasiliensis complex are differentiated at nuclear coding loci, they are not at mitochondrial loci. We addressed the source of this incongruity using 11 previously published gene fragments, 10 newly-sequenced nuclear non-coding loci, and 10 microsatellites. We hypothesized and further demonstrated that the mito-nuclear incongruence in the brasiliensis species complex results from interspecific hybridization and mitochondrial introgression, a common phenomenon in eukaryotes. Additional population genetic analyses revealed possible nuclear introgression but much less than that seen in the mitochondrion. Our results are consistent with a divergence scenario of secondary contact and subsequent mitochondrial introgression despite the continued persistence of species boundaries. We also suggest that yeast morphology slightly-but significantly-differs across all five Paracoccidioides species and propose to elevate four of these phylogenetic species to formally described taxonomic species.

AB The ecosystem services concept provides a valuable framework for analyzing and acting on the linkages between people and their environment. By making the values of nature explicit, it allows discussions about trade-offs between services and thus a prioritization of management options. The integration of the ecosystem services concept into decision making remains however challenging. Based on a thorough literature review of 68 tools for integrating ecosystem services into decision making, we analyze the current state, gaps and trends in the operationalization of the ecosystem services concept. We evaluate how well various policy sectors are covered with the tools and highlight gaps where more development is needed. While for some policy sectors such as agriculture or forestry several tools have been developed to support the integration of nature's benefits into concrete decisions, tools are missing where the link between policies and ecosystem services is less evident for example regarding cultural services related to land use policies as well as services supported by soils. Furthermore, the successful implementation of tools requires a good understanding of decision-making processes to bridge gaps in the science-policy interface. Based on the analysis of the application of tools in case studies, we evaluate the establishment of tools over time in different policy sectors and the frequency of their application.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides are commonly-used as seed treatments on flowering crops such as oilseed rape. Their persistence and solubility in water increase the chances of environmental contamination via surface-runoff or drainage into areas adjacent to the crops. However, their uptake and fate into non-target vegetation remains poorly understood. In this study, we analysed samples of foliage collected from neonicotinoid seed-treated oilseed rape plants and also compared the levels of neonicotinoid residues in foliage (range: 1.4-11 ng/g) with the levels found in pollen collected from the same plants (range: 1.4-22 ng/g). We then analysed residue levels in foliage from non-target plants growing in the crop field margins (range: <= 0.02-106 ng/g). Finally, in order to assess the possible risk posed by the peak levels of neonicotinoids that we detected in foliage for farmland phytophagous and predatory insects, we compared the maximum concentrations found against the LC50 values reported in the literature for a set of relevant insect species. Our results suggest that neonicotinoid seed-dressings lead to widespread contamination of the foliage of field margin plants with mixtures of neonicotinoid residues, where levels are very variable and discontinuous, but sometimes overlap with lethal concentrations reported for some insect species. Understanding the distribution of pesticides in the environment and their potential effects on biological communities is crucial to properly assess current agricultural management and schemes with biodiversity conservation aims in farmland.

AB Citizen science has the potential to expand the scope and scale of research in ecology and conservation, but many professional researchers remain skeptical of data produced by nonexperts. We devised an approach for producing accurate, reliable data from untrained, nonexpert volunteers. On the citizen science website www.snapshotserengeti.org, more than 28,000 volunteers classified 1.51 million images taken in a large-scale camera-trap survey in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Each image was circulated to, on average, 27 volunteers, and their classifications were aggregated using a simple plurality algorithm. We validated the aggregated answers against a data set of 3829 images verified by experts and calculated 3 certainty metrics-level of agreement among classifications (evenness), fraction of classifications supporting the aggregated answer (fraction support), and fraction of classifiers who reported "nothing here" for an image that was ultimately classified as containing an animal (fraction blank)-to measure confidence that an aggregated answer was correct. Overall, aggregated volunteer answers agreed with the expert-verified data on 98% of images, but accuracy differed by species commonness such that rare species had higher rates of false positives and false negatives. Easily calculated analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey tests indicated that the certainty metrics were significant indicators of whether each image was correctly classified or classifiable. Thus, the certainty metrics can be used to identify images for expert review. Bootstrapping analyses further indicated that 90% of images were correctly classified with just 5 volunteers per image. Species classifications based on the plurality vote of multiple citizen scientists can provide a reliable foundation for large-scale monitoring of African wildlife.

AB Many studies have investigated patterns in the near-surface soil microbial community over large spatial scales. However, less is known about variation in subsurface (15-30 cm of depth) microbial communities. Here we studied depth profiles of microbial communities in high-elevation soils from Tibet. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Alphaproteobacteria was higher in near-surface layers, while the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes and Betaproteobacteria was higher in the subsurface samples. The microbial community structure was distinct between the surface and subsurface soil layers, strongly correlating with variation in total carbon (TC) and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N). The differences in the microbial community between the layers were about the same as the horizontal differences between sites separated by many kilometers. Overall, we found that TC and C/N were the best predictors for both surface and subsurface microbial community distribution. Exploration of the relative contribution of distance and environmental variables to community composition suggests that the contemporary environment is the primary driver of microbial distribution in this region. Reflecting niche conservatism in evolution, the microbial communities in each soil site and layer tended to be more phylogenetically clustered than expected by chance, and surface soil layer samples were more likely to be clustered than subsurface samples.

AB We used a functional trait-based approach to assess the impacts of aridity and shrub encroachment on the functional structure of Mediterranean dryland communities (functional diversity (FD) and community-weighted mean trait values (CWM)), and to evaluate how these functional attributes ultimately affect multifunctionality (i.e. the provision of several ecosystem functions simultaneously). Shrub encroachment (the increase in the abundance/cover of shrubs) is a major land cover change that is taking place in grasslands worldwide. Studies conducted on drylands have reported positive or negative impacts of shrub encroachment depending on the functions and the traits of the sprouting or nonsprouting shrub species considered. FD and CWM were equally important as drivers of multifunctionality responses to both aridity and shrub encroachment. Size traits (e.g. vegetative height or lateral spread) and leaf traits (e.g. specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) captured the effect of shrub encroachment on multifunctionality with a relative high accuracy (r(2)=0.63). FD also improved the resistance of multifunctionality along the aridity gradient studied. Maintaining and enhancing FD in plant communities may help to buffer negative effects of ongoing global environmental change on dryland multifunctionality.

TI Conservation inequality and the charismatic cat: Felis felicis
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Flagship species; Charisma; Market research; Mammals; Conservation
AB Conservation resources are limited, making it impossible to invest equally in all threatened species. One way to maximise conservation gains is to focus upon those species with particular public appeal, using them to generate funding and support that could also benefit less charismatic species. Although this approach is already used by many conservation organisations, no reliable metrics currently exist to determine the likely charisma of a given species, and therefore identify the most appropriate targets for such campaigns. Here we use market research techniques on over 1500 people from five continents to assess the relative charisma of different mammals, which factors appear to drive it, and how these patterns vary between countries. Felids and primates emerged as highly favoured species for conservation, with the tiger (Panthera tigris) the top species by a wide margin. Using an information theoretic approach we develop models that successfully predict respondents' preferences across the entire sample, suggesting global commonalities in the attributes that people prefer for conservation. However, by analysing each country separately we are able to improve our models, thus highlighting the importance of identifying locally specific flagships for conservation. The most important attributes were body size and IUCN status, although the extent of baldness, whether the species was a potential threat to humans and whether the eyes were forward or side facing were also widely important. Several of the key attributes revealed in this study could be extrapolated to nearly all terrestrial mammals, paving the way for a standardised global identification of species likely to prove effective for future conservation campaigns. The public preferred species with which they had affinity and familiarity, and we discuss how these aspects could be increased to promote the underachievers, whilst maximising the funding potential of the highly charismatic mammals. While the felids are widely regarded as a popular taxonomic group, the great extent to which they appealed to our respondents emphasises their potential as ambassadors for conservation. Indeed, the big cats were so highly rated that we might think of them as one, Felis felicis: a globally powerful flagship for conservation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A long-standing problem in evolutionary biology has been determining whether and how gradual, incremental changes at the gene level can account for rapid speciation and bursts of adaptive radiation. Using genome-scale computer simulations, we extend previous theory showing how gradual adaptive change can generate nonlinear population transitions, resulting in the rapid formation of new, reproductively isolated species. We show that these transitions occur via a mechanism rooted in a basic property of biological heredity: the organization of genes in genomes. Genomic organization of genes facilitates two processes: (i) the build-up of statistical associations among large numbers of genes and (ii) the action of divergent selection on persistent combinations of alleles. When a population has accumulated a critical amount of standing, divergently selected variation, the combination of these two processes allows many mutations of small effect to act synergistically and precipitously split one population into two discontinuous, reproductively isolated groups. Periods of allopatry, chromosomal linkage among loci, and large-effect alleles can facilitate this process under some conditions, but are not required for it. Our results complement and extend existing theory on alternative stable states during population divergence, distinct phases of speciation and the rapid emergence of multilocus barriers to gene flow. The results are thus a step towards aligning population genomic theory with modern empirical studies.

AB To test the hypothesis that different drivers shape the diversity and biogeography of the total and active bacterial community, we examined the bacterial community composition along two transects, one from the inner Pearl River estuary to the open waters of the South China Sea (SCS) and the other from the Luzon Strait to the SCS basin, using 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA gene (V1-3 regions) and thereby characterizing the active and total bacterial community, respectively. The diversity and biogeographic patterns differed substantially between the active and total bacterial communities. Although the composition of both the total and active bacterial community was strongly correlated with environmental factors and weakly correlated with geographic distance, the active bacterial community displayed higher environmental sensitivity than the total community and particularly a greater distance effect largely caused by the active assemblage from deep waters. The 16S rRNA vs. rDNA relationships indicated that the active bacteria were low in relative abundance in the SCS. This might be due to a high competition between active bacterial taxa as indicated by our community network models. Based on these analyses, we speculate that high competition could cause some dispersal limitation of the active bacterial community resulting in a distinct distance-decay relationship. Altogether, our results indicated that the biogeographic distribution of bacteria in the SCS is the result of both environmental control and distance decay.

AB Intensive agriculture ensures high yields but can cause serious environmental damages. The optimal use of soil and atmospheric sources of nitrogen in cereal-legume mixtures may allow farmers to maintain high production levels and good quality with low external N inputs, and could potentially decrease environmental impacts, particularly through a more efficient energy use. These potential advantages are presented in an overall assessment of cereal-legume systems, accounting for the agronomic, environmental, energetic, and economic performances. Based on a low-input experimental field network including 16 site-years, we found that yields of pea-wheat intercrops (about 4.5 Mg ha(-1) whatever the amount of applied fertiliser) were higher than sole pea and close to conventionally managed wheat yields (5.4 Mg ha(-1) on average), the intercrop requiring less than half of the nitrogen fertiliser per ton of grain compared to the sole wheat. The land equivalent ratio and a statistical analysis based on the Price's equation showed that the crop mixture was more efficient than sole crops particularly under unfertilised situations. The estimated amount of energy consumed per ton of harvested grains was two to three times higher with conventionally managed wheat than with pea-wheat mixtures (fertilised or not). The intercrops allowed (i) maintaining wheat grain protein concentration and gross margin compared to wheat sole crop and (ii) increased the contribution of N-2 fixation to total N accumulation of pea crop in the mixture compared to pea sole crop. They also led to a reduction of (i) pesticide use compared to sole crops and (ii) soil mineral nitrogen after harvest compared to pea sole crop. Our results demonstrate that pea-wheat intercropping is a promising way to produce cereal grains in an efficient, economically sustainable and environmentally friendly way. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The roles of intra- and interspecific gene flow in speciation and species evolution are topics of great current interest in molecular ecology and evolutionary biology. Recent modelling studies call for new empirical data to test hypotheses arising from the recent shift from a 'whole-genome reproductive isolation' view to a 'genic' view of species and speciation. Particularly scarce (and thus of particular interest) are molecular genetic data on recently radiated, naturally hybridizing species in strongly structured and species-rich environments. Here, we studied four sympatric plant species (Pitcairnia spp.; Bromeliaceae) adapted to Neotropical inselbergs (isolated outcrops resembling habitat 'islands' in tropical rainforests) using nuclear and plastid DNA. Patterns of plastid DNA haplotype sharing and nuclear genomic admixture suggest the presence of both, incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific gene flow over extended periods of time. Integrity and cohesion of inselberg species of Pitcairnia are maintained despite introgression and in the face of extremely low within-species migration rates (N(e)m < 1 migrant per generation). Cross-evaluation of our genetic data against published pollination experiments indicate that species integrity is maintained by the simultaneous action of multiple prezygotic barriers, including flowering phenology, pollinator isolation and divergent mating systems. Postzygotic Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities appear to contribute to isolation, as suggested by asymmetric introgression rates of single loci. Our results suggest that incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization and introgression form integral aspects of adaptive radiation in Neotropical inselberg 'archipelagos'. Inselbergs with multiple closely related co-occurring species should be of special interest to students of speciation in mountain systems, and to ongoing conservation programmes in the Atlantic Rainforest biodiversity hotspot.

   EVOLUTION
AB In an island population receiving immigrants from a larger continental population, gene flow causes maladaptation, decreasing mean fitness and producing continued directional selection to restore the local mean phenotype to its optimum. We show that this causes higher plasticity to evolve on the island than on the continent at migration-selection equilibrium, assuming genetic variation of reaction norms is such that phenotypic variance is higher on the island, where phenotypes are not canalized. For a species distributed continuously in space along an environmental gradient, higher plasticity evolves at the edges of the geographic range, and in environments where phenotypes are not canalized. Constant or evolving partially adaptive plasticity also alleviates maladaptation owing to gene flow in a heterogeneous environment and produces higher mean fitness and larger population size in marginal populations, preventing them from becoming sinks and facilitating invasion of new habitats. Our results shed light on the widely observed involvement of partially adaptive plasticity in phenotypic clines, and on the mechanisms causing geographic variation in plasticity.

AB Spermatozoa are amongst the most variable cells, and three factors are thought to account for this variation in design: fertilization mode, phylogeny, and postcopulatory sexual selection. In addition, it has long been assumed that a tradeoff exists between sperm size and number, and although postcopulatory sexual selection affects both traits, empirical evidence for a tradeoff has so far been elusive. Our recent theoretical model predicts that the nature of a direct tradeoff between sperm size and number varies with sperm competition mechanism and sperm competition risk. We test these predictions using a comparative approach in two very different taxa with different sperm competition mechanisms: passerine birds (mechanism: simple raffle) and Drosophila fruit flies (sperm displacement). We show that in both groups, males increase their total ejaculate investment with increasing sperm competition risk, but whereas passerine birds allocate disproportionately to sperm number, drosophilids allocate disproportionately to sperm size. This striking difference between the two groups can be at least partly explained by sperm competition mechanisms depending on sperm size relative to the size of the female reproductive tract: in large animals (passerines), sperm numbers are advantageous in sperm competition owing to dilution inside the female tract, whereas in small animals (drosophilids), large spermare advantageous for physical competition (sperm displacement). Our study provides two important results. First, we provide convincing evidence for the existence of a sperm size-number tradeoff. Second, we show that by considering both sperm competition mechanism and dilution, can we account for variation in sperm size between different taxa.

AB Facilitation is a positive interaction assembling ecological communities and preserving global biodiversity. Although communities acquire emerging properties when many species interact, most of our knowledge about facilitation is based on studies between pairs of species. To understand how plant facilitation preserves biodiversity in complex ecological communities, we propose to move from the study of pairwise interactions to the network approach. We show that facilitation networks behave as mutualistic networks do, characterized by a nonrandom, nested structure of plant-plant interactions in which a few generalist nurses facilitate a large number of species while the rest of the nurses facilitate only a subset of them. Consequently, generalist nurses shape a dense and highly connected network. Interestingly, such generalist nurses are the most abundant species in the community, making facilitation-shaped communities strongly resistant to extinction, as revealed by coextinction simulations. The nested structure of facilitative networks explains why facilitation, by preventing extinction, preserves biodiversity.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) assume equilibrium between species' distribution and the environment. However, this assumption can be violated under restricted dispersal and spatially autocorrelated environmental conditions. Here we used a model to simulate species' ranges expansion under two non-equilibrium scenarios, evaluating the performance of SDM coupled with spatial eigenvector mapping. The highest fit is for the models that include space, although the relative importance of spatial variables during the range expansion differs in the two scenarios. Incorporating space to the models was important only under colonization-lag non-equilibrium, under the expected scenario. Thus, mechanisms that generate range cohesion and determine species' distribution under climate changes can be captured by spatial modelling, with advantages compared with other techniques and in line with recent claims that SDMs have to account for more complex dynamic scenarios.

AB Some of most used indicators in marine ecology are nucleic acid-derived indices. They can be divided by target levels in three groups: 1) at the organism level as ecophysiologic indicators, indicators such as RNA: DNA ratios, DNA: dry weight and RNA: protein, 2) at the population level, indicators such as growth rate, starvation incidence or fisheries impact indicators, and 3) at the community level, indicators such as trophic interactions, exergy indices and prey identification. The nucleic acids derived indices, especially RNA: DNA ratio, have been applied with success as indicators of nutritional condition, well been and growth in marine organisms. They are also useful as indicators of natural or anthropogenic impacts in marine population and communities, such as upwelling or dredge fisheries, respectively. They can help in understanding important issues of marine ecology such as trophic interactions in marine environment, fish and invertebrate recruitment failure and biodiversity changes, without laborious work of counting, measuring and identification of small marine organisms. Besides the objective of integrate nucleic acid derived indices across levels of organization, the paper will also include a general characterization of most used nucleic acid derived indices in marine ecology and also advantages and limitations of them. We can conclude that using indicators, such RNA: DNA ratios and other nucleic acids derived indices concomitantly with organism and ecosystems measures of responses to climate change (distribution, abundance, activity, metabolic rate, survival) will allow for the development of more rigorous and realistic predictions of the effects of anthropogenic climate change on marine systems.

AB 1. Agri-environmental schemes (AES) are commonly adopted in Europe to reduce the loss of farmland biodiversity. These schemes have, however, been criticized as not fulfilling this goal, partly because their effectiveness is thought to differ depending on external factors such as landscape heterogeneity, the focal organism and scale of application.
   2. We used one AES, organic farming, as a landscape-scale experiment to test whether its effect on butterflies depends on the spatial scale at which it is applied. Our study system consisted of organically and conventionally managed fields within eight pairs of matched landscapes, differing in the proportion of land under organic management at the landscape scale. Butterflies and their nectar and host-plant resources were surveyed along the fields and adjacent field borders.
   3. Butterfly species richness and abundance were significantly increased by organic farming at the local scale. However, local butterfly species richness was also positively affected by a large proportion of organic farming in the surrounding landscape, independent of the local farming practice. Local and landscape farming practices interacted such that the farming practice within fields had a larger effect on butterfly abundance if surrounded by conventionally rather than organically managed fields. These results could only partly be explained by variation in local availability of nectar and host-plant resources.
   4. The total observed species richness (gamma-diversity) was higher in organically managed landscapes, mainly because of higher within-field diversity (alpha-diversity), whereas the between-field diversity (beta-diversity) tended to be similar in both landscape types.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Butterflies were positively affected by organic farming at a local scale, but the amount of organic farming in the surrounding landscape had either an additive (species richness) or interactive (abundance) effect. Therefore, the spatial distribution of AES must be taken into account to maximize their potential to increase farmland biodiversity. We have shown that organic farming affected butterfly species richness on nearby conventionally managed land. This suggests a landscape effect of organic farming that may indicate a wider benefit of AES for biodiversity conservation.

AB Positive relationships between species diversity and productivity have been reported for a number of ecosystems(1,2). Theoretical and experimental studies have attempted to determine the mechanisms that generate this pattern over short timescales(1,2), but little attention has been given to the problem of understanding how diversity and productivity are linked over evolutionary timescales. Here, we investigate the role of dispersal in determining both diversity and productivity over evolutionary timescales, using experimental metacommunities of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens assembled by divergent natural selection. We show that both regional diversity and productivity peak at an intermediate dispersal rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that these two patterns are linked: selection at intermediate rates of dispersal leads to high niche differentiation between genotypes, allowing greater coverage of the heterogeneous environment and a higher regional productivity. We argue that processes that operate over both ecological and evolutionary timescales should be jointly considered when attempting to understand the emergence of ecosystem- level properties such as diversity - function relationships.

AB Efforts to characterize carbon (C) cycling among atmosphere, forest canopy, and soil C pools are hindered by poorly quantified fine root dynamics. We characterized the influence of free-air-CO2-enrichment (ambient +200 ppm) on fine roots for a period of 6 years (Autumn 1998 through Autumn 2004) in an 18-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation near Durham, NC, USA using minirhizotrons. Root production and mortality were synchronous processes that peaked most years during spring and early summer. Seasonality of fine root production and mortality was not influenced by atmospheric CO2 availability. Averaged over all 6 years of the study, CO2 enrichment increased average fine root standing crop (+23%), annual root length production (+25%), and annual root length mortality (+36%). Larger increase in mortality compared with production with CO2 enrichment is explained by shorter average fine root lifespans in elevated plots (500 days) compared with controls (574 days). The effects of CO2-enrichment on fine root proliferation tended to shift from shallow (0-15 cm) to deeper soil depths (15-30) with increasing duration of the study. Diameters of fine roots were initially increased by CO2-enrichment but this effect diminished over time. Averaged over 6 years, annual fine root NPP was estimated to be 163 g dw m(-2) yr(-1) in CO2-enriched plots and 130 g dw m(-2) yr(-1) in control plots (P = 0.13) corresponding to an average annual additional input of fine root biomass to soil of 33 g m(-2) yr(-1) in CO2-enriched plots. A lack of consistent CO2 x year effects suggest that the positive effects of CO2 enrichment on fine root growth persisted 6 years following minirhizotron tube installation (8 years following initiation of the CO2 fumigation). Although CO2-enrichment contributed to extra flow of C into soil in this experiment, the magnitude of the effect was small suggesting only modest potential for fine root processes to directly contribute to soil C storage in south-eastern pine forests.

AB Propagule pressure is considered the main determinant of success of biological invasions: when a large number of individuals are introduced into an area, the species is more likely to establish and become invasive. Nevertheless, precise data on propagule pressure exist only for a small sample of invasive species, usually voluntarily introduced. We studied the invasion of the American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, into Europe, a species that is considered a major cause of decline for native amphibians. For this major invader with scarce historical data, we used population genetics data (a partial sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene) to infer the invasion history and to estimate the number of founders of non-native populations. Based on differences between populations, at least six independent introductions from the native range occurred in Europe, followed by secondary translocations. Genetic diversity was strongly reduced in non-native populations, indicating a very strong bottleneck during colonization. We used simulations to estimate the precise number of founders and found that most non-native populations derive from less than six females. This capability of invasion from a very small number of propagules challenges usual management strategies; species with such ability should be identified at an early stage of introduction.

AB Altitudinal change in temperatures has a major effect on the distribution of plants and vegetation along an elevational gradient in mountainous areas. In order to explore changes in temperatures in Mt. Taibai (3767 in a.s.l.), Qinling Mountains, the highest mountain in eastern mainland China, we used temperature microloggers to measure the temperature throughout a year on the northern and southern slopes. The measurement was conducted at 16 different elevations between 1250 and 3250 m from August 2001 to July 2002. The results showed that with an increase of altitude, the annual mean temperature (AMT) decreased at a lapse rate of 0.34 +/- 0.04 and 0.50 +/- 0.02 degrees C/100 m on the southern and northern slopes, respectively. The lapse rates of monthly mean temperatures (MMT) showed a large seasonal difference, with a higher value in the summer than in the winter, ranging from 0.14 +/- 0.05 to 0.43 +/- 0.05 degrees C/100 m on the southern slope, and from 0.29 +/- 0.03 to 0.63 +/- 0.02 degrees C/100 m on the northern slope. The accumulated temperature above 0 degrees C (ATO) decreased at a lapse rate of 98.6 +/- 13.0 and 142.5 +/- 3.75 degrees C days/100 m along the southern and northern slopes, respectively. The annual mean diurnal range of temperature (ADRT) was higher on the southern slope than on the northern slope, while the annual range of temperature (ART) showed a converse pattern. The ART declined at a lapse rate of 0.24 +/- 0.07 and 0.32 +/- 0.04 degrees C/100 m on the southern and northern slopes. Our results revealed that lapse rates of temperature variables showed large spatial and seasonal changes, and these changes should be taken into account for analysis of vegetation-climate relationships in mountainous areas.

AB Aim This study used data from temperate forest communities to assess: (1) five different stepwise selection methods with generalized additive models, (2) the effect of weighting absences to ensure a prevalence of 0.5, (3) the effect of limiting absences beyond the environmental envelope defined by presences, (4) four different methods for incorporating spatial autocorrelation, and (5) the effect of integrating an interaction factor defined by a regression tree on the residuals of an initial environmental model.
   Location State of Vaud, western Switzerland.
   Methods Generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted using the grasp package (generalized regression analysis and spatial predictions, http://www.cscf.ch/grasp).
   Results Model selection based on cross-validation appeared to be the best compromise between model stability and performance (parsimony) among the five methods tested. Weighting absences returned models that perform better than models fitted with the original sample prevalence. This appeared to be mainly due to the impact of very low prevalence values on evaluation statistics. Removing zeroes beyond the range of presences on main environmental gradients changed the set of selected predictors, and potentially their response curve shape. Moreover, removing zeroes slightly improved model performance and stability when compared with the baseline model on the same data set. Incorporating a spatial trend predictor improved model performance and stability significantly. Even better models were obtained when including local spatial autocorrelation. A novel approach to include interactions proved to be an efficient way to account for interactions between all predictors at once.
   Main conclusions Models and spatial predictions of 18 forest communities were significantly improved by using either: (1) cross-validation as a model selection method, (2) weighted absences, (3) limited absences, (4) predictors accounting for spatial autocorrelation, or (5) a factor variable accounting for interactions between all predictors. The final choice of model strategy should depend on the nature of the available data and the specific study aims. Statistical evaluation is useful in searching for the best modelling practice. However, one should not neglect to consider the shapes and interpretability of response curves, as well as the resulting spatial predictions in the final assessment.

AB Electricity-generating wind turbines are an attractive energy source because they are renewable and produce no emissions. However, they have at least two potentially damaging ecological effects. Their rotating blades are hazardous to raptors which occasionally fly into them. And wind turbines are very noisy when active, a feature that may interfere with the lives of animals beneath them. We studied California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area of Northern California. These squirrels emit vocalizations that alert others to the presence of a predator, and so may be forced to compensate for turbine noise by modifying antipredator behavior. We compared the antipredator behavior of squirrels at two sites, one close to and the other far from turbines, and under two conditions, during baseline and playback of conspecific alarm calls. We generated composite two variables using principle components analysis, one representing vigilance and one representing another cautionary antipredator tactic, for further statistical comparisons. Animals at the Turbine site exhibited elevated levels of vigilance and showed increased caution demonstrated in part, by returning to the area near their burrows during alarm calling. We conclude that this site difference is probably caused by the disparity in turbine noise, since predator abundance, group size, and vegetation type and density were similar for the two sites. Though population level impacts of these behavioral differences remain to be explored, our results indicate that behavioral impacts of turbines on wildlife should be considered during future turbine development.

AB In organisms with complex life cycles, physiological stressors during early life stages may have fitness-level impacts that are delayed into later stages or habitats. We tested the hypothesis that body size and date of metamorphosis, which are highly responsive to aquatic stressors, influence post-metamorphic survival and movement patterns in the terrestrial phase of an ephemeral pond-breeding frog by examining these traits in two populations of northern red-legged frogs (Rana aurora aurora). To increase variation of body size at metamorphosis, we manipulated food availability for 314 of 1045 uniquely marked tadpoles and estimated the probability that frogs survived and emigrated using concentric rings of drift fencing surrounding ponds and Bayesian capture-recapture modeling. The odds of surviving and emigrating from the ponds to the innermost drift fences, similar to 12 m, increased by factors of 2.20 (95% credibility intervals 1.39-4.23) and 2.54 (0.94-4.91) with each millimeter increase in snout-vent length and decreased by factors of 0.91 (0.85-0.96) and 0.89 (0.80-1.00) with each day's delay in metamorphosis for the two ponds. The odds of surviving and moving to the next ring of fencing, 12 m to similar to 40 m from the ponds, increased by a factor of 1.20 (0.45-4.06) with each millimeter increase in size. Our results demonstrated that body size and timing of metamorphosis relate strongly to the performance of newly metamorphosed frogs during their initial transition into terrestrial habitat. Carryover effects of aquatic stressors that reduce size and delay metamorphosis may have population-level impacts that are not expressed until terrestrial stages. Since changes in both aquatic and terrestrial systems are implicated in many amphibian declines, quantifying both immediate and delayed effects of stressors on demographic rates is critical to sound management.

AB Several lines of evidence suggest that the species diversity and composition of communities should depend on genetic diversity within component species, but there has been very little effort to directly assess this possibility. Here I use models of competition among genotypes and species to demonstrate a strong positive effect of the number of genotypes per species on species diversity across a range of conditions. Genetic diversity allows species to respond to selection imposed by competition, resulting in both functional convergence and divergence among species depending on their initial niche positions. This ability to respond to selection promote., species coexistence and contributes to a reduction in variation in species composition among communities. These models suggest that whenever individual fitness depends on the degree of functional similarity between a focal individual and its competitors, genetic diversity should promote species coexistence; this prediction is consistent with the few relevant empirical data collected to date. The results point to the importance of considering the genetic origin and diversity of material used in ecological experiments and in restoration efforts, in addition to highlighting potentially important community consequences of the loss of genetic diversity in natural populations.

AB The role and importance of natural hybridization in the evolutionary histories of animal taxa is still debated. This results largely from a history of zoological investigations that assumed, rather than documented, a limited evolutionary role for this process. However, it is now becoming apparent that, just as for plants, the creative effects of reticulate evolution are widespread in animal taxa as well. This conclusion is supported by the documentation of numerous instances of the formation of new taxa and the genetic enrichment through introgressive hybridization. In the present review, we use primates as a paradigm for how natural hybridization can affect the evolution of species complexes and remains a footprint on genomes. Findings for a number of groups, including basal (e.g. lemurs) and derived (e.g. Old World apes) lineages, demonstrate that introgression and hybrid speciation have caused a reticulate pattern that is still detectable in the, often mosaic, genomes of primates. For example, results from genetic analyses of our own species demonstrate the process of past introgressive hybridization with the progenitors of our sister taxa (i.e. chimpanzees and gorillas) and most likely also our extinct, close relatives in the hominid lineage.

AB 1. Growth, reproductive success and non-structural carbon pools in Polylepis tarapacana Philippi trees were examined across a transect between 4360 and 4810 m altitude on Nevado Sajama, Bolivia.
   2. The mean -10-cm soil temperature of 5.4 degrees C under trees at the treeline during the 265-day growing season matched the threshold temperature found at other subtropical and tropical treelines. Beyond 4400 m Polylepis is restricted to the warmer and drier equator-facing slopes, suggesting a direct thermal limitation of tree growth.
   3. Maximum tree height, annual shoot increment and mean tree-ring width decreased with altitude. Trees near the upper range limit reached a maximum tree height of 3.3 m and a maximum stem diameter of 34 cm.
   4. The smallest tree-height classes dominated populations at all altitudes, and the uppermost site revealed the highest proportion of seedlings. Tree-size demography indicates a critical phase for tree establishment during the sapling stage, when trees emerge from sheltered niches near the ground.
   5. No evidence of a depletion of mobile C stores (sugars, starch and lipids) was found in any tissue type with increasing elevation, suggesting a limitation of C investment (growth) rather than C acquisition (photosynthesis) at treeline.

AB Homoploid hybrid speciation occurs through stabilization of a hybrid segregate (or segregates) isolated by premating and/or postmating barriers from parent taxa. Theory predicts that ecological and spatial isolation are of critical importance during homoploid hybrid speciation, and all confirmed homoploid hybrid species are ecologically isolated from their parents. Until recently, such species have been identified long after they originated, and consequently it has not been possible to determine the relative importance of spatial and ecological isolation during their origin. Here we present evidence for the recent origin (within the past 300 years) of a new homoploid hybrid species, Senecio squalidus (Asteraceae), in the British Isles, following long-distance dispersal of hybrid material from a hybrid zone between S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius on Mount Etna, Sicily, Italy. Historical records show that such hybrid material from Sicily was introduced to the Oxford Botanic Garden in Britain in the early part of the 18th century and that S. squalidus began to spread from there after approximately 90 years. A survey of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA/intersimple sequence repeats (RAPD/ISSR) marker variation demonstrated that S. squalidus is a diploid hybrid derivative of S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius that grow at high and low altitudes, respectively, on Mount Etna and that form a hybrid zone at intermediate altitudes. Senecio squalidus contained 11 of 13 RAPD/ISSR markers that were recorded at high frequency in S. chrysanthemifolius but were absent or occurred at low frequency in S. aethnensis, and 10 of 13 markers for which the reverse was true. Bayesian admixture analysis showed that all individuals of S. squalidus surveyed were of mixed ancestry with relatively high mean proportions of ancestry derived from both S. chrysanthemifolius and S. aethnensis (0.644 and 0.356, respectively). We argue that long-distance isolation of hybrid material from its parents on Mount Etna would have helped favor the origin and establishment of S. squalidus in the British Isles, regardless of whether the initial hybrid material introduced to Britain was preadapted to local conditions.

AB 1. Biodiversity-environment relationships are increasingly well-understood in the context of species richness and species composition, whereas other aspects of biodiversity, including variability in functional diversity (FD), have received rather little rigorous attention. For streams, most studies to date have examined either taxonomic assemblage patterns or have experimentally addressed the importance of species richness for ecosystem functioning.
   2. I examined the relationships of the functional biodiversity of stream macroinvertebrates to major environmental and spatial gradients across 111 boreal headwater streams in Finland. Functional biodiversity encompassed functional richness (FR - the number of functional groups derived from a combination of functional feeding groups and habit trait groups), FD - the number of functional groups and division of individuals among these groups, and functional evenness (FE - the division of individuals among functional groups). Furthermore, functional structure (FS) comprised the composition and abundance of functional groups at each site.
   3. FR increased with increasing pH, with additional variation related to moss cover, total nitrogen, water colour and substratum particle size. FD similarly increased with increasing pH and decreased with increasing canopy cover. FE decreased with increasing canopy cover and water colour. Significant variation in FS was attributable to pH, stream width, moss cover, substratum particle size, nitrogen, water colour with the dominant pattern in FS being related to the increase of shredder-sprawlers and the decrease of scraper-swimmers in acidic conditions.
   4. In regression analysis and redundancy analysis, variation in functional biodiversity was not only related to local environmental factors, but a considerable proportion of variability was also attributable to spatial patterning of environmental variables and pure spatial gradients. For FR, 23.4% was related to pure environmental effects, 15.0% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 8.0% to spatial trends. For FD, 13.8% was attributable to environmental effects, 15.2% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 5% to spatial trends. For FE, 9.0% was related to environmental variables, 12.7% to shared effects of environmental and spatial variables and 4.5% to spatial variables. For FS, 13.5% was related to environmental effects, 16.9% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 15.4% to spatial trends.
   5. Given that functional biodiversity should portray variability in ecosystem functioning, one might expect to find functionally rather differing ecosystems at the opposite ends of major environmental gradients (e.g. acidity, stream size). However, the degree to which variation in the functional biodiversity of stream macroinvertebrates truly portrays variability in ecosystem functioning is difficult to judge because species traits, such as feeding roles and habit traits, are themselves strongly affected by the habitat template.
   6. If functional characteristics show strong responses to natural environmental gradients, they also are likely to do so to anthropogenic environmental changes, including changes in habitat structure, organic inputs and acidifying elements. However, given the considerable degree of spatial structure in functional biodiversity, one should not expect that only the local environment and anthropogenic changes therein are responsible for this variability. Rather, the spatial context, as well as natural variability along environmental gradients, should also be explicitly considered in applied research.

AB Fire is the keystone, disturbance in the Alaskan boreal forest and is highly influenced by summer weather patterns: Records from the last. 53 years reveal high variability in:, the annual area burned in, Alaska and corresponding high variability in weather occurring at multiple, spatial and temporal scales. Here we use multiple linear regression (MLR) to systematically explore the relationships between weather variables and the annual area burned in Alaska. Variation in the seasonality of the atmospheric circulation-fire linkage is addressed through an evaluation of both the East Pacific teleconnection field and a Pacific Decadal Oscillation index keyed to an annual fire index. In the MLR, seven explanatory variables and an interaction term collectively explain 79% of the variability in the natural logarithm of the number of hectares burned annually by lightning-caused fires in Alaska from 1950 to 2003. Average June temperature alone explains one-third of the variability in the, logarithm. of annual area burned. The results of this work suggest that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the East Pacific teleconnection indices can be useful in determining a priori an estimate of the number of hectares that will burn in an upcoming season. This information also provides insight into the link between ocean-atmosphere interactions and the fire disturbance regime in Alaska.

AB The combined effect of drought and light on different physiological and biochemical traits was assessed in cork oak (Quercus suber L.) seedlings grown under two levels of light availability and submitted to a long-standing drought. Watering was withdrawn after germination and seedlings were allowed to dry to a water content of ca. 50% of field capacity. At this point, water-stressed seedlings were grown under moderate drought and two light regimes: high light (HL-50%) and low light (LL-2%). Soil water in control plants was kept close to field capacity (90-100%) for both light environments. Water-relations parameters derived from P-V curves, gas exchange and water status at predawn (Psi(pd)) were evaluated at twice during the experiment. Nitrogen and chlorophyll contents were determined in the same leaves used for the gas exchange measurements. In addition, maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) and electronic transport (J(max)) were derived from A-C-i curves in well-watered seedlings.
   The variation on moisture availability during the experiment was the same under both light environments. In control plants, Psi(pd) was over -0.3 MPa at the two harvests, while stressed seedlings decreased to -0.9 MPa, with no differences between light treatments. Water stress decreased osmotic potentials at full (Psi pi(100)) and zero turgor (Psi pi(0)). The regressions between both potentials and Psi(pd) showed a higher intercept in shade grown seedlings. This fact will point out the higher osmoregulation capacity in sun seedlings whatever water availability.
   Nitrogen investment on a per leaf mass (N-mass), chlorophyll content (Chl(mass)) and SLA tended to show a typical pattern of sun-shade acclimation. Thus, the three parameters increased with shade. Only for N-mass there was a significant effect of watering, since water stress increased N-mass.
   LL plants showed a lower photosynthetic capacity in terms of maximum net photosynthesis at saturating light (A,.), which was related to a decrease in V-cmax and J(max). Both parameters varied with specific leaf area (SLA) in a similar way. The low-light environment brought about a higher nitrogen investment in chlorophyll, while under high-light environment the investment was higher in carboxylation (V-cmax) and electronic transport (F-max).
   Stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(w)) and A(max) were lower in low-light seedlings independently of watering. In addition, there was a trend to keep higher intrinsic water use efficiency (IWUE) under high light environment. The increase of IWUE under water stress was higher in HL seedlings. This was as consequence of the steeper decline in g(w) as Psi(pd) decreased. The decrease of A(max) with Psi(pd) occurred in a similar way in LL and HL seedlings. Thus, the HL seedlings tended to sustain a higher ability to increase IWUE than LL seedlings when they were submitted to the same water stress. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological invasion by normative species is a global phenomenon that has the capacity to dramatically alter native communities. However, surprisingly few studies have quantified the effects of exotic plant species on the communities they invade, or have considered how these effects vary among habitat types or seasons. Here, we used both comparative and experimental field studies to investigate the influence of Cape ivy (Delairea odorata; Asteraceae), an invasive evergreen vine native to South Africa, on three habitat types in coastal regions of northern California (coastal scrub, willow riparian, and alder riparian). In the comparative study, plots invaded by Cape ivy contained 36% fewer native plant species and 37% fewer normative taxa, and this pattern persisted across habitat types and seasons. The richness of grass and forb species was lower in invaded plots, whereas fern and shrub richness did not vary among zones. Native species richness was significantly lower with increasing cover of Cape ivy, but this was not the case for normative species. In addition, invasion by Cape ivy was associated with a 31% decrease in species diversity as well as an 88% decrease in the abundance of native seedlings and a 92% decrease in normative seedlings compared to uninvaded areas. After 2 yr, a Cape-ivy reduction experiment yielded similar results, with a 10% increase in the richness of native species compared to control plots, and a 43% increase in the richness of normative taxa. Forb species richness increased significantly when Cape-ivy cover was reduced, whereas shrub richness decreased slightly and no effects were detected for ferns and grasses. We also found that Cape-ivy reduction led to a 32% increase in plant species diversity, an 86% increase in the abundance of native seedlings, and an 85% increase for normative seedlings. In all cases, the effects of Cape-ivy reduction were consistent across habitat types. Collectively, our results indicate that this invader has significantly changed the composition of three different habitat types, and its control should be a major priority. However, our data also indicate that Cape ivy had negative effects on the richness of both native and normative plant species. Such findings suggest that a consequence of removing Cape ivy from invaded areas may be to facilitate the proliferation of other normative species.

AB Soil properties should be taken into account when managing and restoring semi-natural grasslands. Topsoils sampled at 462 sites in temperate lowland grasslands in England, UK, were analysed for pH, extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg), total nitrogen (N), organic matter (OM), and estimated available water capacity. Soil-plant community relationships were determined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Mesotrophic semi-improved grasslands had soil nutrient levels closer to semi-natural communities than to agriculturally improved grasslands, and will be suitable targets for restoration. Unimproved mesotrophic sub-communities were distributed along a pH gradient and will be sensitive to soil pH changes. Wet grasslands were differentiated at the community level; the most species-rich had low extractable P and K levels and will require high levels of soil wetness. Calcareous grasslands were less well differentiated from one another but had lowest ecological amplitudes. Soil summary data for communities are presented to assist site managers and policy makers.

AB We tested forecasts made by Mac Nally and Bennett (Mac Nally, R., Bennett, A.F., 1997. Species-specific predictions of the impact of habitat fragmentation: local extinction of birds in the box-ironbark forests of central Victoria, Australia. Biological Conservation 82, 147-155) of relative vulnerability to habitat fragmentation for 43 species of birds in the box-ironbark system of central Victoria, Australia. The predictions were based on a simple, tripartite model linking habitat specialization, density and mobility, three of the characteristics most widely mooted in the literature to influence vulnerability to habitat fragmentation. For each species, a predicted index of 'proneness' to local extinction was calculated by using prior, independent data. The model system consisted of existing fragments of 10, 20, 40 and 80 ha size-classes, with between 5 and 15 'replicates' of each size-class. Replicated 'refcrence-areas' - mapped-out areas of these same size-classes set within large (> 10 000 ha) remnant forests of the same general vegetation as the fragments - were surveyed also to. provide 'expectations' of the likelihood of finding each species in a given size-class. Our results indicated that the simple model had virtually no predictive power: the index-values for proneness to local extinction were no help in forecasting whether a given species was over- or under-represented in a fragment of a given size based on the bird's occurrence in reference-areas of similar size. When the three components of the model were tested separately, measures of habitat specialization and mobility showed no relationship with the observed responses of birds to fragmentation, while for population density there was a significant relationship but in a direction contrary to that expected. Evaluation of assumptions underlying the test revealed two main factors that are likely to have affected the model's performance: (I)differences in anthropogenic impacts between fragments and reference-areas have resulted in differences in habitat quality, and (2) species interactions within fragments differ from those in reference-areas, a result of secondary effects arising from the altered spatial pattern of the habitat (e.g. the expansion of numbers and influence of 'despotic' species such as the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala), These two factors appear to be common to most fragmented systems and, therefore, need to be addressed in predictive models of species vulnerability. However, because the nature of anthropogenic impacts and the types of changes to species interactions in fragments differ between ecosystems, we conclude that it will be difficult to develop a model of species' vulnerability to fragmentation that has both strong predictive ability and wide generality among ecosystems.

AB Bees (series Apiformes, superfamily Apoidea) are most diverse in arid regions of the world. Arid regions (deserts and semi-deserts) are characterized by discrete rainy seasons and extreme temporal variability in rainfall. This paper documents several novel mechanisms by which one desert bee species (Perdita portalis) copes with harsh and unpredictable conditions in xeric habitats. These same mechanisms are likely to be present in diverse bee families. First, diapausing P. portalis follow a bet-hedging emergence pattern, such that only approximately half of the larvae pupate under optimal conditions. Second, emergence is condition dependent such that larvae with a low average body weight are significantly more likely to emerge than are larvae with a high average body weight under similar conditions. Finally, larval emergence is induced by exposure to high humidity (rainfall). The parallels between bee larvae and angiosperm seeds in arid environments are striking. In both cases there is clear evidence of bet hedging, emergence (or germination) is dependent on larval (or seed) condition and rainfall triggers emergence (or germination). These patterns of emergence are significant for understanding bee species diversity in arid regions.

ID HUMAN CANCER; MUTATION; RETINOBLASTOMA; SIZE
AB A wide array of proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes are involved in the prevention of cancer. Each form of cancer requires mutations in a characteristic group of genes, but no single group controls all cancers. This lack of generality shows that the control of cancer is not an ancient, fixed property of cells. By contrast, it supports a dynamic evolutionary model, whereby genetic controls over unregulated cell growth are recruited independently through evolutionary time in different tissues within different taxa. The complexity of this genetic control can be predicted from a population genetic model of lineage selection driven by the detrimental fitness effects of cancer. Cancer occurs because the genetic control of cell growth is vulnerable to somatic mutations (or 'hits'), particularly in large, continuously dividing tissues. Thus, compared to small rodents, humans must have evolved more complex genetic controls over cell growth in at least some of their tissues because of their greater size and longevity; an expectation relevant to the application of mouse data to humans. Similarly the 'two-hit' model so successfully applied to retinoblastoma, which originates in a small embryonic tissue, is unlikely to be generally applicable to other human cancers; instead, more complex scenarios are expected to dominate, with complexity depending upon a tissue's size and its pattern of proliferation.

AB Edge effects encompass a complex panoply of biotic and abiotic phenomena across woodland borders. I identify four main explanations which have been proposed to explain avian habitat selection with respect to forest edges: 1) individualistic resource and patch use, 2) biotic interactions; 3) microclimate modification and 4) changes in vegetation structure. 1) relates nest site location in woodlands relative to the edge to the proximity of food resources. It is shown that, all other things being equal, birds which are wholly dependent on resources found within woodlands will tend to avoid forest edges. Woodland species dependent upon resources found in adjacent habitats will tend to be found near to edges to enable their exploitation. 2) identifies competition, predation and brood parasitism as factors which have the potential to influence bird habitat selection near edges. 3) identifies microclimate modification as a potential influence which may act directly on nesting success or indirectly through its effects on food supply; 4) relates the activities of birds, such as nesting, feeding or use of song posts, to vegetation structure and/or floristic composition at the edge. Research on edge effects of birds in woodland has provided few practical recommendations to conservation managers. Forest edge management needs to take into account the multiple cause and effects which influence habitat selection at the edge and to target species of conservation concern.

AB The relationship between surface sediment diatom (Division: Bacillariophyta) assemblages and measured water chemical and environmental variables in 30 lakes from northern Fennoscandia were examined using multivariate statistical techniques. The lakes are distributed across the treeline, spanning boreal coniferous forest to treeless tundra zones along a steep climatic gradient. Such lakes at an ecotonal boundary offer excellent opportunities to study the interactions of physicochemical environment and biotic assemblages. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), with forward selection and associated Monte Carlo permutation tests, suggested that pH, surface-water temperature, conductivity, altitude, and sodium made significant (P < 0.05) contributions to explaining the variation in the diatom assemblages. A constrained CCA with temperature as the only explanatory variable revealed that the surface-water temperature was a strong variable, and accounted for a statistically significant proportion of the variance in the diatom data. The data-set will be expanded and used to create a quantitative predictive model (transfer function) for temperature which can be applied to sediment-core diatoms to reconstruct lake-water paleotemperatures.

AB 1 Age and diameter distributions of nonpyrogenic, virgin Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) populations were studied at six different sites of the Empetrum-Vaccinium type along a latitudinal gradient (65 degrees 54'-68 degrees 15'N) in northern Sweden. 1910 trees, including saplings and seedlings, were aged at their root collars in order to reconstruct regeneration patterns.
   2 All populations had multimodal age structures. Obvious regeneration pulses occurred in the 1770s-80s and 1950s-70s. The three southernmost stands exhibited an additional regeneration pulse in the 1870s-80s. A regeneration cycle of about 100 years in the south and 200 years in the north were thus clearly expressed. Correlation with temperature changes over the past 300 years showed that recruitment peaks of Scots pine lagged 20-30 years behind the warm climate periods and fell to zero in the intervening cold periods.
   3 A much smaller number of experimentally planted pine and spruce seeds established and survived in vegetation dominated by Empetrum hermaphroditum than in that dominated by Cladina spp. After two growing seasons, fresh weights of pine seedlings were also much lower in E. hermaphroditum vegetation than in Cladina spp. Spruce established less frequently than pine in both vegetation types. Naturally established pine seedlings were found almost exclusively in vegetation dominated by Cladina spp.
   4 The wave-like regeneration pattern of pine may therefore result from successful establishment in periods with good seed production on ground dominated by Vaccinium spp. and Cladina spp. This vegetation type is favoured by warm dry conditions but its establishment possibly lagged behind climate change. The extreme amplitude between regeneration failures and successes found over the period studied may be caused by the specific complex of vegetation responses to climate variability found in this forest type.
   5 The results have implications for predicting the effect of climatic warming.

TI THE SYNTHESIS OF LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE CONTEXT OF

DT Article

AB 1. Using sites from the Upper Rhone River, France, as an example, the objective of this paper is to identify the essential elements needed to test current ecological theories with previously collected data. Procedures developed may enable other groups to design comparable research strategies for syntheses of long-term studies of ecological systems.
   2. Because of the high number (more than 200) and turnover of researchers, the long study period (about 17 years), the evolution of research methods and interests, and the diverse systematic groups that were considered (from micro-organisms to birds), the data available for a synthesis were quite heterogeneous. The application of a fuzzy coding' technique allowed such disparate information to be structured for analysis.
   3. The habitat templet concept and the patch dynamics concept were selected for analysis with existing data on the Upper Rhone because theories, such as these, that link ecological responses to habitat templets are a focus of current ecological debate and potentially may serve as a general tool for ecologically orientated river management.
   4. A preliminary trial to structure the existing knowledge, to identify (and manage) gaps in it, and to create and apply the analytical tools in a way that predictions from theory could be tested was an essential element in the design of this project.
   5. Predictions derived from the theoretical concepts had to match the format of the available information on the Upper Rhone; potential bias was avoided by having a priori predictions developed by previously uninvolved colleagues.
   6. Synthesis of the long-term study of the Upper Rhone in the context of concurrently developed ecological theory required, at times, an unconventional research strategy. Hence, the generation of hypotheses and methods, the presentation of results, and consequently the discussions in papers of this special issue of Freshwater Biology (Statzner, Resh & Doledec, 1994) represent an innovative approach to testing ecological theory.

AB Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield (FII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others-and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.

AB Detailed information about the geographic distribution of genetic and genomic variation is necessary to better understand the organization and structure of biological diversity. In particular, spatial isolation within species and hybridization between them can blur species boundaries and create evolutionary relationships that are inconsistent with a strictly bifurcating tree model. Here, we analyse genome-wide DNA sequence and genetic ancestry variation in Lycaeides butterflies to quantify the effects of admixture and spatial isolation on how biological diversity is organized in this group. We document geographically widespread and pervasive historical admixture, with more restricted recent hybridization. This includes evidence supporting previously known and unknown instances of admixture. The genome composition of admixed individuals varies much more among than within populations, and tree-and genetic ancestry-based analyses indicate that multiple distinct admixed lineages or populations exist. We find that most genetic variants in Lycaeides are rare (minor allele frequency <0.5%). Because the spatial and taxonomic distributions of alleles reflect demographic and selective processes since mutation, rare alleles, which are presumably younger than common alleles, were spatially and taxonomically restricted compared with common variants. Thus, we show patterns of genetic variation in this group are multifaceted, and we argue that this complexity challenges simplistic notions concerning the organization of biological diversity into discrete, easily delineated and hierarchically structured entities.

AB Marine spatial planning provides a comprehensive framework for managing multiple uses of the marine environment and has the potential to minimize environmental impacts and reduce conflicts among users. Spatially explicit assessments of the risks to key marine species from human activities are a requirement of marine spatial planning. We assessed the risk of ships striking humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), and fin (Balaenoptera physalus) whales in alternative shipping routes derived from patterns of shipping traffic off Southern California (U.S.A.). Specifically, we developed whale-habitat models and assumed ship-strike risk for the alternative shipping routes was proportional to the number of whales predicted by the models to occur within each route. This definition of risk assumes all ships travel within a single route. We also calculated risk assuming ships travel via multiple routes. We estimated the potential for conflict between shipping and other uses (military training and fishing) due to overlap with the routes. We also estimated the overlap between shipping routes and protected areas. The route with the lowest risk for humpback whales had the highest risk for fin whales and vice versa. Risk to both species may be ameliorated by creating a new route south of the northern Channel Islands and spreading traffic between this new route and the existing route in the Santa Barbara Channel. Creating a longer route may reduce the overlap between shipping and other uses by concentrating shipping traffic. Blue whales are distributed more evenly across our study area than humpback and fin whales; thus, risk could not be ameliorated by concentrating shipping traffic in any of the routes we considered. Reducing ship-strike risk for blue whales may be necessary because our estimate of the potential number of strikes suggests that they are likely to exceed allowable levels of anthropogenic impacts established under U.S. laws.

AB 1. Functional traits can be used to describe the composition of communities through indices that seek to explain the factors that drive community assembly, biotic effects on ecosystem processes or both. Appropriately representing functional composition is therefore essential for predicting the consequences of environmental context and management actions for the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) in heterogeneous landscapes.
   2. Functional indices can be constructed from single or multiple traits; however, it is not clear how they differ in information content or ability to predict biodiversity - ecosystem function relationships in complex landscapes. Here, we compare the utility of analogous single-and multi-trait indices in linking environmental variation and functional composition to ESs in a heterogeneous landscape, relating functional indices based on three plant traits [height, relative growth rate and root density (RD)] to variation in the physical environment and to two ESs (forage production and soil carbon) and their net ES level.
   3. Two orthogonal gradients, elevation and soil bulk density (BD), explained significant variation in several dimensions of functional composition comprised of single traits. These traits in turn significantly predicted variation in ESs and their net values. Only one index measured with multiple traits (functional richness) varied with the physical environment, while none predicted variation in ES or net ES levels.
   4. One ES, soil carbon, increased with the community-average value of RD, while the other, forage production, was related to the range and community-average value of height. In turn, average RD increased with soil BD while the average and range of height declined with elevation. Due to these environmental patterns, soil carbon and forage production did not covary strongly, leading to moderate net ES levels across the landscape.
   5. Synthesis: Single-trait indices of functional composition best linked variation in environmental gradients with productivity and soil carbon. Because the environment-trait functioning relationships were independent of one another, the ESs were independently distributed across the landscape, providing little evidence of synergies or trade-offs. Single-and multi-trait indices contained unique information about functional composition of these communities, and both are likely to have a place in predicting variation in ESs under different scenarios.

AB 1. Degradation of freshwater ecosystems is a major concern worldwide. Agriculture introduces multiple stressors to streams, presenting a challenge for freshwater managers who must understand the relative strengths of individual stressor effects and their combined multiple-stressor effects. 2. Using a replicated regression design, we manipulated levels of fine sediment and nutrients to create a broad eight-point gradient for each stressor across 128 stream mesocosms to determine the shapes of macroinvertebrate responses after 21 days of exposure. 3. Subsidystress response patterns occurred along both stressor gradients. Sediment addition provided an initial subsidy for some pollution-tolerant taxa and total macroinvertebrate density, but produced consistently negative effects for other taxa, total taxon richness and the density and richness of pollution-sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Nutrient enrichment provided an initial subsidy for densities of two common EPT taxa, total EPT density, macroinvertebrate and EPT taxon richness. 4. Few macroinvertebrate variables were affected by a single stressor (always fine sediment). The majority of responses were additive multiple-stressor patterns, although Chironomidae density and EPT taxon richness followed complex synergistic patterns. 5. Fine sediment was a much more pervasive stressor than augmented nutrient concentrations. Overall, macroinvertebrate traits responded to stressors as strongly as community variables or individual taxa. 6. Synthesis and applications. Managing both fine sediment and nutrient inputs from agriculture is crucial to achieve good stream condition but priority should be given to minimizing fine sediment, which should be maintained below a threshold of 5% cover and 0.5-mm depth. Managers also need to be wary of interactive multiple-stressor effects because ecological outcomes of an increase in stressor load may be worse than predicted based on the knowledge of single-stressor effects.

AB Substantial uncertainty surrounds how forest ecosystems will respond to the simultaneous impacts of multiple global change drivers. Long-term forest dynamics are sensitive to changes in tree mortality rates; however, we lack an understanding of the relative importance of the factors that affect tree mortality across different spatial and temporal scales. We used the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis database to evaluate the drivers of tree mortality for eastern temperate forest at the individual-level across spatial scales from tree to landscape to region. We investigated 13 covariates in four categories: climate, air pollutants, topography, and stand characteristics. Overall, we found that tree mortality was most sensitive to stand characteristics and air pollutants. Different functional groups also varied considerably in their sensitivity to environmental drivers. This research highlights the importance of considering the interactions among multiple global change agents in shaping forest ecosystems.

AB While both sperm number and quality are now recognized to be important in determining the outcome of sperm competition, very few studies have experimentally assessed the influence of these two parameters simultaneously. We studied the effect of sperm quality and number on competitive fertilization success in an internal-fertilizing fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), which is characterized by high levels of sperm competition. We artificially inseminated virgin females with varying proportion of sperm from two competing males, while holding constant the total number of sperm transferred to the female. Sperm morphology and sperm swimming velocity were also determined prior to insemination. The paternity outcome of sperm competition trials was assessed through molecular analyses of the resulting offspring using polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found that both sperm number and sperm velocity affected the outcome of sperm competition, with males that contributed more and faster sperm achieving a greater paternity share.

AB Climate change can cause major changes to the dynamics of individual species and to those communities in which they interact. One effect of increasing temperatures is on insect voltinism, with the logical assumption that increases in surface temperatures would permit multivoltine species to increase the number of generations per year. Though insect development is primarily driven by temperature, most multivoltine insect species rely on photoperiodic cues, which do not change from year-to-year or in response to climate warming, to initiate diapause. Thus, the relationship between climate change and voltinism could be complex. We use a phenology model for grape berry moth, Paralobesia viteana (Clemens), which incorporates temperature-dependent development and diapause termination, and photoperiod-dependent diapause induction, to explore historical patterns in year-to-year voltinism fluctuations. We then extend this model to predict voltinism under varying scenarios of climate change to show the importance of both the quality and quantity of accumulated heat units. We also illustrate that increases in mean surface temperatures > 2 degrees C can have dramatic effects on insect voltinism by causing a shift in the ovipositional period that currently is subject to diapause-inducing photoperiods.

AB To resolve a panselectionist paradox, the population geneticist Kimura invented a neutral theory, where each gene is equally likely to enter the next generation whatever its allelic type. To learn what could be explained without invoking Darwinian adaptive divergence, Hubbell devised a similar neutral theory for forest ecology, assuming each tree is equally likely to reproduce whatever its species. In both theories, some predictions worked; neither theory proved universally true. Simple assumptions allow neutral theorists to treat many subjects still immune to more realistic theory. Ecologists exploit far fewer of these possibilities than population geneticists, focussing instead on species abundance distributions, where their predictions work best, but most closely match non-neutral predictions. Neutral theory cannot explain adaptive divergence or ecosystem function, which ecologists must understand. By addressing new topics and predicting changes in time, however, ecological neutral theory can provide probing null hypotheses and stimulate more realistic theory.

AB We describe an approach to dynamically couple a fish bioenergetics-based population dynamics model to the NEMURO lower trophic level nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model. The coupled models, denoted NEMURO.FISH and configured for Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasii) on the west coast of Vancouver island, are capable of simulating the daily dynamics of the lower trophic levels and the daily average weight and numbers of individual herring in each of 10 age classes over multiple years. New recruits to the herring population are added each June based on either constant recruitment or dynamic recruitment generated from an environmental Ricker spawner-recruitment relationship. The dynamics of the three zooplankton groups in the NEMURO model determine the consumption rate of the herring; herring consumption affects the zooplankton, and egestion and excretion contribute to the nitrogen dynamics. NEMURO was previously calibrated to field data for the West Coast Vancouver Island. Thirty-year simulations of herring growth and population dynamics were performed that used repeated environmental conditions for the lower trophic levels of NEMURO and historical environmental variables for the herring spawner-recruit relationship. Herring dynamics were calibrated to the west coast of Vancouver Island such that the coupled models reasonably duplicated observed herring weights-at-age and total herring biomass. Additional 30-year simulations under constant recruitment with herring coupled and uncoupled from NEMURO clearly showed the effects of the feedback mechanism between the two models and also showed that herring have small to moderate effects on their prey. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis showed the importance of feeding- and respiration-related parameters to predicted individual and population herring growth. The utility of the NEMURO.FISH framework for improving our understanding of climate change effects on marine ecosystem dynamics is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing temperatures due to climate change were found to influence abundance and timing of species in numerous ways. Whereas many studies have investigated climate-induced effects on the phenology and abundance of single species, less is known about climate-driven shifts in the diversity and composition of entire communities. Analyses of long-term data sets provide the potential to reveal such relationships. We analysed time series of entire communities of macrozoobenthos in lakes and streams in Northern Europe. There were no direct linear effects of temperature and climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation index) on species composition and diversity, but using multivariate statistics we were able to show that trends in average temperature have already had profound impacts on species composition in lakes. These significant temperature signals on species composition were evident even though we analysed comparatively short time periods of 10-15 years. Future climate shifts may thus induce strong variance in community composition.

AB Question: The heterogeneous origin of the data in large phyto-sociological databases may seriously influence the results of their analysis. Therefore we propose some strategies for stratified resampling of such databases, which may improve the representativeness of the data. We also explore the effects of different resampling options on vegetation classification.
   Methods: We used 6050 plot samples (releves) of mesic grasslands from the Czech Republic. We stratified this database using (I) geographical stratification in a grid; (2) habitat stratification created by an overlay of digital maps in GIS; (3) habitat stratification with strata defined by traditional phyto-sociological associations; (4) habitat stratification by numerical classification and (5) habitat stratification by Ellenberg indicator values. Each time we resampled the database, taking equal numbers of releves per stratum. We then carried out cluster analyses for the resampled data sets and compared the resulting classifications using a newly developed procedure.
   Results: Random resampling of the initial data set and geographically stratified resampling resulted in similar classifications. By contrast, classifications of the resampled data sets that were based on habitat stratifications (2-5) differed from each other and from the initial data set. Stratification 2 resulted in classifications that strongly reflected environmental factors with a coarse grain of spatial heterogeneity (e.g. macroclimate), whereas stratification 5 resulted in classifications emphasizing fine-grained factors (e.g. soil nutrient status). Stratification 3 led to the most deviating results, possibly due to the subjective nature of the traditional phytosociological classifications.
   Conclusions: Stratified resampling may increase the representativeness of phytosociological data sets, but different types of stratification may result in different classifications. No single resampling strategy is optimal or superior: the appropriate stratification method must be selected according to the objectives of specific studies.

AB This paper presents an agent-based model of land use designed to explore the impacts of edge-effect externalities-distance-dependent spatial extemalities-on land-use pattern. While the impacts of externalities on aspatial economics measures such as equilibrium land rents and the distribution of economic activity are well explored, links between externalities and landscape pattern are not well understood. This gap reflects a more general gap between aspatial theoretical land-use models and descriptive, pattern-based empirical analysis. The model presented in this paper, designed to link changes in socioeconomic parameters to changes in macroscale measures of landscape pattern, was developed with the specific goal of formally bridging this gap. The model simulates land-use decisions of parcel managers in an environment where potential conflicts between urban and agricultural land uses affect the payoffs to particular land uses. In the model, spatial and aspatial macroscale outcomes emerge from the independent, but dynamically linked, decisions of individual parcel managers. Land-use composition, land-use pattern, and the location of land uses are jointly determined, and interactions between composition and pattern feedback to microlevel landowner decisions through endogenous land rents. The paper demonstrates a series of results. First, the paper demonstrates the economic inefficiency of landscape fragmentation when edge-effect externalities are present and illustrates a series of landscape metrics appropriate to measure this fragmentation. Second, the agent-based model is used to demonstrate links between externality impacts and landscape pattern: that conflicts between urban and residential land users lead to a more compact urban form, that when the profitability of agricultural production is reduced by proximity to urban land, the urban-rural fringe expands to a socially inefficient degree, and that conflicts between urban land users can lead to fragmented patterns of urban development consistent with existing definitions of urban sprawl. Finally, the paper concludes by proposing a methodology for establishing the robustness of the model's conclusions over a wide range of parameter values. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a part of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research project, we determined how land-use alteration influenced spider and harvestman diversity. We sampled spiders in six habitat types (desert parks, urban desert remnants, industrial, agricultural, xeric- and mesic-residential yards) and tested how habitat type and productivity affected spider diversity and abundance. As expected, agricultural fields and mesic yards were more productive than the other, xeric habitats. These more productive habitats were characterized by higher abundances but lower spider diversity and were dominated by Lycosidae (wolf spiders), followed by Linyphiidae (sheet-web weavers). The increase in wolf spider abundance was positively correlated with habitat productivity and negatively correlated with the abundance of other predatory arthropods that might compete with, or prey upon, wolf spiders. Temporal changes in productivity affected spider abundance. After an El-Ni (n) over tildeo winter (May 1998), spider abundance was five times higher than after an extremely dry winter (May 2000). The differences in spider abundance between agricultural fields and the four xeric habitats were profound in 2000 but moderate in 1998, suggesting an interaction between the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on spider populations. Compared with xeric habitats, the El-Ni (n) over tildeo effect was less profound in agricultural sites, suggesting that human land modification mollifies seasonal effects. We suggest that habitat structure and productivity alteration may change community structure, as the urban or agricultural habitats favor one or a few preadapted taxa over many others. Incorporation of large fragments of natural habitats into future landscape planning in urban environments may be important for conservation of rich spider communities.

AB Aerial dispersal by ballooning is a passive flight, by which wind drag generates an upward lift on a silk thread. It is likely to reflect an aerial lottery, in which the absence of flight direction control is a serious cost for long-distance dispersal in a fragmented landscape. For species occurring in one patchily distributed habitat type, dispersal should evolve in a different way from morphological traits, directly linked to active dispersal. Therefore, we expect that if the risk of landing in an unsuitable habitat is lower than the probability of reaching a suitable habitat, selection should benefit a well-developed ballooning behaviour. We investigated interspecific variation in the ballooning-initiating tiptoe behaviour as it is linked to spider dispersal performance. Our results indeed indicate that ballooning performance is negatively related to habitat specialization in spiders from patchy grey dunes, so habitat specialists are characterized by poorly developed dispersal behaviour. These findings are concordant with recent insights that dispersal is selected as risk spreading in generalists, while it is selected against in specialist species.

AB Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) have undergone a documented Europe-wide decline in recent years, mostly attributable to destruction of forage and nest sites caused by agricultural intensification. This study was set up to quantify species-specific nest-site preferences of observed UK species for various types of field and forest boundary habitat. In total, 1287 observations were made of seven common bumblebee species; nest-searching behaviour was taken as being indicative of nest site preference. There was interspecific variation in preferred habitat, with some species found to be much more specific in their choice of nest site than others. A strong association was found between those species that are known to prefer subterraneous nesting and those habitats that contained banks (Bornbus terrestris, B. lapidarius and B. lucorum); other species were strongly associated with tussock-type vegetation (B. pascuorum, B. hortorum and B. ruderarius). In order to safeguard the continued existence of bumblebee species it is clear that a variety of field and forest boundary types need to be conserved; this has positive implications for the conservation of other species of flora and fauna associated with agroecosystems.

AB Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the shape of occupancy frequency distributions (distributions of the numbers of species occupying different numbers of areas). Artefactual effects include sampling characteristics, whereas biological mechanisms include organismal, niche-based and meta-population models. To date, there has been little testing of these models. In addition, although empirically derived occupancy distributions encompass an array of taxi and spatial scales, comparisons between them are often not possible because of differences in sampling protocol and method of construction. In this paper, the effects of sampling protocol (grain, sample number, extent, sampling coverage and intensity) on the shape of occupancy distributions are examined, and approaches for minimising artefactual effects recommended. Evidence for proposed biological determinants of the shape of occupancy distributions is then examined. Good support exists for some mechanisms (habitat and environmental heterogeneity), little for others (dispersal ability), while some hypotheses remain untested (landscape productivity, position in geographic range, range size frequency distributions), or are unlikely to be useful explanations for the shape of occupancy distributions (species specificity and adaptation to habitat, extinction-colonization dynamics). The presence of a core (class containing species with the highest occupancy) mode in occupancy distributions is most likely to be associated with larger sample units, and small homogenous sampling areas positioned well within and towards the range centers of a sufficient proportion of the species in the assemblage. Satellite (class with species with the lowest occupancy) modes are associated with sampling large, heterogeneous areas that incorporate a large proportion of the assemblage range. However, satellite modes commonly also occur in the presence of a core mode, and rare species effects are likely to contribute to the presence of a satellite mode at most sampling scales. In most proposed hypotheses, spatial scale is an important determinant of the shape of the observed occupancy distribution. Because the attributes of the mechanisms associated with these hypotheses change with spatial scale, their predictions for the shape of occupancy distributions also change. To understand occupancy distributions and the mechanisms underlying them, a synthesis of pattern documentation and model testing across scales is thus needed. The development of null models, comparisons of occupancy distributions across spatial scales and taxa, documentation of the movement of individual species between occupancy classes with changes in spatial scale, as well as further testing of biological mechanisms are all necessary for an improved understanding of the distribution of species and assemblages within their geographic ranges.

AB Aim Species transported to and introduced into non-native environments, termed 'introductions', constitute a growing component of many regional floras and faunas, yet not all such species successfully establish. Investigations into why some introductions succeed while others fail are often based on analyses of the outcome of historical introductions. Such 'experiments in nature' have the drawback that the effects of interest may be confounded because they have not been randomized with respect to each other, and because the species and locations chosen for introduction may not be a random subset of the available species or locations. Our aim is to quantify this non-randomness using a global data set of bird introductions, and examine the factors associated with introduction probability in two subsets of these data, one taxonomic (order Anseriformes) and one geographical (British birds).
   Location Global.
   Methods Statistical analyses of the distributions among taxa and locations for 1378 introduction events for 426 bird species across the world, and statistical analyses of the characteristics of Ariseriform and British bird species selected for introduction.
   Results Global introductions of birds have been highly non-random with respect to taxon, location of origin, and location of introduction. Most introductions involve species in just five families (Phasianidae, Passeridae, Psittacidae, Anatidae and Columbidae), and most introductions have been to temperate and island locations. Within the taxonomic and geographical subsets, the species chosen for introduction tend to be abundant species that would have been relatively easy to obtain.
   Main conclusions The characteristics of the species and locations chosen for introduction are not representative of species and locations in general, which limits our ability to draw general conclusions from historical records, and generates problems of confounding and non-independence in statistical analyses of introduction success. We suggest possible solutions for these problems.

AB The effects of scale, landscape matrix and habitat structure on birds were studied in forest-dominated landscapes in northern Finland. Abundances of birds correlated with different factors at different scales. No edge effect was observed at the large scale matrix level (4 km(2)), even though edge was the most important factor at the small-scale matrix level (4 ha). Matrix components explained up to 47% of the variation in abundances of birds. Fragmentation and amount of edges had a positive relationship with the managed forest species, edge species and habitat generalists. However, virgin forest species and hole-nesters had a negative relationship with edges. Landscape matrix components were more important than habitat components to the managed forest species and the Willow Warbler; whereas habitat components were more important to the migratory species and the Pied Flycatcher. Within a habitat, floristic components were more important than structural components. Habitat generalist species benefited from deciduous forests and virgin forest birds from mixed-tree species composition. Stand age had a positive relationship with species richness, total amount of birds, virgin forest species and hole-nesters. Our results indicate that bird responses to the environment are scale-dependent and individualistic. Bird species composition and abundances are also dependent on factors at larger scales than the individual's immediate habitat.

AB Ellenberg's indicator values for light, moisture and reaction were tested in deciduous hardwood forests of the Boreo-nemoral zone in Sweden. Weighted averages of indicator values were calculated and correlated with field measurements for two test sets of releves. The best, highly significant correlations were found for reaction, particularly for weighted averages based on vascular plant species. Significant correlations were also found for light, whereas those for moisture were less good and only partly significant. Weighted averages based on presence/absence values and those based on cover/abundance values were generally very similar to each other, but showed differences in their correlations with actual measurements.
   A training set of releves was used to calculate optima and ecological amplitudes of the most common species. Under certain conditions, the original indicator values were replaced by these optima in order to obtain improved indicator values for Swedish deciduous forests. These were correlated with the same test sets of field measurements as the original values and clearly gave better results for light as well as for reaction regarding vascular plants. No clear differences were found for moisture and reaction regarding bryophytes. For the majority of species, the original indicator values also expressed the ecological optima in Swedish deciduous forests as determined by this study. However, several species, most of them preferring more open habitats, showed ecological optima and amplitudes that considerably deviated from central European conditions. In conclusion, Ellenberg's indicator values can successfully be used in south Swedish deciduous forests, particularly after calibration of the values according to regional deviations.

AB Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) offers the possibility of democratising management of the seas. MSP is, however, increasingly implemented as a form of post-political planning, dominated by the logic of neoliberalism, and a belief in the capacity of managerial-technological apparatuses to address complex socio-political problems, with little attention paid to issues of power and inequality. There is growing concern that MSP is not facilitating a paradigm shift towards publicly engaged marine management, and that it may simply repackage power dynamics in the rhetoric of participation to legitimise the agendas of dominant actors. This raises questions about the legitimacy and inclusivity of participatory MSP. Research on stakeholder engagement within MSP has predominately focused on assessing experiences of active MSP participants and has not evaluated the democratic or inclusive nature of these processes. Adopting the Northeast Ocean Planning initiative in the US as a case study, this paper provides the first study of exclusion and non-participation of stakeholders in an MSP process. Three major issues are found to have had an impact on exclusion and non-participation: poor communication and a perception that the process was deliberately exclusionary; issues arising from fragmented governance, territorialisation and scale; and lack of specificity regarding benefits or losses that might accrue from the process. To be effective, participatory MSP practice must: develop mechanisms that recognise the complexity of socio-spatial relationships in the marine environment; facilitate participation in meaningful spatial decision-making, rather than in post-ideological, objective-setting processes; and create space for debate about the very purpose of MSP processes.

AB Parallel evolution across replicate populations has provided evolutionary biologists with iconic examples of adaptation. When multiple populations colonize seemingly similar habitats, they may evolve similar genes, traits, or functions. Yet, replicated evolution in nature or in the laboratory often yields inconsistent outcomes: Some replicate populations evolve along highly similar trajectories, whereas other replicate populations evolve to different extents or in distinct directions. To understand these heterogeneous outcomes, biologists are increasingly treating parallel evolution not as a binary phenomenon but rather as a quantitative continuum ranging from parallel to nonparallel. By measuring replicate populations' positions along this (non) parallel continuum, we can test hypotheses about evolutionary and ecological factors that influence the extent of repeatable evolution. We review evidence regarding the manifestation of (non) parallel evolution in the laboratory, in natural populations, and in applied contexts such as cancer. Weenumerate the many genetic, ecological, and evolutionary processes that contribute to variation in the extent of parallel evolution.

AB Aim Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to predict impacts of global change on biodiversity, but the reliability of these predictions in space and time depends on their transferability. We tested how the strategy used to choose predictors impacts the transferability of SDMs at a cross-continental scale.
   Location North America, Eurasia and Australia.
   Method We used a systematic approach including 50 Holarctic plant invaders and 27 initial predictor variables, considering 10 different strategies for variable selection, accounting for the proximality, multicollinearity and climate analogy of predictors. We compared the average performance of each strategy, some of which used a large number of predictor combinations. Next, we looked for the single best model for each species across all the predictor combinations retained in the analysis. Transferability was considered as the predictive success of SDMs calibrated in the native range and projected onto the invaded range.
   Results Two strategies showed better SDM transferability on average: a set of predictors known for their ecologically meaningful effects on plant distribution, and the two first axes of a principal component analysis calibrated on all predictor variables (S-pc2). From the more than 2000 combinations of predictors per species across strategies, the best set of predictors yielded SDMs with good transferability for 45 species (90%). These best combinations consisted of eight randomly assembled (39 species) or uncorrelated predictors (6 species) and S-pc2 (5 species). We also found that internal cross-validation was not sufficient to give full information about the transferability of a SDM to a distinct range.
   Main conclusion Transferring SDMs at the macroclimatic scale, and thus anticipating invasions, is possible for the large majority of invasive plants considered in this study, but the accuracy of the predictions relies strongly on the choice of predictors. From our results, we recommend including either proximal and state-of-the-art variables or a reduced and orthogonalized set to obtain robust SDM projections.

AB Thermal treatment technologies hold an important niche in the remediation of hydrocarboncontaminated soils and sediments due to their ability to quickly and reliably meet cleanup standards. However, sustained high temperature can be energy intensive and can damage soil properties. Despite the broad applicability and prevalence of thermal remediation, little work has been done to improve the environmental compatibility and sustainability of these technologies. We review several common thermal treatment technologies for hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, assess their potential environmental impacts, and propose frameworks for sustainable and low-impact deployment based on a holistic consideration of energy and water requirements, ecosystem ecology, and soil science. There is no universally appropriate thermal treatment technology. Rather, the appropriate choice depends on the contamination scenario (including the type of hydrocarbons present) and on site-specific considerations such as soil properties, water availability, and the heat sensitivity of contaminated soils. Overall, the convergence of treatment process engineering with soil science, ecosystem ecology, and plant biology research is essential to fill critical knowledge gaps and improve both the removal efficiency and sustainability of thermal technologies.

AB The dramatic phenotypic changes that occur in organisms during domestication leave indelible imprints on their genomes. Although many domesticated plants and animals have been systematically compared with their wild genetic stocks, the molecular and genomic processes underlying fungal domestication have received less attention. Here, we present a nearly complete genome assembly for the recently described yeast species Saccharomyces eubayanus and compare it to the genomes of multiple domesticated alloploid hybrids of S. eubayanus x S. cerevisiae (S. pastorianus syn. S. carlsbergensis), which are used to brew lager-style beers. We find that the S. eubayanus subgenomes of lager-brewing yeasts have experienced increased rates of evolution since hybridization, and that certain genes involved in metabolism may have been particularly affected. Interestingly, the S. eubayanus subgenome underwent an especially strong shift in selection regimes, consistent with more extensive domestication of the S. cerevisiae parent prior to hybridization. In contrast to recent proposals that lager-brewing yeasts were domesticated following a single hybridization event, the radically different neutral site divergences between the subgenomes of the two major lager yeast lineages strongly favor at least two independent origins for the S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids that brew lager beers. Our findings demonstrate how this industrially important hybrid has been domesticated along similar evolutionary trajectories on multiple occasions.

AB Biogeographical regions (geographically distinct assemblages of species and communities) constitute a cornerstone for ecology, biogeography, evolution and conservation biology. Species turnover measures are often used to quantify spatial biodiversity patterns, but algorithms based on similarity can be sensitive to common sampling biases in species distribution data. Here we apply a community detection approach from network theory that incorporates complex, higher-order presence-absence patterns. We demonstrate the performance of the method by applying it to all amphibian species in the world (c. 6,100 species), all vascular plant species of the USA (c. 17,600) and a hypothetical data set containing a zone of biotic transition. In comparison with current methods, our approach tackles the challenges posed by transition zones and succeeds in retrieving a larger number of commonly recognized biogeographical regions. This method can be applied to generate objective, data-derived identification and delimitation of the world's biogeographical regions.

AB Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticides world-wide, but their fate in the environment remains unclear, as does their potential to influence non-target species and the roles they play in agroecosystems. We investigated in laboratory and field studies the influence of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, applied as a coating to soya bean seeds, on interactions among soya beans, non-target molluscan herbivores and their insect predators. In the laboratory, the pest slug Deroceras reticulatum was unaffected by thiamethoxam, but transmitted the toxin to predaceous beetles (Chlaenius tricolor), impairing or killing >60%. In the field, thiamethoxam-based seed treatments depressed activity-density of arthropod predators, thereby relaxing predation of slugs and reducing soya bean densities by 19% and yield by 5%. Neonicotinoid residue analyses revealed that insecticide concentrations declined through the food chain, but levels in field-collected slugs (up to 500ngg(-1)) were still high enough to harm insect predators.Synthesis and applications. Our findings reveal a previously unconsidered ecological pathway through which neonicotinoid use can unintentionally reduce biological control and crop yield. Trophic transfer of neonicotinoids challenges the notion that seed-applied toxins precisely target herbivorous pests and highlights the need to consider predatory arthropods and soil communities in neonicotinoid risk assessment and stewardship.

AB Dormancy is a life history trait that may have important implications for linking microbial communities to the functioning of natural and managed ecosystems. Rapid changes in environmental cues may resuscitate dormant bacteria and create pulses of ecosystem activity. In this study, we used heavy-water ((H2O)-O-18) stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify fast-growing bacteria that were associated with pulses of trace gasses (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from different ecosystems [agricultural site, grassland, deciduous forest, and coniferous forest (CF)] following a soil-rewetting event. Irrespective of ecosystem type, a large fraction (69-74%) of the bacteria that responded to rewetting were below detection limits in the dry soils. Based on the recovery of sequences, in just a few days, hundreds of rare taxa increased in abundance and in some cases became dominant members of the rewetted communities, especially bacteria belonging to the Sphingomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae. Resuscitation led to dynamic shifts in the rank abundance of taxa that caused previously rare bacteria to comprise nearly 60% of the sequences that were recovered in rewetted communities. This rapid turnover of the bacterial community corresponded with a 5-20-fold increase in the net production of CO2 and up to a 150% reduction in the net production of CH4 from rewetted soils. Results from our study demonstrate that the rare biosphere may account for a large and dynamic fraction of a community that is important for the maintenance of bacterial biodiversity. Moreover, our findings suggest that the resuscitation of rare taxa from seed banks contribute to ecosystem functioning.

AB The diversity of eukaryotic macroorganisms such as animals and plants usually declines with increasing elevation and latitude. By contrast, the community structure of prokaryotes such as soil bacteria does not generally correlate with elevation or latitude, suggesting that differences in fundamental cell biology and/or body size strongly influence diversity patterns. To distinguish the influences of these two factors, soil eukaryotic microorganism community structure was investigated in six representative vegetation sites along an elevational gradient from forest to alpine tundra on Changbai Mountain in Northeast China, and compared with our previous determination of soil bacterial community structure along the same gradient. Using bar-coded pyrosequencing, we found strong site differences in eukaryotic microbial community composition. However, diversity of the total eukaryotic microorganism community (or just the fungi or protists alone) did not correlate with elevation. Instead, the patterns of diversity and composition in the total eukaryotic microbial community (and in the protist community alone) were closely correlated with soil pH, suggesting that just as for bacteria, acidity is a particularly important determinant of eukaryotic microbial distributions. By contrast, as expected, plant diversity at the same sites declined along our elevational gradient. These results together suggest that elevational diversity patterns exhibited by eukaryotic microorganisms are fundamentally different from those of plants.

AB The effects of tree species differing in foliage and litter chemistry on the chemical, micro-morphological, and biological properties of soil were studied on post-mining sites afforested with one of six tree species (spruce, pine, larch, oak, lime, and alder) and also on sites left to natural succession (dominated by willow). The sites were located on a large colliery spoil heap that had been produced by the mining of coal in alkaline tertiary clays near the city of Sokolov, Czech Republic. Because no topsoil had been applied to the sites, soil development resulted from in situ interactions among the deposited overburden (spoil), trees, and soil biota. Soil formation differed markedly among sites afforested with different tree species. On sites with trees producing litter with a low C/N ratio (the deciduous species), the organic Oe layer was narrow or absent and a thick organomineral A layer was evident. On sites with trees producing litter with a high C/N ratio (the evergreen species), in contrast, a thick Oe layer and a thin A layer were evident. Besides C/N ratio, earthworm abundance and earthworm bioturbation activity (measured as the amount of earthworm casts in the topsoil) were the strongest predictors of A layer thickness and C accumulation in the mineral topsoil. Sites with higher C accumulation in mineral soil had higher microbial biomass and lower microbial respiration, which may have contributed to the higher C storage. The gradient of bioturbaton was correlated with changes in the composition of the bacterial community and other soil biota, but partial correlation showed that the effects of litter quality and bioturbation were largely independent. Overall, the results indicate that the effect of tree species on soil development is substantially mediated by soil fauna activity and especially by earthworm bioturbation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent large-scale studies of tree growth in the Iberian Peninsula reported contrasting positive and negative effects of temperature in Mediterranean angiosperms and conifers. Here we review the different hypotheses that may explain these trends and propose that the observed contrasting responses of tree growth to temperature in this region could be associated with a continuum of trait differences between angiosperms and conifers. Angiosperm and conifer trees differ in the effects of phenology in their productivity, in their growth allometry, and in their sensitivity to competition. Moreover, angiosperms and conifers significantly differ in hydraulic safety margins, sensitivity of stomatal conductance to vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), xylem recovery capacity or the rate of carbon transfer. These differences could be explained by key features of the xylem such as non-structural carbohydrate content (NSC), wood parenchymal fraction or wood capacitance. We suggest that the reviewed trait differences define two contrasting ecophysiological strategies that may determine qualitatively different growth responses to increased temperature and drought. Improved reciprocal common garden experiments along altitudinal or latitudinal gradients would be key to quantify the relative importance of the different hypotheses reviewed. Finally, we show that warming impacts in this area occur in an ecological context characterized by the advance of forest succession and increased dominance of angiosperm trees over extensive areas. In this context, we examined the empirical relationships between the responses of tree growth to temperature and hydraulic safety margins in angiosperm and coniferous trees. Our findings suggest a future scenario in Mediterranean forests characterized by contrasting demographic responses in conifer and angiosperm trees to both temperature and forest succession, with increased dominance of angiosperm trees, and particularly negative impacts in pines.

AB We investigated the influence of climate on the ring width and xylem anatomy of two co-occurring pines (Pinus nigra Arn. and P. sylvestris L.) in the mountains of east-central Spain in order to test their utility for dendroclimatic reconstructions. We developed chronologies of ring width, mean lumen diameter and mean cell-wall thickness (in the earlywood, latewood, and the total annual ring) and the number of cells between 1960 and 2006. Drought, expressed as the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), was the main climatic driver of tree radial growth, although trees were also sensitive to temperature (negative effect in previous autumn and current summer) and precipitation (with a general positive effect). P. sylvestris response was stronger to climate of the current year, whereas the effect of previous-year climate was more important for P. nigra. Warm and dry summers reduced ring width, tracheid lumen, and wall thickness in both species, whereas warm winter-spring temperatures had the opposite effect, primarily for P. sylvestris. Previous-year or early-season conditions mainly affected earlywood features, whereas latewood was more responsive to summer climate. Overall, climate appeared to be a stronger limiting factor for P. sylvestris. During periods of drought, cell-wall thickness was reduced while lumen width increased in the latewood of P. sylvestris. This could compromise its hydraulic safety against drought-induced cavitation as our site was close to the southern and dry edge of the species distribution area. Our results suggest that anatomical variables record different and stronger climate information than ring width variables, especially in P. sylvestris. Reconstruction models for SPEI at the 3-month scale were developed for July-August and September-October using principal components regression. The best models included anatomical and width variables of both pine species suggesting that tracheid chronologies can be useful for drought reconstructions especially at mesic sites or with species that encode a mixed drought and temperature-precipitation signal.

AB This study aimed to compare the intensity and the sensitivity of the responses of four river biological quality elements (BQEs) - macrophytes, fish, diatoms and macroinvertebrates - to human pressures excluding natural variations in stream ecosystem functioning. Biological, water quality and hydro-morphological data were compiled for 290 French river sites.
   Out of the 93 metrics tested, 51 covering the four BQEs responded significantly to global degradation. The responses to specific pressures were consistent with the BQEs' ecological and biological characteristics. For the four BQEs, metrics responded strongly to water quality degradations. Like fish, macroinvertebrate metrics were very sensitive to morphological degradations such as the presence of an impoundment, while diatom and macrophyte metrics did not show strong responses to these changes. Among the four BQEs' metrics, fish metrics responded the strongest to hydrological perturbations. Although a high proportion of the metrics responded only to high levels of human-induced degradations, trait-based metrics seemed the most sensitive and responded to lower levels of pressure. Global and water quality degradations of the river appear to be better detected by BQE metrics than channel morphological and hydrological degradations. Our results highlight the different impacts of human-induced pressures on the four BQE metrics and the challenging task of assessing the effect of single pressures when most of sites are multi-impacted.

AB An accurate and synoptic quantification of gross primary production (GPP) in crops is essential for studies of carbon budgets at regional and global scales. In this study, we tested a model, relating crop GPP to a product of total canopy chlorophyll (Chl) content and potential incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR(potential)). The approach is based on remotely sensed data; specifically, vegetation indices (VI) that are proxies for total Chl content and PAR(potential), which is incident PAR under a condition of minimal atmospheric aerosol loading. Using VI retrieved from surface reflectance Landsat data, we found that the model is capable of accurately estimating GPP in maize, with coefficient of variation (CV) below 23%, and in soybean with CV below 30%. The algorithms established and calibrated over three Mead, Nebraska AmeriFlux sites were able to estimate maize and soybean GPP at tower flux sites in Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois with acceptable accuracy.

AB Africa is predicted to be highly vulnerable to 21st century climatic changes. Assessing the impacts of these changes on Africa's biodiversity is, however, plagued by uncertainties, and markedly different results can be obtained from alternative bioclimatic envelope models or future climate projections. Using an ensemble forecasting framework, we examine projections of future shifts in climatic suitability, and their methodological uncertainties, for over 2500 species of mammals, birds, amphibians and snakes in sub-Saharan Africa. To summarize a priori the variability in the ensemble of 17 general circulation models, we introduce a consensus methodology that combines co-varying models. Thus, we quantify and map the relative contribution to uncertainty of seven bioclimatic envelope models, three multi-model climate projections and three emissions scenarios, and explore the resulting variability in species turnover estimates. We show that bioclimatic envelope models contribute most to variability, particularly in projected novel climatic conditions over Sahelian and southern Saharan Africa. To summarize agreements among projections from the bioclimatic envelope models we compare five consensus methodologies, which generally increase or retain projection accuracy and provide consistent estimates of species turnover. Variability from emissions scenarios increases towards late-century and affects southern regions of high species turnover centred in arid Namibia. Twofold differences in median species turnover across the study area emerge among alternative climate projections and emissions scenarios. Our ensemble of projections underscores the potential bias when using a single algorithm or climate projection for Africa, and provides a cautious first approximation of the potential exposure of sub-Saharan African vertebrates to climatic changes. The future use and further development of bioclimatic envelope modelling will hinge on the interpretation of results in the light of methodological as well as biological uncertainties. Here, we provide a framework to address methodological uncertainties and contextualize results.

AB Recently diverged species are challenging for identification, yet they are frequently of special interest scientifically as well as from a regulatory perspective. DNA barcoding has proven instrumental in species identification, especially in insects and vertebrates, but for the identification of recently diverged species it has been reported to be problematic in some cases. Problems are mostly due to incomplete lineage sorting or simply lack of a 'barcode gap' and probably related to large effective population size and/or low mutation rate. Our objective was to compare six methods in their ability to correctly identify recently diverged species with DNA barcodes: neighbor joining and parsimony (both tree-based), nearest neighbor and BLAST (similarity-based), and the diagnostic methods DNA-BAR, and BLOG. We analyzed simulated data assuming three different effective population sizes as well as three selected empirical data sets from published studies. Results show, as expected, that success rates are significantly lower for recently diverged species (similar to 75%) than for older species (similar to 97%) (P<0.00001). Similarity-based and diagnostic methods significantly outperform tree-based methods, when applied to simulated DNA barcode data (P<0.00001). The diagnostic method BLOG had highest correct query identification rate based on simulated (86.2%) as well as empirical data (93.1%), indicating that it is a consistently better method overall. Another advantage of BLOG is that it offers species-level information that can be used outside the realm of DNA barcoding, for instance in species description or molecular detection assays. Even though we can confirm that identification success based on DNA barcoding is generally high in our data, recently diverged species remain difficult to identify. Nevertheless, our results contribute to improved solutions for their accurate identification.

AB Bergmann's rule, which proposes a heat-balance explanation for the observed latitudinal gradient of increasing animal body size with increasing latitude, has dominated the study of geographic patterns in animal size since it was first proposed in 1847. Several critical reviews have determined that as many as half of the species examined do not fit the predictions of Bergmann's rule. We have proposed an alternative hypothesis for geographic variation in body size based on food availability, as regulated by the net primary production (NPP) of plants, specifically NPP during the growing season, or eNPP (ecologically and evolutionarily relevant NPP). Our hypothesis, "the eNPP rule," is independent of latitude and predicts both spatial and temporal variation in body size, as well as in total population biomass, population growth rates, individual health, and life history traits of animals, including humans, wherever eNPP varies across appropriate scales of space or time. In the context of a revised interpretation of the global patterns of NPP and eNPP, we predict contrasting latitudinal correlations with body size in three distinct latitudinal zones. The eNPP rule explains body-size patterns that are consistent with Bergmann's rule, as well as two distinct types of contradictions of Bergmann's rule: the lack of latitudinal patterns within the tropics, and the decline in body size above approximately 608 latitude. Both types of contradictions of Bergmann's rule are consistent with the eNPP rule, as are a wide range of other phenomena.

AB We developed a Bayesian genomic cline model to study the genetic architecture of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation between hybridizing lineages. This model quantifies locus-specific patterns of introgression with two cline parameters that describe the probability of locus-specific ancestry as a function of genome-wide admixture. 'Outlier' loci with extreme patterns of introgression relative to most of the genome can be identified. These loci are potentially associated with adaptive divergence or reproductive isolation. We simulated genetic data for admixed populations that included neutral introgression, as well as loci that were subject to directional, epistatic or underdominant selection, and analysed these data using the Bayesian genomic cline model. Under many demographic conditions, underdominance or directional selection had detectable and predictable effects on cline parameters, and 'outlier' loci were greatly enriched for genetic regions affected by selection. We also analysed previously published genetic data from two transects through a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus. We found considerable variation in rates of introgression across the genome and particularly low rates of introgression for two X-linked markers. There were similarities and differences in patterns of introgression between the two transects, which likely reflects a combination of stochastic variability because of genetic drift and geographic variation in the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. By providing a robust framework to quantify and compare patterns of introgression among genetic regions and populations, the Bayesian genomic cline model will advance our understanding of the genetics of reproductive isolation and the speciation process.

AB Mycorrhizal species richness and host ranges were investigated in mixed deciduous stands composed of Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp., Carpinus betulus, Acer spp., and Fraxinus excelsior. Acer and Fraxinus were colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizas and contributed 5% to total stand mycorrhizal fungal species richness. Tilia hosted similar and Carpinus half the number of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal taxa compared with Fagus (75 putative taxa). The relative abundance of the host tree the EM fungal richness decreased in the order Fagus > Tilia >> Carpinus. After correction for similar sampling intensities, EM fungal species richness of Carpinus was still about 30-40% lower than that of Fagus and Tilia. About 10% of the mycorrhizal species were shared among the EM forming trees; 29% were associated with two host tree species and 61% with only one of the hosts. The latter group consisted mainly of rare EM fungal species colonizing about 20% of the root tips and included known specialists but also putative non-host associations such as conifer or shrub mycorrhizas. Our data indicate that EM fungal species richness was associated with tree identity and suggest that Fagus secures EM fungal diversity in an ecosystem since it shared more common EM fungi with Tilia and Carpinus than the latter two among each other.

AB Conservation agricultural practices such as no-till (NT) and crop residue retention (CRR), and nutrient application, increases soil organic C (SOC) and are considered effective measures of C sequestration in soil. However, long-term effects of individual components of conservation agriculture and their interactions on SOC are rarely evaluated; as a result, conflicting findings of these practices on SOC are reported in the literature. We measured SOC and soil total N in a balanced factorial experiment, conducted on a Vertisol, consisting of tillage practices (conventional mechanical tillage, CT; and no-tillage, NT), crop residue management (crop residue burned, CRB; and crop residue retained, CRR) and N fertiliser application (no N, 30 kg N ha(-1) year(-1); and 90 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The site, in a semiarid subtropical region, was cropped with wheat (Triticum aestivum L) except for 3 years of barley (Hordeum vulgare L), for 40 years using conservation practices.
   In general, tillage effects on SOC and soil total N were small. Crop residue and N fertiliser interactively increased SOC and total N stocks at 0-0.1 m depth and cumulative stocks at 0-0.2 m and 0-0.3 m depths; that is, CRR increased SOC and soil total N only when N fertiliser was applied, and fertilisation increased SOC and soil total N only under CRR treatment. Depletion of delta C-13 values in CRR treatments and delta N-15 values in N treatments strongly indicated the contribution of crop residue (and root biomass) and N fertiliser to soil organic matter in this Vertisol. From this study and previous findings from this site, it appears, however, the effects of crop residue retention and N fertiliser occurred in early years, and did not continually increase SOC and total soil N with increasing period of conservation practices.

AB The aim here was to review and summarize the findings of scientific studies concerning the types of forest dynamics which occur in natural forests (i.e. forests with negligible human impact) of boreal Fennoscandia. We conducted a systematic search for relevant studies from selected reference databases, using search terms describing the location, structure and processes, and degree of naturalness of the forest. The studies resulting from these searches were supplemented with other known works that were not indexed in the databases. This procedure yielded a total of 43 studies. The studies were grouped into four types of forest dynamics according to the information presented on the characteristics of the native disturbance-succession cycle: 1) even-aged stand dynamics driven by stand-replacing disturbances, 2) cohort dynamics driven by partial disturbances, 3) patch dynamics driven by tree mortality at intermediate scales (>200 m(2)) and 4) gap dynamics driven by tree mortality at fine scales (<200 m(2)). All four dynamic types were reported from both spruce and pine dominated forests, but their commonness differed. Gap dynamics was most commonly reported in spruce forests, and cohort dynamics in pine forests. The studies reviewed provide the best obtainable overall picture of scientific findings concerning the characteristics and variability of the unmanaged boreal forest dynamics in Fennoscandia. The results demonstrate that the unmanaged Fennoscandian forests are characterized by more diverse and complex dynamics than has traditionally been acknowledged.

AB In contrast to early predictions, it is now widely accepted that males incur substantive costs from ejaculate production. Hence, males are predicted to allocate their reproductive investments, including ejaculate size, relative to the risk of sperm competition and to female quality. The study of sperm allocation, however, has been technically challenging with nonvirgin females because sperm from different males must be discriminated within the female reproductive tract. To date, such investigations have thus largely been restricted to species that transfer sperm in spermatophores or for which females can be fitted with a harness to capture the incoming ejaculate. In this study, we examined sperm allocation using male Drosophila melanogaster that express a fluorescently labeled protein in sperm heads, allowing us to quantify sperm numbers from different males within the female reproductive tract. We found that male D. melanogaster deliver significantly more sperm to mated, large or young females compared with virgins, small or old females, respectively, whereas copulation duration was only significantly longer with large than with small females. These results provide further evidence for costly ejaculate production and consequent prudent allocation of sperm. Key words: ejaculate size, body size, female reproductive value, sperm competition, sperm number. [Behav Ecol 22: 184-191 (2011)]

AB Aim
   Our objective was to document the general relationship between plant species richness (SR) and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) at different spatial scales and the environmental influence on this relationship.
   Location
   Temperate and alpine grasslands of China.
   Methods
   We investigated SR and ANPP at 321 field sites (1355 plots) across the widely distributed temperate and alpine grasslands of China. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions were used to test SR-ANPP relationships among site means. Plot-level data of SR and ANPP were analysed with general linear models (GLMs) and the correlation between SR and ANPP was decomposed into covariance components to test the influence of climatic variables, region, vegetation type and remaining variation among sites on SR, ANPP and their relationship.
   Results
   We found positive linear relationships between SR and ANPP among sites in both the alpine and temperate grassland regions and in different grassland vegetation types of these biomes. Environmental gradients such as growing-season precipitation affected both SR and ANPP in parallel. However, after removing the among-site environmental variation, residual SR and ANPP were no longer correlated at the pooled within-site level.
   Main conclusions
   The positive SR-ANPP relationship across large-scale environmental gradients among sites was most likely the result of climatic variables influencing SR and ANPP in parallel. Our results suggest that in China's natural grasslands there is no direct relationship between SR and ANPP, presumably because the pool of available species for local community assembly is large, in contrast to experiments where species pools are artificially reduced.

AB We present eco-genetic modeling as a flexible tool for exploring the course and rates of multi-trait life-history evolution in natural populations. We build on existing modeling approaches by combining features that facilitate studying the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of realistically structured populations. In particular, the joint consideration of age and size structure enables the analysis of phenotypically plastic populations with more than a single growth trajectory, and ecological feedback is readily included in the form of density dependence and frequency dependence. Stochasticity and life-history trade-offs can also be implemented. Critically, eco-genetic models permit the incorporation of salient genetic detail such as a population's genetic variances and covariances and the corresponding heritabilities, as well as the probabilistic inheritance and phenotypic expression of quantitative traits. These inclusions are crucial for predicting rates of evolutionary change on both contemporary and longer timescales. An eco-genetic model can be tightly coupled with empirical data and therefore may have considerable practical relevance, in terms of generating testable predictions and evaluating alternative management measures. To illustrate the utility of these models, we present as an example an eco-genetic model used to study harvest-induced evolution of multiple traits in Atlantic cod. The predictions of our model (most notably that harvesting induces a genetic reduction in age and size at maturation, an increase or decrease in growth capacity depending on the minimum-length limit, and an increase in reproductive investment) are corroborated by patterns observed in wild populations. The predicted genetic changes occur together with plastic changes that could phenotypically mask the former. Importantly, our analysis predicts that evolutionary changes show little signs of reversal following a harvest moratorium. This illustrates how predictions offered by eco-genetic models can enable and guide evolutionarily sustainable resource management.

AB In agroecosystems, biodiversity correlates with ecosystem function, yet mechanisms driving these relationships are often unknown. Examining traits and functional classifications of organisms providing ecosystem functions may provide insight into the mechanisms. Birds are important predators of insects, including pests. However, biological simplification of agroforests may decrease provisioning of this pest removal service by reducing bird taxonomic and functional diversity. A recent meta-analysis of bird exclosure studies from a range of agroecosystems in Central America concluded that higher bird richness is associated with significantly greater arthropod removal, yet the mechanism remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of the same data to examine whether birds demonstrate functional complementarity in tropical agroforests. We classified birds according to relevant traits (body mass, foraging strategy, foraging strata, and diet) and then examined how design of functional classification, including trait selection, classification methods, and the functional diversity metric used affect the suitability of different classifications as predictors of ecosystem services. We determined that vegetation characteristics are not likely drivers of arthropod removal by birds. For some functional classifications, functional richness positively correlated with arthropod removal, indicating that species complementarity may be an important mechanism behind this ecosystem function. The predictive ability of functional classifications increased with the number of traits included in the classification. For the two best classifications examined, functional group richness was a better predictor of arthropod reduction than other metrics of functional diversity (FD and Rao's Q). However, no functional classification predicted arthropod removal better than simple species richness; thus other factors may be important. Our analysis indicates that the sampling effect may also play a role, as one species and two functional groups were responsible for disproportionate effects of arthropod removal.

AB Decreased gas exchange as trees grow tall has been proposed to explain age-related growth declines in trees. We examined changes of mobile carbon stores (starch, sugars and lipids) with tree height in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at two sites differing in water availability, and tested the following hypotheses: (1) carbon supply does not become increasingly limited as trees grow tall; rather, the concentration of mobile carbon compounds increases with tree height reflecting greater reductions of carbon sink activities relative to carbon assimilation; and (2) increases of stored mobile carbon compounds with tree height are greater in drier sites. Height-related growth reductions were associated with significant increases of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and lipid concentrations in all tissues in the upper canopy and of NSC in the bole. Lipid concentrations in the bole decreased with tree height, but such decrease is not necessarily inconsistent with non-limiting carbon supply in tall trees. Furthermore, we found stronger increases of mobile carbon stores with tree height at the dry site relative to the moist site. Our results provide first direct evidence that carbon supply does not limit growth in tall trees and that decreases of water availability might negatively impact growth processes more than net-photosynthesis.

AB Ocean climate impacts on survivorship and growth of Atlantic salmon are complex, but still poorly understood. Stock abundances have declined over the past three decades and 1992-2006 has seen widespread sea surface temperature (SST) warming of the NE Atlantic, including the foraging areas exploited by salmon of southern European origin. Salmon cease feeding on return migration, and here we express the final growth condition of year-classes of one-sea winter adults at, or just before, freshwater re-entry as the predicted weight at standard length. Two independent 14-year time series for a single river stock and for mixed, multiple stocks revealed almost identical temporal patterns in growth condition variation, and an overall trend decrease of 11-14% over the past decade. Growth condition has fallen as SST anomaly has risen, and for each year-class the midwinter (January) SST anomalies they experienced at sea correlated negatively with their final condition on migratory return during the subsequent summer months. Stored lipids are crucial for survival and for the prespawning provisioning of eggs in freshwater, and we show that under-weight individuals have disproportionately low reserves. The poorest condition fish (similar to 30% under-weight) returned with lipid stores reduced by similar to 80%. This study concurs with previous analyses of other North Atlantic top consumers (e.g. somatic condition of tuna, reproductive failure of seabirds) showing evidence of major, recent climate-driven changes in the eastern North Atlantic pelagic ecosystem, and the likely importance of bottom-up control processes. Because salmon abundances presently remain at historical lows, fecundity of recent year-classes will have been increasingly compromised. Measures of year-class growth condition should therefore be incorporated in the analysis and setting of numerical spawning escapements for threatened stocks, and conservation limits should be revised upwards conservatively during periods of excessive ocean climate warming.

AB Aim The aim of this study is to analyse the distribution pattern of the botanical collecting effort in Amazonia so that it can be accounted for when interpreting phytogeographical patterns such as inferred species ranges. We also develop a mechanistic and transparent method for taking into account the bias in collecting effort when estimating likelihoods of species occurrences.
   Location Amazonia, Neotropics.
   Methods We utilized electronic data sets of georeferenced herbarium collections (1,063,530 in total). We plotted collecting localities (68,246 in total) on maps overlaid with 1 degrees and 0.5 degrees square grids, and analysed collecting effort using a geographical information system (GIS). We also drew a map of Thiessen polygons, using collecting localities as polygon centres, to visualize collecting density in a scale-independent way. We then created a 'collecting activity landscape' in which well-collected areas appear as peaks and poorly studied areas as valleys. We demonstrate how this surface can be utilized when estimating species distributions.
   Results The data available to us confirm that botanical collecting activity is still severely biased in Amazonia. The uncollected area represents 43% of the total area of Amazonia, while another 28% is poorly collected and only 2% can be considered relatively well collected. The Thiessen polygon network represents an improvement in the presentation of collecting intensity compared with square grids.
   Main conclusions The maps of botanical collecting effort in the Neotropics should be used for visually correcting phytogeographical interpretations. With the help of GIS applications the observed spatial bias in collecting effort can be utilized in estimating the likelihood of occurrence of species in a repeatable manner. These estimates, in turn, can be used for various purposes in basic and applied science as well as in decision-making. The biased collecting effort should, in the long run, be corrected by further field work in unexplored areas, which can be identified with the maps presented here.

AB Invasion of natural ecosystems by exotic plant species is a major threat to biodiversity. Disturbance to native plant communities, whether natural or management induced, is a primary factor contributing to successful invasion by exotic plant species. Herbivory by both wild and domestic ungulates exerts considerable impact on structure and composition of native plant communities. Intensive herbivory by ungulates can enhance exotic plant invasion, establishment, and spread for three reasons: (1) many exotic plants are adapted to ground disturbances such as those caused by ungulate feeding, trampling, and movements; (2) many exotic plants are adapted for easy transport from one area to another by ungulates via endozoochory and epizoochory; (3) many exotic plants are not palatable or are of low palatability to ungulates, and consequently, their survival is favored as ungulates reduce or eliminate palatable, native plants. Ungulate herbivory is a chronic, landscape-scale disturbance capable of influencing plant communities as much as episodic events such as fire. Consequently, ungulate herbivory has the potential to facilitate the invasion and establishment of exotic plants in the interior Pacific Northwest where ungulates occupy nearly every ecosystem. Moreover, ungulate herbivory has intensified in many ecosystems, owing to the addition of domestic ungulates with that of existing, wild ungulates, coupled with the reduction or elimination of migratory movements and predators that previously regulated wild ungulate populations and influenced their distributions. Despite the observational evidence for ungulate herbivory as a strong facilitator of exotic plant invasion and establishment, current knowledge of cause-effect relations is severely limited by a lack of manipulative experiments. Most studies have been observational, unreplicated, and lack the experimental controls needed to eliminate or account for confounding sources of variation. Heightened attention to conservation of biodiversity will increase the importance of managing ungulates in balance with the plant communities that support them. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Biogeographical and ecological research on the evergreen broad-leaved forests (EBLF) of the Far East, which have been reduced to remnant fragments over the historical period has, until now, been very limited. To inform forest conservation and management, this paper describes research into major plant community types and underlying environmental gradients of degraded EBLF in Eastern China and examines the importance of resprouting as a key mechanism in secondary succession following forest clearance. Species composition was described from 199 10 m x 10 rn plots and analysed using two-way indicator species analysis and canonical correspondence analysis ordination. Some 22 degraded and mature forest community types were identified, while CCA indicated that a primary vegetation gradient was related to distance of sample plot from mature forest, which was closely linked to altitude and slope. The secondary gradient corresponded to successional stage and disturbance. The roles of resprouting and reseeding characteristics in forest regeneration were researched firstly by 10 m, x 10 m plots from selected TWINSPAN groups and secondly by 20 m x 20 m plots in representative areas of forest at 1, 20, 43 and 60 years and in an area of mature forest.
   The importance of resprouting in the regeneration of many EBLF tree and shrub species is demonstrated, a process linked to ideas of the persistence niche. Existing remnant forests should be conserved but forest restoration is also essential and will benefit from understanding of the importance of tree/shrub resprouting, as well as seedling recruitment in forest regeneration. Further work is required on seedbanks, germination success and both inter- and intra-specific competition within Chinese EBLF to assist with successful forest conservation and management.

AB 1. Plants encounter a variety of light and nutrient availabilities during succession. However, there is an ongoing debate to which extent light-dependent structural and physiological plasticity is associated with species shade tolerance.
   2. Seedlings of five species, Betula pubescens Ehrh., B. pendula Roth, Populus tremula L., Quercus robur L. and Acer platanoides L. (from most intolerant to most shade-tolerant), were grown at four different light and nutrient availabilities to test the hypotheses that intolerant species have higher physiological and tolerant species higher structural plasticity to light and also that there is an overall increase in plasticity with increasing nutrient availability. Two replicate experiments in different years were conducted. Plasticity was characterized by four estimates: (1) the range of variation of the components of relative growth rate (RGR), leaf area ratio (LAR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) (RGR = LAR.NAR) at common RGR; (2) average standardized slopes of physiological (RGR, NAR, i.e. physiological plasticity, Pi(P)) and structural (LAR, leaf dry mass per unit area, biomass allocation traits, i.e. structural plasticity, Pi(S)) traits vs. irradiance relationships; (3) standardized difference of plant traits measured at low to medium irradiance; (4) coefficient of variation across different irradiance treatments.
   3. Plant growth was more strongly associated with NAR than with structural traits, but shade-intolerant species had a greater range of variation in both NAR and LAR at a common RGR. RGR, NAR and structural characteristics also responded more strongly to increases in irradiance in shade-intolerant species, but at low irradiance RGR and NAR were similar among all species. Owing to higher biomass fraction in leaves, the intolerant species produced less woody biomass. In nonfertilized plants, both Pi(P) and Pi(S) were negatively associated with shade tolerance. The plasticity was enhanced by nutrient addition, but the nutrient-dependent enhancement in plasticity was greater in more tolerant species. Therefore, differences in plasticity among species of varying tolerance were lower at higher nutrient availability.
   4. Our study does not support the hypothesis of a trade-off between structural and physiological plasticity. Shade-tolerant species are generally less plastic than intolerant species, but increases in nutrient availability during succession reduce the differences in plasticity. Despite similar RGR in low light, first-year seedlings of shade-tolerant species produce more woody biomass, favouring survival and growth in subsequent years.

AB Game theoretical models of biparental care predict that a change in work rate by one parent should be met by incomplete compensation by its partner. However, in empirical studies on biparental birds, there has been some inconsistency in the direction and extent of the response, and the mechanism behind it has so far been unclear. Parents could be responding directly to partner work rate or indirectly via chick begging. In this study of great tits (Parus major), the work rate of one parent was increased experimentally by augmenting the begging of the chicks with playback of extra begging calls whenever the parent visited the nest. The playback had no effect on the chicks' begging behavior, so any change in the focal parent's behavior was a direct response to its partner's work rate over a short timescale. An experimental increase in care by either male or female parent led to an increase (to a lesser extent) in the work rate of its partner, which is counter to the decrease predicted by partial compensation models. This seemingly paradoxical result may reflect decisions made exclusively over a short timescale and is in keeping with new theoretical work, which takes into account the information content of partner work rates.

AB The last decade has seen an explosion in the number of studies exploring predator-induced plasticity. Recently, there has been a call for more comprehensive approaches that can identify functional relationships between traits, constraints on phenotypic responses, and the cost and benefits of alternative phenotypes. In this study, we exposed Helisoma trivolvis, a freshwater snail, to a factorial combination of three resource levels and five predator environments (no predator, one or two water bugs, and one or two crayfish) and examined ten traits including behavior, morphology, and life history. Each predator induced a unique suite of behavioral and morphological responses. Snails increased near-surface habitat use with crayfish but not with water bugs. Further, crayfish induced narrow and high shells whereas water bugs induced wide shells and wide apertures. In terms of life history, both predators induced delayed reproduction and greater mass at reproduction. However, crayfish induced a greater delay in reproduction that resulted in reduced fecundity whereas water bugs did not induce differences in fecundity. Resource levels impacted the morphology of H. trivolvis; snails reared with greater resource levels produced higher shells, narrower shells, and wider apertures. Resource levels also impacted snail life history; lower resources caused longer times to reproduction and reduced fecundity. Based on an analysis of phenotypic correlations, the morphological responses to each predator most likely represent phenotypic trade-offs. Snails could either produce invasion-resistant shells for defense against water bugs or crush-resistant shells for defense against crayfish, but not both. Our use of a comprehensive approach to examine the responses of H. trivolvis has provided important information regarding the complexity of phenotypic responses to different environments, the patterns of phenotypic integration across environments, and the potential costs and benefits associated with plastic traits.

AB Climatic variation and change affect the dynamics of organisms and ecosystem processes. Many studies in the past have analyzed and discussed various climate-driven effects on different components of the lake ecosystem. Only a few synthesis papers have been published in this field. In this overview, a conceptual model has been developed to help explain why lakes respond individually to climate. The model consists of two main components, a so-called Landscape Filter comprising the features of geographical position, catchment characteristics and lake morphology, and a so-called Internal Lake Filter, comprising the features of lake history and biotic/abiotic interactions. The application of this conceptual model on published literature findings illustrates the strength in this encompassing perspective. An assessment of current climate research methods is presented with some perspectives given.

AB The circumpolar arctic fox Alopex lagopus thrives in cold climates and has a high migration rate involving long-distance movements. Thus, it differs from many temperate taxa that were subjected to cyclical restriction in glacial refugia during the Ice Ages. We investigated population history and genetic structure through mitochondrial control region variation in 191 arctic foxes from throughout the arctic. Several haplotypes had a Holarctic distribution and no phylogeographical structure was found. Furthermore, there was no difference in haplotype diversity between populations inhabiting previously glaciated and unglaciated regions. This suggests current gene flow among the studied populations, with the exception of those in Iceland, which is surrounded by year-round open water. Arctic foxes have often been separated into two ecotypes: 'lemming' and 'coastal'. An analysis of molecular variance suggested particularly high gene flow among populations of the 'lemming' ecotype. This could be explained by their higher migration rate and reduced fitness in migrants between ecotypes. A mismatch analysis indicated a sudden expansion in population size around 118 000 BP, which coincides with the last interglacial. We propose that glacial cycles affected the arctic fox in a way opposite to their effect on temperate species, with interglacials leading to short-term isolation in northern refugia.

AB 1. The ability of many introduced fish species to thrive in degraded aquatic habitats and their potential to impact on aquatic ecosystem structure and function suggest that introduced fish may represent both a symptom and a cause of decline in river health and the integrity of native aquatic communities.
   2. The varying sensitivities of many commonly introduced fish species to degraded stream conditions, the mechanism and reason for their introduction and the differential susceptibility of local stream habitats to invasion because of the environmental and biological characteristics of the receiving water body, are all confounding factors that may obscure the interpretation of patterns of introduced fish species distribution and abundance and therefore their reliability as indicators of river health.
   3. In the present study, we address the question of whether alien fish (i.e. those species introduced from other countries) are a reliable indicator of the health of streams and rivers in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. We examine the relationships of alien fish species distributions and indices of abundance and biomass with the natural environmental features, the biotic characteristics of the local native fish assemblages and indicators of anthropogenic disturbance at a large number of sites subject to varying sources and intensities of human impact.
   4. Alien fish species were found to be widespread and often abundant in south-eastern Queensland rivers and streams, and the five species collected were considered to be relatively tolerant to river degradation, making them good candidate indicators of river health. Variation in alien species indices was unrelated to the size of the study sites, the sampling effort expended or natural environmental gradients. The biological resistance of the native fish fauna was not concluded to be an important factor mediating invasion success by alien species. Variation in alien fish indices was, however, strongly related to indicators of disturbance intensity describing local in-stream habitat and riparian degradation, water quality and surrounding land use, particularly the amount of urban development in the catchment.
   5. Potential confounding factors that may influence the likelihood of introduction and successful establishment of an alien species and the implications of these factors for river bioassessment are discussed. We conclude that the potentially strong impact that many alien fish species can have on the biological integrity of natural aquatic ecosystems, together with their potential to be used as an initial basis to find out other forms of human disturbance impacts, suggest that some alien species (particularly species from the family Poeciliidae) can represent a reliable 'first cut' indicator of river health.

AB Female mate choice is often based on exaggerated sexual traits, signals of male qualities that females cannot assess directly. Two such key qualities are male immune and/or sexual competence, whereby honesty in signalling could be maintained by physiological trade-offs. Carotenoid-based ornaments likely constitute such honest signals, as there is direct competition for (limited) carotenoids between ornament deposition and anti-oxidant support of immune or sperm functioning. Using spectrometry, we assessed the potential signalling function of the yellow, carotenoid-based colour of the bill of male mallards, a target of female mate choice. Here we demonstrate that bill reflectance varied with plasma carotenoid level, indicating antioxidant reserves. Moreover, lower relative UV reflectance during autumn pairing predicted immune responsiveness and correlated positively with sperm velocity during breeding, a trait that affects fertility. Our data provide support for current theories that females could use carotenoid-based sexual signals to detect immune vigour and fertilizing ability of prospective mates.

AB It has been suggested that species richness in agricultural ecosystems depends on both landscape heterogeneity and farm management, but how these factors affect species composition is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the species composition of plants, butterflies, and carabid beetles in three different habitats (cereal fields, leys, and semi-natural pastures) in relation to farm management (conventional vs. organic) and landscape complexity at 16 farms in south-eastern Sweden. The farms were divided into eight pairs of one conventional and one organic farm based on land use, location, and landscape features to enable us to separate the effects of landscape features and farm management on species composition.
   Habitat type explained most of the variation in species composition of butterflies, carabids, and plants. Landscape features in the surrounding landscape explained additional variation, but little relative to habitat, in species composition. The effect of landscape features was larger in the disturbed habitats (cereal fields and ley) than in the more stable semi-natural pastures. Moreover, the effect of landscape features was largest for the most mobile group, butterflies, and least for the sessile plants. The percentage of ley (land temporarily with perennial grass and clover) was the most important landscape feature for butterfly and plant species composition, whereas landscape heterogeneity was the most important landscape feature for carabid species composition. Farm management explained some additional variation in species composition of carabids and butterflies, but it was of minor importance compared to landscape features for species composition of butterflies and plants. We classified the species as common or rare, but for no taxa were common or rare species associated with any landscape feature or farm management.

AB Estimation of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis from remote sensing data frequently use soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models (SVAT models). These models compute energy and mass transfer using descriptions of turbulent, radiative, and water exchanges, as well as a description of stomatal control in relation with water vapor transfers and photosynthesis. Remote sensing data mall provide information that is useful for driving SVAT models (e.g., surface temperature, surface soil moisture, canopy structure, solar radiation absorption, or albedo). Forcing or recalibration methods may be employed to combine remote sensing data and SWAT models. In this article a review of SVAT models and remote sensing estimation of energy and mass fluxes is presented. Examples are given based on our work on two different SVAT models. Eventually, some of the difficulties in the combined use of multispectral remote sensing data and SVAT models are discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB It may often be necessary to perform genetic analyses of temporal replicates to estimate the significance of spatial variation independently from that of temporal variation in order to ensure the reliability of estimates of a defined population structure. Nevertheless, temporal studies of genetic diversity remain scarce in the literature relative to the plethora of empirical studies of population structure. In vertebrates, a limited number of studies have specifically assessed the temporal stability of population structure for more than one generation. In this study, we performed a microsatellite analysis of DNA obtained from archived scales to compare the population structure among four sympatric landlocked populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) over a time frame of three to five generations. The same patterns of allele frequency distribution, theta, R-ST and genetic distance estimates were observed among populations for two time periods, confirming the temporal stability of the population structure. Despite population declines and stocking during this period, no statistically significant changes in intrapopulation genetic diversity were apparent. This study illustrates the feasibility and usefulness of microsatellite analysis of temporal samples, not only to infer changes of intrapopulation genetic diversity, but also to assess the stability of population structure over a time frame of several generations.

AB The frequency of cyanobacterial or cephalodial macrolichens on old standing Populus trees in southern and middle boreal Finland was surveyed on 22 sample plots containing 22-41 trunks. The sample plots were divided into four main groups according to location and human impact: (A) middle boreal +/- old-growth, (B) southern boreal old-growth, (C) southern boreal slightly managed and (D) southern boreal strongly managed plots. The number of cyanobacterial lichen species per tree was mainly 0-2 and only rarely exceeded 5 on some large old-growth trees. All cyanobacterial species occurred exclusively or more frequently on the old-growth plots. Thus the occurrence of cyanobacterial lichens proved to be a potential simple indicator of the continuity of the forest stand. The best indicator species were Lobaria pulmonaria, Nephroma spp., Pannaria pezizoides and Parmeliella triptophylla.

TI THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF ORGANISMS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ENERGY
   BALANCES ALONG MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Review
AB We argue that observed patterns of distribution and abundance of plant and animal species within space and time are related directly to species-specific energy costs and gains (energy balance) in response to the many (Hutchinsonian N-dimensional) environmental or resource gradients. Competition, predation and other biotic interactions operate principally by increasing energy costs to the species, and can be included in our energy balance methodology as additional environmental gradients of energy costs. Persistence of a population and, ultimately, the species in a given locality, will occur only where energy return on investment allows a significant energy profit in the form of propagules. At any given time, energy investment in physiological, behavioral or morphological adaptations that optimize abundance at one point within the N-dimensional hyperspace of environmental gradients precludes the investment of the same energy elsewhere. Within the spatial and temporal range where the species can reproduce, abundance is related to the stochastic nature of important environmental interactions, because energy balance is ultimately controlled by the sum of organismal responses to all environmental influences. Populations tend to be most abundant where their genome allows the optimization of energy profits. Therefore, population dynamics reflect the cumulative effect of environmentally-induced shifts in organismal energy balance. If this energy balance approach is robust, it has the potential of synthesizing ecology at many levels.

AB Because biodiversity is multidimensional and scale-dependent, it is challenging to estimate its change. However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the first question, we analysed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity - species richness - was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.

AB Satellite-retrieved solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has shown great potential to monitor the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial ecosystems. However, several issues, including low spatial and temporal resolution of the gridded datasets and high uncertainty of the individual retrievals, limit the applications of SIF. In addition, inconsistency in measurement footprints also hinders the direct comparison between gross primary production (GPP) from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers and satellite-retrieved SIF. In this study, by training a neural network (NN) with surface reflectance from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), we generated two global spatially contiguous SIF (CSIF) datasets at moderate spatiotemporal (0.05 degrees 4-day) resolutions during the MODIS era, one for clear-sky conditions (2000-2017) and the other one in all-sky conditions (2000-2016). The clear-sky instantaneous CSIF (CSIFclear-inst) shows high accuracy against the clear-sky OCO-2 SIF and little bias across biome types. The allsky daily average CSIF (CSIFall-daily) dataset exhibits strong spatial, seasonal and interannual dynamics that are consistent with daily SIF from OCO-2 and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). An increasing trend (0.39 %) of annual average CSIFall-daily is also found, confirming the greening of Earth in most regions. Since the difference between satellite-observed SIF and CSIF is mostly caused by the environmental down-regulation on SIFyieid, the ratio between OCE-2 SIF and CSIFclear-inst can be an effective indicator of drought stress that is more sensitive than the normalized difference vegetation index and enhanced vegetation index. By comparing CSLFall-daily with GPP estimates from 40 EC flux towers across the globe, we find a large cross-site variation (c.v. = 0.36) of the GPP-SIF relationship with the highest regression slopes for evergreen needle-leaf forest. However, the cross-biome variation is relatively limited (c.v. = 0.15). These two contiguous SIF datasets and the derived GPP-SIF relationship enable a better understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of the GPP across biomes and climate.

AB The study of natural ecosystems and experiments using mixtures of plant species demonstrates that both species and genetic diversity generally promote ecosystem functioning. Therefore, mixing crop varieties is a promising alternative practice to transform modern high-input agriculture that is associated with a drastic reduction of within-field crop genetic diversity and is widely recognized as unsustainable. Here, we review the effects of mixtures of varieties on ecosystem functioning, and their underlying ecological mechanisms, as studied in ecology and agronomy, and outline how this knowledge can help designing more efficient mixtures. We recommend the development of two complementary strategies to optimize variety mixtures by fostering the ecological mechanisms leading to a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and its stability through time, i.e., sampling and complementarity effects. (1) In the "trait-blind" approach, the design of high-performance mixtures is based on estimations of the mixing abilities of varieties. While this approach is operational because it does not require detailed trait knowledge, it relies on heavy experimental designs to evaluate mixing ability. (2) The trait-based approach is particularly efficient to design mixtures of varieties to provide particular baskets of services but requires building databases of traits for crop varieties and documenting the relations between traits and services. The performance of mixtures requires eventually to be evaluated in real economic, social, and agronomic contexts. We conclude that the need of a multifunctional low-input agriculture strongly increases the attractiveness of mixtures but that new breeding approaches are required to create varieties with higher mixing abilities, to foster complementarity and selection effects through an increase in the variance of relevant traits and to explore new combinations of trait values.

AB Humans have grazed on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) for many thousands of years. In recent decades, the intensity of grazing has increased and several new management strategies have been put into place to address the resulting changes in rangeland condition. Effective management of grazing activities in this region requires understanding the impact of livestock grazing across the diverse array of alpine grassland ecosystems present in the QTP, but recent studies have identified a number of critical uncertainties in the ecological science that underlies these management principles. To address these uncertainties, we carried out a synthesis analysis of the effect of livestock grazing on 26 indicators of ecosystem structure and function based on 61 studies from 88 independent research sites within the QTP. Our synthesis results indicate that livestock grazing exerts complex controls on ecosystem structure and function, which vary according to local landscape characteristics. We found that grazing contributes to greater plant species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson dominance index, and Pielou evenness index significantly increased 0.18, 0.05, and 0.03, respectively, due to grazing), but decreased aboveground biomass (47.15%), soil organic carbon (12.41%), soil total nitrogen (12.75%), and microbial biomass carbon (9.42%). Further, ecosystem function is controlled by interactions between grazing and other landscape characteristics such as elevation and mean annual temperature. The management regime currently in place in the QTP, which involves complete exclusion of grazing in some areas, can have variable effects on grassland health. Therefore, the complexity of these responses is an indication that livestock and grassland management may benefit from a more nuanced management regime than is currently utilized in the QTP.

AB Hybrid zones have been promoted as windows on the evolutionary process and as laboratories for studying divergence and speciation. Patterns of divergence between hybridizing species can now be characterized on a genomewide scale, and recent genome scans have focused on the presence of 'islands' of divergence. Patterns of heterogeneous genomic divergence may reflect differential introgression following secondary contact and provide insights into which genome regions contribute to local adaptation, hybrid unfitness and positive assortative mating. However, heterogeneous genome divergence can also arise in the absence of any gene flow, as a result of variation in selection and recombination across the genome. We suggest that to understand hybrid zone origins and dynamics, it is essential to distinguish between genome regions that are divergent between pure parental populations and regions that show restricted introgression where these populations interact in hybrid zones. The latter, more so than the former, reveal the likely genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. Mosaic hybrid zones, because of their complex structure and multiple contacts, are particularly good subjects for distinguishing primary intergradation from secondary contact. Comparisons among independent hybrid zones or transects that involve the 'same' species pair can also help to distinguish between divergence with gene flow and secondary contact. However, data from replicate hybrid zones or replicate transects do not reveal consistent patterns; in a few cases, patterns of introgression are similar across independent transects, but for many taxa, there is distinct lack of concordance, presumably due to variation in environmental context and/ or variation in the genetics of the interacting populations.

AB 1. Movement data provide a window - often our only window - into the cognitive, social and biological processes that underlie the behavioural ecology of animals in the wild. Robust methods for identifying and interpreting distinct modes of movement behaviour are of great importance, but complicated by the fact that movement data are complex, multivariate and dependent. Many different approaches to exploratory analysis of movement have been developed to answer similar questions, and practitioners are often at a loss for how to choose an appropriate tool for a specific question.
   2. We apply and compare four methodological approaches: first passage time (FPT), Bayesian partitioning of Markov models (BPMM), behavioural change point analysis (BCPA) and a fitted multistate random walk (MRW) to three simulated tracks and two animal trajectories - a sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) tracked for 12 h and a wolf (Canis lupus) tracked for 1 year.
   3. The simulations - in which, respectively, velocity, tortuosity and spatial bias change highlight the sensitivity of all methods to model misspecification. Methods that do not account for autocorrelation in the movement variables lead to spurious change points, while methods that do not account for spatial bias completely miss changes in orientation.
   4. When applied to the animal data, the methods broadly agree on the structure of the movement behaviours. Important discrepancies, however, reflect differences in the assumptions and nature of the outputs. Important trade-offs are between the strength of the a priori assumptions (low in BCPA, high in MRW), complexity of output (high in the BCPA, low in the BPMM and MRW) and explanatory potential (highest in the MRW).
   5. The animal track analysis suggests some general principles for the exploratory analysis of movement data, including ways to exploit the strengths of the various methods. We argue for close and detailed exploratory analysis of movement before fitting complex movement models.

AB Afforestation has been implemented worldwide as regional and national policies to address environmental problems and to improve ecosystem services. China's central government launched the Grain for Green Program (GGP) in 1999 to increase forest cover and to control soil erosion by converting agricultural lands on steep slopes to forests and grasslands. Here a variety of satellite data products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer were used to assess the biophysical consequences of the GGP for the Loess Plateau, the pilot region of the program. The average tree cover of the plateau substantially increased because of the GGP, with a relative increase of 41.0%. The GGP led to significant increases in enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index, and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by canopies. The increase in forest productivity as approximated by EVI was not driven by elevated air temperature, changing precipitation, or rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Moreover, the afforestation significantly reduced surface albedo, leading to a positive radiative forcing and a warming effect on the climate. The GGP also led to a significant decline in daytime land surface temperature and exerted a cooling effect on the climate. The GGP therefore has significant biophysical consequences by altering carbon cycling, hydrologic processes, and surface energy exchange and has significant feedbacks to the regional climate. The net radiative forcing on the climate depends on the offsetting of the negative forcing from carbon sequestration and higher evapotranspiration and the positive forcing from lower albedo.

AB Rye (Secale cereale) is closely related to wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Due to its large genome (similar to 8 Gb) and its regional importance, genome analysis of rye has lagged behind other cereals. Here, we established a virtual linear gene order model (genome zipper) comprising 22,426 or 72% of the detected set of 31,008 rye genes. This was achieved by high-throughput transcript mapping, chromosome survey sequencing, and integration of conserved synteny information of three sequenced model grass genomes (Brachypodium distachyon, rice [Oryza sativa], and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor]). This enabled a genome-wide high-density comparative analysis of rye/barley/model grass genome synteny. Seventeen conserved syntenic linkage blocks making up the rye and barley genomes were defined in comparison to model grass genomes. Six major translocations shaped the modern rye genome in comparison to a putative Triticeae ancestral genome. Strikingly dissimilar conserved syntenic gene content, gene sequence diversity signatures, and phylogenetic networks were found for individual rye syntenic blocks. This indicates that introgressive hybridizations (diploid or polyploidy hybrid speciation) and/or a series of whole-genome or chromosome duplications played a role in rye speciation and genome evolution.

AB Aim Climatic conditions exert a strong control on the geographic distribution of many woodland-to-grassland transition zones (or tree lines'). Because woody plants have, in general, a weaker cold tolerance than herbaceous vegetation, their altitudinal or latitudinal limits are strongly controlled by cold sensitivity. While temperature controls on the dynamics of woodlandgrassland ecotones are relatively well established, the ability of woody plants to modify their microclimate and to create habitat for seedling establishment and growth may involve a variety of processes that are still not completely understood. Here we investigate feedbacks between vegetation and microclimatic conditions in the proximity to woodlandgrassland ecotones. Location We concentrate on arctic and alpine tree lines, the transition between mangrove forests and salt marshes in coastal ecosystems, and the shift from shrubland to grassland along temperature gradients in arid landscapes. Methods We review the major abiotic and biotic mechanisms underlying the ability of woody plants to alter the nocturnal microclimate by increasing the temperatures they are exposed to. Results We find that in many arctic, alpine, desert and coastal landscapes the presence of trees or shrubs causes nocturnal warming thereby favouring the establishment and survival of woody plants. Main conclusion Because of this feedback, trees and shrubs may establish in areas that would be otherwise unsuitable for their survival. Thus, in grasslandwoodland transition zones both vegetation covers may be (alternative) stable states of the landscape, thereby affecting the way tree lines may migrate in response to regional and global climate change.

AB Background: Do brain training games work? The beneficial effects of brain training games are expected to transfer to other cognitive functions. Yet in all honesty, beneficial transfer effects of the commercial brain training games in young adults have little scientific basis. Here we investigated the impact of the brain training game (Brain Age) on a wide range of cognitive functions in young adults.
   Methods: We conducted a double-blind (de facto masking) randomized controlled trial using a popular brain training game (Brain Age) and a popular puzzle game (Tetris). Thirty-two volunteers were recruited through an advertisement in the local newspaper and randomly assigned to either of two game groups (Brain Age, Tetris). Participants in both the Brain Age and the Tetris groups played their game for about 15 minutes per day, at least 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Measures of the cognitive functions were conducted before and after training. Measures of the cognitive functions fell into eight categories (fluid intelligence, executive function, working memory, short-term memory, attention, processing speed, visual ability, and reading ability).
   Results and Discussion: Our results showed that commercial brain training game improves executive functions, working memory, and processing speed in young adults. Moreover, the popular puzzle game can engender improvement attention and visuo-spatial ability compared to playing the brain training game. The present study showed the scientific evidence which the brain training game had the beneficial effects on cognitive functions (executive functions, working memory and processing speed) in the healthy young adults.
   Conclusions: Our results do not indicate that everyone should play brain training games. However, the commercial brain training game might be a simple and convenient means to improve some cognitive functions. We believe that our findings are highly relevant to applications in educational and clinical fields.

AB We quantified the relative influence of maternal fidelity to feeding grounds and natal fidelity to breeding grounds on the population structure of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae based on an ocean-wide survey of mitochondrial (mt) DNA diversity in the North Pacific. For 2193 biopsy samples collected from whales in 10 feeding regions and 8 breeding regions during the winter and summer of 2004 to 2006, we first used microsatellite genotyping (average, 9.5 loci) to identify replicate samples. From sequences of the mtDNA control region (500 bp) we identified 28 unique haplotypes from 30 variable sites. Haplotype frequencies differed markedly among feeding regions (overall F-ST = 0.121, Phi(ST) = 0.178, p < 0.0001), supporting previous evidence of strong maternal fidelity. Haplotype frequencies also differed markedly among breeding regions (overall F-ST = 0.093, Phi(ST) = 0.106, p < 0.0001), providing evidence of strong natal fidelity. Although sex-biased dispersal was not evident, differentiation of microsatellite allele frequencies was weak compared to differentiation of mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting male-biased gene flow. Feeding and breeding regions showed significant differences in haplotype frequencies, even for regions known to be strongly connected by patterns of individual migration. Thus, the influence of migratory fidelity seems to operate somewhat independently on feeding and breeding grounds over an evolutionary time scale. This results in a complex population structure and the potential to define multiple units to conserve in either seasonal habitat.

AB Climate change is imposing intensified and novel selection pressures on organisms by altering abiotic and biotic environmental conditions on Earth, but studies demonstrating genetic adaptation to climate change mediated selection are still scarce. Evidence is accumulating to indicate that both genetic and ecological constrains may often limit populations' abilities to adapt to large scale effects of climate warming. These constraints may predispose many organisms to respond to climate change with range shifts and phenotypic plasticity, rather than through evolutionary adaptation. In general, broad conclusions about the role of evolutionary adaptation in mitigating climate change induced fitness loss in the wild are as yet difficult to make.

AB A fundamental premise of life-history theory is that organisms that increase current reproductive investment suffer increased mortality. Possibly the most studied life-history phenotypic relationship is the trade-off between parental effort and survival. However, evidence supporting this trade-off is equivocal. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to test the generality of this tenet. Using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. Our results suggest that the trade-off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. Finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life-history trade-offs.

AB The role of habitat disturbance on biodiversity is central as it promotes changes in ecological systems. That said, still little is known about the functional consequences of such changes. Functional diversity can be used to revealing more mechanistically the disturbance effects on communities by considering the richness and the distribution of traits among the species. Here we analyzed the response of functional and species diversity of ground beetles to flood disturbance to better understand the functioning of alluvial invertebrate communities.
   Ground beetles were sampled in periodically flooded grasslands along the Elbe River in Germany. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to unveil the relationships between flood disturbance, species and functional diversity, respectively. We measured different components of functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, dispersion, and divergence) and analyzed species diversity by means of rarefied species richness, abundances, evenness and Simpson's diversity.
   We found contrasting relationships in that most species diversity measures peaked at highest disturbance levels, while most functional diversity measures decreased with increasing disturbance intensities.
   Inversed relationships between species and functional diversity are rarely observed, as most studies report on positive correlations. We explain increasing species diversity with a higher amount of resources available in highly disturbed sites. Decreasing functional diversity is best explained through the convergence of species traits by flood disturbance and uneven resource exploitation in highly disturbed plots (low functional evenness), suggesting strong impacts from functionally different generalist species in floodchannels. We show that the amount of resources available, and how these resources are exploited, play major roles in the functioning of floodplain ground beetle communities.

AB 1. The internal cycling of nitrogen (N) is a critical process in terrestrial ecosystems. Nitrification occurs when soil microbes convert ammonium to nitrate. Nitrification is known to be regulated by abiotic soil properties, but less is known about how plant communities influence this important ecosystem function.
   2. Two contrasting hypotheses propose mechanisms for how communities influence ecosystem processes. The 'mass ratio hypothesis' proposes that dominant species control ecosystem processes, e.g. communities dominated by plants with high leaf N content may increase rates of N cycling. The 'diversity hypothesis' proposes that community diversity controls ecosystem processes, e.g. diverse communities may increase rates of N cycling by providing a more consistent supply of organic N as variable litter qualities break down at different rates. Each hypothesis was simultaneously evaluated using structural equation modelling in the context of a ponderosa pine forest.
   3. The first principle component extracted from a species-trait matrix captured interspecific covariation in leaf traits such as specific leaf area and leaf N content. This 'leaf economics spectrum' was scaled to the community-level by calculating community-weighted mean leaf trait axis scores. Quadratic entropy was used as the index of understorey functional diversity to capture variation in functional traits within the community.
   4. Structural equation modelling results suggest that soil factors, such as pH, temperature, C:N mass ratio and total N were the dominant factors exerting direct control over nitrification potential. Understorey leaf traits were positively associated with nitrification potential, suggesting that high-quality litter inputs increase rates of nitrification. The negative indirect effects of pine abundance on nitrification mediated through soil properties were much stronger than the direct effect of understorey leaf traits.
   5. Synthesis. The leaf economics spectrum is an important gradient of functional trait variation that has consequences for internal N cycling. Nitrification potential was more strongly linked to dominant leaf traits than to functional diversity, thereby lending more support to the mass ratio hypothesis. However, functional diversity still explained some of the observed variation in biomass production. Leaf traits can be used to understand how internal N cycling rates will be affected by changes in vegetation structure.

AB Small mammals, such as European rabbits (Otyctolagus cuniculus), plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) and prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), traditionally have been perceived as pests and targeted for control within their native ranges, where they perform essential ecosystem roles and are considered keystone species. These species can reach high densities, and have been subjected to eradication campaigns because of their putative negative impact on natural habitats and agriculture and their competition with livestock for forage. Eradication programmes have been a main factor causing sharp declines of these species in their natural ranges. Paradoxically, they are keystone species where they are abundant enough to be perceived as pests. The term "pest" is usually a social perception that is rarely supported by scientific data, whereas there is considerable scientific evidence of the key ecological roles played by these species. We call for the conservation of these species and present a conceptual model regarding the management of their populations. Where they occur at high numbers, and hence their effects on biodiversity are still of crucial importance, the persecution of these species should be avoided and their natural habitats preserved. In areas with high conservation value, but where these species occur at low densities, management efforts should aim to increase their density. In areas of high commercial value, managers ideally should consider changing prioritization of the area to high conservation value by purchasing the land or obtaining conservation easements. In situations with high commercial value and demonstrable low conservation concern, small mammals could be reduced humanely. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We explore bird communities in different types of small urban greenspaces (<2 ha) in order to understand which birds occupy these structures, and the habitat and landscape features that affect them. In particular we analyzed how greenspace characteristics (size and vegetation structure), those of the adjacent landscape (area covered by urban structures and vegetation), and human disturbance variables (traffic of pedestrians, vehicles and noise levels) affected bird species richness, abundance and community composition (during summer and winter) in the city of Pachuca, Mexico. We selected 19 small greenspaces (ranging from 0.1 to 2 ha), including public parks, gardens and road strip corridors. We registered 39 species of birds of which 15 were migratory. In general bird species richness was higher in parks and gardens, and lower in road strip corridors, where more noise and traffic was registered. Greenspace area was the most important variable that positively influenced bird species richness, for both the summer and the winter communities. Summer bird species richness was lower in places that had a greater percentage of area covered by buildings in the adjacent landscape. Generalist and opportunistic species were favored by urbanization. Insectivorous species in winter were more abundant in larger greenspaces that had taller trees and more tree and shrub species, and in sites with more vegetative cover in the adjacent landscape. We suggest some management and urban planning actions that would benefit birds within many Latin American cities, where small greenspaces are often the only available refuges for birds.

   EXAMPLE; CONSEQUENCES
AB Despite the broad acceptance of phylogenetic principles in biological classification, a fundamental question still exists on how to classify paraphyletic groups. Much of the controversy appears due to (I) historical shifts in terminology and definitions, (2) neglect of focusing on evolutionary processes for understanding origins of natural taxa, (3) a narrow perspective on dimensions involved with reconstructing phylogeny, and (4) acceptance of lower levels of information content and practicability as a trade-off for ease of arriving at formal classifications. Monophyly in evolutionary biology originally had a broader definition, that of describing a group with common ancestry. This definition thus includes both paraphyletic and monophyletic groups in the sense of Hennig. We advocate returning to a broader definition, supporting use of Ashlock's term holophyly as replacement for monophyly s.str. By reviewing processes involved in the production of phylogenetic patterns (budding, merging, and splitting), we demonstrate that paraphyly is a natural transitional stage in the evolution of taxa, and that it occurs regularly along with holophyly. When a new holophyletic group arises, it usually coexists for some time with its paraphyletic stem group. Paraphyly and holophyly, therefore, represent relational and temporal evolutionary stages. Paraphyletic groups exist at all levels of diversification in all kingdoms of eukaryotes, and they have traditionally been recognized because of their descent-based similarity. We review different methodological approaches for recognition of monophyletic groups s.l. (i.e., both holophyletic and paraphyletic), which are essential for discriminating from polyphyly that is unacceptable in classification. For arriving at taxonomic decisions, natural processes, information content, and practicability are essential criteria. We stress using shared descent as a primary grouping principle, but also emphasize the importance of degrees of divergence plus similarity (cohesiveness of evolutionary features) as additional criteria for classification.

AB The anthozoan sub-class Octocorallia, comprising approximately 3000 species of soft corals, gorgonians, and sea pens, remains one of the most poorly understood groups of the phylum Cnidaria. Efforts to classify the soft corals and gorgonians at the suprafamilial level have long thwarted taxonomists, and the subordinal groups in current use are widely recognized to represent grades of colony forms rather than clades. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the sub-class do not support either the current morphologically based subordinal or familial-level taxonomy. To date, however, the resolution necessary to propose an alternative, phylogenetic classification of Octocorallia or to elucidate patterns of morphological evolution within the group is lacking. Attempts to understand boundaries between species and interspecific or intraspecific phylogenetic relationships have been hampered by the very slow rate of mitochondrial gene evolution in Octocorallia, and a consequent dearth of molecular markers with variation sufficient to distinguish species (or sometimes genera). A review of the available ITS2 sequence data for octocorals, however, reveals a yet-unexplored phylogenetic signal both at sequence and secondary-structure levels. In addition, incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees suggests that hybrid speciation and reticulate evolution may be an important mechanism of diversification in some genera. Emerging next-generation genomic-sequencing technologies offer the best hope for a breakthrough in our understanding of phylogenetic relationships and of evolution of morphological traits in Octocorallia. Genome and transcriptome sequencing may provide enough characters to resolve relationships at the deepest levels of the octocoral tree, while simultaneously offering an efficient means to screen for new genetic markers variable enough to distinguish species and populations.

They are most often visualized using either species richness - log abundance class (Preston) plots or abundance - species rank order (Whittaker) plots. Because many of the models predict very similar shapes, model distinction and testing become problematic. However, the variety of models can be classified into three basic types: one that predicts a double S-shape in Whittaker plots and a unimodal distribution in Preston plots (the lognormal type), a second that lacks the mode in Preston plots (the logseries type), and a third that predicts power functions in both plotting types (the power law type). Despite the interest of ecologists in SADs no formal meta-analysis of models and plotting types has been undertaken so far. Here we use a compilation of 558 species-abundance distributions from 306 published papers to infer the frequency of the three SAD shapes in dependence of environmental variables and type of plotting. Our results highlight the importance of distinguishing between fully censused and incompletely sampled communities in the study of SADs. We show that completely censused terrestrial or freshwater animal communities tend to follow lognormal type SADs more often than logseries or power law types irrespective of species richness, spatial scale, and geographic position. However, marine communities tend to follow the logseries type, while plant communities tend to follow the power law. In incomplete sets the power law fitted best in Whittaker plots, and the logseries in Preston plots. Finally our study favors the use of Whittaker over Preston plots.

AB Understanding the relationships between climate and carbon exchange by terrestrial ecosystems is critical to predict future levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide because of the potential accelerating effects of positive climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. However, directly observed relationships between climate and terrestrial CO2 exchange with the atmosphere across biomes and continents are lacking. Here we present data describing the relationships between net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) and climate factors as measured using the eddy covariance method at 125 unique sites in various ecosystems over six continents with a total of 559 site-years. We find that NEE observed at eddy covariance sites is (1) a strong function of mean annual temperature at mid-and high-latitudes, (2) a strong function of dryness at mid-and low-latitudes, and (3) a function of both temperature and dryness around the mid-latitudinal belt (45 degrees N). The sensitivity of NEE to mean annual temperature breaks down at similar to 16 degrees C (a threshold value of mean annual temperature), above which no further increase of CO2 uptake with temperature was observed and dryness influence overrules temperature influence.

AB Much of the recent discussion concerning the form and underlying mechanistic basis of metabolic rate-temperature and development rate-temperature relationships has been precipitated by the development of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). Empirical tests of the theory's fundamental equation are an essential component of establishing its validity. Here, we test the temperature component of the fundamental equation of the MTE as it applies to metabolic rate and development rate, using insects as model organisms. Specifically, we test (i) whether mean activation energies, E, approximate the 0.65 eV value proposed by the proponents of the MTE and whether the range of values is tightly constrained between 0.6 and 0.7 eV, as they have argued; (ii) whether phylogenetic signal is apparent in the rate-temperature relationships; (iii) whether the slopes of the rate-temperature relationships show consistent, directional variation associated with environmental variables; and (iv) whether intra- and interspecific rate-temperature relationships differ significantly. Because the majority of activation energy values fell outside the predicted range and rate-temperature relationships showed consistent directional variation correlated with large-scale climatic variation, we conclude that data from insects provide only limited support for the MTE. In consequence, we consider alternative explanations for variation in rate-temperature relationships.

AB In outdoor common gardens, high latitude populations of deciduous tree species often display higher assimilation rates (A) than low latitude populations, but they accomplish less height. To test whether trends in A reflect adaptation to growing season length or, alternatively, are garden growth artefacts, we examined variation in height increment and ecophysiological traits in a range-wide collection of Populus balsamifera L. populations from 21 provenances, during unconstrained growth in a greenhouse. Rooted cuttings, maintained without resource limitation under 21 h photoperiod for 90 d, displayed increasing height growth, A, leaf mass per area and leaf N per area with latitude whereas stomatal conductance (g(s)) showed no pattern. Water-use efficiency as indicated by both gas exchange and delta 13C increased with latitude, whereas photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency decreased. Differences in delta 13C were less than expected based on A/g(s), suggesting coextensive variation in internal conductance (g(m)). Analysis of A-C-i curves on a subset of populations showed that high latitude genotypes had greater g(m) than low-latitude genotypes. We conclude that higher peak rates of height growth in high latitude genotypes of balsam poplar are supported by higher A, achieved partly through higher g(m), to help compensate for a shorter growing season.

AB Because of the characteristically low temperatures and ambient CO2 concentrations associated with greater altitudes, mountain forests may be particularly sensitive to global warming and increased atmospheric CO2. Moreover, the upper treeline is probably the most stressful location within these forests, possibly providing an early bellwether of forest response. Most treeline studies of the past century, as well as recently, have correlated temperatures with the altitudinal limits observed for treelines. In contrast, investigations on pre-establishment seedlings, the most vulnerable life stage of most tree species, are rare. There appears to be specific microclimatic factors dictated by wind and sky exposure that limit seedling survival, and also generate the distorted tree forms commonly observed at treeline. Seedling survival appears critical for creating the biological facilitation of microclimate at the community level which is necessary for the growth of seedlings to normal tree stature, forming new subalpine forest at a higher altitude.

AB When faced with changing environments, organisms rapidly mount physiological and behavioural responses, accommodating new environmental inputs in their functioning. The ubiquity of this process contrasts with our ignorance of its evolutionary significance: whereas within-generation accommodation of novel external inputs has clear fitness consequences, current evolutionary theory cannot easily link functional importance and inheritance of novel accommodations. One hundred and twelve years ago, J.M. Baldwin, H.F. Osborn and C.L. Morgan proposed a process (later termed the Baldwin effect) by which non-heritable developmental accommodation of novel inputs, which makes an organism fit in its current environment, can become internalized in a lineage and affect the course of evolution. The defining features of this process are initial overproduction of random (with respect to fitness) developmental variation, followed by within-generation accommodation of a subset of this variation by developmental or functional systems ('organic selection'), ensuring the organism's fit and survival. Subsequent natural selection sorts among resultant developmental variants, which, if recurrent and consistently favoured, can be inherited when existing genetic variance includes developmental components of individual modifications or when the ability to accommodate novel inputs is itself heritable. Here, I show that this process is consistent with the origin of novel adaptations during colonization of North America by the house finch. The induction of developmental variation by novel environments of this species's expanding range was followed by homeostatic channelling, phenotypic accommodation and directional cross-generational transfer of a subset of induced developmental outcomes favoured by natural selection. These results emphasize three principal points. First, contemporary novel adaptations result mostly from reorganization of existing structures that shape newly expressed variation, giving natural selection an appearance of a creative force. Second, evolutionary innovations and maintenance of adaptations are different processes. Third, both the Baldwin and parental effects are probably a transient state in an evolutionary cycle connecting initial phenotypic retention of adaptive changes and their eventual genetic determination and, thus, the origin of adaptation and evolutionary change.

AB The relative influence of temperature versus local physical factors on the spatial distribution of riverine fish species was investigated in a large watershed of south-western France. Using generalised additive models and hierarchical partitioning, we modelled the ecological responses of 28 fish species to a set of five environmental predictors, and we quantified the independent effect of each predictor. The spatial distribution of fish species was primarily determined by both mean temperature and position along the upstream-downstream gradient. However, responses to these environmental factors varied according to the species considered. Fish species with strong thermal requirements (e.g., common carp, black bullhead, Atlantic salmon) were mainly sensitive to temperature whereas longitudinal gradient was of primary importance for downstream species (e.g., common bream, largemouth bass, pike perch). Both the statistical methods used gave concordant results and appeared complementary. This dual-approach, quantifying the relative contribution of each environmental factor, appears particularly useful to understand the spatial distribution of stream fish species. Separating the effects of temperature versus habitat factors is crucial to accurately predict species distribution modifications in the current context of global change.

AB AFLP markers are becoming one of the most popular tools for genetic analysis in the fields of evolutionary genetics and ecology and conservation of genetic resources. The technique combines a high-information content and fidelity with the possibility of carrying out genomewide scans. However, a potential problem with this technique is the lack of homology of hands with the same electrophoretic mobility, what is known as fragment-size homoplasy. We carried out a theoretical analysis aimed at quantifying the impact of AFLP homoplasy on the estimation of within- and between-neutral population genetic diversity in a model of a Structured finite population with migration among subpopulations. We also investigated the performance of a Currently used method (DFDIST software) to detect selective loci from the comparison between genetic differentiation and heterozygosis of dominant molecular markers, as well as the impact of AFLP homoplasy on its effectiveness. The results indicate that the biases produced by homoplasy are: (1) an overestimation of the frequency of the allele determining the presence of the hand, (2) an underestimation of the degree of differentiation between subpopulations, and (3) an overestimation or underestimation of the heterozygosis, depending on the allele frequency of the markers. The impact of homoplasy is quickly diminished by reducing the number of fragments analyzed per primer combination. However, substantial biases on the expected heterozygosity (Lip to 15-25%) may occur with similar to 50-100 fragments per printer combination. The performance of the DFDIST software to detect selective loci from dominant markers is highly dependent on the number of selective loci in the genome and their average effects, the estimate of genetic differentiation chosen to be used in the analysis, and the critical bound probability used to detect outliers. Overall, the results indicate that the software should be used with caution. AFLP homoplasy can produce a reduction of up to 15% in the power to detect selective loci.

AB Selective regimes and phenotypic optima could either change smoothly and in a clinal fashion or be spatially organized in a more unpredictable mosaic pattern over the geographic landscape. When natural or sexual selection is driven by intra- or interspecific biotic interactions, fine-grained spatial variation in selective regimes could result in selection mosaics rather than clinal variation in selection. We investigated temporal variation and spatial organization in sexual selection on male body size along an ecological coastal-inland gradient of a polymorphic damselfly Ischnura elegans. Body size increased in a clinal fashion along this gradient: animals were smaller in size at the coast, but became larger in the inland areas. In contrast, the sexual selection regimes on male body size showed evidence of more fine-grained spatial organization with no evidence for a clinal pattern and low spatial autocorrelations between populations. These spatially fine-grained sexual selection regimes varied in sign and magnitude and were driven by a combination of the densities of heritable female color morphs and local female body sizes. We suggest that the spatial organization of the selective regimes can be interpreted as a sexual selection mosaic that is influenced by highly localized density- and frequency-dependent social interactions.

AB The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts an increase in global temperatures of between 1.4 degrees C and 5.8 degrees C during the 21st century, as a result of elevated CO2 levels. Using bioclimatic envelope models, we evaluate the potential impact of climate change on the distributions and species richness of 120 native terrestrial non-volant European mammals under two of IPCC's future climatic scenarios. Assuming unlimited and no migration, respectively, our model predicts that 1% or 5-9% of European mammals risk extinction, while 32-46% or 70-78% may be severely threatened (lose > 30% of their current distribution) under the two scenarios. Under the no migration assumption endemic species were predicted to be strongly negatively affected by future climatic changes, while widely distributed species would be more mildly affected. Finally, potential mammalian species richness is predicted to become dramatically reduced in the Mediterranean region but increase towards the northeast and for higher elevations. Bioclimatic envelope models do not account for non-climatic factors such as land-use, biotic interactions, human interference, dispersal or history, and our results should therefore be seen as first approximations of the potential magnitude of future climatic changes.

AB The Compensation Hypothesis says that parents and prospective parents attempt to make up for lowered offspring viability by increasing reproductive effort to produce healthy, competitive offspring and by increasing investment in less viable, but still-living progeny (parental effects). The hypothesis assumes that offspring viability is lower when individuals are constrained (often through sexual conflict) to breed with individuals they do not prefer. We review results of experimental tests of the offspring-viability assumption in Tanzanian cockroaches, fruit flies, pipefish, wild mallards, and feral house mice. Experimental constraints on mating preferences lowered offspring viability in each of the studies, Females breeding under constraints laid more eggs or gave birth to more young than females breeding without or with fewer constraints on their mating preferences, and males mating under constraints on their mate preferences ejaculated more sperm than males mating without constraints. The number of eggs laid or offspring born was higher when female choosers were experimentally constrained to reproduce with males they did not prefer. Constrained females may increase fecundity to enhance the probability that they produce adult offspring with rarer phenotypes with survival benefits against offspring generation pathogens. Similarly, ejaculation of more sperm when males are paired with females they do not prefer may be a mechanism that provides more variable sperm haplotypes for prospective mothers or that may provide nutritional benefits to mothers and zygotes.

AB 1. Stream communities are structured by factors acting over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Identifying what factors are driving spatial patterns in stream communities is a central aim of ecology.
   2. Here we used two large European data sets of fish, invertebrates, macrophytes, benthic diatoms and environmental data in two stream groups (lowland and mountain) to determine the importance of variables at different spatial scales (geographical, regional, local) on community structure.
   3. Both geographical position and ecoregion were selected first in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), clearly showing the broad spatial gradients covered in the data set. Secondary predictors (after accounting for spatial and/or ecoregion effects) were similar between stream groups and among the four organism groups. In particular, conductivity and N concentration were strong predictors reflecting catchment land use.
   4. Using partial CCA, we assessed the individual importance of the three spatial scales on the community structure of the four organism groups in the two stream groups. The majority of among-site variability (22-29%) was accounted for by local scale variables (e.g. water chemistry and substratum type), with regional and spatial variables accounting 11-13% and 5-6%, respectively. Our findings indicate that the four organism groups are responding similarly to the different levels of spatial scale, implying much redundancy which should be consider when implementing studies of bioassessment.

AB We investigated performance trade-offs among seedlings of nine tropical tree species during a -five-year field experiment. Seedlings were grown in eight microhabitat types composed of paired gap and shaded understory sites in each of four soil types. We defined performance trade-offs relevant to coexistence as significant pairwise rank reversals for species performance between contrasting situations, of which we characterize three types: microhabitat, fitness component, and ontogenetic. Only 2 of 36 species pairs exhibited microhabitat trade-offs or reversed rankings for survival or relative growth rate (RGR) among microhabitats, and only one species pair reversed performance ranks among soil types. We found stronger evidence for rank reversals between fitness components (survival and RGR), particularly in gap vs. understory environments, suggesting a general trade-off between shade tolerance (survival in shade) and gap establishment (RGR in gaps). Third, the most frequent rank reversals between species pairs occurred between early and later ontogenetic stages, especially between fitness components in contrasting microhabitats. Overall, 15 of 36 pairs of potentially competing species exhibited some type of seedling performance trade-off, two species pairs never outperformed one another, and for 19 species pairs one species was a consistent better performer. We suggest that ontogenetic trade-offs, in concert with microhabitat and fitness component trade-offs, may contribute to species coexistence of long-lived organisms such as tropical trees.

AB Patterns of species co-distribution have often been used to infer the operation of processes such as competition and selection among species. Ecological specialization should create unexpectedly strong species associations, reflected by high positive or negative correlations between species that are adapted to similar or different kinds of site. Two systematic surveys of plant communities do indeed show stronger associations than are expected in randomly assembled communities. Neutral community models, however, also predict nonrandom patterns of co-distribution. Local selection in heterogeneous landscapes, where species are sorted into the sites to which they are best adapted, will produce even stronger associations, provided that different kinds of site are correlated in space, forming repeated combinations or "habitats." In practice, however, this effect is readily detectable only for intense selection in coarse-grained landscapes. In contrast, classification of species or sites into prior categories consistently produces positive associations, and thereby demonstrates the existence of non-neutral processes structuring communities. It is concluded that the bulk properties of communities, such as overall diversity, may be strongly affected by local dispersal and stochastic drift and, for this reason, are adequately represented by neutral models in many cases, despite the operation of systematic processes of local selection. One corollary of this interpretation is that these bulk properties are unlikely to provide useful information about community processes.

AB Many invasive taxa are hybrids, but how hybridization boosts the invasive process remains poorly known. We address this question in the clonal freshwater snail Melanoides tuberculata from Martinique, using three parental and two hybrid lines. We combine an extensive field survey (1990-2003) and a quantitative genetic experiment to show that hybrid lines have outcompeted their parents in natural habitats, and that this increased invasiveness co-occurred with pronounced shifts in life-history traits, such as growth, fecundity and juvenile size. Given the little time between hybrid creation and sampling, and the moderate standing genetic variance for life-history traits in hybrids, we show that some of the observed trait changes between parents and hybrids were unlikely to arise only by continuous selection. We therefore suggest that a large part of hybrid advantage stems from immediate heterosis upon hybridization.

AB Variables determining the number of native and alien plants on arable land in Central Europe are identified. Species richness of 698 samples of weed floras recorded in the Czech Republic in plots of a standard size of 100 m(2) in 1955-2000 was studied in relation to altitudinally based floristic region, soil type, type of cultivated crop, climatic variables, altitude, year of the record, crop cover and height, and human population density in the region. Vascular plant species were classified into native and alien, the latter divided in archaeophytes, introduced before AD 1500, and neophytes, introduced after this date. The use of minimal adequate models in the analysis of covariance allowed determination of the net effects of mutually correlated environmental variables. Models for particular species groups explained 33-48% of variation in species numbers and 27-51% in proportions; however, explanatory variables affected native species, archaeophytes, and neophytes differently. The number and proportion of neophytes increased in 1955-2000, whereas the number of native species and archaeophytes declined (in archaeophytes more slowly in the warm than in the moderate to cool altitudinal floristic region). In warm and dry regions and on dry soils, where most archaeophytes find optimum conditions, fewer native species are able to persist in weed communities than in colder and wetter regions. Archaeophytes respond like neophytes to some variables (climate, seasonal development of crop) and alternatively like native species to other variables (increasing agricultural intensification through time, human population density). Archaeophytes are common in old crops introduced with the beginning of agriculture (cereals), but are poorly represented in relatively recently introduced crops (rape, maize), where neophytes are most numerous. These patterns reflect the history of plant invasions in Central Europe. Neolithic agriculture, introduced from the Near East in the sixth millenium BC, brought archaeophytes with crops and, by creating intense and continuous propagule pressure and imposing new agricultural management, facilitated their invasion. By contrast, the crops introduced during the past five centuries and their specific agrotechnical management have supported spreading of other weed species, mainly invaders from overseas.

AB While population genetic diversity has broad application in species conservation, no studies have examined the community-level consequences of this diversity. We show that population genetic diversity (generated by interspecific hybridization) in a dominant riparian tree affects an arthropod community composed of 207 species. In an experimental garden, plant cross type structured the arthropod community of individual trees, and among stands in the wild, plant genetic diversity accounted for nearly 60% of the variation in arthropod diversity. While previous experimental garden studies have demonstrated the effects of plant genotype on arthropod communities, our study extends these findings from individual trees in an experimental garden to natural stands of cottonwoods where plant population genetic diversity was a significant factor structuring arthropod diversity. These findings argue that the preservation of genetic diversity in a dominant species is far more important than previously realized, and may be particularly important in hybridizing systems.

AB Individual fitness is a central evolutionary concept, but the question of how it should be defined in empirical studies of natural selection remains contentious. Using founding cohorts from long-term population studies of two species of individually marked birds (collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis and Ural owl Strix uralensis), we compared a rate-sensitive (lambda(ind)) and a rate-insensitive (lifetime reproductive success [LRS]) estimate of individual fitness with an estimate of long-term genetic fitness. The latter was calculated as the number of gene copies present in the population after more than two generations, as estimated by tracing genetic lineages and accounting for the fact that populations were not completely closed. When counting fledglings, rate-insensitive estimates of individual fitness correlated better than rate-sensitive estimates with estimated long-term genetic contribution. When counting recruits, both classes of estimates performed equally well. The results support the contention that simple, rate-insensitive measures of fitness, such as LRS, provide a valid and good estimate of fitness in evolutionary studies of natural populations.

AB An important pattern in host-parasite assemblages is a higher intensity of parasites in juveniles than in adults, but the reasons for these differences remain obscure. Three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed: (1) heavily parasitized juveniles die before being recruited into the adult population ('selection' hypothesis); (2) the development of an acquired immunity by the host in front of the parasite reduces the intensity of the parasite in adult hosts ('immunity' hypothesis); and (3) differences in behavior makes adults less exposed to the parasite than juveniles ('vector exposure' hypothesis). Having rejected the 'vector exposure' hypothesis in a previous study, here we tested the 'selection' and 'immunity' hypotheses in feral pigeons (Columba livia) infected by the blood parasite Haemoproteus columbae. In agreement with the 'selection' hypothesis, young (but not adult) pigeons that were highly parasitized had a lower probability of surviving until adulthood, independent of their body condition. However, selection was not strong enough to account for the observed differences in parasite intensity between age-classes, and after selection parasite intensity of survivors still remained 85% higher in juveniles than in adults. In contrast, the 'immunity' hypothesis offered a greater explanatory power. The intensity of blood parasites in young pigeons, but not in adults, decreased over time so dramatically that by the time they had become adults their intensities were indistinguishable from that typically seen in adults. Therefore, while selection against highly parasitized juveniles can contribute to some extent to a reduction in parasitism seen in the adult population, age-specific blood parasitism in feral pigeons is best explained as a transitory phase just before the host develops an effective immune response.

AB 1. Species extinction in fragmented habitats is a non-random process described by transient, rather than equilibrium dynamics. Therefore, 'static' approaches focusing on experimentally established spatial gradients of diversity may fail to capture essential aspects of ecosystem responses to species loss.
   2. Here we document temporal changes in microarthropod species abundance, biomass and richness during a community disassembly trajectory following experimental habitat fragmentation of a moss-based microecosystem.
   3. Habitat fragmentation reduced heterotrophic species richness and community biomass in remnant moss fragments. Extinction was biased towards rare species, and thus occurred initially without significant changes in total community abundance and biomass. Eventual reductions in abundance and biomass were found to lag behind observed declines in species richness.
   4. The presence of moss-habitat corridors connecting fragments to a large 'mainland' area coupled with an immigration rescue effect maintained microarthropod richness, abundance and biomass within remnant fragments.
   5. Our results indicate that both the order of species loss and the dynamics of remnant populations influence the magnitude and timing of ecosystem-level responses to habitat destruction and isolation.

TI The economic value of forest ecosystems
SO ECOSYSTEM HEALTH

ID WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; UNCERTAINTY; OPTION
AB Forest ecosystems are being degraded and lost because of rapid population change and economic incentives that make forest conversion appear more profitable than forest conservation. All ecological functions of forests are also economic functions. Many important forest functions have no markets, and hence, no apparent economic value, justifying the use of forest land for other purposes. Imputing economic values to nonmarketed benefits has the potential to change radically the way we look at all forests and to make the pendulum swing back from a presumption in favor of forest conversion to more conservation and sustainable use. This paper surveys what we know about forest economic values and draws policy conclusions from the now substantial literature that values nonmarket benefits of forests. Estimating economic values is not enough. The subsequent stage of policy is to design markets that capture the values-'market creation'-ideally for the benefit of the many vulnerable communities that rely on the forests for their well-being. These conclusions support the wider argument for using effective economic instruments to promote conservation of the remaining forests. Forest loss involves: risks to human health; accelerated climate change; increased watershed disruption, adding to eutrophication in inland and coastal waters; loss of water quality; and loss of biodiversity.

AB Developed by combining components simplified from previously developed mechanistic models, a complete dynamic model is described for simulating the growth of phytoplankton as functions of ammonium, nitrate, light, iron, silicon, phosphorus and temperature. Components may be safely added or deleted to the base model, describing ammonium-nitrate-light interactions, to suit particular modelling scenarios. Biomass is described in terms of C and cells, while chlorophyll is also a state variable enabling the simulation of changes in Chl a:C with photoacclimation. The model is capable of simulating variable silicon deposition (diatoms) and C cell(-1) with Si, Fe, or P limitations. Mechanisms for inclusion of temperature control of nutrient transport, growth rate and cell size are given. The model is suitable for placement in ecosystem models, containing various components that can be readily modified to tune the simulation to mimic the behaviour of specific algal groups or species, Most of those components have biological significance and can be estimated from experiments or by analysis of existing data.

AB There is a widespread opinion among ecologists that ecology lacks general laws. In this paper I argue that this opinion is mistaken. Taking the case of population dynamics. I point out that there are several very general law-like propositions that provide the theoretical basis for most population dynamics models that were developed to address specific issues. Some of these foundational principles, like the law of exponential growth. are logically very similar to certain laws of physics (Newton's law of inertia, for example. is almost a direct analogue of exponential growth). [ discuss two other principles (population self-limitation and resource-consumer oscillations), as well as the more elementary postulates that underlie them. None of the "laws" that I propose for population ecology are new. Collectively ecologists have been using these general principles in guiding development of their models and experiments since the days of Lotka. Volterra, and Gause.

   REPRODUCTIVE SKEW; HELPING-BEHAVIOR; EUROPEAN ROBIN
AB We examine the evolutionary stability of year-round residency in territorial populations, where breeding sites are a limiting resource. The model links individual life histories to the population-wide competition for territories and includes spatial variation in habitat quality as well as a potential parent-offspring conflict over territory ownership. The general form of the model makes it applicable to the evolution of dispersal, migration, partial migration, and delayed dispersal (offspring retention). We show that migration can be evolutionarily stable only if year-round residency in a given area would produce a sink population, where mortality exceeds reproduction. If this applies to a fraction of the breeding habitat only, partial migration is expected to evolve. In the context of delayed dispersal, habitat saturation has been argued to form an ecological constraint on independent breeding, which favors offspring retention and cooperative breeding. We show that habitat saturation must be considered as a dynamic outcome of birth, death, and dispersal rates in the population, rather than an externally determined constraint. Although delayed dispersal often associates with intense competition for territories, life-history traits have direct effects on stable dispersal strategies, which can often override the effect of habitat saturation. As an example, high survival of floaters selects against delayed dispersal, even though it increases the number of competitors for each breeding vacancy (the "habitat saturation factor"). High survival of territory owners, by contrast, generally favors natal philopatry. We also conclude that spatial variation in habitat quality only rarely selects for delayed dispersal. Within a population, however, offspring retention is more likely in high-quality territories.

AB To evaluate sex-specific differences in gene flow between Native American populations from South America and between those populations and recent immigrants to the New World, we examined the genetic diversity at uni- and biparental genetic markers of five Native American populations from Colombia and in published surveys from native South Americans. The Colombian populations were typed for five polymorphisms in mtDNA, five restriction sites in the beta -globin gene cluster, the DQA1 gene, and nine autosomal microsatellites. Elsewhere, we published results for seven Y-chromosome microsatellites in the same populations. Autosomal polymorphisms showed a mean G(ST) of 6.8%, in agreement with extensive classical marker studies of South American populations. MtDNA and Y-chromosome markers resulted in G(ST) values of 0.18 and 0.165, respectively. When only Y chromosomes of confirmed Amerind origin were used in the calculations las defined by the presence of allele T at locus DYS199), G(ST) increased to 0.22. G(ST) values calculated from published data for other South American natives were 0.3 and 0.29 for mtDNA and Amerind Y chromosomes, respectively. The concordance of these estimates does not support an important difference in migration rates between the sexes throughout the history of South Amerinds. Admixture analysis of the Colombian populations suggests an asymmetric pattern of mating involving mostly immigrant men and native women.

AB Spatial and temporal variations in sediment microbial community structure in a eutrophic lake polluted with inorganic mercury were identified using polar lipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, Microbial community structure was strongly related to mercury methylation potential , sediment organic carbon content, and lake location. Pore a ater sulfate, total mercury concentrations, and organic matter C/N ratios showed no relation ships with microbial community structure. Seasonal changes and changes potentially attributable to temperature regulation of bacterial membranes were detectable but were less important influences on sediment PLFA composition than were differences due to lake sampling location. Analysis of biomarker PLFAs characteristic of Desulfobacter and Desulfovibrio groups of sulfate-reducing bacteria suggests that Desulfobacter-like organisms are important mercury methylators in the sediments, especially in the Lower Arm of Clear Lake.

AB Previous attempts to test for small-scale stock structuring within Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus L.) with molecular markers have been hampered by uninformative levels of genetic variation. Here we report the first application of microsatellite DNA markers to investigate population subdivision in Atlantic herring from Norwegian waters and the Barents Sea, and also examine microsatellite differentiation between C. harengus and Pacific herring (C. pallasi). Results from four microsatellite loci indicate high, and informative, variation compared to molecular markers used previously: number of alleles per locus = 18-41, mean expected heterozygosity within samples = 0.90-0.93. Significant genetic differences were detected between almost all samples representing postulated Icelandic summer-spawner, Norwegian spring-spawner and Norwegian fjord stocks, using Fisher's exact test, F-ST and R-ST values. Levers of allele frequency differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific herring overlapped the range seen among Atlantic herring samples, indicating that microsatellites are poor indicators of the degree of species differentiation. Comparison with allozyme and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) datasets from the same samples suggests that microsatellites may detect structuring at a finer scale, but are less informative at larger scales of divergence.

AB Wind-borne migration, in which migrants ascend to altitudes at which they are transported downwind, has evolved independently in several insect orders. The use of a range of observational techniques, including ground and air-borne radars, has provided new insights into how the migrants' behavior can influence the distance traveled and the degree of dispersal during migration. Simultaneously in recent years, advances in our knowledge of the genetics of migratory potential have provided a basis for understanding how the stochastic effects of the winds on destinations and the pattern of habitat distribution in space and time maintain variation in these traits in populations of wind-borne migrants. This variation, in turn, is an essential factor in the ability of these insects, many of which are important pests, to track often unpredictable changes in the spatial distribution of suitable habitats.

AB 1. Community structure of interstitial invertebrates was studied in the sediments of two gravel bars in a bypass section of the Rhone River (France), in relation to hydrological patchiness and to major geomorphological characteristics of the sampling areas. Hydrological patchiness was characterized by upwelling or downwelling zones while geomorphological characteristics were concerned mainly with position towards the head or tail of each bar, which presented different environmental conditions.
   2. Longitudinal profiles of the two bars, at 0.5 and 1.0 m below the substrate surface, were compared. At each station 10-l samples were taken using mobile standpipes and a Bou-Rouch pump. During low-water conditions, replicate samples were taken in both the head-bar and tail-bar regions to confirm the results. Physicochemical parameters were used to differentiate surface water from ground water (conductivity, alkalinity, silica, nitrates, sulphates and temperature) and to detect hydrological patterns.
   3. Two different situations were observed within the gravel bars. In the first one, the upwelling zone was situated in the tail bar and downwelling zone in the head bar. The reverse was observed in gravel bar 2 where the head-bar region formed the upwelling zone and the tail-bar region formed the downwelling zone.
   4. In the first situation, the distribution of interstitial assemblages corresponded with the observed hydrological patterns: epigean fauna characterized the downwelling zone and stygofauna characterized the upwelling zone. The interstitial fauna seemed to be strictly linked to the mode of water movement within the sediments. Hydrological patchiness therefore appeared to be an important factor for the structure of interstitial assemblages.
   5. In the second case there was no relationship between the hydrological and the biological pattern. Epigean fauna and hypogean fauna were scattered all along the gravel bar. These results suggest that geomorphology is a second important factor governing the composition and structure of interstitial assemblages. A precise structure was obtained when hydrological and geomorphological characteristics were superimposed (case 1). When they were opposed (case 2) all the species responded according to their individual ecological requirements.

AB The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) was launched to the International Space Station on 29 June 2018 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The primary science focus of ECOSTRESS is centered on evapotranspiration (ET), which is produced as Level-3 (L3) latent heat flux (LE) data products. These data are generated from the Level-2 land surface temperature and emissivity product (L2_LSTE), in conjunction with ancillary surface and atmospheric data. Here, we provide the first validation (Stage 1, preliminary) of the global ECOSTRESS clear-sky ET product (L3_ET_PT-JPL, Version 6.0) against LE measurements at 82 eddy covariance sites around the world. Overall, the ECOSTRESS ET product performs well against the site measurements (clear-sky instantaneous/time of overpass: r(2) = 0.88; overall bias = 8%; normalized root-mean-square error, RMSE = 6%). ET uncertainty was generally consistent across climate zones, biome types, and times of day (ECOSTRESS samples the diurnal cycle), though temperate sites are overrepresented. The 70-m-high spatial resolution of ECOSTRESS improved correlations by 85%, and RMSE by 62%, relative to 1-km pixels. This paper serves as a reference for the ECOSTRESS L3 ET accuracy and Stage 1 validation status for subsequent science that follows using these data.
   Key Points
   ECOSTRESS is a state-of-the-art combination of thermal bands, spatial and temporal resolutions, and measurement accuracy and precision Data from 82 eddy covariance sites were coalesced concurrently with the first year of ECOSTRESS for Stage 1 validation Clear-sky ET from ECOSTRESS compared well against a wide range of eddy covariance sites, vegetation classes, climate zones, and times of day

   HYPOTHESIS
AB Plant-soil feedback (PSF) theory provides a powerful framework for understanding plant dynamics by integrating growth assays into predictions of whether soil communities stabilise plant-plant interactions. However, we lack a comprehensive view of the likelihood of feedback-driven coexistence, partly because of a failure to analyse pairwise PSF, the metric directly linked to plant species coexistence. Here, we determine the relative importance of plant evolutionary history, traits, and environmental factors for coexistence through PSF using a meta-analysis of 1038 pairwise PSF measures. Consistent with eco-evolutionary predictions, feedback is more likely to mediate coexistence for pairs of plant species (1) associating with similar guilds of mycorrhizal fungi, (2) of increasing phylogenetic distance, and (3) interacting with native microbes. We also found evidence for a primary role of pathogens in feedback-mediated coexistence. By combining results over several independent studies, our results confirm that PSF may play a key role in plant species coexistence, species invasion, and the phylogenetic diversification of plant communities.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Recent simulation studies examining the performance of Bayesian species delimitation as implemented in the bpp program have suggested that bpp may detect population splits but not species divergences and that it tends to over-split when data of many loci are analyzed. Here, we confirm these results and provide the mathematical justifications. We point out that the distinction between population and species splits made in the protracted speciation model (PSM) has no influence on the generation of gene trees and sequence data, which explains why no method can use such data to distinguish between population splits and speciation. We suggest that the PSM is unrealistic as its mechanism for assigning species status assumes instantaneous speciation, contradicting prevailing taxonomic practice. We confirm the suggestion, based on simulation, that in the case of speciation with gene flow, Bayesian model selection as implemented in bpp tends to detect population splits when the amount of data (the number of loci) increases. We discuss the use of a recently proposed empirical genealogical divergence index (gdi) for species delimitation and illustrate that parameter estimates produced by a full likelihood analysis as implemented in bpp provide much more reliable inference under the gdi than the approximate method phrapl. We distinguish between Bayesian model selection and parameter estimation and suggest that the model selection approach is useful for identifying sympatric cryptic species, while the parameter estimation approach may be used to implement empirical criteria for determining species status among allopatric populations.

AB The supply of nitrogen commonly limits plant production in boreal forests and also affects species composition and ecosystem functions other than plant growth. These interrelations vary across the landscapes, with the highest N availability, plant growth and plant species richness in ground-water discharge areas (GDAs), typically in toe-slope positions, which receive solutes leaching from the much larger groundwater recharge areas (GRAs) uphill. Plant N sources include not only inorganic N, but, as heightened more recently, also organic N species. In general, also the ratio inorganic N over organic N sources increase down hillslopes. Here, we review recent evidence about the nature of the N limitation and its variations in Fennoscandian boreal forests and discuss its implications for forest ecology and management.
   The rate of litter decomposition has traditionally been seen as the determinant of the rate of N supply. However, while N-rich litter decomposes faster than N-poor litter initially, N-rich litter then decomposes more slowly, which means that the relation between N % of litter and its decomposability is complex. Moreover, in the lower part of themor-layer, where the most superficial mycorrhizal roots first appear, and N availability matters for plants, the ratio of microbial N over total soil N is remarkably constant over the wide range in litter and soil C/N ratios of between 15 and 40 for N-rich and N-poor sites, respectively. Nitrogen-rich and-poor sites thus differ in the sizes of the total N pool and the microbial N pool, but not in the ratio between them. A more important difference is that the soil microbial N pool turns over faster in N -rich systems because the microbes are more limited by C, while microbes in N-poor systems are a stronger sink for available N.
   Furthermore, litter decomposition in the most superficial soil horizon (as studied by the so-called litter-bag method) is associated with a dominance of saprotrophic fungi, and absence of mycorrhizal fungi. The focal zone in the context of plant N supply in N-limited forests is further down the soil profile, whereectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots become abundant. Molecular evidence and stable isotope data indicate that in the typical N-poor boreal forests, nitrogen is retained in saprotrophic fungi, likely until they run out of energy (available C-compounds). Then, as heightened by recent research, ECM fungi, which are supplied by photosynthate from the trees, become the superior competitors for N.
   In N-poor boreal soils strong N retention by microorganisms keeps levels of available N very low. This is exacerbated by an increase in tree C allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (TCAM) relative to net primary production (NPP) with decreasing soil N supply, which causes ECM fungi to retain much of the available soil N for their own growth and transfer little to their tree hosts. The transfer of N through the ECM fungi, and not the rate of litter decomposition, is likely limiting the rate of tree N supply under such conditions. All but a few stress-tolerant less N-demanding plant species, like the ECM trees themselves and ericaceous dwarf shrubs, are excluded.
   With increasing N supply, a weakening of ECM symbiosis caused by the relative decline in TCAM contributes to shifts in soil microbial community composition from fungal dominance to bacterial dominance. Thus, bacteria, which are less C-demanding, but more likely to release N than fungi, take over. This, and the relatively high pH in GDA, allow autotrophic nitrifying bacteria to compete successfully for the NH4+ released by C-limited organisms and causes the N cycle to open up with leaching of nitrate (NO) and gaseous N losses through denitrification. These N-rich conditions allow species-rich communities of N-demanding plant species. Meanwhile, ECM fungi have a smaller biomass, are supplied with N in excess of their demand and will export more N to their host trees. Hence, the gradient from low to high N supply is characterized by profound variations in plant and soil microbial physiologies, especially their relations to the C-to-N supply ratio. We propose how interactions among functional groups can be understood and modelled (the plant-microbe carbon-nitrogen model).
   With regard to forest management these perspectives explain why the creation of larger tree-free gaps favors the regeneration of tree seedlings under N-limited conditions through reduced belowground competition for N, and why such gaps are less important under high N supply (but when light might be limiting). We also discuss perspectives on the relations between N supply, biodiversity, and eutrophication of boreal forests from N deposition or forest fertilization. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB A novel magnetic copper-based metal-organic framework (M-MOF) was prepared using a Fe4O3-graphene oxide(GO)-beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) nanocomposite as the magnetic core and support, and used for adsorption and removal of neonicotinoid insecticide pollutants from aqueous solution. M-MOF characterization suggested that (Fe4O3)-Fe-1-GO-beta-CD consisted of a thin single layer with anchored Fe3O4. The M-MOF was coated on the Fe4O3-GO-beta-CD surface. The M-MOF had a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (250.33 m(2)g(-1)) and high super-paramagnetism with saturation magnetization of 10.47 emu g(-1). Adsorption model analysis showed that the equilibrium data for thiacloprid fitted Langmuir monolayer adsorption and the other insecticides tested showed Freundlich bimolecular layer adsorption. The results show that M-MOF is a promising hybrid adsorbent for rapid removal of neonicotinoid insecticide pollutants from environmental waters. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is thought that species abundance is correlated with environmental suitability and that environmental variables, scale, and type of model fitting can confound this relationship. We performed a meta-analysis to 1) test whether species abundance is positively correlated with environmental suitability derived from correlative ecological niche models (ENM), 2) test whether studies encompassing large areas within a species range (> 50%) exhibited higher AS correlations than studies encompassing small areas within a species range (< 50%), 3) assess which modelling method provided higher AS correlation, and 4) compare strength of the AS relationship between studies using only climatic variables and those that used both climatic and other environmental variables to derive suitability. We used correlation coefficients to measure the relationship between abundance and environmental suitability derived from ENM. Each correlation coefficient was considered an effect size in a random-effects multivariate meta-analysis. In all cases we found a significantly positive relationship between abundance and suitability. This relationship was consistent regardless of scale of study, ENM method, or set of variables used to derive suitability. There was no difference in strength of correlation between studies focusing on large or small areas within a species' range or among ENM methods. Studies using other variables in combination with climate exhibited higher AS correlations than studies using only climatic variables. We conclude that occurrence data can be a reasonable proxy for abundance, especially for vertebrates, and the use of local variables increases the strength of the AS relationship. Use of ENMs can significantly decrease survey costs and allow the study of large-scale abundance patterns using less information. Including only climatic variables in ENM may confound the relationship between abundance and suitability when compared to studies including variables taken locally. However, modelers and conservationists must be aware that high environmental suitability does not always indicate high abundance.

AB Inbreeding depression (reduced fitness of individuals with related parents) has long been a major focus of ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. Despite decades of research, we still have a limited understanding of the strength, underlying genetic mechanisms, and demographic consequences of inbreeding depression in the wild. Studying inbreeding depression in natural populations has been hampered by the inability to precisely measure individual inbreeding. Fortunately, the rapidly increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing data means it is now feasible to measure the inbreeding of any individual with high precision. Here, we review how genomic data are advancing our understanding of inbreeding depression in the wild. Recent results show that individual inbreeding and inbreeding depression can be measured more precisely with genomic data than via traditional pedigree analysis. Additionally, the availability of genomic data has made it possible to pinpoint loci with large effects contributing to inbreeding depression in wild populations, although this will continue to be a challenging task in many study systems due to low statistical power. Now that reliably measuring individual inbreeding is no longer a limitation, a major focus of future studies should be to more accurately quantify effects of inbreeding depression on population growth and viability.

AB Community ecology recognises today that local biological communities are not only affected by local biotic interactions and abiotic environmental conditions, but also by regional processes (e.g. dispersal). While much is known about how metacommunities are organised in space in terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecological systems, their temporal variations remain poorly studied. Here, we address the question of the dynamics of metacommunities in highly variable systems, using intermittent rivers (IRs), those rivers which temporarily stop flowing or dry up, as a model system. We first review how habitat heterogeneity in space and time influences metacommunity organisation. Second, we compare the metacommunities in IRs to those in perennial rivers (PRs) and develop the idea that IRs could undergo highly dynamic shifts due to the temporal variability in local and regional community processes. Third, we develop the idea that in IRs, metacommunities of the wet and dry phases of IRs are closely intertwined, thereby increasing even more their respective temporal dynamics. Last, we provide a roadmap to stimulate further conceptual and empirical developments of metacommunity research and identify possible applications for improving the management of IRs and other highly dynamic ecological systems.
   Synthesis Extensive research has examined the importance of local biotic interactions, environmental filtering, and regional processes on community assembly. Movement of organisms between sites, i.e. dispersal, is a major set of processes within this framework. However, subsequent metacommunity organisation also varies over time in ecosystems because habitat characteristics such as configuration and composition continuously shift. Intermittent rivers are an ideal set of systems to examine these ideas because these freshwater systems temporarily cease flowing thereby limiting dispersal events. We proposed the hypothesis that metacommunities in dynamic ecosystems will undergo frequent shifts in structure and composition in response to the temporal variability in environmental filtering and dispersal. In addition to providing a roadmap for developing a more dynamic perspective for community ecology, these framework provides direct insights for the management of intermittent rivers.

AB The crude processing of electronic waste (e-waste) has led to serious contamination in soils. While microorganisms may play a key role in remediation of the contaminated soils, the ecological effects of combined pollution (heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers) on the composition and diversity of microbial communities remain unknown. In this study, a suite of e-waste contaminated soils were collected from Guiyu, China, and the indigenous microbial assemblages were profiled by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and clone library analysis. Our data revealed significant differences in microbial taxonomic composition between the contaminated and the reference soils, with Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes dominating the e-waste-affected communities. Genera previously identified as organic pollutants-degrading bacteria, such as Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Alcanivorax, were frequently detected. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that approximately 70% of the observed variation in microbial assemblages in the contaminated soils was explained by eight environmental variables (including soil physiochemical parameters and organic pollutants) together, among which moisture content, decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), and copper were the major factors. These results provide the first detailed phylogenetic look at the microbial communities in e-waste contaminated soils, demonstrating that the complex combined pollution resulting from improper e-waste recycling may significantly alter soil microbiota.

AB Declines in plants and herbivorous insects due to land use abandonment and intensification have been studied in agricultural areas worldwide. We tested four hypotheses, which were complementary rather than mutually exclusive, to understand the mechanisms driving biodiversity declines due to abandonment and intensification. These predict that biodiversity decline is caused by a decline in resource diversity, changes in disturbance regime, surrounding landscape conversion, and a decrease in biomass production. We compared plant richness and butterfly and orthopteran richness and diversity among three land use types in seminatural grasslands: abandoned, traditional, and intensified terraces. Then, we examined effects of changes in resource (plant) richness, frequency of disturbance (mowing), and surrounding landscapes on butterfly and orthopteran diversity to understand the mechanisms driving decline after land abandonment and intensification. Plant and herbivore richness and diversity were significantly lower in abandoned and intensified grasslands than in traditional grasslands. This trend was consistent throughout the seasons in both years of the study. Changes in mowing frequency and surrounding landscape explained plant richness declines as a consequence of land abandonment and intensification. Declines in herbivorous insects were explained by plant richness declines and changes in mowing frequency, but not by landscape changes. Plant and herbivore richness were maximized at an intermediate mowing frequency (approximately twice per year), which is typical practice on traditional terraces. This is the first report demonstrating that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis explained well the biodiversity declines in agricultural ecosystems. The richness and diversity responses of herbivore functional groups to plant richness, mowing frequency, and surrounding landscapes were generally inconsistent with predictions. We found significant trends in which butterfly and orthopteran species with low abundance in traditional terraces were lost in abandoned and/or intensive terraces. This may suggest that the number of individuals of most herbivorous species decreased randomly with respect to life-history traits following a decline in plant richness after changes in disturbance frequency. This study demonstrates that declines in herbivorous insects can be explained by multiple factors, and provides a unified explanation for biodiversity declines in both abandoned and intensified use of agricultural lands, which have often been studied separately.

AB Corridors are popular conservation tools because they are thought to allow animals to safely move between habitat fragments, thereby maintaining landscape connectivity. Nonetheless, few studies show that mammals actually use corridors as predicted. Further, the assumptions underlying corridor models are rarely validated with field data. We categorized corridor use as a behavior, to identify animal-defined corridors, using movement data from fishers (Martes pennanti) tracked near Albany, New York, USA. We then used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to predict fisher corridors and validated the performance of all three corridor models with data from camera traps. Six of eight fishers tracked used corridors to connect the forest patches that constitute their home ranges, however the locations of these corridors were not well predicted by the two cost-based models, which together identified only 5 of the 23 used corridors. Further, camera trap data suggest the cost-based corridor models performed poorly, often detecting fewer fishers and mammals than nearby habitat cores, whereas camera traps within animal-defined corridors recorded more passes made by fishers, carnivores, and all other non-target mammal groups. Our results suggest that (1) fishers use corridors to connect disjunct habitat fragments, (2) animal movement data can be used to identify corridors at local scales, (3) camera traps are useful tools for testing corridor model predictions, and (4) that corridor models can be improved by incorporating animal behavior data. Given the conservation importance and monetary costs of corridors, improving and validating corridor model predictions is vital.

AB Hybridization is increasingly being recognized as a widespread process, even between ecologically and behaviorally divergent animal species. Determining phylogenetic relationships in the presence of hybridization remains a major challenge for evolutionary biologists, but advances in sequencing technology and phylogenetic techniques are beginning to address these challenges. Here we reconstruct evolutionary relationships among swordtails and platyfishes (Xiphophorus: Poeciliidae), a group of species characterized by remarkable morphological diversity and behavioral barriers to interspecific mating. Past attempts to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within Xiphophorus have produced conflicting results. Because many of the 26 species in the genus are interfertile, these conflicts are likely due to hybridization. Using genomic data, we resolve a high-confidence species tree of Xiphophorus that accounts for both incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization. Our results allow us to reexamine a long-standing controversy about the evolution of the sexually selected sword in Xiphophorus, and demonstrate that hybridization has been strikingly widespread in the evolutionary history of this genus.

AB Climate warming is expected to change the distribution and abundance of many species(1-3). Range shifts have been detected in a number of European taxa for which long-term government-initiated or organized-survey data are available(4-8). In North America, well-organized long-term data needed to document such shifts are much less common. Opportunistic observations made by citizen scientist groups may be an excellent alternative to systematic surveys(9). From 1992 to 2010, 19,779 butterfly surveys were made by amateur naturalists in Massachusetts, a geographically small state located at the convergence of northern and southern bioclimatic zones in eastern North America. From these data, we estimated population trends for nearly all butterfly species (100 of 116 species present) using list-length analysis(10,11). Population trajectories indicate increases of many species near their northern range limits and declines in nearly all species (17 of 21) near their southern range limits. Certain life-history traits, especially overwintering stage, were strongly associated with declines. Our results suggest that a major, climate-induced shift of North American butterflies, characterized by northward expansions of warm-adapted and retreat of cold-adapted species, is underway.

AB Background: There is growing evidence that long-term, heavy cannabis use is associated with alterations in regional brain volumes. Although these changes are frequently attributed to the neurotoxic effects of cannabis, it is possible that some abnormalities might predate use and represent markers of vulnerability. To date, no studies have examined whether structural brain abnormalities are present before the onset of cannabis use. This study aims to determine whether adolescents who have initiated cannabis use early (i.e., before age 17 years) show premorbid structural abnormalities in the amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex.
   Methods: Participants (n = 121) were recruited from primary schools in Melbourne, Australia, as part of a larger study examining adolescent emotional development. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging at age 12 years and were assessed for cannabis use 4 years later, at age 16 years. At the follow-up assessment, 28 participants had commenced using cannabis (16 female subjects [57%]), and 93 had not (43 female subjects [46%]).
   Results: Smaller orbitofrontal cortex volumes at age 12 years predicted initiation of cannabis use by age 16 years. The volumes of other regions (amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex) did not predict later cannabis use.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that structural abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex might contribute to risk for cannabis exposure. Although the results have important implications for understanding neurobiological predictors of cannabis use, further research is needed to understand their relationship with heavier patterns of use in adulthood as well as later abuse of other substances.

AB Rural communities in many parts of the tropics are dependent of forests for their livelihoods and for environmental services. Forest resources in the tropics have declined rapidly over the past century and therefore many developing countries in the tropics have reforestation programs. Although reforestation is a long-term process with long-term benefits, existing evaluations of the success of these programs tends to focus on short-term establishment success indicators. This paper presents a review of reforestation assessment that highlights the need to not only consider short-term establishment success, but also longer-term growth and maturation success, environmental success and socio-economic success. In addition, we argue that reforestation assessment should not be based on success indicators alone, but should incorporate the drivers of success, which encompasses an array of biophysical, socio-economic, institutional and project characteristics. This is needed in order to understand the reasons why reforestation projects succeed or fail and therefore to design more successful projects in future. The paper presents a conceptual model for reforestation success assessment that links key groups of success indicators and drivers. This conceptual model provides the basis for a more comprehensive evaluation of reforestation success and the basis for the development of predictive systems-based assessment models. These models will be needed to better guide reforestation project planning and policy design and therefore assist rural communities in tropical developing countries to alleviate poverty and achieve a better quality of life.

AB Aim Species distribution models have been used frequently to assess the effects of climate change on mountain biodiversity. However, the value and accuracy of these assessments have been hampered by the use of low-resolution data for species distributions and climatic conditions. Herein we assess potential changes in the distribution and community composition of tree species in two mountainous regions of Spain under specific scenarios of climate change using data with a high spatial resolution. We also describe potential changes in species distributions and tree communities along the entire elevational gradient.
   Location Two mountain ranges in southern Europe: the Central Mountain Range (central west of the Iberian Peninsula), and the Iberian Mountain Range (central east).
   Methods We modelled current and future distributions of 15 tree species (Eurosiberian, sub-Mediterranean and Mediterranean species) as functions of climate, lithology and availability of soil water using generalized linear models (logistic regression) and machine learning models (gradient boosting). Using multivariate ordination of a matrix of presence/absence of tree species obtained under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (A2 and B2) for two different periods in the future (2041-70 and 2071-2100), we assessed the predicted changes in the composition of tree communities.
   Results The models predicted an upward migration of communities of Mediterranean trees to higher elevations and an associated decline in communities of temperate or cold-adapted trees during the 21st century. It was predicted that 80-99% of the area that shows a climate suitable for cold-wet-optimum Eurosiberian coniferous and broad-leaved species will be lost. The largest overall changes were predicted for Mediterranean species found currently at low elevations, such as Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinaster, Quercus ilex ssp. ballota and Juniperus oxycedrus, with sharp increases in their range of 350%.
   Main conclusions It is likely that areas with climatic conditions suitable for cold-adapted species will decrease significantly under climate warming. Large changes in species ranges and forest communities might occur, not only at high elevations within Mediterranean mountains but also along the entire elevational gradient throughout this region, particularly at low and mid-elevations. Mediterranean mountains might lose their key role as refugia for cold-adapted species and thus an important part of their genetic heritage.

AB Establishing species conservation priorities and recovery goals is often enhanced by extinction risk estimates. The need to set goals, even in data-deficient situations, has prompted researchers to ask whether general guidelines could replace individual estimates of extinction risk. To inform conservation policy, recent studies have revived the concept of the minimum viable population (MVP), the population size required to provide some specified probability of persistence for a given period of time. These studies conclude that long-term persistence requires >= 5000 adult individuals, an MVP threshold that is unaffected by taxonomy, life history or environmental conditions. Here, we re-evaluate this suggestion. We find that neither data nor theory supports its general applicability, raising questions about the utility of MVPs for conservation planning.

AB Ecological invasions are a major worldwide problem exacting tremendous economic and ecological costs. Efforts to explain variability in invasion speed and impact by searching for combinations of ecological conditions and species traits associated with invasions have met with mixed success. We use a simulation model that integrates insights from life-history theory, animal personalities, network theory, and spatial ecology to derive a new mechanism for explaining variation in animal invasion success. We show that spread occurs most rapidly when (1) a species includes a mix of life-history or personality types that differ in density-dependent performance and dispersal tendencies, (2) the differences between types are of intermediate magnitude, and (3) patch connections are intermediate in number and widely spread. Within-species polymorphism in phenotype (e.g., life-history strategies or personality), a feature not included in previous models, is important for overcoming the fact that different traits are associated with success in different stages of the invasion process. Polymorphism in sociability (a personality type) increases the speed of the invasion front, since asocial individuals colonize empty patches and facilitate the local growth of social types that, in turn, induce faster dispersal by asocials at the invasion edge. The results hold implications for the prediction of invasion impacts and the classification of traits associated with invasiveness.

AB Gross primary production (GPP) defined as the overall rate of fixation of carbon through the process of vegetation photosynthesis is important for carbon cycle and climate change research. Three models, the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), the Temperature and Greenness (TG) model and the Vegetation Index (VI) model have been compared for the estimation of GPP in Harvard Forest from 2003 to 2006 using climate variables acquired by eddy covariance (EC) measurements and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. All these models provide more reliable estimates of GPP than that of MODIS GPP product. High Pearsons correlation coefficients r equal to 0.94, 0.92 and 0.90 are observed for the VPM, the TG and the VI model, respectively. Relationships between GPP and land surface temperature (LST, R-2=0.72), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, R-2=0.45) indicate that climate variables are important for GPP estimation. Due to proper characterization of temperature, water stress and leaf age by three scalars, VPM best follows the seasonal variations of GPP. By incorporation of the MODIS surface reflectance and LST product, the TG model is the most suitable choice for areas without prior knowledge as it is based entirely on remote sensing observations. Results from the VI model demonstrate the possibility of using a single vegetation index for light use efficiency (LUE) estimation in deciduous forest that is of high spatial heterogeneity. The validation and comparison of models will be helpful in development of future GPP models using combinations of climate variables and/or remote sensing observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB High biodiversity of forests is not predicted by traditional models, and evidence for trade-offs those models require is limited. High-dimensional regulation (e.g.. N factors to regulate N species) has long been recognized as a possible alternative explanation, but it has not be been seriously pursued, because only a few limiting resources are evident for trees, and analysis of multiple interactions is challenging. We develop a hierarchical model that allows us to synthesize data from long-term, experimental; data sets with processes that control growth, maturation, fecundity, and survival. We allow for uncertainty at all stages and variation among 26 000 individuals and over time, including 268 000 tree years, for dozens of tree species. We estimate population-level parameters that apply at the species level and the interactions among latent states, i.e., the demographic rates for each individual, every year. The former show that the traditional trade-offs used to explain diversity are not present. Demographic rates overlap among species, and they do not show trends consistent with maintenance of diversity by simple mechanisms (negative correlations and limiting similarity). However, estimates of latent states at the level of individuals and years demonstrate that species partition environmental variation. Correlations between responses to variation in time are high for individuals of the same species, but not for individuals of different species. We demonstrate that these relationships are pervasive, providing strong evidence that high-dimensional regulation is critical for biodiversity regulation.

AB Bird communities in tropical forests are strongly affected by both patch area and habitat edges. The fact that both effects are intrinsically confounded in space raises questions about how these two widely reported ecological patterns interact, and whether they are independent or simply different spatial manifestations of the same phenomenon. Moreover, do small patches of secondary forest, in landscapes where the most sensitive species have gone locally extinct, exhibit similar patterns to those previously observed in fragmented and continuous primary forests? We addressed these questions by testing edge-related differences in vegetation structure and bird community composition at 31 sites in fragmented and continuous landscapes in the imperilled Atlantic forest of Brazil. Over a two-year period, birds were captured with mist nets to a standardized effort of 680 net-hours at each site (similar to 22 000 net-hours resulting in 3381 captures from 114 species). We found that the bird community in patches of secondary forest was degraded in species composition compared to primary continuous forest, but still exhibited a strong response to edge effects. In fragmented secondary forests, edge and area effects also interacted, such that the magnitude of edge to interior differences on bird community composition declined markedly with patch size. The change in bird species composition between forest interiors and edges was similar to the change in community composition between large and small patches (because species had congruent responses to edge and area), but after controlling for edge effects community composition was no longer affected by patch area. Our results show that although secondary forests hold an impoverished bird community, ecological patterns such as area and edge effects are similar to those reported for primary forests. Our data provide further evidence that edge effects are the main drivers of area effects in fragmented landscapes.

AB P>The benefits of plant functional group and plant species diversity for sustaining primary productivity have been extensively studied. However, few studies have simultaneously explored potential benefits of plant species and functional group richness and composition for the delivery of other ecosystem services and their dependency on resource availability.
   Here, we investigated in soils of different fertility the effects of plant species and functional group richness and composition on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in vegetation, soil and soil microbes and on CO(2) exchange and the loss of C and N from soil through leaching. We established plant communities from a pool of six mesotrophic grassland species belonging to one of three functional groups (C3 grasses, forbs and legumes) in two soils of contrasting fertility. We varied species richness using one, two, three or six species and one, two or three functional groups.
   After 2 years, vegetation C and N and soil microbial biomass were greater in the more fertile soil and increased significantly with greater numbers of plant species and functional group richness. The positive effect of plant diversity on vegetation C and N coincided with reduced loss of water and N through leaching, which was especially governed by forbs, and increased rates of net ecosystem CO(2) exchange.
   Soil C and N pools were not affected by the number of plant species or functional group richness per se after 2 years, but were enhanced by the presence and biomass of the legumes Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens.
   Synthesis. Collectively, our findings indicate that changes in plant species and functional group richness influence the storage and loss of both C and N in model grassland communities but that these responses are related to the presence and biomass of certain plant species, notably N fixers and forbs. Our results therefore suggest that the co-occurrence of species from specific functional groups is crucial for the maintenance of multifunctionality with respect to C and N storage in grasslands.

AB Variable selection pressures across heterogeneous landscapes can lead to local adaptation of populations. The extent of local adaptation depends on the interplay between natural selection and gene flow, but the nature of this relationship is complex. Gene flow can constrain local adaptation by eroding differentiation driven by natural selection, or local adaptation can itself constrain gene flow through selection against maladapted immigrants. Here we test for evidence that natural selection constrains gene flow among populations of a widespread passerine bird (Zonotrichia capensis) that are distributed along an elevational gradient in the Peruvian Andes. Using multilocus sequences and microsatellites screened in 142 individuals collected along a series of replicate transects, we found that mitochondrial gene flow was significantly reduced along elevational transects relative to latitudinal control transects. Nuclear gene flow, however, was not similarly reduced. Clines in mitochondrial haplotype frequency were strongly associated with transitions in environmental variables along the elevational transects, but this association was not observed for the nuclear markers. These results suggest that natural selection constrains mitochondrial gene flow along elevational gradients and that the mitonuclear discrepancy may be due to local adaptation of mitochondrial haplotypes.

AB Previous studies have found that urbanization often decreases net primary production (NPP), an important integrative measure of ecosystem functioning. in arid environments, however, urbanization may boost productivity by introducing highly productive plant communities and weakening the coupling of plant growth to naturally occurring cycles of water and nutrients. We tested these ideas by comparing NPP estimated for natural and anthropogenic land covers in the Phoenix metropolitan region of USA using MODIS NDVI data and a simplified parametric NPP model. Most anthropogenic land covers exhibited higher production than the natural desert. Consequently, the combined urban and agricultural areas contributed more to the regional primary production than the natural desert did in normal and dry years, whereas this pattern was reversed in wet years. Primary production of this urban landscape was only weakly correlated with rainfall, but strongly with socio-economic variables. Our productivity estimates agreed well with NPP predicted by a process-based ecosystem model for the area. Significant uncertainties, however, remain due to extremely high heterogeneity of urban vegetation. Nevertheless, our results clearly show that urbanization may not only increase regional NPP and disrupt the coupling between vegetation and precipitation, but also increase spatial heterogeneity of NPP in this and region.

AB Plant root systems are highly dynamic over various temporal and spatial scales, and are responsive to changes in environmental conditions. The objective of this review is to describe the dynamics of root structure and function in boreal and northern temperate forests and examine how edaphic and climatic characteristics and intra- and interspecific root competition impact root dynamics. Fine roots exhibit distinct seasonal trends of production and mortality. Over the extent of stand development, coarse root biomass increases until maturity, while the response of fine roots remains unclear. Roots are predominantly restricted to the upper soil layers, and spatial variability of roots in the horizontal direction decreases with decreasing root size. Root/shoot ratio decreases gradually through stand development. On nutrient-rich sites, roots are more concentrated around respective stems and root systems are more branched than on nutrient-poor sites. Plants generally root deeper under low soil moisture conditions, while roots tend to grow horizontally into rich rather than poor patches of soil. Plants adapt their biomass allocation strategies to edaphic and climatic variation according to the functional equilibrium hypothesis. Although root production is projected to increase, providing nutrients are not limiting, following elevated carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures, how root turnover and above- and below-ground carbon allocation may change remains uncertain. Stands composed of species with different rooting characteristics may attain greater root production compared to single-species stands or mixtures of similar species from reduced exploitative competition. Alternatively, plants can produce greater root biomass with a competing plant than growing alone as a result of self root discrimination. Future research is needed to address how elevated carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures will feedback upon soil resource availability to influence plant responses from the organism- to the ecosystem-level.

AB We used the mitochondrial control region and a comparative approach to study the genetic population structure of two surgeonfishes, Naso brevirostris and Naso unicornis, across their Indo-central Pacific ranges. Our purpose was to compare our results with those of a previous study of Naso vlamingii [Klanten, S.O., van Herwerden, L., Choat J.H., 2007. Extreme genetic diversity and temporal rather than spatial partitioning in a widely distributed coral reef fish. Mar. Biol. 150, 659-670] another widely distributed Indo-central Pacific Naso species. We found no evidence of a barrier to gene flow between the Indian and Pacific Oceans for either species, consistent with what was shown for N. vlamingii. Overall, both target species lacked spatial population partitions and probably have complex patterns of gene flow on several spatial scales. Despite the lack of geographic population structure distinct clades were observed in N. brevirostris, similar to those found in N. vlamingii. Coalescence times for intraspecific clades of N. brevirostris and N. vlamingii approximate each other, suggesting parallel evolutionary histories. A bimodal mismatch distribution in N. brevirostris indicates that a biogeographic barrier separated N. brevirostris; populations sometime during its species history. Naso unicornis, in contrast, lacked genetic structure of any kind, although it has what could represent a single surviving clade. Congruent lack of spatial population structure among all three species suggest that such patterns are not due to stochastic processes of DNA mutation and are most likely driven by ecological and environmental factors.

AB The link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is now well established, but the challenge remains to develop a mechanistic understanding of observed effects. Predator-prey interactions provide an opportunity to examine the role of resource partitioning, thought to be a principal mediator of biodiversity-function relationships. To date, interactions between multiple predators and their prey have typically been investigated in simplified agricultural systems with limited scope for resource partitioning. Thus there remains a dearth of studies examining the functional consequences of predator richness in diverse food webs. Here, we manipulated a species-rich intertidal food web, crossing predator diversity with total predator density, to simultaneously examine the independent and interactive effects of diversity and density on the efficiency of secondary resource capture. The effect of predator diversity was only detectable at high predator densities where competitive interactions between individual predators were magnified; the rate of resource capture within the species mixture more than doubled that of the best-performing single species. Direct observation of species-specifc resource use in monoculture, as quantified by patterns of prey consumption, provided clear evidence that species occupied distinct functional niches, suggesting a mechanistic explanation of the observed diversity effect.

AB Since its emergence in the past decades, restoration ecology has demonstrated an astounding growth as a new discipline of applied science. At the same time, this young discipline has been criticized for its retrospective goals largely based on the past, its fragmented approach, and its idealistic goals, which do not relate to the real world context. Restoration with past-focused, idealistic, and/or ad hoc goals may not work in the future because an ecosystem that is restored for the past environment is not likely to be sustainable in the changing environment of the future, simple recomposition of isolated and fragmented naturalistic patches is not likely to restore ecosystem functions, and unrealistic goals and work plans are not likely to gain public support. We advocate directing the principles and practice of ecological restoration to the future. Future-aimed restoration should acknowledge the changing and unpredictable environment of the future, assume the dynamic nature of ecological communities with multiple trajectories, and connect landscape elements for improving ecosystem functions and structures. In this paper, we discuss the predictability of restoration trajectories under changing environmental conditions, the application of ecological theories to restoration practice, the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and human interventions in ecosystem recovery, and the social context of ecological restoration.

AB The fitness of an organism can be affected by conditions experienced during early development. In light of the impact that oxidative stress can have on the health and ageing of a bird species, this study evaluated factors accounting for the variation in oxidative stress levels in nestlings of the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) by measuring the serum concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites and the serum antioxidant barrier against hypochlorite-induced oxidation. The ratio between these two variables was considered as an index of oxidative stress, with higher values meaning higher oxidative damage. Six-chick broods showed the highest level of oxidative stress, while no effect of sex was found. Age showed an inverse relationship with the oxidants and the levels of oxidative stress, with younger birds having higher levels. Hatching date, body condition, body mass and carotenoid concentration did not show any relationship with oxidants, antioxidants or degree of oxidative stress. These findings suggest that intrabrood sibling competition could play a role in determining oxidative stress, and that in carnivorous birds other antioxidant molecules could be more important than carotenoids to reduce oxidative stress.

AB Inter-locus sexual conflict occurs by definition when there is sexually antagonistic selection on a trait so that the optimal trait value differs between the sexes. As a result, there is selection on each sex to manipulate the trait towards its own optimum and resist such manipulation by the other sex. Sexual conflict often leads additionally to the evolution of harmful behaviour and to self-reinforcing and even perpetual sexually antagonistic coevolution. In an attempt to understand the determinants of these different outcomes, I compare two groups of traits-those related to parental investment (PI) and to mating-over which there is sexual conflict, but which have to date been explored by largely separate research traditions. A brief review suggests that sexual conflict over PI, particularly over PI per offspring, leads less frequently to the evolution of manipulative behaviour, and rarely to the evolution of harmful behaviour or to the rapid evolutionary changes which may be symptomatic of sexually antagonistic coevolution. The chief determinants of the evolutionary outcome of sexual conflict are the benefits of manipulation and resistance, the costs of manipulation and resistance, and the feasibility of manipulation. All three of these appear to contribute to the differences in the evolutionary outcome of conflicts over PI and mating. A detailed dissection of the evolutionary changes following from sexual conflict exposes greater complexity than a simple adaptation-counter-adaptation cycle and clarifies the role of harm. Not all of the evolutionary changes that follow from sexual conflict are sexually antagonistic, and harm is not necessary for sexually antagonistic coevolution to occur. In particular, whereas selection on the trait over which there is conflict is by definition sexually antagonistic, collateral harm is usually in the interest of neither sex. This creates the opportunity for palliative adaptations which reduce collateral harm. Failure to recognize that such adaptations are in the interest of both sexes can hinder our understanding of the evolutionary outcome of sexual conflict.

AB Intergenerational effects arise when parents' actions influence the reproduction and survival of their offspring and possibly later descendants. Models suggest that intergenerational effects have important implications for both population dynamical patterns and the evolution of life-history traits. However, these will depend on the nature and duration of intergenerational effects. Here we show that manipulating parental food environments of soil mites produced intergenerational effects that were still detectable in the life histories of descendents three generations later. Intergenerational effects varied in different environments and from one generation to the next. In low-food environments, variation in egg size altered a tradeoff between age and size at maturity and had little effect on the size of eggs produced in subsequent generations. Consequently, intergenerational effects decreased over time. In contrast, in high-food environments, variation in egg size predominantly influenced a tradeoff between fecundity and adult survival and generated increasing variation in egg size. As a result, the persistence and significance of intergenerational effects varied between high- and low-food environments. Context-dependent intergenerational effects can therefore have complex but important effects on population dynamics.

AB 1 Alien species may form plant-animal mutualistic complexes that contribute to their invasive potential. Using multivariate techniques, we examined the structure of a plant-pollinator web comprising both alien and native plants and flower visitors in the temperate forests of north-west Patagonia, Argentina. Our main objective was to assess whether plant species origin (alien or native) influences the composition of flower visitor assemblages. We also examined the influence of other potential confounding intrinsic factors such as flower symmetry and colour, and extrinsic factors such as flowering time, site and habitat disturbance.
   2 Flowers of alien and native plant species were visited by a similar number of species and proportion of insects from different orders, but the composition of the assemblages of flower-visiting species differed between alien and native plants.
   3 The influence of plant species origin on the composition of flower visitor assemblages persisted after accounting for other significant factors such as flowering time, bearing red corollas, and habitat disturbance. This influence was at least in part determined by the fact that alien flower visitors were more closely associated with alien plants than with native plants. The main native flower visitors were, on average, equally associated with native and alien plant species.
   4 In spite of representing a minor fraction of total species richness (3.6% of all species), alien flower visitors accounted for > 20% of all individuals recorded on flowers. Thus, their high abundance could have a significant impact in terms of pollination.
   5 The mutualistic web of alien plants and flower-visiting insects is well integrated into the overall community-wide pollination web. However, in addition to their use of the native biota, invasive plants and flower visitors may benefit from differential interactions with their alien partners. The existence of these invader complexes could contribute to the spread of aliens into novel environments.

AB The diversity and composition of a community are determined by a combination of local and regional processes. We conducted a field experiment to examine the impact of resource manipulations and seed addition on the invasibility and diversity of a low-productivity grassland. We manipulated resource levels both by a disturbance treatment that reduced adult plant cover in the spring of the first year and by addition of fertilizer every year. Seeds of 46 native species, both resident and nonresident to the community,,were added in spring of the first year to determine the effects of recruitment limitation from local (seed limitation) and regional (dispersal limitation) sources on local species richness. Our results show that the unmanipulated community was not readily invasible. Seed addition increased the species richness of unmanipulated plots, but this was primarily due to increased occurrence of resident species. Nonresident species were only able to invade following a cover-reduction disturbance.
   Cover reduction resulted in an increase in nitrogen availability in the first year, but had no measurable effect on light availability in any year. In contrast, fertilization created a persistent increase in nitrogen availability that increased plant cover or biomass and reduced light penetration to ground level. Initially, fertilization had an overall positive effect on species richness, but by the third year, the effect was either negative or neutral. Unlike cover reduction, fertilization had no observable effect on seedling recruitment or occurrence (number of plots) of invading resident or nonresident species. The results of our experiment demonstrate that, although resource fluctuations can increase the invasibility of this grassland, the community response depends on the nature of the resource change.

AB Animals must allocate finite resources amongst competing demands. A suite of such trade-offs is thought to occur in the deployment of carotenoids, being widely responsible for sexual coloration and also important in antioxidant and immune defences. Experimental manipulation of dietary carotenoid availability is a useful approach for elucidating the mechanistic bases of carotenoid allocation trade-offs. Recent work using birds has shown that both sexual display and immune defences can be limited by carotenoid availability, providing support for the hypothesis that males allocating greater amounts of carotenoids to sexual coloration are advertising their superior health. Carotenoid availability has also been shown to limit egg-laying capacity in birds, although it remains to be seen whether carotenoid display in females advertises reproductive potential. More experiments are required to ascertain the importance of direct (material) and indirect (genetic) benefits accruing through choosing to mate with individuals that have greater carotenoid display. paired right arrows 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Four independent studies of conifer growth between 1880 and 2002 in upper elevation forests of the central Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.A., showed correlated multidecadal and century-long responses associated with climate. Using tree-ring and ecological plot analysis, we studied annual branch growth of krummholz Pinus albicaulis; invasion by P. albicaulis and Pinus monticola into formerly persistent snowfields; dates of vertical branch emergence in krummholz P. albicaulis; and invasion by Pinus contorta into subalpine meadows. Mean annual branch growth at six treeline sites increased significantly over the 20th century (range 130-400%), with significant accelerations in rate from 1920 to 1945 and after 1980. Growth stabilized from 1945 to 1980. Similarly, invasion of six snowfield slopes began in the early 1900s and continued into snowfield centers throughout the 20th century, with significantly accelerated mean invasion from 1925 to 1940 and after 1980. Rate of snowfield invasion decreased between 1950 and 1975. Meadow invasion and vertical leader emergence showed synchronous, episodic responses. Pinus contorta invaded each of ten subalpine meadows in a distinct multidecadal pulse between 1945 and 1976 (87% of all trees) and vertical release in five krummholz P. albicaulis sites also occurred in one pulse between 1945 and 1976 (86% of all branches). These synchronies and lack of effect of local environments implicate regional climate control. Composite weather records indicated significant century-long increases in minimum monthly temperature and multidecadal variability in minimum temperature and precipitation. All ecological responses were significantly correlated with minimum temperature. Significant interactions among temperature, precipitation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices, and multiyear variability in moisture availability further explained episodic ecological responses. Four multidecadal periods of the 20th century that are defined by ecological response (< 1925; 1925-1944; 1945-1976; > 1976) correlate with positive and negative PDO phases, as well as with steps in the rate of temperature increase. These diverse factors in spatially distributed upper-montane and treeline ecosystems respond directionally to century-long climate trends, and also exhibit abrupt and reversible effects as a consequence of interdecadal climate variability and complex interactions of temperature and moisture.

AB The genetic variation within and between wild apple samples (Malus sylvestris ) and cultivated apple trees was investigated with amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and microsatellite markers to develop a conservation genetics programme for the endangered wild apple in Belgium. In total, 76 putative wild apples (originating from Belgium and Germany), six presumed hybrids and 39 cultivars were typed at 12 simple sequence repeats (SSR) and 139 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. Principal co-ordinate analysis and a model-based clustering method classified the apples into three major gene pools: wild Malus sylvestris genotypes, edible cultivars and ornamental cultivars. All presumed hybrids and two individuals (one Belgian, one German) sampled as M. sylvestris were assigned completely to the edible cultivar gene pool, revealing that cultivated genotypes are present in the wild. However, gene flow between wild and cultivated gene pools is shown to be almost absent, with only three genotypes that showed evidence of admixture between the wild and edible cultivar gene pools. Wild apples sampled in Belgium and Germany constitute gene pools that are clearly differentiated from cultivars and although some geographical pattern of genetic differentiation among wild apple populations exists, most variation is concentrated within samples. Concordant conclusions were obtained from AFLP and SSR markers, which showed highly significant correlations in both among-genotypes and among-samples genetic distances.

AB Recent ecological studies suggest that the landscape context of native habitat remnants may significantly influence plant and animal abundance and distribution within those remnants. Other research has revealed a weak link between landscape context and native community composition. To understand the relative importance of local and regional habitat characteristics for grassland butterflies, we assessed butterfly community diversity in four types of grassland habitats surrounded by varying amounts of urban development near Boulder, Colorado ( U.S.A.). We recorded butterfly species abundance and composition in 66 grassland study plots on five sampling dates in 1999 and 2000. Grasslands were of four types: native shortgrass, native mixed grass, native tallgrass, and planted hayfields. Grasslands also varied in quality, determined by the abundance of native versus exotic plant species. We observed highly significant effects of grassland type on butterfly species richness and composition. For example, tallgrass plots supported significantly higher butterfly species richness than shortgrass plots ( p < 0.01). Habitat quality also affected butterfly species richness and composition. Low-quality plots generally supported fewer species than moderate- or high-quality plots ( p < 0.05). Landscape context-the percentage of urbanization in the surrounding landscape-did not significantly predict butterfly species richness or composition. Our observations suggest that for the grassland butterfly communities in our study, (1) grassland type was the primary determinant of species richness and composition, (2) habitat quality secondarily affected butterfly community diversity, and (3) landscape context did not significantly predict butterfly species composition. Our findings emphasize the importance of maintaining high-quality grassland habitat to protect native butterfly diversity.

AB In this study, we investigate the relative role of historical factors and evolutionary forces in promoting population differentiation in a new case of sympatric dwarf and normal ecotypes of the rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax Mitchill) in Lac Saint-Jean (Quebec, Canada). Our first objective was to test the hypothesis that the evolution of sympatric smelt ecotypes in Lac Saint-Jean has been contingent upon the secondary contact between two evolutionary lineages in postglacial times. Secondly, the Q(ST) method was applied to test the null hypothesis that the extent of phenotypic differences relative to that of neutral marker variation would be similar in comparisons involving populations within and among ecotypes. Thirdly, we applied a quantitative-genetic method as an exploratory assessment as to whether the amount of gene flow observed between populations could affect divergence in adaptive traits under specific conditions. This study revealed a unique situation of dwarf and normal smelt ecotypes that are, respectively, characterized by selmiparous and iteroparous life histories and the occurrence in each of two genetically distinct populations that synchronously use the same spawning habitat in two tributaries. Historical contingency has apparently played little role in the origin of these populations. In contrast, an important role of divergent natural selection in driving their phenotypic divergence was suggested. While divergent selection has apparently been strong enough to maintain phenotypic differentiation in the face of migration, this study suggests that gene flow has been sufficiently important to modulate the extent of adaptive differentiation being achieved between ecotypes, unless the extent of stabilizing selection acting on smelt ecotypes is much more pronounced than usually reported in natural populations.

AB An emerging body of literature suggests that the richness of native and naturalized plant species are often positively correlated. It is unclear, however, whether this relationship is robust across spatial scales, and how a disturbance regime may affect it. Here, I examine the relationships of both richness and abundance between native and naturalized species of plants in two mediterranean scrub communities: coastal sage scrub (CSS) in California and xeric-sloped matorral (XSM) in Chile. In each vegetation type I surveyed multiple sites, where I identified vascular plant species and estimated their relative cover. Herbaceous species richness was higher in XSM, while cover of woody species was higher in CSS, where woody species have a strong impact upon herbaceous species. As there were few naturalized species with a woody growth form, the analyses performed here relate primarily to herbaceous species. Relationships between the herbaceous cover of native and naturalized species were not significant in CSS, but were nearly significant in XSM. The herbaceous species richness of native and naturalized plants were not significantly correlated on sites that had burned less than one year prior to sampling in CSS, and too few sites were available to examine this relationship in XSM. In post 1-year burn sites, however, herbaceous richness of native and naturalized species were positively correlated in both CSS and XSM. This relationship occurred at all spatial scales, from 400 m(2) to 1 m(2) plots. The consistency of this relationship in this study, together with its reported occurrence in the literature, suggests that this relationship may be general. Finally, the residuals from the correlations between native and naturalized species richness and cover, when plotted against site age (i.e. time since the last fire), show that richness and cover of naturalized species are strongly favoured on recently burned sites in XSM; this suggests that herbaceous species native to Chile are relatively poorly adapted to fire.

AB A previous investigation on fish-farm biodeposition effects on benthos, carried out in the Gaeta Gulf (northwestern Mediterranean Sea), revealed a strong impact on meiofaunal assemblages. This study implements these findings by examining in detail the nematode assemblage and its response to organic enrichment from the start of a fish farm activity to the conclusion of the fish rearing cycle. Density, community structure and individual size were utilised for univariate (genus, trophic diversity and abundance patterns) and multivariate analyses (MDS) in order to identify the best descriptors of impact and the response of the nematode assemblages. Nematodes displayed significantly reduced densities, diversity and richness in sediments beneath fish farms. The impact of biodeposition was evident not only from structural community parameters but also in terms of functional indices. Forty-five days after starting fish farming, an increase of the nematode individual biomass was observed. MDS ordination pointed out the presence of two different nematode communities in disturbed sediments and in the control site. These results were substantiated by the analysis of the temporal changes of k-dominance curves, the maturity index and, to a lesser extent, by the index of trophic diversity. Some nematode genera were highly sensitive to biodeposition (Setosabatieria, Latronema and Elzalia) and disappeared almost completely in farm sediments, whereas other genera largely increased their dominance (Sabatieria, Dorylaimopsis and Oxystomina). This study indicates that nematodes are very sensitive to this kind of environmental disturbance. The use of simple tools, such as the k-dominance analysis and maturity index, are recommended for monitoring of aquaculture impact. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Methods to assess the physical habitat available to aquatic organisms provide important tools for many aspects of river management, including river health monitoring, determination of river restoration/rehabilitation strategies, setting and evaluating environmental flows and as surrogates for biodiversity assessment.
   2. Procedures used to assess physical habitat need to be ecologically and geomorphologically meaningful, as well as practicable. A conceptual methodological procedure is presented that evaluates and links instream habitat and geomorphology.
   3. The heterogeneity of habitat potential is determined within geomorphic units (such as pools, runs, riffles) by assessing flow hydraulics and substrate character. These two variables are integrated as hydraulic units - patches of uniform flow and substrate.
   4. This methodology forms a logical extension of the River Styles framework that characterizes river form and behaviour at four inter-related scales: catchments, landscape units, River Styles (reaches) and geomorphic units. As geomorphic units constitute the basis to assess aquatic habitat availability, and they form the building blocks of river and floodplain systems, intact reaches of a particular River Style should have similar assemblages of instream and floodplain habitat.
   5. An application of the hydraulic unit procedure is demonstrated in gorge, partly-confined and alluvial River Styles front the Manning catchment in northern New South Wales, Australia. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB 1. Large-scale habitat use of eight species of breeding birds was considered using data collected across Britain. The species were skylark Alauda arvensis (L.), dunnock Prunella modularis (L.), blackbird Turdus merula (L.), song thrush Turdus philomelos (L.), starling Sturnus vulgaris (L.), linnet Carduelis cannabina (L.), bullfinch Pyrrhula Pyrrhula (L.) and reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus (L.). All are linked by roughly synchronous population declines over the last 25 years in southern Britain land mostly in farmland landscapes). Discussion is limited to the conservation status of these species.
   2, Breeding densities were estimated for broad habitat types and these were used to estimate population sizes within habitat types. Confidence limits on the estimates were derived using a bootstrap procedure.
   3. For most species considered, farmland holds a high proportion of their population tin excess of 50% for four species), reflecting the predominance of this land use across Britain. This suggests that sympathetic changes in farming practices are likely to provide the best mechanism for improving the status of these species.
   4. Substantial proportions of particular species occur outside farmland, but different species occur in different habitats. A considerable proportion of skylarks occur on upland moor, bullfinches in wooded habitats, and reed buntings in riparian habitats. Conservation of this group of species thus requires appropriate management of the wider countryside, including their main habitats.
   5, Habitats associated with human habitation hold > 20% of the British populations of blackbird, song thrush and starling, and considerable numbers of other species. The management of parks, gardens and other 'green space' may have an important impact on their populations and should not be neglected by conservationists.

ID CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS
AB A modem pollen/land-use data-set of 124 surface samples (moss polsters) from different vegetation and land-use types in south Sweden is presented. The samples are from non-fertilized grazed areas, burned and grazed heaths, traditionally managed fodder-producing meadows and cultivated fields, and deciduous forests. Twenty nine environmental (e.g. management type, soil chemistry) variables are available for the 124 samples. Patterns of modern local pollen variation in relation to these environmental variables are explored by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and tested by associated statistical procedures. The modem data-set is used to aid interpretation of extra-local pollen sequences from two small lakes and one mire in south Sweden, using CCA as a means of comparing modem and fossil spectra. The resulting land-use reconstructions are compared to earlier interpretations of the same pollen-stratigraphical data using the more traditional ''indicator-species'' approach. Emphasis is placed on the history of mowing and grazing in south Sweden as an example of the potential uses of the comparative approach for interpretating fossil pollen data in terms of past land-use.

AB We developed a bioenergetics model for steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss that simulates growth and consumption by separate life history forms in Lakes Michigan and Ontario. We estimated abundances of hatchery and wild smolts during 1975-1990 for both lakes based on stocking rates, survival schedules, and discrimination of the proportion of the lake population that was naturally recruited. Recruitment of wild steelhead varied as a function of presmolt winter severity in both lakes. Wild smolts accounted for 6-44% (during 1982-1989) and 18-33% (during 1978-1985) of total annual smolt production in Lakes Michigan and Ontario, respectively. We developed an age-structured population model with separate accounting for run timing (summer, fall, and spring) using the proportions of life history stages observed at weirs and estimated adult survival rates. We summarized data on growth, diet, water temperature, and energy contents of predator and prey to model lakewide prey consumption in both lakes during 1975-1990. Lakewide prey consumption by steelhead amounted to 9,500 tonnes . year-1 in 1987 in Lake Michigan and 2,200 tonnes . year-1 in 1990 in Lake Ontario. Because of their limited dietary reliance on alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax and relatively low stocking density compared with other salmonines, steelhead consumed only 4% of available alewife production and 2% of total smelt production in 1987 in Lake Michigan. Although estimates of alewife production in Lake Ontario are presently unavailable, measures of alewife biomass in 1990 in Lake Ontario indicate that steelhead probably had a negligible effect on these prey fish. Steelhead consumed 2% of total rainbow smelt production in Lake Ontario in 1990. Population biomass conversion efficiency (16.1%) and production-to-biomass ratio (mean, 1.18) for Lake Michigan steelhead are low compared with those of sympatric Oncorhynchus species. Sensitivity analysis of the population submodel indicated that the most sensitive parameters were lake survival and size at stocking.

AB Biological traits offer valuable approaches to understand species distributions and underlying mechanisms. Their use has received a growing interest in marine community ecology, for both fundamental and applied purposes. The need of ecological indicators as part of marine directives and conservation programmes has promoted the use of multiple traits for indicator development, but in a questionable context regarding the state of fundamental developments. Biological Trait Analysis (BTA) is a complex research field, characterised by flexible concepts and applications. In order to enhance the development of relevant marine ecological indicators, this review provides baselines for better theoretical and applied BTA. A compilation of the existing literature reveals that specific topics have dominated the use of multiple traits in marine ecology unlike in freshwater and terrestrial ecology where tests of theories and uses of evolutionary concepts consistently preceded BTA applications. Availability of data sets and analytical techniques seemed to have driven the growing use of marine BTA rather than fundamental questions regarding life history theories in marine ecosystem components and the functional nature of traits. It is therefore suggested that greater focus on life history ecology and on the links between marine species traits and ecosystem functioning are still needed to support trait-based indicator development. Life history strategy understanding is put forward as a theoretically-sound basis and fundamental pre-requisite for trait-based marine indicator development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The first goal of this paper was to overview modern approaches to local adaptation, with a focus on the use of population genomics data to detect signals of natural selection in fishes. Several mechanisms are discussed that may enhance the maintenance of genetic variation and evolutionary potential, which have been overlooked and should be considered in future theoretical development and predictive models: the prevalence of soft sweeps, polygenic basis of adaptation, balancing selection and transient polymorphisms, parallel evolution, as well as epigenetic variation. Research on fish population genomics has provided ample evidence for local adaptation at the genome level. Pervasive adaptive evolution, however, seems to almost never involve the fixation of beneficial alleles. Instead, adaptation apparently proceeds most commonly by soft sweeps entailing shifts in frequencies of alleles being shared between differentially adapted populations. One obvious factor contributing to the maintenance of standing genetic variation in the face of selective pressures is that adaptive phenotypic traits are most often highly polygenic, and consequently the response to selection should derive mostly from allelic co-variances among causative loci rather than pronounced allele frequency changes. Balancing selection in its various forms may also play an important role in maintaining adaptive genetic variation and the evolutionary potential of species to cope with environmental change. A large body of literature on fishes also shows that repeated evolution of adaptive phenotypes is a ubiquitous evolutionary phenomenon that seems to occur most often via different genetic solutions, further adding to the potential options of species to cope with a changing environment. Moreover, a paradox is emerging from recent fish studies whereby populations of highly reduced effective population sizes and impoverished genetic diversity can apparently retain their adaptive potential in some circumstances. Although more empirical support is needed, several recent studies suggest that epigenetic variation could account for this apparent paradox. Therefore, epigenetic variation should be fully integrated with considerations pertaining to role of soft sweeps, polygenic and balancing selection, as well as repeated adaptation involving different genetic basis towards improving models predicting the evolutionary potential of species to cope with a changing world.

AB Attempts at explaining range limits of temperate tree species still rest on correlations with climatic data that lack a physiological justification. Here, we present a synthesis of a multidisciplinary project that offers mechanistic explanations. Employing climatology, biogeography, dendrology, population and reproduction biology, stress physiology and phenology, we combine results from insitu elevational (Swiss Alps) and latitudinal (Alps vs. Scandinavia) comparisons, from reciprocal common garden and phytotron studies for eight European broadleaf tree species. We show that unlike for low-stature plants, tree canopy temperatures can be predicted from weather station data, and that low-temperature extremes in winter do not explain range limits. At the current low-temperature range limit, all species recruit well. Transplants revealed that the local environment rather than elevation of seed origin dominates growth and phenology. Tree ring width at the range limit is not related to season length, but to growing season temperature, with no evidence of carbon shortage. Bud break and leaf emergence in adults trees are timed in such a way that the probability of freezing damage is almost zero, with a uniform safety margin across elevations and taxa. More freezing-resistant species flush earlier than less resistant species.Synthesis: we conclude that the range limits of the examined tree species are set by the interactive influence of freezing resistance in spring, phenology settings, and the time required to mature tissue. Microevolution of spring phenology compromises between demands set by freezing resistance of young, immature tissue and season length requirements related to autumnal tissue maturation.

AB Aim
   We examined (1) the relationships between aboveground tropical forest C storage, biodiversity and environmental drivers and (2) how these relationships inform theory concerning ecosystem function and biodiversity. Experiments have shown that there is a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but intense debate exists on the underlying mechanisms. While some argue that mechanisms such as niche complementarity increase ecosystem function, others argue that these relationships are a selection effect.
   Location
   Eleven tropical forests in the Americas, Africa and Asia.
   Methods
   We analysed the correlates of biodiversity and carbon storage in tropical forests using data from 59 1-ha tree plots from a standardized global tropical forest biodiversity-monitoring network. We examined taxonomic and functional diversity, aboveground C storage and environmental variables in order to determine the relationships between biodiversity and carbon storage in natural (non-plantation) tropical forests.
   Results
   We found that aboveground C storage in tropical forests increased with both taxonomic diversity and functional dominance, specifically the dominance of genera with large maximum diameters, after potential environmental drivers were accounted for (final model R-2 = 0.38, P < 0.001).
   Main conclusions
   Our results suggest that niche complementarity and the selection effect are not mutually exclusive: they both play a role in structuring tropical forests. While previous studies have documented relationships between diversity and C storage, these have largely been conducted on small scales in biomes that are relatively species poor compared with tropical forests (e.g. grasslands and temperate or boreal forests). Our results demonstrate that these positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are also present in hyperdiverse systems on spatial scales relevant to conservation and management. This insight can be used to inform the conservation and management of tropical forests, which play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and are some of the biologically richest ecosystems on the planet.

Understanding the causes of variability is important for models that use these data to drive land surface fluxes or for benchmarking prognostic vegetation models. Here we evaluated the interannual variability in the new 30.5-year long global satellite-derived surface reflectance index data, Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies normalized difference vegetation index (GIMMS NDVI3g). Pearson's correlation and multiple linear stepwise regression analyses were applied to quantify the NDVI interannual variability driven by climate anomalies, and to evaluate the effects of potential interference (snow, aerosols and clouds) on the NDVI signal. We found ecologically plausible strong controls on NDVI variability by antecedent precipitation and current monthly temperature with distinct spatial patterns. Precipitation correlations were strongest for temperate to tropical water limited herbaceous systems where in some regions and seasons > 40% of the NDVI variance could be explained by precipitation anomalies. Temperature correlations were strongest in northern mid- to high-latitudes in the spring and early summer where up to 70% of the NDVI variance was explained by temperature anomalies. We find that, in western and central North America, winter-spring precipitation determines early summer growth while more recent precipitation controls NDVI variability in late summer. In contrast, current or prior wet season precipitation anomalies were correlated with all months of NDVI in sub-tropical herbaceous vegetation. Snow, aerosols and clouds as well as unexplained phenomena still account for part of the NDVI variance despite corrections. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that GIMMS NDVI3g represents real responses of vegetation to climate variability that are useful for global models.

AB Several measures of multiple site dissimilarity have been proposed to quantify the overall heterogeneity in assemblage composition among any number of sites. It is also a common practice to quantify such overall heterogeneity by averaging pairwise dissimilarities between all pairs of sites in the pool. However, pairwise dissimilarities do not account for patterns of co-occurrence among more than two sites. In consequence, the average of pairwise dissimilarities may not accurately reflect the overall compositional heterogeneity within a pool of more than two sites. Here I use several idealized examples to illustrate why pairwise dissimilarity measures fail to properly quantify overall heterogeneity. Thereafter, the effect of this potential problem in empirical patterns is exemplified with data of world amphibians. In conclusion, when the attribute of interest is the overall heterogeneity in a pool of sites (i.e. beta diversity) or its turnover or nestedness components, only multiple site dissimilarity measures are recommended.

AB Aim: To describe gut colonization in preterm infants using standard culture and 16S gene rRNA profiling, exploring differences in healthy infants and those who developed NEC/late onset sepsis (LOS). Methods: Ninety-nine stools from 38 infants of median 27-week gestation were cultured; 44 stools from 27 infants had their microbial profiles determined by 16S. Ordination analyses explored effects of patient variables on gut communities. Results: Standard microbiological culture identified a mean of two organisms (range 07), DGGE 12 (range 318) per patient. Enterococcus faecalis and coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS) were most common by culture (40% and 39% of specimens). Meconium was not sterile. No fungi were cultured. Bacterial community structures in infants with NEC and LOS differed from healthy infants. Infants who developed NEC carried more CONS (45% vs 30%) and less Enterococcus faecalis (31% vs 57%). 16S identified Enterobacter and Staphylococcus presence associated with NEC/LOS, respectively. Conclusions: Important differences were found in the gut microbiota of preterm infants who develop NEC/LOS. The relationship of these changes to current practices in neonatal intensive care requires further exploration.

AB Verrucomicrobia is a bacterial phylum that is commonly detected in soil, but little is known about the distribution and diversity of this phylum in the marine environment. To address this, we analyzed the marine microbial community composition in 506 samples from the International Census of Marine Microbes as well as 11 coastal samples taken from the California Current. These samples from both the water column and sediments covered a wide range of environmental conditions. Verrucomicrobia were present in 98% of the analyzed samples, and thus appeared nearly ubiquitous in the ocean. Based on the occurrence of amplified 16S ribosomal RNA sequences, Verrucomicrobia constituted on average 2% of the water column and 1.4% of the sediment bacterial communities. The diversity of Verrucomicrobia displayed a biogeography at multiple taxonomic levels and thus, specific lineages appeared to have clear habitat preference. We found that subdivision 1 and 4 generally dominated marine bacterial communities, whereas subdivision 2 was more frequent in low salinity waters. Within the subdivisions, Verrucomicrobia community composition were significantly different in the water column compared with sediment as well as within the water column along gradients of salinity, temperature, nitrate, depth and overall water column depth. Although we still know little about the ecophysiology of Verrucomicrobia lineages, the ubiquity of this phylum suggests that it may be important for the biogeochemical cycle of carbon in the ocean.

AB Although nitrogen (N) availability is a major determinant of ecosystem properties, little is known about the ecological importance of plants' preference for ammonium versus nitrate (beta) for ecosystem functioning and the structure of communities. We modeled this preference for two contrasting ecosystems and showed that beta significantly affects ecosystem properties such as biomass, productivity, and N losses. A particular intermediate value of beta maximizes the primary productivity and minimizes mineral N losses. In addition, contrasting beta values between two plant types allow their coexistence, and the ability of one type to control nitrification modifies the patterns of coexistence with the other. We also show that species replacement dynamics do not lead to the minimization of the total mineral N pool nor the maximization of plant productivity, and consequently do not respect Tilman's R* rule. Our results strongly suggest in the two contrasted ecosystems that beta has important consequences for ecosystem functioning and plant community structure.

AB During their domestication, maize, bean and squash evolved in polycultures grown by small-scale farmers in the Americas. Polycultures often overyield on low-fertility soils, which are a primary production constraint in low-input agriculture. We hypothesized that root architectural differences among these crops causes niche complementarity and thereby greater nutrient acquisition than corresponding monocultures.
   A functionalstructural plant model, SimRoot, was used to simulate the first 40 d of growth of these crops in monoculture and polyculture and to determine the effects of root competition on nutrient uptake and biomass production of each plant on low-nitrogen, -phosphorus and -potassium soils.
   Squash, the earliest domesticated crop, was most sensitive to low soil fertility, while bean, the most recently domesticated crop, was least sensitive to low soil fertility. Nitrate uptake and biomass production were up to 7 greater in the polycultures than in the monocultures, but only when root architecture was taken into account. Enhanced nitrogen capture in polycultures was independent of nitrogen fixation by bean. Root competition had negligible effects on phosphorus or potassium uptake or biomass production.
   We conclude that spatial niche differentiation caused by differences in root architecture allows polycultures to overyield when plants are competing for mobile soil resources. However, direct competition for immobile resources might be negligible in agricultural systems. Interspecies root spacing may also be too large to allow maize to benefit from root exudates of bean or squash. Above-ground competition for light, however, may have strong feedbacks on root foraging for immobile nutrients, which may increase cereal growth more than it will decrease the growth of the other crops. We note that the order of domestication of crops correlates with increasing nutrient efficiency, rather than production potential.

   PATTERNS
AB Background: The rising global temperature is predicted to expand the distribution of vector-borne diseases both in latitude and altitude. Many host communities could be affected by increased prevalence of disease, heightening the risk of extinction for many already threatened species. To understand how host communities could be affected by changing parasite distributions, we need information on the distribution of parasites in relation to variables like temperature and rainfall that are predicted to be affected by climate change.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We determined relations between prevalence of blood parasites, temperature, and seasonal rainfall in a bird community of the Australian Wet Tropics along an elevation gradient. We used PCR screening to investigate the prevalence and lineage diversity of four genera of blood parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma) in 403 birds. The overall prevalence of the four genera of blood parasites was 32.3%, with Haemoproteus the predominant genus. A total of 48 unique lineages were detected. Independent of elevation, parasite prevalence was positively and strongly associated with annual temperature. Parasite prevalence was elevated during the dry season.
   Conclusions/Significance: Low temperatures of the higher elevations can help to reduce both the development of avian haematozoa and the abundance of parasite vectors, and hence parasite prevalence. In contrast, high temperatures of the lowland areas provide an excellent environment for the development and transmission of haematozoa. We showed that rising temperatures are likely to lead to increased prevalence of parasites in birds, and may force shifts of bird distribution to higher elevations. We found that upland tropical areas are currently a low-disease habitat and their conservation should be given high priority in management plans under climate change.

AB 1. Compensatory growth and catch-up growth are often used interchangeably to describe the faster than optimal growth that occurs following a period of dietary restriction in the development of many animals. Concerns about the statistical analysis of these studies have drawn attention to the risk of false detection in reports of compensatory and catch-up growth.
   2. This study aims to quantify the degree to which these compensatory responses occur across the animal kingdom. In addition, this study distinguishes the two terms, 'compensatory growth' and 'catch-up growth', to clarify the fitness consequences of rapid growth. Compensatory growth refers to a faster than usual growth rate, while catch-up growth implies attainment of control size.
   3. Eight meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted on data extracted from 88 papers, including 11 taxonomic classes. The results confirmed that both growth tactics (i.e. compensatory and catch-up growth) occur across a wide range of taxa and result in decreased direct fitness components.
   4. Importantly, the meta-analytic methods used made it possible to identify the specific experimental techniques that most successfully promoted rapid growth after restriction and key differences in the responses of the four major groups (mammals, birds, fish and arthropods) to dietary restriction. Endotherms are more likely to show a compensatory growth response because of their determinate growth; in contrast, the indeterminate and saltatory growth tactics of fish and arthropods reduce the pressure to rapidly achieve a large size.
   5. Among the first meta-analyses to be conducted in this field, this study provides valuable support for the premises of compensatory and catch-up growth and also discusses weaknesses in experimental design, and possible solutions, in compensatory growth research. For example, we recommend conducting the experiment within the most linear phase of an animal's growth to avoid analytical complications arising from size-dependent growth, and our results indicate that dietary dilution more closely resembles quantitative restriction than clutch size and intermittent feeding restriction methods when normal quantitative restriction is not possible.

AB Stable isotope natural abundance measurements integrate across several biogeochemical processes in ecosystem N and C dynamics. Here, we report trends in natural isotope abundance (delta C-13 and delta N-15 in plant and soil) along a climosequence of 33 Nothofagus forest stands located within Patagonia, Southern Argentina. We measured 28 different abiotic variables (both climatic variables and soil properties) to characterize environmental conditions at each of the 33 sites. Foliar delta C-13 values ranged from -35.4 parts per thousand to -27.7 parts per thousand, and correlated positively with foliar delta N-15 values, ranging from -3.7 parts per thousand to 5.2 parts per thousand. Soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 values reflected the isotopic trends of the foliar tissues and ranged from -29.8 parts per thousand to -25.3 parts per thousand, and -4.8 parts per thousand to 6.4 parts per thousand, respectively, with no significant differences between Nothofagus species (Nothofagus pumilio, Nothofagus antarctica, Nothofagus betuloides). Principal component analysis and multiple regressions suggested that mainly water availability variables (mean annual precipitation), but not soil properties, explained between 42% and 79% of the variations in foliar and soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 natural abundance, which declined with increased moisture supply. We conclude that a decline in water use efficiency at wetter sites promotes both the depletion of heavy C and N isotopes in soil and plant biomass. Soil delta C-13 values were higher than those of the plant tissues and this difference increased as annual precipitation increased. No such differences were apparent when delta N-15 values in soil and plant were compared, which indicates that climatic differences contributed more to the overall C balance than to the overall N balance in these forest ecosystems.

AB Conservation and enhancement of ecological connectivity is widely recognized as one of the key objectives of forest landscape management. However, practical difficulties still exist due to the lack of pragmatic and operational methodologies that can be efficiently applied for these purposes within the scope of a forest management plan. Here we present the novel integration of two recent approaches for analyzing forest structural connectivity that offers considerable synergies and potential relevant benefits for forest planning at a variety of scales. We combine the morphological analysis of forest spatial patterns with recent indices for the analysis of landscape network connectivity based on the concept of measuring habitat availability (reachability) at the landscape scale. The combination of these approaches in a single integrated workflow embraces from (1) the diagnosis and characterization at the pixel level of the forest spatial patterns and their individual constituents, which are mainly the core habitat areas and the structural connectors (bridges) between them, to (2) the assessment of their individual importance to uphold ecological fluxes as irreplaceable providers of structural connectivity. We present and show different analytical possibilities within the integrated workflow from where the manager can choose depending on the planning targets and on the characteristics of the ecological processes of interest. We illustrate the application of the combined approach in two forested areas in Central Spain with different scales and management contexts, in which the structural connectivity between forest habitat areas needs to be sustained. Our assessment was able to discriminate and highlight a concise subset of cores and bridges that concentrated most of the contribution to the overall connectivity and functioning of the forest habitat network. This provides clear guidelines on where the conservation management efforts should be targeted, allowing for many alternative areas where the rest of the management objectives and activities can be accommodated as required by the multifunctionality of forest resources. The proposed integrated approach can equally serve to identify (a) those forest areas that play a crucial role to sustain ecological fluxes that are to be promoted by management, such as the dispersal of native biota or (b) those sites where the spread of wildfires or invasive species can be halted more effectively. The potential of the proposed methodology to inform and guide forestry decisions is reinforced by the availability of the required analytical tools (Guidos and Conefor Sensinode) as freeware software packages.

AB Although there has been considerable research on the impacts of individual changes in water temperature, carbonate chemistry, and other variables on species, cumulative impacts of these effects have rarely been studied. Here, we simulate changes in (i) primary productivity, (ii) species range shifts, (iii) zooplankton community size structure, (iv) ocean acidification, and (v) ocean deoxygenation both individually and together using five Ecopath with Ecosim models of the northeast Pacific Ocean. We used a standardized method to represent climate effects that relied on time-series forcing functions: annual multipliers of species productivity. We focused on changes in fisheries landings, biomass, and ecosystem characteristics (diversity and trophic indices). Fisheries landings generally declined in response to cumulative effects and often to a greater degree than would have been predicted based on individual climate effects, indicating possible synergies. Total biomass of fished and unfished functional groups displayed a decline, though unfished groups were affected less negatively. Some functional groups (e.g. pelagic and demersal invertebrates) were predicted to respond favourably under cumulative effects in some regions. The challenge of predicting climate change impacts must be met if we are to adapt and manage rapidly changing marine ecosystems in the 21st century.

AB Studies of facilitative interactions as drivers of plant richness along environmental gradients often assume the existence of an overarching stress gradient that equally affects the performance of all the species in a given community. However, co-existing species differ in their ecophysiological adaptations, and do not experience the same stress level under particular environmental conditions. Moreover, these studies assume a unimodal relationship between richness and biomass, which is not as general as previously thought. We ignored these assumptions to assess changes in plant-plant interactions and their effect on local species richness across environmental gradients in semi-arid areas of Spain and Australia. We aimed to understand the relative importance of direct (microhabitat amelioration) and indirect (changes in the competitive relationships among the understorey species: niche segregation, competitive exclusion or intransitivity) mechanisms that might underlie the effects of nurse plants on local species richness. By jointly studying these direct and indirect mechanisms using a unifying framework, we found that nurse plants (trees, shrubs and tussock grasses) increased local richness not only by expanding the niche of neighbouring species but also by increasing niche segregation among them, though the latter was not important in all cases. The outcome of the competition-facilitation continuum varied depending on the study area, likely because the different types of stress gradient considered. When driven by both rainfall and temperature, or rainfall alone, the community-wide importance of nurse plants remained constant (Spanish sites), or showed a unimodal relationship along the gradient (Australian sites). This study expands our understanding of the relative roles of plant-plant interactions and environmental conditions as drivers of local species richness in semi-arid environments. The results can also be used to refine predictions about the response of plant communities to environmental change, and to clarify the relative importance of biotic interactions as drivers of such responses.

AB P>Organic farming aims to be wildlife-friendly, but it may not benefit wildlife overall if much greater areas are needed to produce a given quantity of food. We measured the density and species richness of butterflies on organic farms, conventional farms and grassland nature reserves in 16 landscapes. Organic farms supported a higher density of butterflies than conventional farms, but a lower density than reserves. Using our data, we predict the optimal land-use strategy to maintain yield whilst maximizing butterfly abundance under different scenarios. Farming conventionally and sparing land as nature reserves is better for butterflies when the organic yield per hectare falls below 87% of conventional yield. However, if the spared land is simply extra field margins, organic farming is optimal whenever organic yields are over 35% of conventional yields. The optimal balance of land sparing and wildlife-friendly farming to maintain production and biodiversity will differ between landscapes.

AB Global change (climate change together with other worldwide anthropogenic processes such as increasing trade, air pollution and urbanization) will affect plant health at the genetic, individual, population and landscape level. Direct effects include ecosystem stress due to natural resources shortage or imbalance. Indirect effects include (i) an increased frequency of natural detrimental phenomena, (ii) an increased pressure due to already present pests and diseases, (iii) the introduction of new invasive species either as a result of an improved suitability of the climatic conditions or as a result of increased trade, and (iv) the human response to global change. In this review, we provide an overview of recent studies on terrestrial plant health in the presence of global change factors. We summarize the links between climate change and some key issues in plant health, including tree mortality, changes in wildfire regimes, biological invasions and the role of genetic diversity for ecosystem resilience. Prediction and management of global change effects are complicated by interactions between globalization, climate and invasive plants and/or pathogens. We summarize practical guidelines for landscape management and draw general conclusions from an expanding body of literature.

AB Specific leaf area (SLA) is an important plant functional trait as it is an indicator of ecophysiological characteristics like relative growth rate, stress tolerance and leaf longevity. Substantial intraspecific variation in SLA is common and usually correlates with environmental conditions. For instance, SLA decreases with increasing altitude, which is understood as adjustment to temperature. It is generally assumed that intraspecific variation is mostly the result of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, but genetic effects may also be present, due to local adaptation or genetic drift. In this study, genotypic and environmental effects on SLA were experimentally separated for the widespread Alpine bell flower Campanula thyrsoides by transplanting plants to three common gardens at contrasting altitudes (600, 1,235 and 1,850 m a.s.l.). Seeds were sampled from 18 populations in four phylogeographic regions within the European Alps. A strong plastic response was observed: SLA decreased with increasing altitude of the common gardens (22.0% of variation). The phylogeographic regions were differentiated in SLA in the common gardens (10.1% of variation), indicating that SLA is at least partly genetically determined. Plants from the six easternmost populations experienced a submediterranean climate and showed decreased SLA values in the three common gardens compared to populations to the west, which may be explained as adaptation to drought. Within these submediterranean populations, SLA decreased with altitude of origin in two out of three common gardens. Concluding, SLA shows strong phenotypic plasticity as well as substantial genetic effects, the latter probably being the result of adaptation to local conditions rather than genetic drift.

AB Spatio-temporal patterns of temperature in mountain environments are complex due to both regional synoptic-scale and landscape-scale physiographic controls in these systems. Understanding the nature and magnitude of these physiographic effects has practical and theoretical implications for the development of temperature datasets used in ecosystem assessment and climate change impact studies in regions of complex terrain. This study attempts to quantify the absolute and relative influence of landscape-scale physiographic factors in mediating regional temperatures and assess how these influences vary in time. Our approach was to decompose the variance in in situ temperature measurements into components associated with regional free-air temperature estimates and local physiographic effects. Near-surface air temperature data, collected between 1995 and 2006 from 16 meteorological stations in the Lake Tahoe region of California, USA were regressed against free-air temperature (North American Regional Reanalysis dataset) for the same period. Residuals from this fit represent spatial deviations from the regional mean and were modeled as a function of physiographic position on the landscape using variables derived from terrain analysis techniques. Linear models relating temperature residuals to physiographic variables explained roughly 10-90% of the variance in temperature residuals and had root mean squared error of 1.2-2.0 degrees C, depending upon the type of measurement and time of year. Results demonstrate that: (I) regional temperature patterns were the principle driver of surface temperatures explaining roughly 70-80% of the variance in in situ measurements; (2) the remaining variance was largely explained by spatial variability in land-scapescale physiographic variables; (3) the influence of physiographic drivers varied seasonally and was influenced by regional conditions. Periods of well-mixed atmospheric conditions lend themselves to the use of simple elevation-based lapse rate models for temperature estimation whereas other physiographic effects become more prominent during periods of enhanced atmospheric stability; and lastly (4) small differences in temperature due to landscape position, when integrated over time, can have a prominent effect on water balance and thus hydrologic and ecologic processes.

AB Phylogeographic analysis has become a major tool for investigating historical aspects of biogeography and population genetic structure. Anuran amphibians are particularly informative subjects for phylogeographic research on account of their global distribution, high degree of population genetic structure and ease of sampling. Studies on all the world's inhabited continents have demonstrated the nature and locations of refugia, including the Gulf Coast in North America and the Mediterranean peninsulas in Europe during the Pleistocene glaciations; the importance of vicariance events such as the uplift of the Andes in shaping modern distributions; and colonization routes in temperate zones during postglacial climatic amelioration. Features identified as important to amphibian biogeography, notably mountain ranges, large rivers such as the Amazon and climatic fluctuations, are common to many other taxa. New analytical methods based on coalescent, Bayesian and likelihood approaches permit more rigorous hypothesis testing than has hitherto been possible and offer the prospect of even more detailed insights into species and population history in future work.

AB 1. Whether the global high elevation tree line phenomenon is associated with a low-temperature-induced limitation of sink activities (i.e. direct impact on meristems and thus, growth) or by a limitation of the trees' carbon source activities (net photosynthesis) still awaits detailed tests across a range of taxa and regions, especially for deciduous species in a short growing season.
   2. Here, we test the sink limitation hypothesis in the highest tree lines of Eurasia at altitudes up to 4700 m. We assessed growth and tissue concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) as a measure of the carbon source-sink balance in needles and branchwood of Abies, Juniperus (evergreen), Betula and Larix (deciduous).
   3. The mean soil temperature in deep shade (a proxy for mean air temperature) across the growing season at tree line in this region is around 6.6 degrees C, which is consistent with the threshold temperature found at the natural climatic limit of the tree life-form worldwide. Mean tree height and stem diameter decreased significantly towards the upper tree line in all species studied.
   4. Air temperature measurements at an inverted tree line site (valley bottom) indicate strong and rapid oscillations between nighttime freezing and mild daytime temperatures during late winter, which apparently eradicate Abies and select for Juniperus, offering potential explanations for the inferiority of Abies also at the upper Tibetan tree line.
   5. At none of the four altitudinal transects studied did we observe a significant depletion of NSC (carbon limitation) at tree line. Instead, NSC increased in the majority of cases, suggesting direct (meristematic) low temperature constraints of growth. These results for these highest Eurasian tree lines suggest a common mechanism of alpine tree line formation for evergreen and deciduous species.

AB Biologists seek an understanding of the processes underlying spatial biodiversity patterns. Neutral theory links those patterns to dispersal, speciation and community drift. Here, we advance the spatially explicit neutral model by representing the metacommunity as a network of smaller communities. Analytic theory is presented for a set of equilibrium diversity patterns in networks of communities, facilitating the exploration of parameter space not accessible by simulation. We use this theory to evaluate how the basic properties of a metacommunity - connectivity, size, and speciation rate - determine overall metacommunity gamma-diversity, and how that is partitioned into alpha- and beta-components. We find spatial structure can increase gamma-diversity relative to a well-mixed model, even when theta is held constant. The magnitude of deviations from the well-mixed model and the partitioning into alpha- and beta-diversity is related to the ratio of migration and speciation rates. gamma-diversity scales linearly with metacommunity size even as alpha- and beta-diversity scale nonlinearly with size.

AB Over 4 years, the environmental conditions and the causal agents of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease of wheat were determined in field sites in four European countries: Hungary, Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to detect each species causing FHB and quantify its DNA (as a measurement of fungal abundance) in the samples. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine the relationship of the incidence and abundance of each species with weather variables. CCA indicated that little variability in the species prevalence data was explained by the weather variables. In contrast, a greater proportion of variability in abundance data was accounted for by the weather variables. Most samples contained two or more species and statistical analysis suggested that these species tended to coexist at field sites. CCA also indicated that there were differences in the relationships of the prevalence and abundance of the six FHB species with environmental variables. Fusarium poae was associated with relatively drier and warmer conditions, whereas F. graminearum was associated with warmer/humid conditions. F. avenaceum and F. culmorum were both associated with niches of cooler/wet/humid conditions. Two Microdochium species were associated with regions of relatively cool/moderate temperatures and frequent rainfalls of short duration. The results also suggested that environmental conditions differentially affect the infection and colonization processes, and the comparative abundance of the six species.

AB It is widely recognized that maternal phenotype can have important effects on offspring, but paternal phenotype is generally assumed to have no influence in animals lacking paternal care. Nonetheless, selection may favour the transfer of environmentally acquired condition to offspring from both parents. Using a split-brood, cross-generational laboratory design, we manipulated a key environmental determinant of condition - larval diet quality - of parents and their offspring in the fly Telostylinus angusticollis, in which there is no evidence of paternal provisioning. Parental diet did not affect offspring survival, but high-condition mothers produced larger eggs, and their offspring developed more rapidly when on a poor larval diet. Maternal condition had no effect on adult body size of offspring. By contrast, large, high-condition fathers produced larger offspring, and follow-up assays showed that this paternal effect can be sufficient to increase mating success of male offspring and fecundity of female offspring. Our findings suggest that both mothers and fathers transfer their condition to offspring, but with effects on different offspring traits. Moreover, our results suggest that paternal effects can be important even in species lacking conventional forms of paternal care. In such species, the transfer of paternal condition to offspring could contribute to indirect selection on female mate preferences.

AB In Europe, southern peninsulas served as refugia during cold periods in the Pleistocene, acting both as centres of origin of endemisms and as sources from which formerly glaciated areas were recolonized during interglacial periods. Previous studies have revealed that within the main refugial areas, intraspecific lineages often survived in allopatric refugia. We analysed two mitochondrial markers (nad4, control region, similar to 1.4 kb) in 103 individuals representing the entire distribution of Lissotriton boscai, a newt endemic to the western Iberian Peninsula. We inferred the evolutionary history of the species through phylogenetic, phylogeographic and historical demographic analyses. The results revealed unexpected, deep levels of geographically structured genetic variability. We identified two main evolutionary lineages, each containing three well-supported clades. The first historical split involved populations from central-southwestern coastal Portugal and the ancestor of all the remaining populations around 5.8 million years ago. Both lineages were subsequently fragmented into different population groups between 2.5 and 1.2 million years ago. According to nested clade analysis, at lower hierarchical levels the patterns suggest restricted gene flow with isolation by distance, whereas at higher levels the clades exhibit signatures of contiguous range expansion. Bayesian Skyline Plots show recent bottlenecks, followed by demographic expansions in all lineages. The significant genetic structure found is consistent with long-term survival of populations in allopatric refugia, supporting the 'refugia-within-refugia' scenario for southern European peninsulas. The comparison of our results with other co-distributed species highlights the generality of this hypothesis for the Iberian herpetofauna and suggests that Mediterranean refuges had more relevance for the composition and distribution of present biodiversity patterns than currently acknowledged. We briefly discuss the taxonomic and conservation implications of our results.

AB We tested the influence of population density and of drought intensity (measured as the Gaussen Index in spring and summer of the year of birth) on winter body mass, hind foot length, and body condition of roe deer fawns. Body mass decreased with increasing density and increased with increasing Gaussen Index in summer, in a similar way for both males and females. Hind foot length of males showed the same response. On the other hand, hind foot length of females decreased with increasing density only after dry summers, hence when environmental conditions were very harsh. Body condition was affected neither by density nor by drought intensity. Our results indicate that body mass and size are much better indicators of phenotypic quality than body condition in roe deer. The sex-specific responses of body size to environmental conditions could correspond to a differential allocation in favour of daughters by heavier than average roe deer mothers.

AB A new paradigm of Natural Capital and Sustainable Landscapes has been suggested. It implies the integration of economic, environmental and social-cultural qualities in a physical setting while focusing on functions in terms of goods and services for people. Due to its anthropocentric perspective it pays less attention to landscape structure and spatial arrangement compared to the widely applied patch-matrix concept. The matrix of land use elements provides the key to understanding land use systems and land use changes and it can play an important role in understanding land use pattern and their dynamics. But one of the remaining constraints for a direct application of landscape ecological concepts in practice is the lack of agreed ways to combine environmental, socio-economic and societal/cultural views. This paper examines both paradigms, asking: does the spatial arrangement of land use types add specific qualities beyond statistical measures of their existence and quantity? For instance, can a landscape be sustainable, as long as 20% of the land use is extensive, 10% is protection area, etc., no matter where the respective patches are, which typical size and shape they have, how connected patches are and how often incompatible land use types are adjacent? This paper elucidates spatial concepts for sustainable landscapes with an emphasis on the role of GIs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relationships between dispersal and local transmission rate of parasites are essential to understanding host-parasite coevolution and the emergence and spread of novel disease threats. Here we show that year-round transmission, as opposed to summer transmission, has repeatedly evolved in malarial parasites (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) of a migratory bird. Year-round transmission allows parasites to spread in sympatric host's wintering areas, and hence to colonize distantly located host's breeding areas connected by host-migration movements. Widespread parasites had higher local prevalence, revealing increased transmission, than geographically restricted parasites. Our results show a positive relationship between dispersal and local transmission of malarial parasites that is apparently mediated by frequent evolutionary changes in parasite transmission dynamics, which has important implications for the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases.

AB The observed rates and deleterious impacts of biological invasions have caused significant alarm in recent years, driving efforts to reduce the risk (establishment) of new introductions. Characterizing the supply of propagules is key to understanding invasion risk and developing effective management strategies. In coastal ecosystems, ships' ballast water is an important transfer mechanism (vector) for marine and freshwater species. Commercial ships exhibit a high degree of variation in ballast water operations that affect both the quantity and quality of propagule supply, and thereby invasion risk. The per-ship inoculation size from ballast water depends upon both the volume discharged and the organism density. Moreover, propagule quality will vary among source regions (ports) and voyage routes, due to differences in species composition and transport conditions, respectively. We show that significant differences exist in (i) the frequency and volume of ballast water discharge among vessel types, (ii) the frequency of vessel types and routes (source regions) among recipient ports, and (iii) the transit success (survivorship) of zooplankton in ballast tanks among voyage routes. Thus, propagule supply is not a simple function of total ship arrivals. For ships, as well as other vectors, variation in propagule quantity and quality must be explicitly considered to estimate invasion risk and advance predictive ability.

AB We examined the butterfly fauna at 62 sites in southeastern Sweden within a region exhibiting high variation in the landscape surrounding the studied grasslands. The landscape varied from an intensively-managed agricultural landscape with a large amount of open fields to a landscape with a high amount of deciduous forest/semi-natural grassland. We made 12 179 observations of 57 species of butterflies. The amount of neighbouring deciduous forest/semi-natural grassland, with >25% tree and bush cover, was the most important environmental factor explaining the variation in the butterfly assemblages. Landscape analyses at three different spatial scales showed that the variation in butterfly assemblages could be explained only at the largest scale (radius 5000 m) and not at the smaller ones (radii 500 and 2000 m).
   Logistic regressions were used to predict presence/absence of butterfly species. Our study indicated that there may be critical thresholds for the amount of habitat at the landscape scale for several butterfly species as well as for species richness. For Melitaea athalia, there was a sharp increase in occupancy probability between 3 and 10% deciduous forests/semi-natural grasslands at the 5000-m scale. For 12 other species, the value for 50% probability of occurrence varied between 2 and 12% deciduous forest/semi-natural grassland. Species which had high occupancy probabilities in landscapes with a low amount of surrounding deciduous forests/semi-natural grasslands were significantly more mobile than others.
   Our study highlights the importance of applying a landscape perspective in conservation management, and that single-patch management might fail in maintaining a diverse butterfly assemblage.

AB Analyzing the effect of scale on landscape pattern indices has been a key research topic in landscape ecology. The lack of comparability of fragmentation indices across spatial resolutions seriously limits their usefulness while multi-scale remotely sensed data are becoming increasingly available. In this paper, we examine the effect of spatial resolution on six common fragmentation indices that are being used within the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory. We analyse categorical data derived from simultaneously gathered Landsat-TM and IRS-WiFS satellite images, as well as TM patterns aggregated to coarser resolutions through majority rules. In general, majority rules tend to produce more fragmented patterns than actual sensor ones. It is suggested that sensor point spread function should be specifically considered to improve comparability among satellite images of varying pixel sizes. Power scaling-laws were found between spatial resolution and several fragmentation indices, with mean prediction errors under 10% for number of patches and mean patch size and under 5% for edge length. All metrics but patch cohesion indicate lower fragmentation at coarser spatial resolutions. In fact, an arbitrarily large value of patch cohesion can be obtained by resampling the pattern to smaller pixel sizes. An explanation and simple solution for correcting this undesired behaviour is provided. Landscape division and largest patch index were found to be the least sensitive indices to spatial resolution effects.

AB A key issue when generating a land cover map from remotely sensed data is the selection of the minimum mapping unit (MMU) to be employed, which determines the extent of detail contained in the map. This study analyses the effects of MMU in land cover spatial configuration and composition, by using simulated landscape thematic patterns generated by the Modified Random Clusters method. This approach allows a detailed control of the different factors influencing landscape metrics behaviour, as well as taking into account a wide range of land cover pattern possibilities.
   Land cover classes that are sparse and fragmented can be considerably misrepresented in the final map when increasing MMU, while the classes that occupy a large percentage of map area tend to become more dominant.
   Mean Patch Size and Number of Patches are very poor indicators of pattern fragmentation in this context. In contrast, Landscape Division (LD) and related indices (Splitting Index and Effective Mesh Size) are clearly suitable for comparing the fragmentation of landscape data with different MM Us.
   We suggest that the Mean Shape Index, the most sensitive to MMU of those considered in this study, should not be used in further landscape studies if land cover data with different MMU or patch size frequency distribution are to be compared. In contrast, the Area Weighted Mean Shape Index presents a very robust behaviour, which advocates the use of this index for the quantification of the overall irregularity of patch shapes in landscape spatial patterns.
   The results presented allow quantifying the biases resulting from selecting a certain MMU when generating a land cover dataset. In general, a bigger MMU implies underestimating landscape diversity and fragmentation, as well as overestimating animal population dispersal success. Guidelines are provided for the proper use and comparison of spatial pattern indices measured in maps with different MMUs.

AB I studied carabid-beetle assemblages in boreal spruce-forest stands representing early secondary succession, produced by three different logging methods, in central Finland in 1995-1998. The logging methods studied in eight separate study areas were: unlogged control stands, traditionally clear-cut stands, stands within which three 1600 m(2) openings were felled and stands of modified clear-cutting, within which three small tree groups (20-30 live standing mature trees) were retained. Pretreatment samples were collected in 1995 and the stands were logged the following winter. A three-summer follow-up study indicated the following. (1) Carabid assemblages changed with varying speed and intensity after logging. (2) Stands with small openings maintained the original assemblage structure best. Generalists were more abundant in clear-cut stands than in the stands with openings, indicating stronger assemblage-level changes in the large clear-cuts. (3) Carabid species showed varying responses to a moisture gradient, to the amount of trees removed and to the abundance of red wood ants. Some forest species with poor dispersal ability were associated with for closed and moist or mesic sites. These findings are discussed in the light of the ecological characteristics of the species and in relation to forest management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Indirect interactions are almost inevitable in any multi-species community. Understanding the implications of such interactions is a challenging task, in light of the very large number of ways species can be tied together in complex food webs. One approach to this complexity is to focus on strong interactions among a relatively small number (e.g. 3-6) of species interacting in defined configurations: community modules. In recent years, the discipline of community ecology has developed a substantial body of theory focused on such modules. Modules often clearly describe the basic features of empirical systems, particularly in simplified anthropogenic landscapes, and also help to isolate and characterize key processes driving the dynamics of more complex communities. In this chapter, we draw out a number of insights from ecological studies of modules which we believe are relevant to biological control. We emphasize in particular the module of 'shared predation', where a natural enemy attacks two or more species of prey. Theoretical studies suggest a number of 'rules of thumb', including: (i) the greatest risk to non-targets may occur from control agents that are only moderately effective on the target; (ii) targets with a high reproductive capacity can indirectly endanger non-targets; (iii) there can be transient phases of extinction risk for non-targets during the establishment phase of control agents, particularly for species with high attack rates; (iv) at a landscape scale, mobile agents can endanger the fate of non-targets at sites other than the area of control; (v) using specialist natural enemies can pose risks to non-targets, if there are generalist resident predators/ parasitoids which can exploit these introduced agents. The theoretical models help to highlight circumstances when these effects should be particularly strong.

AB Species composition and turnover that have occurred in a series of permanent sample plots established during the 1930s and 1940s in Budongo, a semi-deciduous Ugandan forest, are reported. The plots were established as part of a sequence first used to describe forest succession, five of which have been maintained and which were last measured in 1992-1993. One plot (plot 7) provides 53 y of data from old-growth pristine forest. Plot 15 was established in wooded grassland at the forest edge and is now closed high forest. Evaluation of the remaining three plots is complicated by silvicultural interventions carried out in the 1950s. Forty species have been added since the first evaluations and a total of 188 tree species (over 80% of Budongo's forest tree flora, and including two exotics) has now been recorded from within the plots. The pattern of shade-tolerance in the original plot series conforms to patterns expected for succession with an increasing proportion of shade-tolerant species with development, and large stems appearing to 'lag behind' smaller stems in this respect. The time series data are less consistent, and while plot 7 increased in the proportion of shade-tolerant stems through time, the proportion of shade-tolerant species actually declines. Stem-turnover (the mean of mortality and recruitment) slowed with implied successional stage. Most species have a higher recruitment than mortality rate and stem numbers have thus increased in all plots. This is most pronounced in the putatively 'early successional' plot. Stem size structure has changed within the plots, with an increased proportion of smaller stems. Species show different rates of turnover and these vary from plot to plot and period to period. In plot 7, the overall mortality rate decreased with initial stem size. Estimates imply that some tree species may easily live longer than 500 y after reaching 10 cm DBH, and that 1000 y is possible. The importance of large trees in determining forest dynamics is illustrated by the finding that death of only seven stems in plot 7 contributed over 60% of net basal area losses recorded over the 53-y observation period. Many of the observed patterns were not predicted and could only have been found by long-term studies.

AB The post-drainage changes in vegetation composition and carbon balance were studied on four site types (from minero- to ombrotrophic conditions) in Lakkasuo mire, central Finland, by directly comparing undrained and drained parts (30 years ago) of the mire. Drainage had drastically changed the species composition of the sites, especially at the minerotrophic sites, where almost all Sphagna had been replaced by forest mosses. On the ombrotrophic sites much of the mire vegetation still remained 30 years after drainage. Drainage had decreased the C stores in ground vegetation on the minerotrophic sites but increased them on the ombrotrophic sites. The changes were, however, very small compared to the changes in the tree stand, where the C stores had increased at all sites (increasing with nutrient level). The change in peat C balance over the 30-year post-drainage period was negative on the most nutrient-rich site, and positive on the others, increasing with lower nutrient levels. The decrease in the peat C balance on the most nutrient-rich site was compensated by the greater increase in the tree stand C stores and the changes in the total C balance (peat+tree stand+ground vegetation) remained positive on all sites.

AB Patterns of lynx Lynx lynx (Linnaeus, 1758) predation on ungulates were studied in the Polish part of Bialowieza Primeval Forest (580 km(2)) from seats and prey remains of lynx between 1985-1996, and radiotracking of 18 lynx between 1991-1996. Cervids were the main prey and constituted 90% of food biomass consumed (analysis of faeces) and 84% of prey killed. Roe deer Capreolus capreolus was positively selected by all lynx (though stronger by females and subadults than by adult males). Fawns and adult roe deer of both sexes were preyed on in proportion to their abundance in the population. Red deer Cervus elaphus was taken less often than would have been expected at random, and fawns were positively selected by lynx. On average, lynx spent 76 h (3.2 days) feeding on a killed deer (from 38 h in a female with 3 kittens to 105 h in single adult females). Mean searching time (ie time from leaving the remains of one deer to killing another one) was 52 h (2.2 days); from 10 h in a female with 3 young to 104 h in subadults. Thus, the average kill rate by lynx was one deer per 5.4 days. Predation impact of lynx population on roe and red deer was estimated in 1991-1996, when recorded numbers were 288-492 roe deer and 359-607 red deer per 100 km(2) in late winter (March), and 501-820 roe deer and 514-858 red deer per 100 km(2) in spring (May/June). During that period densities of deer declined markedly due to deliberately elevated hunting harvest by forestry personnel, aimed at reduction of game damage to silviculture. Densities of adult lynx were little variable (2.4-3.2 inds/100 km(2)), but reproduction rate strongly varied in response to deer decline, from 0.67 juv/adult lynx in 1991/92 to 0.25 juv/adult lynx in 1995/96. Annually, lynx population killed 110-169 roe deer/100 km(2), which constituted 21-36% of spring (seasonally highest) numbers of roe deer. Lynx predation was the most important factor of roe deer mortality. Furthermore, lynx population took 42-70 red deer/100 km(2) annually, which constituted 6-13% of spring number of red deer. In red deer mortality, lynx predation played an inferior role to hunting harvest and wolf predation.

AB In transect surveys during summer 1988-93 at 86 tallgrass prairies in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin USA, 80,906 butterflies of 90 species were counted. Individuals were recorded with respect to habitat, type of management (burning or haying), and number of growing seasons since last management. The effects of recent management were analyzed separately for 34 species while controlling for other factors affecting variability in abundance (geography, Fight period, weather, yearly fluctuation, vegetation quality and type, patch size, site diversity). While each butterfly species had its own individual response to fire, the prairie specialists (Oarisma poweshiek, Hesperia ottoe, H. dacotae, H. leonardus, Atrytone arogos, Speyeria idalia) showed the most negative effect front fire, which may persist for 3-5+ years. The broader the habitat adaptation, the more over-represented the species tended to be in move recently burned areas and the more under-represented in longer unburned areas. Fire also appeared to affect butterfly abundance based on the species' number of generations per year, vagility, location during fire, and response of their key plants to fire. Specialist numbers were much higher in hayed than burned prairies, while invaders and generalists did not decline markedly with haying. Habitat maintenance with haying is much more favorable for prairie-specialist butterflies than burning.

AB Fish and benthic invertebrates from 40 lakes in south-central Ontario showed significantly concordant patterns based on community structure.  Fish communities were associated significantly with lake morphological characteristics, but were uncorrelated with water chemistry.  Large, deep lakes differed from shallow lakes in their fish species, having richer faunas due to the additional cold-water species.  Centrarchid species occurred more frequently in small, shallow lakes than in larger lakes.  The invertebrate community was not correlated with lake morphology, but showed a significant association with water chemistry, principally lake pH.  A strong contrast in the abundance of Chaoborus and Holopedium existed, but it was unclear whether this was due to a predator-prey relationship or to differences in acid tolerance.  Although the lakes showed similar patterns in the composition of both communities, each community was associated with a different set of environmental factors.  Biotic processes within and between communities explain this paradox in community-environment relationships.  Such biotic interactions may involve direct processes such as fish predation on a particular invertebrate taxon or indirect factors, e.g., where fish limit the abundance of invertebrate predators, thereby limiting the impact of these invertebrate predators.

AB Mapping aboveground forest biomass is central for assessing the global carbon balance. However, current large-scale maps show strong disparities, despite good validation statistics of their underlying models. Here, we attribute this contradiction to a flaw in the validation methods, which ignore spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in data, leading to overoptimistic assessment of model predictive power. To illustrate this issue, we reproduce the approach of large-scale mapping studies using a massive forest inventory dataset of 11.8 million trees in central Africa to train and validate a random forest model based on multispectral and environmental variables. A standard nonspatial validation method suggests that the model predicts more than half of the forest biomass variation, while spatial validation methods accounting for SAC reveal quasi-null predictive power. This study underscores how a common practice in big data mapping studies shows an apparent high predictive power, even when predictors have poor relationships with the ecological variable of interest, thus possibly leading to erroneous maps and interpretations.

   neural networks; deep learning; machine learning
AB Ecologists often study wildlife populations by deploying camera traps. Large datasets are generated using this approach which can be difficult for research teams to manually evaluate. Researchers increasingly enlist volunteers from the general public as citizen scientists to help classify images. The growing number of camera trap studies, however, makes it ever more challenging to find enough volunteers to process all projects in a timely manner. Advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, allow for accurate automatic image classification. By training models using existing datasets of images classified by citizen scientists and subsequent application of such models on new studies, human effort may be reduced substantially. The goals of this study were to (a) assess the accuracy of deep learning in classifying camera trap data, (b) investigate how to process datasets with only a few classified images that are generally difficult to model, and (c) apply a trained model on a live online citizen science project. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to differentiate among images of different animal species, images of humans or vehicles, and empty images (no animals, vehicles, or humans). We used four different camera trap datasets featuring a wide variety of species, different habitats, and a varying number of images. All datasets were labelled by citizen scientists on Zooniverse. Accuracies for identifying empty images across projects ranged between 91.2% and 98.0%, whereas accuracies for identifying specific species were between 88.7% and 92.7%. Transferring information from CNNs trained on large datasets ("transfer-learning") was increasingly beneficial as the size of the training dataset decreased and raised accuracy by up to 10.3%. Removing low-confidence predictions increased model accuracies to the level of citizen scientists. By combining a trained model with classifications from citizen scientists, human effort was reduced by 43% while maintaining overall accuracy for a live experiment running on Zooniverse. Ecology researchers can significantly reduce image classification time and manual effort by combining citizen scientists and CNNs, enabling faster processing of data from large camera trap studies.

AB Terrestrial primary productivity and carbon cycle impacts of droughts are commonly quantified using vapour pressure deficit (VPD) data and remotely sensed greenness, without accounting for soil moisture. However, soil moisture limitation is known to strongly affect plant physiology.
   Here, we investigate light use efficiency, the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to absorbed light. We derive its fractional reduction due to soil moisture (fLUE), separated from VPD and greenness changes, using artificial neural networks trained on eddy covariance data, multiple soil moisture datasets and remotely sensed greenness.
   This reveals substantial impacts of soil moisture alone that reduce GPP by up to 40% at sites located in sub-humid, semi-arid or arid regions. For sites in relatively moist climates, we find, paradoxically, a muted fLUE response to drying soil, but reduced fLUE under wet conditions.
   fLUE identifies substantial drought impacts that are not captured when relying solely on VPD and greenness changes and, when seasonally recurring, are missed by traditional, anomaly-based drought indices. Counter to common assumptions, fLUE reductions are largest in drought-deciduous vegetation, including grasslands. Our results highlight the necessity to account for soil moisture limitation in terrestrial primary productivity data products, especially for drought-related assessments.

AB There is a growing movement in government, environmental non -governmental organizations and the private sector to include ecosystem services in decision making. Adding ecosystem services into assessments implies measuring how much a change in ecological conditions affects people, social benefit, or value to society. Despite consensus around the general merit of accounting for ecosystem services, systematic guidance on what to measure and how is lacking. Current ecosystem services assessments often resort to biophysical proxies (e.g., area of wetland in a floodplain) or even disregard services that seem difficult to measure. Valuation, an important tool for assessing trade-offs and comparing outcomes, is also frequently omitted due to lack of data on social preferences, lack of expertise with valuation methods, or mistrust of valuation methods for non-market services.
   To address these shortcomings, we propose the use of a new type of indicator that explicitly reflects an ecosystem's capacity to provide benefits to society, ensuring that ecosystem services assessments measure outcomes that are demonstrably and directly relevant to human welfare. We call these Benefit-relevant indicators (BRIs) and describe a process for developing them using causal chains that link management decisions through ecological responses to effects on human well-being. BRIs identify what is valued and by whom, but stop short of valuation. A BRI for the ability of wetlands to ameliorate flooding would connect measures of the quantity and quality of wetland in a floodplain, as affected by wetlands management decisions, to the number of people or properties downstream that are vulnerable to flooding. BRIs can support monetary or non-monetary valuation, but are particularly useful when valuation will not be conducted; in such cases they serve as stand-alone measures of "what is valued" by particular beneficiaries. BRIs are valid measures of ecosystem services in that they are directly linked to human well-being. Flexibility in the development of BRIs helps to ensure that they are broadly applicable across practitioner and stakeholder communities and decision contexts.

AB The uncertainties of China's gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates by global data-oriented products and ecosystem models justify a development of high-resolution data-oriented GPP dataset over China. We applied a machine learning algorithm developing a new GPP dataset for China with 0.1 degrees spatial resolution and monthly temporal frequency based on eddy flux measurements from 40 sites in China and surrounding countries, most of which have not been explored in previous global GPP datasets. According to our estimates, mean annual GPP over China is 6.62 +/- 0.23 PgC/year during 1982-2015 with a clear gradient from southeast to northwest. The trend of GPP estimated by this study (0.020 +/- 0.002 PgC/year(2) from 1982 to 2015) is almost two times of that estimated by the previous global dataset. The GPP increment is widely spread with 60% area showing significant increasing trend (p <.05), except for Inner Mongolia. Most ecosystem models overestimated the GPP magnitudes but underestimated the temporal trend of GPP. The monsoon affected eastern China, in particular the area surrounding Qinling Mountain, seems having larger contribution to interannual variability (IAV) of China's GPP than the semiarid northwestern China and Tibetan Plateau. At country scale, temperature is the dominant climatic driver for IAV of GPP. The area where IAV of GPP dominated by temperature is about 42%, while precipitation and solar radiation dominate 31% and 27% respectively over semiarid area and cold-wet area. Such spatial pattern was generally consistent with global GPP dataset, except over the Tibetan Plateau and northeastern forests, but not captured by most ecosystem models, highlighting future research needs to improve the modeling of ecosystem response to climate variations.

AB Time-stamped camera data are increasingly used to study temporal patterns in species and community ecology, including species' activity patterns and niche partitioning. Given the importance of niche partitioning for facilitating coexistence between sympatric species, understanding how emerging environmental stressors - climate and landscape change, biodiversity loss and concomitant changes to community composition - affect temporal niche partitioning is of immediate importance for advancing ecological theory and informing management decisions. A large variety of analytical approaches have been applied to camera-trap data to ask key questions about species activity patterns and temporal overlap among heterospecifics. Despite the many advances for describing and quantifying these temporal patterns, few studies have explicitly tested how interacting biotic and abiotic variables influence species' activity and capacity to segregate along the temporal niche axis. To address this gap, we suggest coordinated distributed experiments to capture sufficient camera-trap data across a range of anthropogenic stressors and community compositions. This will facilitate a standardized approach to assessing the impacts of multiple variables on species' behaviours and interactions. Ultimately, further integration of spatial and temporal analyses of camera-trap data is critical for improving our understanding of how anthropogenic activities and landscape changes are altering competitive interactions and the dynamics of animal communities.

AB Modern population genomic datasets hold immense promise for revealing the evolutionary processes operating in natural populations, but a crucial prerequisite for this goal is the ability to model realistic evolutionary scenarios and predict their expected patterns in genomic data. To that end, we present SLiM 2: an evolutionary simulation framework that combines a powerful, fast engine for forward population genetic simulations with the capability of modeling a wide variety of complex evolutionary scenarios. SLiM achieves this flexibility through scriptability, which provides control over most aspects of the simulated evolutionary scenarios with a simple R-like scripting language called Eidos. An example SLiM simulation is presented to illustrate the power of this approach. SLiM 2 also includes a graphical user interface for simulation construction, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of simulation output, facilitating easy and fastmodel development with quick prototyping and visual debugging. We conclude with a performance comparison between SLiM and two other popular forward genetic simulation packages.

AB With high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we are able to explore the hidden world of microscopic organisms to an unpre-cedented level. The fast development of molecular technology and statistical methods means that microbial ecologists must keep their toolkits updated. Here, we review and evaluate some of the more widely adopted and emerging techniques for analysis of diversity and community composition, and the inference of species interactions from co-occurrence data generated by HTS of marker genes. We emphasize the importance of observational biases and statistical properties of the data and methods. The aim of the review is to critically discuss the advantages and disadvantages of established and emerging statistical methods, and to contribute to the integration of HTS-based marker gene data into community ecology.This is an overview of the more widely adopted and emerging techniques for analysis of diversity and community composition, and the inference of species interactions from co-occurrence data generated by high-throughput sequencing of marker genes.This is an overview of the more widely adopted and emerging techniques for analysis of diversity and community composition, and the inference of species interactions from co-occurrence data generated by high-throughput sequencing of marker genes.

AB Climatic fluctuations during the Quaternary period governed the demography of species and contributed to population differentiation and ultimately speciation. Studies of these past processes have previously been hindered by a lack of means and genetic data to model changes in effective population size (N-e) through time. However, based on diploid genome sequences of high quality, the recently developed pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) can estimate trajectories of changes in N-e over considerable time periods. We applied this approach to resequencing data from nearly 200 genomes of four species and several populations of the Ficedula species complex of black-and-white flycatchers. N-e curves of Atlas, collared, pied and semicollared flycatcher converged 1-2million years ago (Ma) at an N-e of approximate to 200000, likely reflecting the time when all four species last shared a common ancestor. Subsequent separate N-e trajectories are consistent with lineage splitting and speciation. All species showed evidence of population growth up until 100-200thousand years ago (kya), followed by decline and then start of a new phase of population expansion. However, timing and amplitude of changes in N-e differed among species, and for pied flycatcher, the temporal dynamics of N-e differed between Spanish birds and central/northern European populations. This cautions against extrapolation of demographic inference between lineages and calls for adequate sampling to provide representative pictures of the coalescence process in different species or populations. We also empirically evaluate criteria for proper inference of demographic histories using PSMC and arrive at recommendations of using sequencing data with a mean genome coverage of 18X, a per-site filter of 10 reads and no more than 25% of missing data.

AB 1. Amazonian droughts are predicted to become increasingly frequent and intense, and the vulnerability of Amazonian trees has become increasingly documented. However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms and the diversity of drought tolerance of tropical trees due to the lack of quantitative measurements.
   2. Leaf water potential at wilting or turgor loss point (pi(tlp)) is a determinant of the tolerance of leaves to drought stress and contributes to plant-level physiological drought tolerance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that leaf osmotic water potential at full hydration (pi(o)) is tightly correlated with pi(tlp). Estimating pi(tlp) from osmometer measurements of pi(o) is much faster than the standard pressure-volume curve approach of pi(tlp) determination. We used this technique to estimate pi(tlp) for 165 trees of 71 species, at three sites within forests in French Guiana. Our data set represents a significant increase in available data for this trait for tropical tree species.
   3. Tropical trees showed a wider range of drought tolerance than previously found in the literature, pi(tlp) ranging from -1.4 to -3.2 MPa. This range likely corresponds in part to adaptation and acclimation to occasionally extreme droughts during the dry season.
   4. Leaf-level drought tolerance varied across species, in agreement with the available published observations of species variation in drought-induced mortality. On average, species with a more negative pi(tlp) (i.e. with greater leaf-level drought tolerance) occurred less frequently across the region than drought-sensitive species.
   5. Across individuals, pi(tlp) correlated positively but weakly with leaf toughness (R-2 = 0.22, P = 0.04) and leaf thickness (R-2 = 0.03, P = 0.03). No correlation was detected with other functional traits (leaf mass per area, leaf area, nitrogen or carbon concentrations, carbon isotope ratio, sapwood density or bark thickness).
   6. The variability in pi(tlp) among species indicates a potential for highly diverse species responses to drought within given forest communities. Given the weak correlations between pi(tlp) and traditionally measured plant functional traits, vegetation models seeking to predict forest response to drought should integrate improved quantification of comparative drought tolerance among tree species.

AB Tropical deforestation for the establishment of tree cash crop plantations causes significant alterations to soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Despite this recognition, the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tier 1 method has a SOC change factor of 1 (no SOC loss) for conversion of forests to perennial tree crops, because of scarcity of SOC data. In this pantropic study, conducted in active deforestation regions of Indonesia, Cameroon, and Peru, we quantified the impact of forest conversion to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), and cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry plantations on SOC stocks within 3-m depth in deeply weathered mineral soils. We also investigated the underlying biophysical controls regulating SOC stock changes. Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we compared SOC stocks from paired forests (n = 32) and adjacent plantations (n = 54). Our study showed that deforestation for tree plantations decreased SOC stocks by up to 50%. The key variable that predicted SOC changes across plantations was the amount of SOC present in the forest before conversion-the higher the initial SOC, the higher the loss. Decreases in SOC stocks were most pronounced in the topsoil, although older plantations showed considerable SOC losses below 1-m depth. Our results suggest that (i) the IPCC tier 1 method should be revised from its current SOC change factor of 1 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 for oil palm and cacao agroforestry plantations and 0.8 +/- 0.3 for rubber plantations in the humid tropics; and (ii) land use management policies should protect natural forests on carbon-rich mineral soils to minimize SOC losses.

AB Following widespread deterioration of coastal ecosystems since the 1960s, current environmental policies demand ecosystem recovery and restoration. However, vague definitions of recovery and untested recovery paradigms complicate efficient stewardship of coastal ecosystems. We critically examine definitions of recovery and identify and test the implicit paradigms against well-documented cases studies based on a literature review. The study highlights a need for more careful specification of recovery targets and metrics for assessing recovery in individual ecosystems. Six recovery paradigms were identified and examination of them established that partial (as opposed to full) recovery prevails, that degradation and recovery typically follow different pathways as buffers act to maintain the degraded state, and that recovery trajectories depend on the nature of the pressure as well as the connectivity of ecosystems and can differ between ecosystem components and among ecosystems. A conceptual model illustrates the findings and also indicates how restoration efforts may accelerate the recovery process.

ID MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; RESPONSES
AB Unconstrained ordination is commonly used in ecology to visualize multivariate data, in particular, to visualize the main trends between different sites in terms of their species composition or relative abundance. Methods of unconstrained ordination currently used, such as non-metric multidimensional scaling, are algorithm-based techniques developed and implemented without directly accommodating the statistical properties of the data at hand. Failure to account for these key data properties can lead to misleading results. A model-based approach to unconstrained ordination can address this issue, and in this study, two types of models for ordination are proposed based on finite mixture models and latent variable models. Each method is capable of handling different data types and different forms of species response to latent gradients. Further strengths of the models are demonstrated via example and simulation. Advantages of model-based approaches to ordination include the following: residual analysis tools for checking assumptions to ensure the fitted model is appropriate for the data; model selection tools to choose the most appropriate model for ordination; methods for formal statistical inference to draw conclusions from the ordination; and improved efficiency, that is model-based ordination better recovers true relationships between sites, when used appropriately.

AB Climate change is resulting in rapid poleward shifts in the geographical distribution of many tropical fish species, but it is equally apparent that some fishes are failing to exhibit expected shifts in their geographical distribution. There is still little understanding of the species-specific traits that may constrain or promote successful establishment of populations in temperate regions. We review the factors likely to affect population establishment, including larval supply, settlement and post-settlement processes. In addition, we conduct meta-analyses on existing and new data to examine relationships between species-specific traits and vagrancy. We show that tropical vagrant species are more likely to originate from high-latitude populations, while at the demographic level, tropical fish species with large body size, high swimming ability, large size at settlement and pelagic spawning behaviour are more likely to show successful settlement into temperate habitats. We also show that both habitat and food limitation at settlement and within juvenile stages may constrain tropical vagrant communities to those species with medium to low reliance on coral resources.

AB The field of citizen science is flourishing, and although terrestrial projects are more visible, in recent years thousands of volunteers have actively participated in marine research activities. These volunteers (also termed 'citizen scientists') may have experience in the research in which they are participating, but they have no formal degree in marine science or related topics. The participation of large numbers of volunteers with variable educational or professional backgrounds poses particular challenges for the professional scientists coordinating such research. Knowledge about the structure of these projects, the research activities conducted by citizen scientists, and quality control of data collected by volunteers is essential to identify their contribution to marine science. We examined 227 published studies in which professional scientists collaborated with volunteers in a wide range of marine investigations. Most studies focused on a diverse assemblage of animals, followed by flora and other topics (e.g., contamination or beach dynamics). Seabirds, marine mammals, turtles, and fishes were the most commonly studied animals, but several studies also dealt with marine invertebrates. Many of the studied taxa were commercially important, emblematic, or endangered species. Surveys of invasive species took advantage of the extensive spatial scale that can be covered by large numbers of volunteers. As would be expected, the research activities of citizen scientists were concentrated in easily accessible coastal habitats, including sandy beaches, estuaries, coral reefs, and seagrass beds. Hot spots of marine citizen science projects (CSPs) were found not only in North America and Europe, but also in the Indo-West Pacific region. Contributions made by citizen scientists were equally based on incidental observations as on standardized surveys. Some of the research projects had been active for more than a decade, but most were midterm programmes, lasting a few years or less. Volunteer participants came from a wide range of demographic backgrounds. Usually, the participants were adults of both sexes, but a few studies considered either only men or only women (mainly in small fishing communities). Whereas several studies were based on schoolchildren as volunteers, no study worked specifically with senior citizens. The educational level of participants, often not explicitly mentioned in the publications, was also diverse. Some projects selected participants based on their experiences, skills, or profession, but in the majority of the studies, there was either no selection or no information was provided, suggesting that any interested citizen could participate. The preparation of participants ranged from brief written or oral instructions to extensive (weeks) training sessions with professional experts. In general, training effort increased with the complexity of the tasks conducted by volunteers, a crucial element being the adjustment of simple methodologies to the capabilities of participants. Studies for which volunteers needed to identify many different species and estimate their abundances were considered the most complex tasks, and subsequent analysis of such studies by professional scientists must consider inherent bias or shortcomings. About half of the examined studies included some type of quality control to ensure that the data collected by citizen scientists met the standards of rigorous scientific studies. Several authors emphasized that data quality increased with the duration of project participation.
   Efforts therefore should be made to retain experienced volunteers over time, which is facilitated when volunteers perceive that their efforts lead to something of practical use, such as publications, conservation initiatives, management decisions, or policy actions. Participants seemed to value personal satisfaction and public recognition, but learning about the ocean was also important. The coordinators of marine CSPs often collaborated with organizations such as conservation groups, birdwatchers, dive associations, or fishermen's cooperatives to recruit volunteers, but media campaigns, personal communication, social media, and functional websites were also important. Some studies were based on small numbers of participants (e.g., artisanal fishermen); others involved thousands of volunteers (e.g., coral or litter surveys). Volunteer-generated data contributed information about population dynamics, health, or distribution of marine organisms and supported long-term monitoring programmes of marine protected areas, harmful algal blooms, or marine litter, among others. In general, the contribution of citizen scientists greatly enhances research capacity, providing an increased workforce over extensive spatial and intensive temporal scales at comparatively moderate costs. Citizen science is able to make significant contributions to marine science, where professional scientific activities are limited by the available human resources. Considering the vastness of the oceans and the diversity of habitats, communities, and species, proper understanding of this realm requires intensive research activities over time and space. This recognition should lead to increased consideration of citizen science as a powerful tool for the generation and spread of scientific knowledge. Furthermore, sharing knowledge between volunteer participants and professional scientists improves communication, trust, and capacity building, facilitating efficient collaboration in much-needed conservation initiatives.

AB This paper introduces a Theme Issue combining interdisciplinary perspectives in the study of female competition and aggression. Despite a history of being largely overlooked, evidence is now accumulating for the widespread evolutionary significance of female competition. Here, we provide a synthesis of contributions to this Theme Issue on humans and other vertebrates, and highlight directions for future research. Females compete for resources needed to survive and reproduce, and for preferred mates. Although female aggression takes diverse forms, under most circumstances relatively low-risk competitive strategies are favoured, most probably due to constraints of offspring production and care. In social species, dominance relationships and threats of punishment can resolve social conflict without resort to direct aggression, and coalitions or alliances may reduce risk of retaliation. Consistent with these trends, indirect aggression is a low cost but effective form of competition among young women. Costs are also minimized by flexibility in expression of competitive traits, with aggressive behaviour and competitive signalling tailored to social and ecological conditions. Future research on female competition and the proximate mediators of female aggression will be greatly enhanced by opportunities for interdisciplinary exchange, as evidenced by contributions to this Theme Issue.

AB Areas affected by wildfire comprise spatially complex mosaics of burned patches in which a wide range of burn severities coexist. Rapid diagnosis of the different levels of soil burn severity and their extents is essential for designing emergency post-fire rehabilitation treatments. The main objective of this study was to determine whether visual signs of soil burn severity levels are related to changes in soil chemical and microbial properties immediately after fire.
   Eight areas affected by wildfires in NW Spain were selected immediately after fire, and soil chemical and biological properties (pH, extractable Ca, K, Mg and P, SOC, total N, delta C-13, basal soil respiration, Cmic, phosphatase activity, extractable NH4 (+) and NO3 (-), ammonification and nitrification rates and potential N mineralization) were analysed in relation to five levels of soil burn severity (0: Unburned; 1: Oa layer partially or totally intact; 2: Oa layer totally charred; 3: Bare soil and soil structure unaffected; 4: Bare soil and soil structure affected; 5: Bare soil and surface soil structure and colour altered).
   The five visually assessed levels of soil burn severity adequately reflected changes in SOC, pH, and phosphatase activity, which varied gradually with increasing soil burn severity. However, alterations in certain indicators related to the soil organic quality (C/N, Cmic/SOC, qCO(2), delta C-13) were only detected in the most severely burned areas. Discriminant analysis revealed that the best combination of variables was acid phosphatase activity, SOC and pH, which correctly classified between 64 and 76 % of samples, depending on the levels of soil burn severity considered.
   The results showed that the proposed soil burn severity categories may be useful for indicating the degree of degradation of important soil chemical and microbiological properties in sites similar to the study area. This, in combination with other factors, will allow prioritization of areas for rehabilitation.

AB It is clear that, in some climates, fires are a natural phenomenon, they have occurred for millennia and plants have revealed the capacity to cope with them (Pausas et al., 2008). It is also known that wildland fires are a global phenomenon occurring in tropical, temperate and boreal regions (Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2004: Bowman et al., 2009).
   Fire regimes are being modified, responding to ongoing global changes and poor forest planning in terms of frequency, size, seasonality, recurrence and fire intensity and severity, with deleterious impacts on soil fertility and structure and important implications for forest management and sustainability (Bento-Goncalves et al., 2011).
   In the extensive research that exists on the effect of fire on ecosystems there is a growing interest and body of literature on the effects of fire on soil properties.
   This paper aims to review the latest developments regarding intrinsic characteristic; of fires, fire intensity and severity, wildland fires, prescribed fires, fire regimes and soil protection measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier E.V. All rights reserved.

AB Subspecies lie at the interface between systematics and population genetics, and represent a unit of biological organization in zoology that is widely used in the disciplines of taxonomy and conservation biology. In this review, we explore the utility of subspecies in relation to their application in systematics and biodiversity conservation, and briefly summarize species concepts and criteria for their diagnosis, particularly from an invertebrate perspective. The subspecies concept was originally conceived as a formal means of documenting geographical variation within species based on morphological characters; however, the utility of subspecies is hampered by inconsistencies by which they are defined conceptually, a lack of objective criteria or properties that serve to delimit their boundaries, and their frequent failure to reflect distinct evolutionary units according to population genetic structure. Moreover, the concept has been applied to populations largely comprising different components of genetic diversity reflecting contrasting evolutionary processes. We recommend that, under the general lineage (unified) species concept, the definition of subspecies be restricted to extant animal groups that comprise evolving populations representing partially isolated lineages of a species that are allopatric, phenotypically distinct, and have at least one fixed diagnosable character state, and that these character differences are (or are assumed to be) correlated with evolutionary independence according to population genetic structure. Phenotypic character types include colour pattern, morphology, and behaviour or ecology. Under these criteria, allopatric subspecies are a type of evolutionarily significant unit within species in that they show both neutral divergence through the effects of genetic drift and adaptive divergence under natural selection, and provide an historical context for identifying biodiversity units for conservation. Conservation of the adaptedness and adaptability of gene pools, however, may require additional approaches. Recent studies of Australian butterflies exemplify these points.

AB Analyzing survey-responses from 146 Biosphere Reserves in 55 countries we investigate how stakeholder participation and adaptive co-management practices are linked to management performance. Effectiveness in conventional conservation was positively affected by participation of scientists, but negatively affected by participation of volunteers. Effectiveness in sustainable development goals was associated to participation by local inhabitants. Adaptive co-management practices were associated with a higher level of effectiveness in achieving development goals, and this higher effectiveness did not seem to be at the expense of biodiversity conservation.

AB Fish advisories for polychlorinated biphenyls (total-PCBs) and mercury are often given on a length-specific basis and fish sex is usually not considered. The relationship between concentration and length is well established for mercury, however its suitability for total-PCBs and the influence of sex over the large scale covered by most monitoring programs is not well known. Here we use what is perhaps the largest consistent sport fish contaminant dataset to evaluate the relationship between total-PCB/mercury and length and sex. We evaluated seven of the most commonly consumed fishes from the Canadian Great Lakes and two Ontario (Canada) inland lakes. For mercury, the relationship between concentration and length was significant (p<0.05) in most fish species and locations. For total-PCB, this relationship was also generally significant in Chinook salmon and lake trout, which are the species with the most advisories for this compound. In contrast, significant relationships were found less often for whitefish, northern pike, smallmouth bass, walleye, and especially yellow perch. However, mercury usually drives fish consumption advisories for these species. Overall, our results support the protocol of issuing contaminant advice on a length-specific basis in fish monitoring programs with reasonable confidence when at least a moderate number of samples over the natural size range of a species are included in the analysis. Sex differences were common for walleye (males>females, p<0.05) but not other species, suggesting that an equal number of male and female walleye should be used in deriving fish advisories for walleye.

AB Quantifying the relative impacts of top-down vs. bottom-up control of ecosystems remains a controversial issue, with debate often focusing on the perennial question of how predators affect prey densities. To assess predator impacts, we performed a worldwide meta-analysis of field experiments in which the densities of terrestrial vertebrate predators were manipulated and the responses of their terrestrial vertebrate prey were measured. Our results show that predation indeed limits prey populations, as prey densities change substantially after predator manipulations. The main determinant of the result of an experiment was the efficiency of predator manipulation. Positive impacts of predator manipulation appeared to increase with duration of the experiment for non-cyclic prey, while the opposite was true for cyclic prey. In addition, predator manipulation showed a large positive impact on cyclic prey at low prey densities, but had no obvious impact at peak prey densities. As prey population densities generally respond predictably to predator manipulations, we suggest that control of introduced vertebrate predators can be used to effectively conserve and manage native wildlife. However, care should be taken when controlling native predators, especially apex species, owing to their importance as strong interactors and the biodiversity value of their habitats. We discuss gaps in our knowledge of predator-prey relationships and methodological issues related to manipulation experiments. An important guideline for future studies is that adequate monitoring of predator numbers before and during the experiment is the only way to ensure that observed responses in prey populations are actually caused by changes in predation impacts.

AB Aim
   Latitudinal- and regional-scale studies of reptile diversity suggest a predominant temperature effect, unlike many other vertebrate richness patterns which tend to be highly correlated with both temperature and water variables. Here I examine montane gradients in reptile species richness with separate analyses of snakes and lizards from mountains around the world to assess a predominant temperature effect and three additional theories of diversity, including a temperature-water effect, the species-area effect and the mid-domain effect (MDE).
   Location
   Twenty-five elevational gradients of reptile diversity from temperate, tropical and desert mountains in both hemispheres, spanning 10.3 degrees N to 46.1 degrees N.
   Methods
   Elevational gradients in reptile diversity are based on data from the literature. Of the 63 data sets found or compiled, only those with a high, unbiased sampling effort were used in analyses. Twelve predictions and three interactions of diversity theory were tested using nonparametric statistics, linear regressions and multiple regression with the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
   Results
   Reptile richness and, individually, snake and lizard richness on mountains followed four distinct patterns: decreasing, low-elevation plateaus, low-elevation plateaus with mid-elevation peaks, and mid-elevation peaks. Elevational reptile richness was most strongly correlated with temperature. The temperature effect was mediated by precipitation; reptile richness was more strongly tied to temperature on wet gradients than on arid gradients. Area was a secondary factor of importance, whereas the MDE was not strongly associated with reptile diversity on mountains.
   Main conclusions
   Reptile diversity patterns on mountains did not follow the predicted temperature-water effect, as all diversity patterns were found on both wet and dry mountains. But the influence of precipitation on the temperature effect most likely reflects reptiles' use of radiant heat sources (sunning opportunities) that are more widespread on arid mountains than wet mountains due to lower humidity, sparser vegetation and less cloud cover across low and intermediate elevations.

AB Activating transcription factor-5 (ATF5) is highly expressed in malignant glioma and has a key role in promoting cell survival. Here we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify transcriptional regulators of ATF5. Our results reveal an essential survival pathway in malignant glioma, whereby activation of a RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling cascade leads to induction of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein-3-like-2 (CREB3L2), which directly activates ATF5 expression. ATF5, in turn, promotes survival by stimulating transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), an antiapoptotic B cell leukemia-2 family member. Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicates that ATF5 expression inversely correlates with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase inhibitor sorafenib suppresses ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and inhibits malignant glioma growth in cell culture and mouse models. Our results demonstrate that ATF5 is essential in malignant glioma genesis and reveal that the ATF5-mediated survival pathway described here provides potential therapeutic targets for treatment of malignant glioma.

AB The pervasive impact of invasive species has motivated considerable research to understand how characteristics of invaded communities, such as native species diversity, affect the establishment of invasive species. Efforts to identify general mechanisms that limit invasion success, however, have been frustrated by disagreement between landscape-scale observations that generally find a positive relationship between native diversity and invasibility and smaller-scale experiments that consistently reveal competitive interactions that generate the opposite relationship. Here we experimentally elucidate the mechanism explaining the large-scale positive associations between invasion success and native intertidal diversity revealed in our landscape-scale surveys of New England shorelines. Experimental manipulations revealed this large-scale pattern is driven by a facilitation cascade where ecosystem-engineering species interact nonlinearly to enhance native diversity and invasion success by alleviating thermal stress and substrate instability. Our findings reveal that large-scale diversity-invasion relationships can be explained by small-scale positive interactions that commonly occur across multiple trophic levels and functional groups. We argue that facilitation has played an important but unrecognized role in the invasion of other well studied systems, and will be of increasing importance with anticipated climate change.

AB Within a landscape where prey has an aggregated distribution, predators can take advantage of the spatial autocorrelation of prey density and intensify their search effort in areas of high prey density by using area-restricted search behaviour. In African arid and semi-arid savannas, large herbivores tend to aggregate around scarce water sources. We tested the hypothesis that water sources are a key determinant of habitat selection and movement patterns of large free-ranging predators in such savannas, using the example of the African lion. We used data from 19 GPS radio-collared lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Maps of lions' trajectories showed that waterholes are key loci on the lions' route-maps. Compositional analyses revealed that lions significantly selected for areas located within 2 km of a waterhole. In addition, analysis of lions' night paths showed that when lions are close to a waterhole (< 2 km), they move at lower speed, cover shorter distances per night (both path length and net displacement) and follow a more tortuous path (higher turning angle, lower straightness index and higher fractal dimension) than when they are further from a waterhole. Hence, our results strongly suggest that lions adopt area-restricted searching in the vicinity of waterholes, and reduce their search effort to minimize the time spent far from a waterhole. They provide an illustration of how key habitat features that determine the dispersion of prey (e.g. waterholes in this study) have an influence on the spatial ecology and movement patterns of terrestrial predators.

AB Recent papers have promoted the view that model-based methods in general, and those based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) in particular, are flawed in a number of ways, and are therefore inappropriate for the analysis of phylogeographic data. These papers further argue that Nested Clade Phylogeographic Analysis (NCPA) offers the best approach in statistical phylogeography. In order to remove the confusion and misconceptions introduced by these papers, we justify and explain the reasoning behind model-based inference. We argue that ABC is a statistically valid approach, alongside other computational statistical techniques that have been successfully used to infer parameters and compare models in population genetics. We also examine the NCPA method and highlight numerous deficiencies, either when used with single or multiple loci. We further show that the ages of clades are carelessly used to infer ages of demographic events, that these ages are estimated under a simple model of panmixia and population stationarity but are then used under different and unspecified models to test hypotheses, a usage the invalidates these testing procedures. We conclude by encouraging researchers to study and use model-based inference in population genetics.

AB We analyze interannual to multi-decadal growth variations of 555 oak trees from Central-West Germany. A network of 13 pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and 33 sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) site chronologies is compared with gridded temperature, precipitation,. cloud-cover, vapor pressure and drought (i.e., Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI) fluctuations. A hierarchic cluster analysis identifies three groups for each oak species differentiated by ecologic settings. When high precipitation is primarily a characteristic for one Q. rohur and one Q. petraea cluster, the other clusters are more differentiated by prevailing temperature conditions. Correlation analysis with precipitation and vapor pressure reveals statistically significant (P <= 0.05) correlations for June (r = 0.51) and annual (r = 0.43) means. Growth of both species at dry sites correlates strongly with PDSI (r = 0.39, P <= 0.05) and weakly with temperature and cloud-cover. In natural stands, Q. robur responds more strongly to water depletion than Q. petraea. Twenty-one-year moving correlations show positive significant growth response to both PDSI and precipitation throughout the 20th century, except for the 1940s - an anomalously warm decade during which all oak sites are characterized by an increased growth and all enhanced association with vapor pressure and temperature. We Suggest that the wider oak rings that are exhibited during this period may be indicative of a nonlinear or threshold-induced growth response to drought and vapor pressure, and run counter to the general response of oak to drought and precipitation that normally would result ill Suppressed growth ill a warmer and drier environment. As the wide rings are formed during the severe drought period of the 20th century, a complex model seems to be required to fully explain the widespread oak growth. Our results indicate Uncertainty in estimates of future growth trends of Central European oak forests in a warming and drying world.

AB Background: Analysis of interspecific gene flow is crucial for the understanding of speciation processes and maintenance of species integrity. Oaks ( genus Quercus, Fagaceae) are among the model species for the study of hybridization. Natural co-occurrence of four closely related oak species is a very rare case in the temperate forests of Europe. We used both morphological characters and genetic markers to characterize hybridization in a natural community situated in west-central Romania and which consists of Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, and Q. frainetto, respectively.
   Results: On the basis of pubescence and leaf morphological characters similar to 94% of the sampled individuals were assigned to pure species. Only 16 (similar to 6%) individual trees exhibited intermediate morphologies or a combination of characters of different species. Four chloroplast DNA haplotypes were identified in the study area. The distribution of haplotypes within the white oak complex showed substantial differences among species. However, the most common haplotypes were present in all four species. Furthermore, based on a set of 7 isozyme and 6 microsatellite markers and using a Bayesian admixture analysis without any a priori information on morphology we found that four genetic clusters best fit the data. There was a very good correspondence of each species with one of the inferred genetic clusters. The estimated introgression level varied markedly between pairs of species ranging from 1.7% between Q. robur and Q. frainetto to 16.2% between Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto. Only nine individuals ( 3.4%) appeared to be first-generation hybrids.
   Conclusion: Our data indicate that natural hybridization has occurred at relatively low rates. The different levels of gene flow among species might be explained by differences in flowering time and spatial position within the stand. In addition, a partial congruence between phenotypically and genetically intermediate individuals was found, suggesting that intermediate appearance does not necessarily mean hybridization. However, it appears that natural hybridization did not seriously affect the species identity in this area of sympatry.

AB Classical biological control (the introduction of exotic natural enemies) is often advocated as a tool for managing invasive species. Here, we review the effectiveness of biocontrol and explore the factors that determine whether it is an appropriate response to the invasive species problem. Although there have been some successes, biocontrol is generally poorly evaluated and, in many cases, its impact is unknown. In particular, there is limited understanding of the nature of the invasive species problem and no clear targets against which,success' can be gauged. In addition, exotic natural enemies could act as invasive species in their own right. To improve the role of biocontrol in invasive species management, we need a better ecological understanding of the impacts of both the biocontrol agents and the target invasive species.

AB Coral bleaching events constitute compound disturbances often resulting in coral death as well as successive degradation of the reef framework. The 1997/1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was the most severe on record and affected coral reefs worldwide. The present study examined the response of fish assemblages in plots of transplanted coral before and after the 1998 bleaching. Multidimensional scaling ordinations (MDS) demonstrate significant changes in assemblage composition related to habitat alteration. Within-site variability increased with disturbance, the increase being most apparent following substrate erosion. The differences in long-term responses as opposed to short-term responses were striking. Six mo after coral death, total abundance as well as taxonomic richness had increased at one of the sites, but not the other, whereas 6 yr later, both measures had decreased significantly at both sites. Functional groups, with documented affiliations with coral, were significantly influenced by the habitat alteration. Herbivore abundance increased as an immediate response to bleaching, but was subsequently decimated in eroded habitat. The loss of structural complexity had major detrimental effects on the entire fish community. In conclusion, we present evidence of severe and long-lasting secondary impacts of a catastrophic bleaching event, with no apparent recovery. The discrepancies between short-term and long-term responses underline the importance of long-term monitoring of fish assemblages following habitat alteration.

AB Boreal ecosystems contain a substantial fraction of the earth's soil carbon stores and are prone to frequent and severe wildfires. In this study, we examine changes in element and organic matter stocks due to a 1999 wildfire in Alaska. One year after the wildfire, burned soils contained between 1071 and 1420 g/m(2) less carbon than unburned soils. Burned soils had lower nitrogen than unburned soils, higher calcium, and nearly unchanged potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus stocks. Burned surface soils tended to have higher concentrations of noncombustible elements such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus compared with unburned soils. Combustion losses of carbon were mostly limited to surface dead moss and fibric horizons, with no change in the underlying mineral horizons. Burning caused significant changes in soil organic matter structure, with a 12% higher ratio of carbon to combustible organic matter in surface burned horizons compared with unburned horizons. Pyrolysis gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy also shows preferential volatilization of polysaccharide-derived organic matter and enrichment of lignin- and lipid-derived compounds in surface soils. The chemistry of deeper soil layers in burned and unburned sites was similar, suggesting that immediate fire impacts were restricted to the surface soil horizon.

AB We used mitochondrial cyt b sequences to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of Crocidura russula (sensu lato) populations across the Strait of Gibraltar, western Europe, Maghreb, and the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands. This revealed very low genetic divergence between European and Moroccan populations. The application of a molecular clock previously calibrated for shrews suggested that the separation of European from Moroccan lineages occurred less than 60 000 BP, which is at least 5 million years (Myr) after the reopening of the Strait of Gibraltar. This means that an overwater dispersal event was responsible for the observed phylogeographical structure. In contrast, genetic analyses revealed that Moroccan populations were highly distinct from Tunisian ones. According to the molecular clock, these populations separated about 2.2 million years ago (Ma), a time marked by sharp alternations of dry and humid climates in the Maghreb. The populations of the Mediterranean islands Ibiza, Pantelleria, and Sardinia were founded from Tunisian populations by overwater dispersal. In conclusion, overwater dispersal across the Strait of Gibraltar, probably assisted by humans, is possible for small terrestrial vertebrates. Moreover, as in Europe, Quaternary climatic fluctuations had a major effect on the phylogeographical structure of the Maghreb biota.

AB 1. To determine whether rarity and decline is linked to organism ecology, associations have been examined between butterfly larval host-plant competitive, stress-tolerant, ruderal (C-S-R) strategies and butterfly biology.
   2. Associations have been sought between mean C-S-R scores for larval host plants with butterfly life history, morphology and physiology variables, resource use, population attributes, geography, and conservation status. Comparisons are carried out across species and controlled for phylogenetic patterning.
   3. Butterfly biology is linked to host-plant strategies. An increasing tendency of a butterfly's host plants to a particular strategy biases that butterfly species to functionally linked life-history attributes and resource breadth and type. In turn, population attributes and geography are significantly and substantially affected by host choice and the strategies of these host plants.
   4. The greatest contrast is between butterfly species whose host plants are labelled C and R strategists and those whose host plants are labelled S strategists. Increasingly high host-plant C and R strategy scores bias butterflies to rapid development, short early stages, multivoltinism, long flight periods, early seasonal emergence, higher mobility, polyphagy, wide resource availability and biotope occupancy, open, areally expansive, patchy population structures, denser distributions, wider geographical ranges, resistance to range retractions as well as to increasing rarity in the face of environmental changes. Increasing host-plant S strategy scores have reversed tendencies, biasing those butterfly species to extended development times, fewer broods, short flight periods, smaller wing expanse and lower mobility, monophagy, restricted resource exploitation and biotope occupancy, closed, areally limited populations with typical metapopulation structures, sparse distributions, and limited geographical ranges, range retractions, and increased rarity.
   5. Species with S strategy host plants are species vulnerable to current environmental changes and species of conservation concern.

AB Interactions between the diversity of primary producers and that of decomposers-the two key functional groups that form the basis of all ecosystems-might have major consequences on the functioning of depauperate ecosystems. I I,resent a simple ecosystem model in which primary producers (plants) and decomposers (microbes) are linked through material cycling. The model considers a diversity of plant organic compounds and a diversity of microbial species. Nutrient recycling efficiency from organic compounds to decomposers is then the key parameter that controls ecosystem processes (primary productivity, secondary productivity, producer biomass and decomposer biomass). The model predicts that microbial diversity has a positive effect on nutrient recycling efficiency and ecosystem processes through either greater intensity of microbial exploitation of organic compounds or functional niche complementarity, much like in plants. Microbial niche breadth and overlap should not affect ecosystem processes unless they increase the number of organic compounds that are decomposed. In contrast, the model predicts that plant organic compound diversity can only have a negative effect or, at best, no effect on ecosystem processes, at least ill a constant environment. This creates a tension between the effects of plant diversity and microbial diversity on ecosystem functioning, which may explain some recent experimental results.

AB This study intends to assess the influence of fragment age, size and isolation (from the regional species pool) on bird community composition patterns in urban parks in Madrid, and the role of local and regional factors on community structure. Park age was a good indicator of habitat complexity. Park age and area accounted for 62% of the variability in species richness, but two measures of isolation from the regional species pool were not included as significant: factors. Species composition in urban parks showed a high degree of nestedness, which was associated with park age and area, but not with two measures of isolation from the regional species pool. The degree of nestedness increased with park age; the distribution of species varying from nested in old and mature parks to random in young parks. The incidence (% of species occurrence in parks) in young parks was correlated with regional densities, whereas in mature and old parks the incidence was correlated with local densities. In this urban landscape, species composition appears to be regulated by local factors (particularly in mature and old parks), such that species accumulate in an orderly (not random) fashion in relation to park age and area. Regional influences seem to be more pronounced only in young parks, which are mainly colonized by species from the regional species pool.

Here we report on the global genetic structure of oceanic populations of the sperm whale one of the most widely distributed mammalian species. Groups of females and juveniles are mainly found at low latitudes, while males reach polar waters, returning to tropical and subtropical waters to breed. In comparisons between oceans, we did not find significant heterogeneity in allele frequencies of microsatellite loci (exact test; p = 0.23). Estimates of G(ST) = 0.001 and R-ST = 0.005 also indicated negligible if any nuclear DNA differentiation. We have previously reported significant differentiation between oceans in mtDNA sequences. These contrasting patterns suggest that interoceanic movements have been more prevalent among males than among females, consistent with observations of Females being the philopatric ses and having a more limited latitudinal distribution than males. Consequently the typical mammalian dispersal pattern may have operated on a global scale in sperm whales.

AB We assessed avian nesting success in two forested landscapes (Chippewa and Superior National Forests) in northern Minnesota. We found 311 nests of 33 species in the Chippewa study area and 36 nests of 13 species in the Superior study area. Each nest was classified into one of three general habitat types: open (clearcuts with vegetation <2 m high), regenerating aspen (2-8 m high), or forested (trees >8 m high). Mayfield nesting success for the most common species in the Chippewa (all of which had open-cup nests) averaged 0.43. Nesting success ranged from 0.18 for the Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus) to 0.76 for the Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia). Nest predation was the most common mortality factor, causing 89.2% of known failures Nest predation among ground-nesting birds was significantly higher in the Chippewa (55%) than in the Superior (15%) study area (P = 0.038). Nest predation was highest (P = 0.015) in the forest (62.2%) and lowest in open (42.2%) and regenerating (47.4%) habitat types. Only canopy cover explained differences in nesting success. which was higher in more open canopies. Distance to forest edge, nest height, and nest concealment had no effect on nesting success in both forested and open habitats. Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was low (9.6% in the Chippewa study area), and parasitized nests were relatively unsuccessful (only 1.7% yielded cowbird fledglings). Neither cowbirds nor nest parasitism was observed in the Superior study area.

AB This work reviews applications of stable isotope analysis to the studies of transport and transformation of N species in groundwater under agricultural areas. It summarizes evidence regarding factors affecting the isotopic composition of NO3-, NH4+ and N2O in subsurface, and discusses the use of B-11, O-18, C-13, S-34, Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopes to support the analysis of delta N-15 values. The isotopic composition of NO3-, NH4+ and N2O varies depending on their sources and dynamics of N cycle processes. The reported delta N-15-NO3- values for sources of NO3- are: soil organic N - +3 parts per thousand-+8 parts per thousand, mineral fertilizers - -8 parts per thousand-+7 parts per thousand; manure/household waste - +5 parts per thousand to +35 parts per thousand. For NH4+ sources, the isotopic signature ranges are: organic matter - +2.4-+4.1 parts per thousand, rainwater - -13.4-+2.3 parts per thousand, mineral fertilizers - -7.4-+5.1 parts per thousand, house-hold waste - +5-+9 parts per thousand; animal manure - +8-+11 parts per thousand. For N2O, isotopic composition depends on isotopic signatures of substrate pools and reaction rates. delta N-15 values of NO3- are influenced by fractionation effects occurring during de-nitrification (epsilon = 5-40 parts per thousand), nitrification (epsilon = 5-35 parts per thousand) and DNRA (epsilon not reported). The isotopic signature of NH4+ is also affected by nitrification and DNRA as well as mineralization (epsilon = 1%), sorption (epsilon = 1-8%), anammox (epsilon = 4.3-7.4 parts per thousand) and volatilization (epsilon = 25 parts per thousand). As for the N2O, production of N2O leads to its depletion in N-15, whereas consumption - to enrichment in N-15. The magnitude of fractionation effects occurring during the considered processes depends on temperature, pH, DO, C/NO3- ratio, size of the substrate pool, availability of electron donors, water content in subsoil, residence time, land use, hydrogeology. While previous studies have accumulated rich data on isotopic composition of NO3- in groundwater, evidence remains scarce in the cases of NH4+ and N2O. Further research is required to consider variability of delta N-15-NH4+ and delta N-15-N2O in groundwater across agricultural ecosystems. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The role of animals in modulating nutrient cycling [hereafter, consumer-driven nutrient dynamics (CND)] has been accepted as an important influence on both community structure and ecosystem function in aquatic systems. Yet there is great variability in the influence of CND across species and ecosystems, and the causes of this variation are not well understood. Here, we review and synthesize the mechanisms behind CND in fresh waters. We reviewed 131 articles on CND published between 1973 and 1 June 2015. The rate of new publications in CND has increased from 1.4 papers per year during 1973-2002 to 7.3 per year during 2003-2015. The majority of investigations are in North America with many concentrating on fish. More recent studies have focused on animal-mediated nutrient excretion rates relative to nutrient demand and indirect impacts (e.g. decomposition). We identified several mechanisms that influence CND across levels of biological organization. Factors affecting the stoichiometric plasticity of consumers, including body size, feeding history and ontogeny, play an important role in determining the impact of individual consumers on nutrient dynamics and underlie the stoichiometry of CND across time and space. The abiotic characteristics of an ecosystem affect the net impact of consumers on ecosystem processes by influencing consumer metabolic processes (e.g. consumption and excretion/egestion rates), non-CND supply of nutrients and ecosystem nutrient demand. Furthermore, the transformation and transport of elements by populations and communities of consumers also influences the flow of energy and nutrients across ecosystem boundaries. This review highlights that shifts in community composition or biomass of consumers and eco-evolutionary underpinnings can have strong effects on the functional role of consumers in ecosystem processes, yet these are relatively unexplored aspects of CND. Future research should evaluate the value of using species traits and abiotic conditions to predict and understand the effects of consumers on ecosystem-level nutrient dynamics across temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, new work in CND should strive to integrate knowledge from disparate fields of ecology and environmental science, such as physiology and ecosystem ecology, to develop a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the functional role of consumers. Comparative and experimental studies that develop testable hypotheses to challenge the current assumptions of CND, including consumer stoichiometric homeostasis, are needed to assess the significance of CND among species and across freshwater ecosystems.

AB 1. Abundance-based assemblage dissimilarity can be partitioned into components accounting for (i) balanced variation in abundance, whereby the individuals of some species in one site are substituted by the same number of individuals of different species in another site, and (ii) abundance gradients, whereby some individuals are lost fromone site to the other.
   2. Such amethod was available for pairwise dissimilarity, but not for multiple-site dissimilarity.
   3. New multiple-site extensions of Bray-Curtis and Ruzicka indices based on the formulation of multiple-site analogues of matching components (i.e. the intersection and the relative complements among multiple sites in terms of species abundances) are introduced.
   4. These new indices can be partitioned into balanced-variation and abundance-gradients components.
   5. An example assessing multiple-site dissimilarity of birds and butterflies in a mosaic of habitats is shown to illustrate the usefulness of comparing incidence-and abundance-based multiple-site dissimilarity and its components to characterize biotic heterogeneity across multiple sites.
   6. Themethodmay be generally useful when the question of interest is the overall abundance-based dissimilarity across multiple units (in space, time or other), as separating the balance-variation (i.e. substitution) and abundance-gradients (i.e. subsets) components of dissimilarity can shed light on the processes behind variation in species abundances.

AB Deforestation in the tropics is not only responsible for direct carbon emissions but also extends the forest edge wherein trees suffer increased mortality. Here we combine high-resolution (30 m) satellite maps of forest cover with estimates of the edge effect and show that 19% of the remaining area of tropical forests lies within 100m of a forest edge. The tropics house around 50 million forest fragments and the length of the world's tropical forest edges sums to nearly 50 million km. Edge effects in tropical forests have caused an additional 10.3 Gt (2.1-14.4 Gt) of carbon emissions, which translates into 0.34 Gt per year and represents 31% of the currently estimated annual carbon releases due to tropical deforestation. Fragmentation substantially augments carbon emissions from tropical forests and must be taken into account when analysing the role of vegetation in the global carbon cycle.

AB The interaction between xylem phenology and climate assesses forest growth and productivity and carbon storage across biomes under changing environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that patterns of wood formation are maintained unaltered despite the temperature changes across cold ecosystems. Wood microcores were collected weekly or biweekly throughout the growing season for periods varying between 1 and 13 years during 1998-2014 and cut in transverse sections for assessing the onset and ending of the phases of xylem differentiation. The data set represented 1321 trees belonging to 10 conifer species from 39 sites in the Northern Hemisphere and covering an interval of mean annual temperature exceeding 14 K. The phenological events and mean annual temperature of the sites were related linearly, with spring and autumnal events being separated by constant intervals across the range of temperature analysed. At increasing temperature, first enlarging, wall-thickening and mature tracheids appeared earlier, and last enlarging and wall-thickening tracheids occurred later. Overall, the period of wood formation lengthened linearly with the mean annual temperature, from 83.7 days at -2 degrees C to 178.1 days at 12 degrees C, at a rate of 6.5 days degrees C-1. April-May temperatures produced the best models predicting the dates of wood formation. Our findings demonstrated the uniformity of the process of wood formation and the importance of the environmental conditions occurring at the time of growth resumption. Under warming scenarios, the period of wood formation might lengthen synchronously in the cold biomes of the Northern Hemisphere.

   PESTICIDES; TOXICITY; RESIDUES; SURVIVAL; IMPACT
AB Many factors can negatively affect honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health including the pervasive use of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides. Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food-sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-term colony functioning. These data indicate that risk-mitigation efforts should focus on reducing neonicotinoid exposure in the early spring when colonies are smallest and queens are most vulnerable to exposure.

AB Soils are among the most valuable non-renewable resources on the Earth. They support natural vegetation and human agro-ecosystems, represent the largest terrestrial organic carbon stock, and act as stores and filters for water. Mankind has impacted on soils from its early days in many different ways, with burning being the first human perturbation at landscape scales. Fire has long been used as a tool to fertilize soils and control plant growth, but it can also substantially change vegetation, enhance soil erosion and even cause desertification of previously productive areas. Indeed fire is now regarded by some as the seventh soil-forming factor. Here we explore the effects of fire on soils as influenced by human interference. Human-induced fires have shaped our landscape for thousands of years and they are currently the most common fires in many parts of the world. We first give an overview of fire effect on soils and then focus specifically on (i) how traditional land-use practices involving fire, such as slash-and-burn or vegetation clearing, have affected and still are affecting soils; (ii) the effects of more modern uses of fire, such as fuel reduction or ecological burns, on soils; and (iii) the ongoing and potential future effects on soils of the complex interactions between human-induced land cover changes, climate warming and fire dynamics.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'The interaction of fire and mankind'.

ID CENTRALITY; FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE
AB The objective of this article is to further the study of journal interdisciplinarity, or, more generally, knowledge integration at the level of individual articles. Interdisciplinarity is operationalized by the diversity of subject fields assigned to cited items in the article's reference list. Subject fields and subfields were obtained from the Leuven-Budapest (ECOOM) subject-classification scheme, while disciplinary diversity was measured taking variety, balance, and disparity into account. As diversity measure we use a Hill-type true diversity in the sense of Jost and Leinster-Cobbold. The analysis is conducted in 3 steps. In the first part, the properties of this measure are discussed, and, on the basis of these properties it is shown that the measure has the potential to serve as an indicator of interdisciplinarity. In the second part the applicability of this indicator is shown using selected journals from several research fields ranging from mathematics to social sciences. Finally, the often-heard argument, namely, that interdisciplinary research exhibits larger visibility and impact, is studied on the basis of these selected journals. Yet, as only 7 journals, representing a total of 15,757 articles, are studied, albeit chosen to cover a large range of interdisciplinarity, further research is still needed.

AB The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires EU member states to produce and implement river basin management plans, which are to be designed and updated via participatory processes that inform, consult with, and actively involve all interested stakeholders. The assumption of the European Commission is that stakeholder participation, and institutional adaptation and procedural innovation to facilitate it, are essential to the effectiveness of river basin planning and, ultimately, the environmental impact of the Directive. We analyzed official documents and the WFD literature to compare implementation of the Directive in EU member states in the initial WFD planning phase (2000-2009). Examining the development of participatory approaches to river basin management planning, we consider the extent of transformation in EU water governance over the period. Employing a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach, we map the implementation "trajectories" of 13 member states, and then provide a detailed examination of shifts in river basin planning and participation in four member states (Germany, Sweden, Poland and France) to illustrate the diversity of institutional approaches observed. We identify a general tendency towards increased, yet circumscribed, stakeholder participation in river basin management in the member states examined, alongside clear continuities in terms of their respective pre-WFD institutional and procedural arrangements. Overall, the WFD has driven a highly uneven shift to river basin-level planning among the member states, and instigated a range of efforts to institutionalize stakeholder involvement-often through the establishment of advisory groups to bring organized stakeholders into the planning process.

AB To ensure the long-term persistence of biodiversity, conservation strategies must account for the entire range of climate change impacts. A variety of spatial prioritisation techniques have been developed to incorporate climate change. Here, we provide the first standardised review of these approaches. Using a systematic search, we analysed peer-reviewed spatial prioritisation publications (n = 46) and found that the most common approaches (n = 41, 89%) utilised forecasts of species distributions and aimed to either protect future species habitats (n = 24, 52%) or identify climate refugia to shelter species from climate change (n = 17, 37%). Other approaches (n = 17, 37%) used well-established conservation planning principles to combat climate change, aimed at broadly increasing either connectivity (n = 11, 24%) or the degree of heterogeneity of abiotic factors captured in the planning process (n = 8, 17%), with some approaches combining multiple goals. We also find a strong terrestrial focus (n = 35, 76%), and heavy geographical bias towards North America (n = 8, 17%) and Australia (n = 11, 24%). While there is an increasing trend of incorporating climate change into spatial prioritisation, we found that serious gaps in current methodologies still exist. Future research must focus on developing methodologies that allow planners to incorporate human responses to climate change and recognise that discrete climate impacts (e.g. extreme events), which are increasing in frequency and severity, must be addressed within the spatial prioritisation framework By identifying obvious gaps and highlighting future research needs this review will help practitioners better plan for conservation action in the face of multiple threats including climate change.

AB The maturation of marine phylogeography depends on integration of comparative information across different regions globally. The northwestern Pacific, characterized by unique tectonic setting, however, is still underrepresented. This study seeks to highlight its phylogeographical history based on the available population data, focusing on three seas: the East China Sea (ECS), the South China Sea (SCS) and the Sea of Japan (SOJ). We first conducted a literature survey to evaluate current research efforts and then reanalysed the population structure, historical demography and genealogy for two selections of studies (namely the ECS category' and the multiple-sea category') to elucidate the evolutionary processes within and across the seas, respectively. For the ECS category, the meta-analyses revealed most studies displayed a shallow phylogeny, indicating a single origin from the sea. Significant population structure was commonplace, particularly in molluck and crustacean studies, with proportions of 89% and 80%, respectively. Nearly all studies selected showed signals of population expansion: the times estimated were closely linked to a period of similar to 120-140Kya rather than the last glacial maximum. For the latter category, divergent intraspecific lineages appeared among seas and overlapped in the adjacent regions, a pattern implying each sea had served as an independent refugium during glaciations. The genetic splits, however, were estimated to arise from separate events dating from late Miocene to middle Pleistocene. As phylogeography is still in its infancy in the region, more effort is needed to test and complement the general rules abstracted here. Finally, challenges and prospects were discussed to accelerate further research.

AB Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of the food-borne life threatening disease listeriosis. This pathogenic bacterium received much attention in the endeavor of deciphering the cellular mechanisms that underlie the onset of infection and its ability to adapt to the food processing environment. Although information is available on the presence of L. monocytogenes in many environmental niches including soil, water, plants, foodstuff and animals, understanding the ecology of L. monocytogenes in outdoor environments has received less attention. Soil is an environmental niche of pivotal importance in the transmission of this bacterium to plants and animals. Soil composition, microbial communities and macrofauna are extrinsic edaphic factors that direct the fate of L. monocytogenes in the soil environment. Moreover, farming practices may further affect its incidence. The genome of L. monocytogenes presents an extensive repertoire of genes encoding transport proteins and regulators, a characteristic of the genome of ubiquitous bacteria. Postgenomic analyses bring new insights in the process of soil adaptation. In the present paper focussing on soil, we review these extrinsic and intrinsic factors that drive environmental adaptation of L. monocytogenes.

AB 1. Risks of predation or interference competition are major factors shaping the distribution of species. An animal's response to risk can either be reactive, to an immediate risk, or predictive, based on preceding risk or past experiences. The manner in which animals respond to risk is key in understanding avoidance, and hence coexistence, between interacting species.
   2. We investigated whether cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), known to be affected by predation and competition by lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta), respond reactively or predictively to the risks posed by these larger carnivores.
   3. We used simultaneous spatial data from Global Positioning System (GPS) radiocollars deployed on all known social groups of cheetahs, lions and spotted hyaenas within a 2700 km(2) study area on the periphery of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. The response to risk of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas was explored on three levels: short-term or immediate risk, calculated as the distance to the nearest (contemporaneous) lion or spotted hyaena, long-term risk, calculated as the likelihood of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas based on their cumulative distributions over a 6-month period and habitat-associated risk, quantified by the habitat used by each of the three species.
   4. We showed that space and habitat use by cheetahs was similar to that of lions and, to a lesser extent, spotted hyaenas. However, cheetahs avoided immediate risks by positioning themselves further from lions and spotted hyaenas than predicted by a random distribution.
   5. Our results suggest that cheetah spatial distribution is a hierarchical process, first driven by resource acquisition and thereafter fine-tuned by predator avoidance; thus suggesting a reactive, rather than a predictive, response to risk.

TI Intra-specific and inter-specific variation in specific leaf area reveal

AB Questions: Are patterns of intra- and inter-specific functional trait variation consistent with greater abiotic filtering on community assembly at high latitudes and elevations, and greater biotic filtering at low latitudes and elevations?
   Locations: Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica; Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona; Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon.
   Methods: We measured woody plant species abundance and a key functional trait associated with competition for resources and environmental tolerance (specific leaf area, SLA) along elevational gradients in low-latitude tropical (Costa Rica), mid-latitude desert (Arizona) and high latitude mediterranean (southern Oregon) biomes. We explored patterns of abiotic and biotic filtering by comparing observed patterns of community-weighted means and variances along elevational and latitudinal gradients to those expected under random assembly. In addition, we related trait variability to niches and explored how total trait space and breadth vary across broad spatial gradients by quantifying the ratio of intra- to inter-specific variation.
   Results: Both the community-wide mean and variance of SLA decreased with increasing latitude, consistent with greater abiotic filtering at higher latitudes. Further, low-elevation communities had higher trait variation than expected by chance, consistent with greater biotic filtering at low elevations. Finally, in the tropics and across latitude the ratio of intra-to inter-specific variation was negatively correlated to species richness, which further suggests that biotic interactions influence plant assembly at low latitudes.
   Conclusions: Intra- and inter-specific patterns of SLA variation appeared broadly consistent with the idea that the relative strength of biotic and abiotic drivers on community assembly changes along elevational and latitudinal gradients; evidence for biotic drivers appeared more prominent at low latitudes and elevations and evidence for abiotic drivers appearedmore prominent at high latitudes and elevations.

AB Practicing ecologists who excel at their work ("experts'') hold a wealth of knowledge. This knowledge offers a wide range of opportunities for application in ecological research and natural resource decision-making. While experts are often consulted ad-hoc, their contributions are not widely acknowledged. These informal applications of expert knowledge lead to concerns about a lack of transparency and repeatability, causing distrust of this knowledge source in the scientific community. Here, we address these concerns with an exploration of the diversity of expert knowledge and of rigorous methods in its use. The effective use of expert knowledge hinges on an awareness of the spectrum of experts and their expertise, which varies by breadth of perspective and critical assessment. Also, experts express their knowledge in different forms depending on the degree of contextualization with other information. Careful matching of experts to application is therefore essential and has to go beyond a simple fitting of the expert to the knowledge domain. The standards for the collection and use of expert knowledge should be as rigorous as for empirical data. This involves knowing when it is appropriate to use expert knowledge and how to identify and select suitable experts. Further, it requires a careful plan for the collection, analysis and validation of the knowledge. The knowledge held by expert practitioners is too valuable to be ignored. But only when thorough methods are applied, can the application of expert knowledge be as valid as the use of empirical data. The responsibility for the effective and rigorous use of expert knowledge lies with the researchers.

AB Aim We hypothesized that mechanisms underlying beta diversity in rivers would differ between gradients where (1) natural stressors result in progressive species turnover with high specificity and (2) anthropogenic stressors result in the loss of specialist taxa thus giving rise to nestedness. Location Great Britain, the Iberian Peninsula and the Himalayan Mountains. Methods We analysed five datasets describing benthic macroinvertebrates sampled along natural (elevation, salinity) and anthropogenic (acidity, metals, land use) stress gradients. Predictions were tested by fitting models relating species richness and beta-diversity components (total, turnover and nestedness dissimilarities) to putative stress intensity (i.e. the degree to which a particular environmental constraint filters species occurrence). Results Stress intensity accounted for most of the variability in species richness (r2=0.64-0.93), which declined with increasing stress. Dissimilarity in community composition between locations increased with the difference in stress intensity for all datasets. For natural stressors, beta-diversity patterns mainly reflected species turnover, whilst for anthropogenic stressors beta diversity mainly reflected nesting of subsets of species as stress intensity increased. Main conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that natural and anthropogenic stressors generate contrasting patterns in beta diversity that arise through different mechanisms.

AB It is generally believed that the infant's microbiota is established during the first 1-2 years of life. However, there is scarce data on its characterization and its comparison to the adult-like microbiota in consecutive years.
   Aim: To characterize and compare the intestinal microbiota in healthy young children (1-4 years) and healthy adults from the North Carolina region in the U. S. using high-throughput bacterial phylogenetic microarray analysis.
   Methods: Detailed characterization and comparison of the intestinal microbiota of healthy children aged 1-4 years old (n = 28) and healthy adults of 21-60 years (n = 23) was carried out using the Human Intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) phylogenetic microarray targeting the V1 and V6 regions of 16S rRNA and quantitative PCR.
   Results: The HITChip microarray data indicate that Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Clostridium cluster IV and Bacteroidetes are the predominant phylum-like groups that exhibit differences between young children and adults. The phylum-like group Clostridium cluster XIVa was equally predominant in young children and adults and is thus considered to be established at an early age. The genus-like level show significant 3.6 fold (higher or lower) differences in the abundance of 26 genera between young children and adults. Young U. S. children have a significantly 3.5-fold higher abundance of Bifidobacterium species than the adults from the same location. However, the microbiota of young children is less diverse than that of adults.
   Conclusions: We show that the establishment of an adult-like intestinal microbiota occurs at a later age than previously reported. Characterizing the microbiota and its development in the early years of life may help identify 'windows of opportunity' for interventional strategies that may promote health and prevent or mitigate disease processes.

AB Wildfires are a pervasive disturbance in boreal forests, and the frequency and intensity of boreal wildfires is expected to increase with climate warming. Boreal forests store a large fraction of global soil organic carbon (C), but relatively few studies have documented how wildfires affect soil microbial communities and soil C dynamics. We used a fire chronosequence in upland boreal forests of interior Alaska with sites that were 1, 7, 12, 24, 55, 90, and 100 years post-fire to examine the short- and long-term responses of fungal community composition, fungal abundance, extracellular enzyme activity, and litter decomposition to wildfires. We hypothesized that post-fire changes in fungal abundance and community composition would constrain decomposition following fires. We found that wildfires altered the composition of soil fungal communities. The relative abundance of ascomycetes significantly increased following fire whereas basidiomycetes decreased. Post-fire decreases in basidiomycete fungi were likely attributable to declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi. Fungal hyphal lengths in the organic horizon significantly declined in response to wildfire, and they required at least 24 years to return to pre-fire levels. Post-fire reductions in fungal hyphal length were associated with decreased activities of hydrolytic extracellular enzymes. In support of our hypothesis, the decomposition rate of aspen and black spruce litter significantly increased as forests recovered from fire. Our results indicate that post-fire reductions in soil fungal abundance and activity likely inhibit litter decomposition following boreal wildfires. Slower rates of litter decay may lead to decreased heterotrophic respiration from soil following fires and contribute to a negative feedback to climate warming.

AB Conservation physiology (CP) and nutritional ecology (NE) are both integrative sciences that share the fundamental aim of understanding the patterns, mechanisms and consequences of animal responses to changing environments. Here, we explore the high-level similarities and differences between CP and NE, identifying as central themes to both fields the multiple timescales over which animals adapt (and fail to adapt) to their environments, and the need for integrative models to study these processes. At one extreme are the short-term regulatory responses that modulate the state of animals in relation to the environment, which are variously considered under the concepts of homeostasis, homeorhesis, enantiostasis, heterostasis and allostasis. In the longer term are developmental responses, including phenotypic plasticity and transgenerational effects mediated by non-genomic influences such as parental physiology, epigenetic effects and cultural learning. Over a longer timescale still are the cumulative genetic changes that take place in Darwinian evolution. We present examples showing how the adaptive responses of animals across these timescales have been represented in an integrative framework from NE, the geometric framework (GF) for nutrition, and close with an illustration of how GF can be applied to the central issue in CP, animal conservation.

AB Life-history theory predicts that individuals should adjust their reproductive effort according to the expected fitness returns on investment. Because sexually selected male traits should provide honest information about male genetic or phenotypic quality, females may invest more when paired with attractive males. However, there is substantial disagreement in the literature whether such differential allocation is a general pattern. Using a comparative meta-regression approach, we show that female birds generally invest more into reproduction when paired with attractive males, both in terms of egg size and number as well as food provisioning. However, whereas females of species with bi-parental care tend to primarily increase the number of eggs when paired with attractive males, females of species with female-only care produce larger, but not more, eggs. These patterns may reflect adaptive differences in female allocation strategies arising from variation in the signal content of sexually selected male traits between systems of parental care. In contrast to reproductive effort, female allocation of immune-stimulants, anti-oxidants and androgens to the egg yolk was not consistently increased when mated to attractive males, which probably reflects the context-dependent costs and benefits of those yolk compounds to females and offspring.

AB Sympatric cryptic species, characterized by low morphological differentiation, pose a challenge to understanding the role of interspecific competition in structuring ecological communities. We used traditional (morphological) and novel molecular methods of diet analysis to study the diet of two cryptic bat species that are sympatric in southern England (Plecotus austriacus and P. auritus) (Fig. 1). Using Roche FLX 454 (Roche, Basel, CH) high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and uniquely tagged generic arthropod primers, we identified 142 prey Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) in the diet of the cryptic bats, 60% of which were assigned to a likely species or genus. The findings from the molecular study supported the results of microscopic analyses in showing that the diets of both species were dominated by lepidopterans. However, HTS provided a sufficiently high resolution of prey identification to determine fine-scale differences in resource use. Although both bat species appeared to have a generalist diet, eared-moths from the family Noctuidae were the main prey consumed. Interspecific niche overlap was greater than expected by chance (O-jk = 0.72, P < 0.001) due to overlap in the consumption of the more common prey species. Yet, habitat associations of nongeneralist prey species found in the diets corresponded to those of their respective bat predator (grasslands for P. austriacus, and woodland for P. auritus). Overlap in common dietary resource use combined with differential specialist prey habitat associations suggests that habitat partitioning is the primary mechanism of coexistence. The performance of HTS is discussed in relation to previous methods of molecular and morphological diet analysis. By enabling species-level identification of dietary components, the application of DNA sequencing to diet analysis allows a more comprehensive comparison of the diet of sympatric cryptic species, and therefore can be an important tool for determining fine-scale mechanisms of coexistence.

AB Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) contribute significantly to a rural household's livelihood in the African semi-arid tropics. This study examines the income from NTFPs and the dependency on these of different socio-economic groups in Northern Benin. Using survey data from 230 households of two villages, we firstly compared incomes of five different ethnic groups being differentiated by their traditional source of livelihood and regional provenance. Secondly, we investigated disparities between three income groups. On average, income from NTFPs accounted for 39% of total household income and had a strong equalizing effect on it. However, the economic relevance of NTFPs differs between households: Poorer households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs in order to fulfill basic needs than wealthier households. However, the latter extract more NTFPs in quantitative terms and have significantly higher cash returns than poorer ones. This is mainly due to a significant greater land holding. Moreover, our study revealed that net income from NTFPs reflects traditional sources of livelihoods of different ethnic groups. In conclusion, both conservation and development strategies should take into consideration the socio-economic context of different beneficiaries of savanna woodland resources in order to apply appropriate measures to poverty reduction.

AB Grain legumes, such as peas (Pisum sativum L), are known to be weak competitors against weeds when grown as the sole crop. In this study, the weed-suppression effect of pea-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) intercropping compared to the respective sole crops was examined in organic field experiments across Western Europe (i.e., Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy). Spring pea (P) and barley (B) were sown either as the sole crop, at the recommended plant density (P100 and B100, respectively), or in replacement (P50B50) or additive (P100B50) intercropping designs for three seasons (2003-2005). The weed biomass was three times higher under the pea sole crops than under both the intercrops and barley sole crops at maturity. The inclusion of joint experiments in several countries and various growing conditions showed that intercrops maintain a highly asymmetric competition over weeds, regardless of the particular weed infestation (species and productivity), the crop biomass or the soil nitrogen availability. The intercropping weed suppression was highly resilient, whereas the weed suppression in pea sole crops was lower and more variable. The pea-barley intercrops exhibited high levels of weed suppression, even with a low percentage of barley in the total biomass. Despite a reduced leaf area in the case of a low soil N availability, the barley sole crops and intercrops displayed high weed suppression, probably because of their strong competitive capability to absorb soil N. Higher soil N availabilities entailed increased leaf areas and competitive ability for light, which contributed to the overall competitive ability against weeds for all of the treatments. The contribution of the weeds in the total dry matter and soil N acquisition was higher in the pea sole crop than in the other treatments, in spite of the higher leaf areas in the pea crops.

AB Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain landscape designs outperform others in the support of native biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife, could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition, many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors, landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50% of the variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that support the well-being of both birds and people.

AB Background Environmental agencies have to take measures to either reduce discharges and emissions of nitrate or to remediate nitrate-polluted water bodies where the nitrate concentrations exceed threshold values. Isotope data can support the identification of nitrate pollution sources and natural attenuation processes of nitrate.
   Review This review article gives an overview of the information available to date regarding nitrate source apportionment in surface waters with the ambition to help improving future studies. Different isotope approaches in combination with physicochemical and hydrological data can successfully be used in source apportionment studies. A sampling strategy needs to be developed based on possible nitrate sources, hydrology and land use. Transformations, transport and mixing processes should also be considered as they can change the isotope composition of the original nitrate source.
   Conclusion Nitrate isotope data interpreted in combination with hydrological and chemical data provide valuable information on the nitrate pollution sources and on the processes nitrate has undergone during its retention and transport in the watershed. This information is useful for the development of an appropriate water management policy.

AB Although individual ecosystems vary greatly in the degree to which they have been invaded by exotic species, it has remained difficult to isolate mechanisms influencing invader success. One largely anecdotal observation is that polluted or degraded areas will accumulate more invaders than less-impacted sites. However, the role of abiotic factors alone in influencing invisibility has been difficult to isolate, often because the supply of potential invaders is confounded with conditions thought to increase vulnerability to invasion. Here, we conducted a field experiment to test how the assemblages of exotic versus native marine invertebrates changed during community assembly under different exposure levels of a common pollutant, copper. The experiment was conducted by deploying fouling panels in a Randomized Block Design in San Francisco Bay. Panels were periodically removed, placed into buckets with differing copper concentrations, and returned to the field after 3 days. This design allowed propagule availability to the plates to be statistically independent of short-term copper exposure. The results demonstrate that copper caused significant differences in community structure. Average native species richness was significantly affected by copper exposure, but average exotic richness was not. The total native species pool within treatments exhibited a greater than 40% decline within increasing copper, while the exotic species pool did not change significantly. These results confirm that anthropogenic alteration of abiotic factors influences invader success, indicating that management strategies to reduce invader impacts should include both efforts to improve environmental conditions as well as reduce invader supply.

AB Grasslands and agroecosystems occupy one-third of the terrestrial area, but their contribution to the global carbon cycle remains uncertain. We used a set of 316 site-years of CO2 exchange measurements to quantify gross primary productivity, respiration, and light-response parameters of grasslands, shrublands/savanna, wetlands, and cropland ecosystems worldwide. We analyzed data from 72 global flux-tower sites partitioned into gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration with the use of the light-response method (Gilmanov, T. G., D. A. Johnson, and N. Z. Saliendra. 2003. Growing season CO2 fluxes in a sagebrushsteppe ecosystem in Idaho: Bowen ratio/energy balance measurements and modeling. Basic and Applied Ecology 4:167-183) from the RANGEFLUX and WORLDGRASSAGRIFLUX data sets supplemented by 46 sites from the FLUXNET La Thuile data set partitioned with the use of the temperature-response method (Reichstein, M., E. Falge, D. Baldocchi, D. Papale, R. Valentini, M. Aubinet, P. Berbigier, C. Bernhofer, N. Buchmann, M. Falk, T. Gilmanov, A. Granier, T. Grunwald, K. Havrankova, D. Janous, A. Knohl, T. Laurela, A.

On the separation of net ecosystem exchange into assimilation and ecosystem respiration: review and improved algorithm. Global Change Biology 11: 1.424-1439). Maximum values of the quantum yield (alpha = 75 mmol.mol(-1)), photosynthetic capacity (A(max) = 3.4 mg CO2 . m(-2).s-1), gross photosynthesis (P-g,P-max = 1.16 g CO2 . m(-2).d(-1)), and ecological light-use efficiency (epsilon(ecol) = 59 mmol . mol(-1)) of managed grasslands and high-production croplands exceeded those of most forest ecosystems, indicating the potential of nonforest ecosystems for uptake of atmospheric CO2. Maximum values of gross primary production (8 600 g CO2 . m(-2).yr(-1)), total ecosystem respiration (7 900 g CO2 . m(-2).yr(-1)), and net CO2 exchange (2 400 g CO2 . m(-2).yr(-1)) were observed for intensively managed grasslands and high-yield crops, and are comparable to or higher than those for forest ecosystems, excluding some tropical forests. On average, 80% of the nonforest sites were apparent sinks for atmospheric CO2, with mean net uptake of 700 g CO2 . m(-2).yr(-1) for intensive grasslands and 933 g CO2 . m(-2).d(-1) for croplands. However, part of these apparent sinks is accumulated in crops and forage, which are carbon pools that are harvested, transported, and decomposed off site. Therefore, although agricultural fields may be predominantly sinks for atmospheric CO2, this does not imply that they are necessarily increasing their carbon stock.

AB suggested in the literature. It is crucial to explore the relative importance and groupings of these factors. This paper aims to identify CSFs associated with stakeholder management in construction projects, and explore their ranking and underlying relationship. 15 CSFs were identified through a literature review, and consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in construction industry. A questionnaire instrument containing these 15 CSFs was sent out to project managers in Hong Kong, and 183 completed questionnaires were retrieved. The top three ranked factors for stakeholder management were "managing stakeholders with social responsibilities", "assessing the stakeholders' needs and constraints to the project", and "communicating with stakeholders properly and frequently". Using factor analysis and considering the high importance of the factor "managing stakeholders with social responsibilities", the 15 CSFs were grouped into five dimensions namely, precondition factor, stakeholder estimation, information inputs, decision making, and sustainable support. All these five groupings and their relationship were included in a framework for successful stakeholder management in construction projects. These findings help to clarify what the high prioritized factors are, and could also be used as an assessment tool to evaluate the performance of stakeholder management and thus help to identify areas for improvement.

AB This paper has extended and updated my earlier list and analysis of candidate models used in theoretical modelling and empirical examination of species-area relationships (SARs). I have also reviewed trivariate models that can be applied to include a second independent variable (in addition to area) and discussed extensively the justifications for fitting curves to SARs and the choice of model. There is also a summary of the characteristics of several new candidate models, especially extended power models, logarithmic models and parameterizations of the negative-exponential family and the logistic family. I have, moreover, examined the characteristics and shapes of trivariate linear, logarithmic and power models, including combination variables and interaction terms. The choice of models according to best fit may conflict with problems of non-normality or heteroscedasticity. The need to compare parameter estimates between data sets should also affect model choice. With few data points and large scatter, models with few parameters are often preferable. With narrow-scale windows, even inflexible models such as the power model and the logarithmic model may produce good fits, whereas with wider-scale windows where inflexible models do not fit well, more flexible models such as the second persistence (P2) model and the cumulative Weibull distribution may be preferable. When extrapolations and expected shapes are important, one should consider models with expected shapes, e.g. the power model for sample area curves and the P2 model for isolate curves. The choice of trivariate models poses special challenges, which one can more effectively evaluate by inspecting graphical plots.

AB Whereas similar ecological requirements lead to trait-convergence assembly patterns (TCAP) of species in communities, the interactions controlling how species associate produce trait-divergence assembly patterns (TDAP). Yet, the linking of the latter to community processes has so far only been suggested. We offer a method to elucidate TCAP and TDAP in ecological community gradients that will help fill this gap.
   We evaluated the correlation between trait-based described communities and ecological gradients, and using partial correlation, we separated the fractions reflecting TCAP and TDAP. The required input data matrices describe operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by traits, communities by the quantities or presence-absence of these OTUs, and community sites by ecological variables. We defined plant functional types (PFTs) or species as community components after fuzzy weighting by the traits. The measured correlations for TCAP and TDAP were tested by permutation. The null model for TDAP preserves the trait convergence, the structure intrinsic in the fuzzy types, and community total abundances and autocorrelation.
   We applied the method to trait-based data from plant communities in south Brazil, one set in natural grassland experimental plots under different nitrogen and grazing levels, and another in sapling communities colonizing Araucaria forest patches of increasing size in a forest-grassland mosaic. In these cases, depending on the traits considered, we found strong evidence of either TCAP or TDAP, or both, that was related to the environmental gradients.
   The method developed is able to reveal TCAP and TDAP that are more likely to be functional for specified ecological gradients, allowing establishment of objective hypotheses on their links to community processes.

AB Understanding how species in a diverse regional pool are spatially distributed with respect to habitat types is a longstanding problem in ecology. Tropical species are expected to be specialists along environmental gradients, and this should result in rapid compositional change (high beta diversity) across landscapes, particularly when alpha diversity is a small fraction of regional diversity. Corollary challenges are then to identify controlling environmental variables and to ask whether species cluster into discrete community types along a gradient.
   We investigated patterns of avian species' distributions in the Tilaran mountains of Costa Rica between 1000 m and 1700 m elevation where a strong moisture gradient exists. High beta diversity was found with both auditory counts adjusted for detectability and extensive capture data, revealing nearly complete change in community composition over a few kilometres on the Pacific slope. As predicted, this beta diversity was roughly twice as high as on temperate mountainsides.
   Partial Mantel analyses and canonical correspondence analysis indicate that change in species composition is highly correlated with change in moisture (and correlated epiphyte cover) at different distances from the continental divide on the Pacific slope. Altitude was not a good predictor of change in species composition, as species composition varies substantially among sites at the same elevation.
   Detrended correspondence analysis and cluster analysis revealed a zone of rapid transition separating a distinct cloud forest community from rainshadow forest. On the Caribbean slope, where a shallower moisture gradient was predicted to result in lower beta diversity, we found lower rates of compositional change and more continuous species turnover.
   Results suggest that habitat specialization of birds is likely a strong ecological force generating high beta diversity in montane landscapes. Despite overall rapid rates of species turnover, zones of relatively coherent composition could be identified.
   Landscapes with such high beta diversity are common in the tropics, although little studied. They offer high benefit/cost opportunities for conservation, particularly as climate change threatens to alter the species composition of communities of habitat specialists.

AB The Global Positioning System (GPS) has been increasingly used during the past decade to monitor the movements of free-ranging animals, This technology allows to automatically relocate fitted animals, which often results into a high-frequency sampling of their trajectory during the study period. However, depending on the objective of trajectory analysis, this study may quickly become difficult, due to the lack of well designed computer programs. For example, the trajectory may be built by several "parts" corresponding to different behaviours of the animal, and the aim of the analysis could be to identify the different parts, and thereby the different activities, based on the properties of the trajectory. This complex task needs to be performed into a flexible computing environment, to facilitate exploratory analysis of its properties, In this paper, we present a new class of object of the R software, the class "Itraj" included in the package adehabitat, allowing the analysis of animals' trajectories. We developed this class of data after an extensive review of the literature on the analysis of animal movements. This class of data facilitates the computation of descriptive parameters of the trajectory (such as the relative angles between successive moves, distance between successive relocations, etc.), graphical exploration of these parameters, as well a numerous tests and analyses developed in the literature (first passage time, trajectory partitioning, etc.). Finally, this package also contains numerous examples of animal trajectories, and a working example illustrating the use of the package. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Many studies in northern Europe, North and South America, describe regional trends of population densification at altitudinal and polar tree lines during the 20th century. The purpose of this study was (1) to ascertain if this regeneration enhancement is present across the alpine ecotones of the Pyrenees, (2) if synchronous recruitment trends are common among the studied populations and (3) to determine the tree limit stability during recent decades.
   2. Twelve Pinus uncinata tree line populations were studied on the Iberian eastern range of the Pyrenees. Rectangular plots ranging from 940 to 7600 m(2) were set along the forest-alpine grassland transition; more than 3600 P. uncinata individuals were mapped. Tree size and age were used to establish the demographic structure at each stand, and to characterize abrupt or smooth transition patterns along the tree line ecotone. A new procedure for estimating missing rings in off-centre cores was developed to ensure a correct interval for the age-classes distribution analysis.
   3. Past and recent synchronous recruitment trends (mid 19th century, second half of the 20th century) were apparent at the tree line over the studied area of the Pyrenean range. The ecotone densification since the 1950s occurred in the context of climatic warming and substantial land use abandonment. Both gradual and step-like transition patterns in tree age and size along the ecotone were observed.
   4. Regeneration enhancement in the last approximately 30 years appears as an abrupt change in population age structures, which could indicate the importance of feedback mechanisms for tree line recruitment dynamics. In 50% of the surveyed tree lines ecotone densification has been coupled to tree limit shifts in the recent past. This indicates both great tree limit sensitivity to short-term climatic changes and the presence of differential tree line dynamics at a regional scale.
   5. Synthesis. The observed past and recent synchronous recruitment trends suggest the presence of regional climatic factors modulating tree line structure and dynamics. However, tree line dynamics in the Pyrenees have been widely affected by local anthropogenic activities. We suggest that the presence of step-like tree line transitions in tree age can be considered an evidence of recent human-induced disturbances when no other major natural disturbances affect the tree line dynamics.

AB A fine-resolution pollen-stratigraphical study, supported by macrofossil analysis, has been made at Krakenes Lake, western Norway through the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition and the early Holocene. The median sample-age difference is 14 cal. yr for the period 9175-11 625 cal. yr BP. The chronology is based on 57 AMS radiocarbon dates. The pollen stratigraphy is interpreted as a primary succession following deglaciation at the end of the Younger Dryas. Palynological richness, compositional turnover and rates of assemblage change are estimated from the pollen-stratigraphical data. Comparisons between palynological turnover at Krakenes and floristic turnover on recently deglaciated modern glacier forelands suggest a comparable primary succession and turnover at Krakenes. However, the arrival and expansion of Betula pubescens (tree birch) was delayed by about 450 years. Possible reasons for this lag are discussed. Comparisons between turnover estimates for pollen and for diatoms through the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition highlight differences in the response dynamics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at Krakenes Lake. This fine-resolution study links the long temporal perspective provided by palaeoecology with the fine temporal scales of modern ecological observations. The primary succession following rapid climate warming at Krakenes provides a context for other past and present responses to climate warming and it can provide a long-term perspective on responses to projected future climate warming.

AB Exotic species invasions create almost ideal conditions for promoting evolutionary diversification: establishment of allopatric populations in new environmental conditions; altered ecological opportunities for native species; and new opportunities for hybridization between previously allopatric taxa. Here, we review recent studies of the evolutionary consequences of species invasions, revealing abundant and widespread examples of exotic species promoting evolutionary diversification via increased genetic differentiation among populations of both exotic and native species and the creation of new hybrid lineages. Our review indicates that, although the well-documented reductions to biodiversity caused by exotic species might outweigh the increases resulting from diversification, a complete understanding of the net effects of exotic species on biodiversity in the long term will require consideration of both.

AB Although the evolutionary importance of natural hybridization has been debated for decades, it has become increasingly clear that hybridization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of many plant and animal taxa, sometimes resulting in the formation of entirely new species. Although some hybrid species retain the base chromosome number of their parents, others combine the full chromosomal complements of their progenitors. Hybrid speciation can thus produce two fundamentally different types of evolutionary lineages, yet relatively little is known about the factors influencing ploidy level in hybrid neospecies. We estimated genetic divergence between species pairs that have given rise to homoploid and polyploid hybrid species and found that divergence is significantly greater for the parents of polyploids, even after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Our data thus provide the first direct evidence in support of the notion that the extent of genomic divergence between hybridizing species influences the likelihood of diploid versus polyploid hybrid speciation.

AB Measurements of trait community composition are known to be sensitive to the way species abundance is assessed, but not to what extent. This was investigated by considering two of the most commonly used indices of community trait composition, trait averages and functional diversity, in bee communities along a post-fire environmental gradient. The indices were computed using three different species abundance measurements (log and unlog number of individuals and species occurrence only) and 5 traits. For certain traits, the responses of the indices to fire varied according to how species abundance was measured. The measurements that took species abundance into account in the most distinct way (e.g., occurrence vs. unlog data) produced the least similar results for all traits. Species were then grouped into different classes on the basis of their relative abundance (i.e., dominants, subdominants, and rare species). As a result, the measure that attaches the highest importance to the abundance of species (unlog data) related mostly to the dominant species traits, while the measure attaching the lowest (i.e., species occurrence) related more to rare species traits. Species diversity was mostly independent of trait averages and functional diversity, regardless of the measure of species abundance used. We also quantified functional redundancy (i.e., the potential minus the observed functional diversity in each community). When more weight was attached to species abundance, redundancy decreased and tended to be less correlated with species diversity. Overall, the way species abundance is taken into consideration in indices of functional composition offers promising insights into the way community assembly mechanisms respond to environmental changes.

AB The effect of boat noise on the behaviour of bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus was investigated in the Egadi Islands, Sicily, during spring 2005 using a fixed tuna trap set near shipping routes. Tuna behaviour was observed when exposed to both natural ambient sound and sound generated by hydrofoil passenger ferries, small boats and large car ferries. Acoustical and behavioural analyses were conducted with and without extraneous sound to define a list of behavioural categories. Each vessel produced different engine sounds with regard to their composition and bandwidth, and all were distinctly different from ambient sound levels. In the absence of boat noise, tuna assumed a concentrated coordinated school structure with unidirectional swimming and without a precise shape. When a car terry approached, tuna changed swimming direction and increased their vertical movement toward surface or bottom; the school exhibited an unconcentrated structure and uncoordinated swimming behaviour. Hydrofoils appeared to elicit a similar response, but for shorter periods. Agonistic behaviour was more evident when exposed to sounds from outboard motors of small boats. This study showed that local noise pollution generated by boats produced behavioural deviations in tuna schools. Schooling enhances tuna homing accuracy during their spawning migration, and an alteration in schooling behaviour can affect the accuracy of their migration to spawning and feeding grounds.

AB Species richness, cover and community structure of reef-building corals were assessed at 599 sites on 135 reefs along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) between 1994 and 2001, with focus on the nearshore area. Communities were described hierarchically, with smaller regional communities forming part of higher level communities at increasing spatial scales. Site richness increased from the coast to the mid-continental shelf, declining on the outer shelf. Richness also increased with depth to 5 in, stabilizing thereafter. An anomaly was present in a 400 km section adjacent to the northern, 'wet tropics' coast, where site richness was 67 and 41 % lower than the adjacent far northern and central GBR, respectively; this was probably due to the disturbance regime, with an apparent anthropogenic component. Site richness also declined in the Southern GBR, probably due to naturally marginal conditions. All indicator species had highest values in five small Far Northern and Central GBR communities. In the eight depauperate communities no indicator species had high values, indicating that these communities represent degraded, yet potentially transitional forms of the more diverse communities of the Far Northern and Central GBR. The study shows that on the GBR, disturbance results in the local removal of corals rather than a shift to suites of other coral species.

AB Hybridization is an important factor in the evolution of plants; however, many of the studies that have examined hybrid fitness have been concerned with the study of early generation hybrids. We examined the early- and late-generation fitness consequences of hybridization between two ecotypes of the selfing annual Avena barbata in a greenhouse environment as well as in two natural environments. Fitness of early generation (F-2) hybrids reflects both the action of dominance effects (hybrid vigor) and recombination (hybrid breakdown) and was not significantly different from that of the midparent in any environment. Fitness of later generation (F-6) recombinant inbred lines (RILS) derived from the cross reflect both the loss of early generation heterozygosity as well as disruption of any coadapted gene complexes present in the parents. In all environments, F-6 RILs were on average significantly less fit than the (equally homozygous) midparent, indicating hybrid breakdown through the disruption of epistatic interactions. However, the inbred F-6 were also less fit than the heterozygous F-2, indicating that hybrid vigor also occurs in A. barbata, and counteracts hybrid breakdown in early generation hybrids. Also, although the F-6 generation mean is lower than the midparent mean, there are individual genotypes within the F-6 generation that are capable of outperforming the parental ecotypes in the greenhouse. Fewer hybrid genotypes are capable of outperforming the parental ecotypes in the field. Overall, these experiments demonstrate how a single hybridization event can result in a number of outcomes including hybrid vigor, hybrid breakdown, and transgressive segregation, which interact to determine long-term hybrid fitness.

AB The shift in emphasis away from the single-species focus of traditional fisheries management towards an ecosystem approach to management requires application of indicators, of ecosystem state. Further, an ecosystem approach to management requires the identification of ecological reference points against which management objectives might be set. In applying indicators, identifying reference points, and setting objectives, an obvious requirement is that the indicators respond primarily to the anthropogenic activity being managed and are sufficiently sensitive that impacts of the activity and the responses to management action are clearly demonstrable. Here we apply a suite of 12 indicators to Scottish August groundfish survey data collected in the northern North Sea over the period 1925-1997. These include indicators of size structure, life-history character composition, species diversity, and trophic structure within the community. Our choice of analytical design has two purposes; first to show that fishing has unequivocally affected these various aspects of the structure of the groundfish community, and second to illustrate an approach by which long time-series data sets might be used to identify possible management reference points. The results are discussed in the context of selecting ecological indicators in support of an ecosystem approach to management and determining appropriate reference points for objective-setting.

AB The relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors in shaping personality traits is of fundamental relevance to biologists and social scientists. Individual animals vary in the way they cope with challenges in their environment, comparable with variation in human personalities. This variation has a substantial genetic basis. Here we describe experiments showing the strength of environmental factors (food availability and sibling competition) in shaping personality traits in a passerine bird (Parus major). We manipulated the early rearing condition in two lines (F4) bidirectionally selected for different personalities (fast line: high exploration speed and high aggression; slow line: low exploration speed and low aggression) with a food rationing protocol inducing an impairment in growth rate and an enhancement in levels of offspring solicitation (begging behaviour). Growth impairment was more marked in the slow line. In a first experiment each nest contained experimental and control siblings of the same line (within-nests design). Slow chicks became much faster than their parents in the exploration tests regardless of the treatment, whereas fast chicks had scores similar to their parents and showed no treatment effect. As it consequence, the line difference in exploration behaviour of the offspring was not apparent in the juvenile phase. Six months later the offspring of the slow line was still relatively fast, but lines differed in exploration, since the fast line became even more fast. Food-rationed birds of the fast line were more aggressive than both controls and their fathers, while treatment did not affect the slow line. In a second experiment, carried out only in the slow line, each nest contained either control or experimental siblings (between-nests design). Now, only the food-rationed chicks became faster in exploration. We suggest that the shift in the controls in the within-nests design wits due to enhanced sibling competition, forced by the experimental chick. Indeed, the control chicks in the first experiment begged more persistently and had higher exploration scores than the control chicks in the between-nests design. Environmental factors during ontogeny modulate the expression of phenotypic traits against the background of the reaction norm allowed by the genome even in selected lines of animals resulting in profound and reliable differences in behaviour.

AB To examine the performance and information content of different marker systems, comparative assessment of population genetic diversity was undertaken in nine populations of Athyrium distentifolium using nine genomic and 10 expressed sequence tag (EST) microsatellite (SSR) loci, and 265 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci from two primer combinations. In range-wide comparisons (European vs. North American populations), the EST-SSR loci showed more reliable amplification and produced more easily scorable bands than genomic simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Genomic SSRs showed significantly higher levels of allelic diversity than EST-SSRs, but there was a significant correlation in the rank order of population diversities revealed by both marker types. When AFLPs, genomic SSRs, and EST-SSRs are considered, comparisons of different population diversity metrics/markers revealed a mixture of significant and nonsignificant rank-order correlations. However, no hard incongruence was detected (in no pairwise comparison of populations did different marker systems or metrics detect opposingly significant different amounts of variation). Comparable population pairwise estimates of F-ST were obtained for all marker types, but whilst absolute values for genomic and EST-SSRs were very similar (F-ST = 0.355 and 0.342, respectively), differentiation was consistently higher for AFLPs in pairwise and global comparisons (global AFLP F-ST = 0.496). The two AFLP primer combinations outperformed 18 SSR loci in assignment tests and discriminatory power in phenetic cluster analyses. The results from marker comparisons on A. distentifolium are discussed in the context of the few other studies on natural plant populations comparing microsatellite and AFLP variability.

AB The rapid growth of cities in many parts of the world has stimulated an increasing number of ecological studies of urban environments. Here, 12 study sites in the city of Belo Horizonte (MG), southeastern Brazil, were compared to analyze the effects of habitat changes related to urbanization on the species richness and abundance of native wasps and bees. Two spatial scales were considered: large portions of the urban landscape (entire sites) and small areas within these sites (public squares). Overall, the abundance of advanced eusocial bees (i.e. stingless bees), which were the dominant species, was directly affected by the loss of vegetation cover and the increase of buildings associated with urbanization. The magnitude of this effect varied according to the nesting habits of each species. The loss of vegetation cover associated with urbanization also had a negative effect on the abundance and species richness of advanced eusocial wasps. Generalist species of bees and wasps, such as Trigorta spinipes and Polybia occidentalis, were very abundant and not sensitive to the habitat changes related to urbanization. Advanced eusocial bees also responded to small-scale habitat changes (size and vegetation cover of public squares). No relation was found between the solitary and the primitive eusocial wasps and bees and the habitat changes considered here. Conservation strategies in urban environments need to consider different spatial scales in order to maintain or enhance the local diversity of wasps and bees. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the last decade, much effort was dedicated to the reconstruction of past climate at high temporal resolution. Here, we show the suitability of chrysophyte cysts from lake sediments for revealing continental climate variability when used in sensitive sites, such as those in high mountains. We demonstrate that altitude is a main factor influencing the present distribution of chrysophytes and develop a transfer function to evaluate the local "altitude anomaly'' on a lake site throughout time. Based on our knowledge of chrysophyte ecology, the altitude anomalies are interpreted as winter/spring climate signatures. The method was applied to a Holocene record from a lake in the Pyrenees showing submillennial climatic variability in this northwestern Mediterranean zone. A warming trend was present from the early Holocene to 4 kyear BP. Comparison with pollen-based reconstructions of summer temperatures denoted a contrasting decrease in continentality between the two parts of the Holocene. Oscillations of 1 cycle per ca. 2,000 years appeared throughout the record. The warmest Holocene winters were recorded during the Medieval Warm Period at ca. AD 900 and 450 and the Roman Warm Period (2.7 - 2.4 kyear BP). Winters in the period AD 1,050 - 1,175 were inferred to be as cold as in the Little Ice Age. The period between 3 and 7 kyear BP showed lower intensity in the fluctuations than in early and late Holocene. The cold event, 8,200 years ago, appeared embedded in a warm fluctuation. Another cold fluctuation was recorded around 9 kyear BP, which is in agreement with Irish and Greenland records.

AB We used standardized techniques to assemble eighteen food webs in streams. Our aim was to identify the determinants of food-web structure with particular reference to energy availability (related to land use), spatial heterogeneity and ecosystem size (both independent of land use). Forested streams displayed lower algal productivity and higher standing crops of organic matter than the grassland streams. The organic matter in the pine streams was probably of lower quality than that elsewhere. Measures of energy availability and spatial heterogeneity predicted species richness and connectance. A combination of energy availability, spatial heterogeneity and ecosystem size accounted for the representation of particular invertebrate feeding groups in the streams. Algal production and organic matter standing crop were important determinants of invertebrate biomass and overall food-web structure. Grassland sites showed a positive relationship between algal productivity and food chain length whereas forest sites displayed a positive relationship between ecosystem size and food chain length. Therefore, these results provide support for both Pimm's productivity hypothesis and Cohen and Newman's ecosystem size hypothesis.

AB One of the most important features of biosystems is how they are able to maintain local order (low entropy) within their system boundaries. At the ecosystem scale, this organization can be observed in the thermodynamic parameters that describe it, such that these parameters can be used to track ecosystem growth and development during succession. Thermodynamically, ecosystem growth is the increase of energy throughflow and stored biomass, and ecosystem development is the internal reorganization of these energy mass stores, which affect transfers, transformations, and time lags within the system. Several proposed hypotheses describe thermodynamically the orientation or natural tendency that ecosystems follow during succession, and here, we consider five: minimize specific entropy production, maximize dissipation, maximize exergy storage (includes biomass and information), maximize energy throughflow, and maximize retention time. These thermodynamic orientors were previously all shown to occur to some degree during succession, and here we present a refinement by observing them during different stages of succession. We view ecosystem succession as a series of four growth and development stages: boundary, structural, network, and informational. We demonstrate how each of these ecological thermodynamic orientors behaves during the different growth and development stages, and show that while all apply during some stages only maximizing energy throughflow and maximizing exergy storage are applicable during all four stages. Therefore, we conclude that the movement away from thermodynamic equilibrium, and the subsequent increase in organization during ecosystem growth and development, is a result of system components and configurations that maximize the flux of useful energy and the amount of stored exergy. Empirical data and theoretical models support these conclusions. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Forests are an important source for fiber and fuel for humans and contain the majority of the total terrestrial carbon (C). The amount of C stored in the vegetation and soil are strongly influenced by environmental constraints on annual C uptake and decomposition and time since disturbance. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) nitrogen deposition, and climate warming induced by greater greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere influence C accumulation rates of forests, but their effects will likely differ in direction and magnitude among forest ecosystems. The net interactive effect of global change on the forest C cycle is poorly understood. The growing demand for wood fiber and fuel by humans and the ongoing anthropogenic perturbations of the climate have changed the natural disturbance regimes (i.e., frequency and intensity); these changes influence the net exchange of CO2 between forests and the atmosphere. To date, the role of forest products in the global C cycle have largely been ignored, and important emissions associated with the production, transport, and utilization of the forest products have been excluded, leading to erroneous conclusions about net C storage in forest products.

AB We examined long-term changes in the macroalgal vegetation at Stora Borno Island in the inner Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish Skagerrak coast. This was made possible by access to a 1941 diving investigation. The same sites were reinvestigated in 1998. Community composition and depth distributions of species were compared and changes were analyzed with focus on functional groups (size, thallus shape, and life-history traits). We discovered a significant decrease in the depth extension of macroalgal species and a dramatic decline of species richness in the lower littoral (below 1.6 m of depth) compared with 57 years earlier. Ordination analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in the community composition between the two study periods. In general, small (<10 cm), thin, filamentous, and aseasonal ephemerals increased in relative abundance, whereas larger (>10 cm), coarsely branched, and perennial algae decreased. Calibrations of individual species to local sediment cover, using canonical correspondence analysis, indicated that part of the change in species composition was related to sediment load. Furthermore, large-scale climate differences (NAO Winter Index) between the study periods indicated a higher impact of Baltic Sea and Kattegat water in the nutrient dynamics of the fjord in the 1998 study. We concluded that the observed long-term changes in the macroalgal community at Stora Borno Island were consistent with an increased nutrient availability.

AB Subalpine meadows, which traditionally were mown every other year, are particularly rich in plant species, especially forbs. Near Davos (Switzerland) we compared the vegetation of mown sites with that of sites grazed for up to 50 years by non-lactating cows. We recorded an overall mean of 51.5 plant species per 4x4 in plot. Among grazed sites, evenness decreased with time since conversion to grazing (-0.11 in 50 years; P<0.05), suggesting progressive vegetation change, which may eventually result in the loss of species. Ground cover by forbs tended to be higher in mown than in grazed sites (by 7.2%; P<0.1). The proportion of not-clonally colonising perennial species decreased after conversion to grazing (-7.72%; in 50 years, P<0.05), while the cover by graminoid species increased (+14.2% in 50 years; P<0.1). More intensively grazed sites had a lower cover of dwarf shrubs and higher cover of legume species (P<0.05). Because grazing negatively affects both botanical richness and agricultural quality, mowing of traditionally mown subalpine meadows should be maintained, and recently grazed meadows should be reconverted to mowing.

AB The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of common ancestry, and of geographical or reproductive isolation, in genetic divergence in populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Using seven DNA microsatellite loci we compared the effects of habitat type, drainage system and geographical proximity on genetic distance among 16 populations situated in an area in Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) that became deglaciated approximate to 12 000 years ago. Stickleback population structure correlated only weakly with drainage system, whereas the primary divergence was among habitat types. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that lake (n = 7) and river (n = 5) populations formed two distinct clades (Cavalli-Sforza's and Edwards' chord distance, 82-100% bootstrap support) at approximately equal genetic distances to a third clade, comprising putative estuarine (n = 4) ancestors. Allele frequencies in lake and river populations represented different subsets of the genetically more diverse estuarine populations. In nested AMOVAS approximately twice the genetic variance was distributed among lake vs. river vs. estuarine populations as compared with the combined effects of drainage system and geographical distance. Limited gene flow between habitat types must have been established after postglacial colonization, suggesting ecological hybrid inferiority or behavioural mating barriers between ecotypes. Within estuarine and lake populations, population differentiation followed an isolation-by-distance model. Given the high observed heterozygosities within the 16 study populations (H-O = 0.65-0.87), the mean divergence between lake and river population pairs (F-ST = 0.18 +/- 0.007) would be reached after 300-6000 generations in a stepwise mutation model, depending on the size of N-e. This demonstrates both the utility of hypervariable microsatellites for detecting recent population divergences and the danger of operating at temporal or spatial scales which are beyond their resolution.

ID BOREAL; COLEOPTERA; NORTHERN; INSECTS; IMPACT
AB We studied how variations in fire severity and the degree of cutting before burning affected soil invertebrates in a Pinus sylvestris forest in central Sweden. A varied depth of burn in the mor layer was obtained by exclusion of rain and addition of fuel in small plots (1 m x 2 m) in clear-cut, selectively cut and uncut part of the forest before large-scale prescribed burning took place. Soil samples were taken from the plots immediately before, the day after, and two months after the fire. The overall mortality of invertebrates depended on the proportion of organic soil consumed by the fire, and for individual taxa it ranged between 59 and 100%. Invertebrates that lived deeper in soil suffered lesser mortality than those in the vegetation and litter layers did. Greater mobility in soil (Staphylinidae) or a thick cuticle (Oribatediae, Elateridae) may have contributed to the higher survival observed in these taxa. The beetles Atomaria pulchra (Cryptophagidae), Corticaria rubripes (Lathridiidae), and other fire-favoured insects colonised the burned forest the very day the fire burned. These species preferred the hard-burned plots and the uncut stand for colonisation. Sixty days after the fire, the abundance of invertebrates was lower in the burned cut stands compared to the burned uncut stand. The species composition of beetles in the burned stands was then characterised by a few very abundant fire-favoured species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This review highlights four major topics in plant flooding research: the processes underlying vegetation zonation in the floodplain, the challenges of using model species to reveal adaptive responses in shoots and roots, the role of micro-organisms in flooded soils in relation to plant growth, and the molecular regulation of the hormone ethylene which is heavily involved in the adaptation reaction of flood-resistant plants. Model species and vegetation strategies are used to unravel mechanisms of vegetation zonation in the river floodplain. In the case of woodlands, hydrological conditions determine to a large extent their zonation patterns under natural conditions. For softwood species, such as Salicaceae, the interaction between water levels and timing of seed dispersal is the dominating process determining their establishment success on river banks. Their strategy is well adapted to irregular, high and prolonged floods. Hardwood species, Quercus, Fraxinus, Ulmus and Acer, are hood-sensitive and inhabit the higher sites. They mainly have heavy seeds and germinate under shaded conditions. The most shade-tolerant hardwood species are the least well adapted to flooding. Anthropogenically influenced parts of the floodplain are characterized by grasslands with elevation level and management practices determining the species composition. Low-lying grasslands have flood-tolerant species; elevated zones are seldom flooded and have flooding-sensitive species. Following Grime (1998([59])), plant species of major vegetation types within the floodplain zone can be divided into three categories - dominants, subordinates and transients - illustrating the diversity in plant species in relation to environmental properties. Model species that are indicative of the different conditions in the various zones are chosen to help in the understanding of morphological and physiological adaptations at the plant level. The formation of aerenchymatous roots and the capacity to elongate shoot parts upon submergence are among the main responses of surviving plants. The role of hormones in the adaptation reaction is emphasized. Owing to high porosities in roots of flood-tolerant plants, radial oxygen loss greatly influences nitrification and denitrification processes in the flooded soil. Nutrient cycles are restored by root-derived oxygen and the oxygenated rhizosphere is detoxified. A new development in flooding ecology is the unravelling of the molecular regulation of hormonally controlled processes. The expression of an ethylene receptor gene in Rumex palustris is highlighted. This paper ends with some suggestions for future flooding research.

AB Nematode communities were monitored intensively through a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) growing season in plots managed by conventional and organic farming practices. The temporal dynamics of individual species of bacterial-feeding nematodes differed and suggested differing importance of species in their contribution to N-mineralization in the organically managed soil. Species with r-selected, colonizer characteristics were most responsive to incorporation of organic matter and the subsequent increase of microbial biomass. Bacterial-feeding nematode populations were lowest early in the growing season, when tomato plants exhibited symptoms of nitrogen deficiency. We hypothesize that increasing abundance, biomass and activity of these nematodes in the spring by organic matter incorporation at the end of the previous crop would reduce the observed nitrogen stress. Fungal-feeding nematodes were more abundant in the conventional than the organic plots during periods of organic matter decomposition, possibly related to the higher carbon:nitrogen ratios of the crop residues incorporated into the conventional soils than of the manures and leguminous cover crops incorporated into the organic soils. Predaceous and omnivore nematode populations were low in both farming systems, and plant-parasitic nematode species reflected the crop sequences in rotations used in each system.

AB Studies of invertebrate production in trout streams have often shown prey production to be insufficient to support trout production while simultaneously providing a reasonable surplus of prey (Alien paradox). The Alien paradox was explained by analyzing a comprehensive production budget for a trout stream in New Zealand. Budget compartments included primary production, production by brown trout and surficial and hyporheic macroinvertebrates, input of terrestrial invertebrates, and cannibalism by trout. Ecological efficiencies from the literature were used to estimate food demands. Although much of the food demand by trout was apparently derived from surficial macroinvertebrates, a balanced budget was obtained only when all other prey sources were included. The budget indicated that surplus production by benthic macroinvertebrates was nil. However, given the uncertainty of budget statistics, surpluses as high as similar to 10-20% would probably not be detected. Secondary production by primary consumers required only similar to 20% of total primary production, indicating strong top-down control of herbivory by trout. Results from this study, other recent studies showing strong effects of trout on stream food webs, and the long tradition of the Alien paradox suggest that in productive streams (>100 kg wet mass trout ha(-1) yr(-1)) trout may consume most (>80%) benthic prey production.

AB We examined the influence of local and landscape-level attributes of fragmented habitats in shrub-steppe habitats on the breeding distributions of Sage (Amphispiza belli) and Brewer's (Spizella breweri) Sparrows, Sage Thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus) Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris), and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) in the Snake River Plains of southwestern Idaho. We developed habitat (resource) selection models for each species by combining bird counts conducted from 1991 through 1933 with local vegetation characteristics and landscape attributes derived from satellite imagery. Site selection by shrubsteppe species (Sage and Brewer's Sparrows and Sage Thrashers) depended on local vegetation cover and landscape features, such as the patch size of shrub habitats or the spatial similarity of sites. Marginal sites for these species (with species present in one of three years) were intermediate between unoccupied (never present) and occupied sites along environmental gradients characterized by increasing size of shrub habitat patches and total shrub cover and by decreasing disturbance. Horned Larks and Western Meadowlarks, typical grassland species, were not sensitive to landscape features, and their occupancy depended on the amount of grassland or shrub cozier. In contrast to shrubsteppe species, sites that varied by occupancy rates of Western Meadowlarks did not significantly differ in vegetation or landscape components. Our results demonstrate that fragmentation of shrubsteppe significantly influenced the presence of shrub-obligate species. Because of restoration difficulties, the disturbance of semiarid shrubsteppe may cause irreversible loss of habitat and significant long-term consequences for the conservation of shrub-obligate birds.

AB Paradigms based upon physical and geochemical bottom-up processes or trophic cascade/top down theory have been developed to explain heterogeneity of freshwater zooplankton, but these paradigms taken alone seem unable to encompass the full range of zooplankton variability and have led to controversy. The goal of the study is to test the hypothesis that both abiotic and biotic environmental factors, and spatial structuring, explain simultaneously the large-scale spatial heterogeneity of freshwater zooplankton in Quebec lakes. Partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis (Partial CCA) was used to partition the variance of zooplankton species abundances into independent components: a) non-spatial environmental factors (physics, chemistry, morphometry, phytoplankton and fish communities), b) spatial component of environmental influence, c) pure spatial factors (geographic coordinates), and d) undetermined. Our study shows that pure and spatially-structured abiotic and biotic environmental factors (a+b) explain 48% of the variation of zooplankton within Quebec lakes. Our study supports the multiple driving forces hypothesis and shows that the control model of the zooplankton structure within Quebec lakes includes both abiotic factors (mainly related to the water chemistry gradients) and biotic bottom-up (phytoplankton) and top-down (fish) factors. Across our large geographic scale, the abiotic factors, especially those related to water chemistry, are the main environmental processes explaining zooplankton community structure variability within Quebec. Pure spatial factors (c) have small and nonsignificant contribution (8%) to zooplankton variation. The large amount of unexplained variation (d: 44%) suggests that other external factors, operating at local scales and not taken into account in this study, can exert influence on lake zooplankton structure.

AB Age-0 largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides were studied in Bay Springs Reservoir, Mississippi, to determine if the larger young had greater survival through their first winter and if this survival was influenced by levels of energy reserves. Abundance decreased from 542 young/ hectare in June, when fish averaged 37 mm total length, to 12/hectare in March, when lengths averaged 149 mm. The length-frequency distribution of this year-class was positively skewed during June-August, became bimodal during September-January, and lost most of the smaller mode by March. During September-January, fish in the smaller mode decreased in abundance from 176 to 9/hectare and their mean length remained near 60 mm; fish in the larger mode decreased in abundance from 76 to 27/hectare and increased in length from 108 to 154 mm. Whole-body lipid content increased from 3.5% of dry body weight in fall to 5.9% in December and decreased to 3.3% in March. All young had equal amounts of stored lipid by late fall, but by March the surviving small young had less lipid than large young, suggesting that during winter smaller fish spent their reserves at a faster rate. Protein content averaged 74.6% of the dry body weight and neither differed among months nor changed with fish length. Mortality of the smallest young was accelerated in late fall and winter, coinciding with decreases in lipid stores and rapid drops in water temperature.

AB Wolf-ungulate interactions were studied in the pristine deciduous and mixed forests of the Bialowieza National Park in 1985-1989.  The study period included two severe and two mild winters.  The community of ungulates inhabiting Bialowieza National Park consisted of red deer Cervus elaphus, 55% of all ungulates; wild boar Sus scrofa, 42%; and roe deer Capreolus capreolus, moose Alces alces, and European bison Bison bonasus, about 1% each.  The average size of red deer groups increased from 2.7 (SD 2.35) in spring and summer to 6.9 (SD 6.84) in autumn and winter.  In winter the group size of red deer was positively correlated with the depth of snow cover and negatively correlated with the mean daily temperature.  Average group size of wild boar did not change significantly between seasons; it was 6.8 (SD 5.16) in spring and summer and 5.7 (SD 4.67) in autumn and winter.  Analysis of 144 wolf scats showed that wolves preyed selectively on red deer.  In October-April, Cervidae (mostly red deer) constituted 91% of biomass consumed by wolves, while wild boar made up only 8%.  In May-September deer formed 77% of prey biomass, and the share of wild boar increased to 22%.  In all seasons of the year wolves selected juveniles from deer and boar populations:  61% of red deer and 94% of wild boar of determined age recovered from wolves' scats were young < 1 year old.  Analysis of 117 carcasses of ungulates found in Bialowieza National Park showed that predation was the predominant mortality factor for red deer (40 killed, 10 dead from causes other than predation) and roe deer (4 killed, none dead).  Wild boar suffered most from severe winter conditions (8 killed, 56 dead).  The percentage of ungulates that had died from undernutrition and starvation in the total mortality was proportional to the severity of winter.

AB Biodiversity is essential to healthy ecosystem function, influencing productivity and resilience to disturbance. Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and risks unacceptable environmental consequences. Global biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, to better identify high priority areas for conservation and to help maintain essential ecosystem goods and services. Traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral information content. However, questions regarding the complex drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of spectral diversity biodiversity relationship confound diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be better understood before these methods can be operationally applied. To address some of these topics, we (1) review the history of remote sensing approaches in biodiversity estimation, summarizing the pros and cons of different methods, (2) illustrate successes and major gaps of remote sensing of biodiversity, and (3) identify promising future directions. We focus on emerging methods using spectral diversity (optical diversity) as a proxy for terrestrial plant diversity that offer to revolutionize the study of diversity in its different dimensions (phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity) from remote sensing. We also discuss remaining knowledge gaps and ways spectral diversity might be effectively integrated into a global biodiversity monitoring system, bridging a gap between ecology and remote sensing.

AB In ecology, the true causal structure for a given problem is often not known, and several plausible models and thus model predictions exist. It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are often demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available. We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model's predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models, and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will often be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimized and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is often context dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.

AB We surveyed 807 researchers (494 ecologists and 313 evolutionary biologists) about their use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), including cherry picking statistically significant results, p hacking, and hypothesising after the results are known (HARKing). We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.

AB The utility of plant functional traits for predictive ecology relies on our ability to interpret trait variation across multiple taxonomic and ecological scales. Using extensive data sets of trait variation within species, across species and across communities, we analysed whether and at what scales leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits show predicted trait-trait covariation. We found that most variation in LES traits is often, but not universally, at high taxonomic levels (between families or genera in a family). However, we found that trait covariation shows distinct taxonomic scale dependence, with some trait correlations showing opposite signs within vs. across species. LES traits responded independently to environmental gradients within species, with few shared environmental responses across traits or across scales. We conclude that, at small taxonomic scales, plasticity may obscure or reverse the broad evolutionary linkages between leaf traits, meaning that variation in LES traits cannot always be interpreted as differences in resource use strategy.

AB Dispersal is a process of central importance for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations and communities, because of its diverse consequences for gene flow and demography. It is subject to evolutionary change, which begs the question, what is the genetic basis of this potentially complex trait? To address this question, we (i) review the empirical literature on the genetic basis of dispersal, (ii) explore how theoretical investigations of the evolution of dispersal have represented the genetics of dispersal, and (iii) discuss how the genetic basis of dispersal influences theoretical predictions of the evolution of dispersal and potential consequences.
   Dispersal has a detectable genetic basis in many organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. Generally, there is evidence for significant genetic variation for dispersal or dispersal-related phenotypes or evidence for the micro-evolution of dispersal in natural populations. Dispersal is typically the outcome of several interacting traits, and this complexity is reflected in its genetic architecture: while some genes of moderate to large effect can influence certain aspects of dispersal, dispersal traits are typically polygenic. Correlations among dispersal traits as well as between dispersal traits and other traits under selection are common, and the genetic basis of dispersal can be highly environment-dependent.
   By contrast, models have historically considered a highly simplified genetic architecture of dispersal. It is only recently that models have started to consider multiple loci influencing dispersal, as well as non-additive effects such as dominance and epistasis, showing that the genetic basis of dispersal can influence evolutionary rates and outcomes, especially under non-equilibrium conditions. For example, the number of loci controlling dispersal can influence projected rates of dispersal evolution during range shifts and corresponding demographic impacts. Incorporating more realism in the genetic architecture of dispersal is thus necessary to enable models to move beyond the purely theoretical towards making more useful predictions of evolutionary and ecological dynamics under current and future environmental conditions. To inform these advances, empirical studies need to answer outstanding questions concerning whether specific genes underlie dispersal variation, the genetic architecture of context-dependent dispersal phenotypes and behaviours, and correlations among dispersal and other traits.

AB Neonicotinoids (neonics) are remarkably effective as plant systemics to control sucking insects and for flea control on dogs and cats. The nitroimines imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and dinotefuran are the leaders among the seven commercial neonics that also include the nitromethylene nitenpyram, the nitromethylene-derived cycloxaprid, and the cyanoimines acetamiprid and thiacloprid. Honey bees are highly sensitive to the nitroimines and nitromethylenes, but the cyanoimines are less toxic. All neonics are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists with a common mode of action, target-site cross-resistance, and much higher potency on insect than mammalian nAChRs at defined binding sites. The structurally related sulfoximine sulfoxaflor and butenolide flupyradifurone are also nAChR agonists, and the mesoionic triflumezopyrim is a nAChR competitive modulator with little or no target-site cross-resistance. Some neonics induce stress tolerance in plants via salicylate-associated systems. The neonics in general are readily metabolized and, except for pollinators, have favorable toxicological profiles.

AB Supply chain risk propagation is a cascading effect of risks on global supply chain networks. The paper attempts to measure the behaviour of risks following the assessment of supply chain risk propagation. Bayesian network theory is used to analyse the multi-echelon network faced with simultaneous disruptions. The ripple effect of node disruption is evaluated using metrics like fragility, service level, inventory cost and lost sales. Developed risk exposure and resilience indices support in assessing the vulnerability and adaptability of each node in the supply chain network. The research provides a holistic measurement approach for predicting the complex behaviour of risk propagation for improved supply chain risk management.

   FIRE SEVERITY; CONSERVATION; WILDFIRE; SELECTION; IMPACTS
AB Increasingly frequent "megafires" in North America's dry forests have prompted proposals to restore historical fire regimes and ecosystem resilience. Restoration efforts that reduce tree densities (eg via logging) could have collateral impacts on declining old-forest species, but whether these risks outweigh the potential effects of large, severe fires remains uncertain. We demonstrate the effects of a 2014 California megafire on an iconic old-forest species, the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). The probability of owl site extirpation was seven times higher after the fire (0.88) than before the fire (0.12) at severely burned sites, contributing to the greatest annual population decline observed during our 23-year study. The fire also rendered large areas of forest unsuitable for owl foraging one year post-fire. Our study suggests that megafires pose a threat to old-forest species, and we conclude that restoring historical fire regimes could benefit both old-forest species and the dry forest ecosystems they inhabit in this era of climate change.

AB Defining the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on biodiversity and species distributions is currently a high priority. Niche models focus primarily on predicted changes in abiotic factors; however, species interactions and adaptive evolution will impact the ability of species to persist in the face of changing climate. Our review focuses on the use of hybrid zones to monitor responses of species to contemporary climate change. Monitoring hybrid zones provides insight into how range boundaries shift in response to climate change by illuminating the combined effects of species interactions and physiological sensitivity. At the same time, the semipermeable nature of species boundaries allows us to document adaptive introgression of alleles associated with response to climate change.

AB The study of soil N cycling processes has been, is, and will be at the centre of attention in soil science research. The importance of N as a nutrient for all biota; the ever-increasing rates of its anthropogenic input in terrestrial (agro)ecosystems; its resultant losses to the environment; and the complexity of the biological, physical, and chemical factors that regulate N cycling processes all contribute to the necessity of further understanding, measuring, and altering the soil N cycle. Here, we review important insights with respect to the soil N cycle that have been made over the last decade, and present a personal view on the key challenges of future research. We identify three key challenges with respect to basic N cycling processes producing gaseous emissions:
   1. quantifying the importance of nitrifier denitrification and its main controlling factors;
   2. characterizing the greenhouse gas mitigation potential and microbiological basis for N2O consumption;
   3. characterizing hotspots and hot moments of denitrification
   Furthermore, we identified a key challenge with respect to modelling:
   1. disentangling gross N transformation rates using advanced N-15/O-18 tracing models
   Finally, we propose four key challenges related to how ecological interactions control N cycling processes:
   1. linking functional diversity of soil fauna to N cycling processes beyond mineralization;
   2. determining the functional relationship between root traits and soil N cycling;
   3. characterizing the control that different types of mycorrhizal symbioses exert on N cycling;
   4. quantifying the contribution of non-symbiotic pathways to total N fixation fluxes in natural systems
   We postulate that addressing these challenges will constitute a comprehensive research agenda with respect to the N cycle for the next decade. Such an agenda would help us to meet future challenges on food and energy security, biodiversity conservation, water and air quality, and climate stability.

AB Bayesian networks are quantitative modeling tools whose applications to the maritime traffic safety context are becoming more popular. This paper discusses the utilization of Bayesian networks in maritime safety modeling. Based on literature and the author's own experiences, the paper studies what Bayesian networks can offer to maritime accident prevention and safety modeling and discusses a few challenges in their application to this context. It is argued that the capability of representing rather complex, not necessarily causal but uncertain relationships makes Bayesian networks an attractive modeling tool for the maritime safety and accidents. Furthermore, as the maritime accident and safety data is still rather scarce and has some quality problems, the possibility to combine data with expert knowledge and the easy way of updating the model after acquiring more evidence further enhance their feasibility. However, eliciting the probabilities from the maritime experts might be challenging and the model validation can be tricky. It is concluded that with the utilization of several data sources, Bayesian updating, dynamic modeling, and hidden nodes for latent variables, Bayesian networks are rather well-suited tools for the maritime safety management and decision-making.

AB High-throughput screening has become a mainstay of small-molecule probe and early drug discovery. The question of how to build and evolve efficient screening collections systematically for cell-based and biochemical screening is still unresolved. It is often assumed that chemical structure diversity leads to diverse biological performance of a library. Here, we confirm earlier results showing that this inference is not always valid and suggest instead using biological measurement diversity derived from multiplexed profiling in the construction of libraries with diverse assay performance patterns for cell-based screens. Rather than using results from tens or hundreds of completed assays, which is resource intensive and not easily extensible, we use high-dimensional image-based cell morphology and gene expression profiles. We piloted this approach using over 30,000 compounds. We show that small-molecule profiling can be used to select compound sets with high rates of activity and diverse biological performance.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools for forecasting the potential impacts of future environmental changes but debate remains over the most robust modelling approaches for making projections. Suggested improvements in SDMs vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning SDMs on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of SDMs trained on presence-absence data and those trained on abundance data. Species distribution models trained on presence-absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 032 (SE +/- 012) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence-absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 005 (SE +/- 001) when corresponding SDMs are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence. Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence-absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence-absence data to train and test SDMs. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence-absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.

ID SPECIES-RICHNESS PATTERNS; GRADIENTS; SCALE; MAMMALS
AB While horizontal gradients of biodiversity have been examined extensively in the past, vertical diversity gradients (elevation, water depth) are attracting increasing attention. We compiled data from 443 elevational gradients involving diverse organisms worldwide to investigate how elevational diversity patterns may vary between the Northern and Southern hemispheres and across latitudes. Our results show that most elevational diversity curves are positively skewed (maximum diversity below the middle of the gradient) and the elevation of the peak in diversity increases with the elevation of lower sampling limits and to a lesser extent with upper limit. Mountains with greater elevational extents, and taxonomic groups that are more inclusive, show proportionally more unimodal patterns whereas other ranges and taxa show highly variable gradients. The two hemispheres share some interesting similarities but also remarkable differences, likely reflecting differences in landmass and mountain configurations. Different taxonomic groups exhibit diversity peaks at different elevations, probably reflecting both physical and physiological constraints.

AB Fisheries-induced evolution and its impact on the productivity of exploited fish stocks remains a highly contested research topic in applied fish evolution and fisheries science. Although many quantitative models assume that larger, more fecund fish are preferentially removed by fishing, there is no empirical evidence describing the relationship between vulnerability to capture and individual reproductive fitness in the wild. Using males from two lines of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) selectively bred over three generations for either high (HV) or low (LV) vulnerability to angling as a model system, we show that the trait "vulnerability to angling" positively correlates with aggression, intensity of parental care, and reproductive fitness. The difference in reproductive fitness between HV and LV fish was particularly evident among larger males, which are also the preferred mating partners of females. Our study constitutes experimental evidence that recreational angling selectively captures individuals with the highest potential for reproductive fitness. Our study further suggests that selective removal of the fittest individuals likely occurs in many fisheries that target species engaged in parental care. As a result, depending on the ecological context, angling-induced selection may have negative consequences for recruitment within wild populations of largemouth bass and possibly other exploited species in which behavioral patterns that determine fitness, such as aggression or parental care, also affect their vulnerability to fishing gear.

AB Analysis of human body microbial diversity is fundamental to understanding community structure, biology and ecology. The National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine microbial diversity within and across body habitats and individuals through pyrosequencing-based profiling of 16 S rRNA gene sequences (16 S) from habits of the oral, skin, distal gut, and vaginal body regions from over 200 healthy individuals enabling the application of statistical techniques. In this study, two approaches were applied to elucidate the nature and extent of human microbiome diversity. First, bootstrap and parametric curve fitting techniques were evaluated to estimate the maximum number of unique taxa, S-max, and taxa discovery rate for habitats across individuals. Next, our results demonstrated that the variation of diversity within low abundant taxa across habitats and individuals was not sufficiently quantified with standard ecological diversity indices. This impact from low abundant taxa motivated us to introduce a novel rank-based diversity measure, the Tail statistic, ("tau"), based on the standard deviation of the rank abundance curve if made symmetric by reflection around the most abundant taxon. Due to tau's greater sensitivity to low abundant taxa, its application to diversity estimation of taxonomic units using taxonomic dependent and independent methods revealed a greater range of values recovered between individuals versus body habitats, and different patterns of diversity within habitats. The greatest range of tau values within and across individuals was found in stool, which also exhibited the most undiscovered taxa. Oral and skin habitats revealed variable diversity patterns, while vaginal habitats were consistently the least diverse. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance, and motivate the introduction, of several visualization and analysis methods tuned specifically for next-generation sequence data, further revealing that low abundant taxa serve as an important reservoir of genetic diversity in the human microbiome.

AB One of the reasons for animals not to grow as fast as they potentially could is that fast growth has been shown to be associated with reduced lifespan. However, we are still lacking a clear description of the reality of growth-dependent modulation of ageing mechanisms in wild animals. Using the particular growth trajectory of small king penguin chicks naturally exhibiting higher-than-normal growth rate to compensate for the winter break, we tested whether oxidative stress and telomere shortening are related to growth trajectories. Plasma antioxidant defences, oxidative damage levels and telomere length were measured at the beginning and at the end of the post-winter growth period in three groups of chicks (small chicks, which either passed away or survived the growth period, and large chicks). Small chicks that died early during the growth period had the highest level of oxidative damage and the shortest telomere lengths prior to death. Here, we show that small chicks that grew faster did it at the detriment of body maintenance mechanisms as shown by (i) higher oxidative damage and (ii) accelerated telomere loss. Our study provides the first evidence for a mechanistic link between growth and ageing rates under natural conditions.

AB Although personality has been defined as a suite of correlated behaviours, most studies of animal personality actually consider correlations between a few traits. We examined the repeatability and correlational structure of five potential personality traits (activity, neophobia, exploratory tendencies, risk-taking behaviour and obstinacy), in female zebra finches. In addition, we assessed to what extent personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome. Social dominance was predicted by personality, with proactive individuals being more likely to be dominant. Our results suggest that personality can be considered as a new static factor influencing within-group hierarchies. We finally discuss these results in terms of the consequences for the evolution of personalities and the need to take several traits into account to provide full descriptions of individual personality.

AB In the past, biologists have characterized the responses of a wide range of plant species to their environment. As a result, phenotypic data from hundreds of experiments are publicly available now. Unfortunately, this information is not structured in a way that enables quantitative and comparative analyses. We aim to fill this gap by building a large database which currently contains data on 1000 experiments and 800 species. This paper presents methodology to generalize across different experiments and species, taking the response of specific leaf area (SLA; leaf area:leaf mass ratio) to irradiance as an example. We show how to construct and quantify a normalized mean light-response curve, and subsequently test whether there are systematic differences in the form of the curve between contrasting subgroups of species. This meta-analysis is then extended to a range of other environmental factors important for plant growth as well as other phenotypic traits, using > 5300 mean values. The present approach, which we refer to as 'meta-phenomics', represents a valuable tool in understanding the integrated response of plants to their environment and could serve as a benchmark for future phenotyping efforts as well as for modelling global change effects on both wild species and crops.

AB Projects for the long-term disposal of radioactive waste have often been hampered by strong local and regional opposition. Public participation has been recognized as a means to cope with this problem. Advocates promoting extensive public participation suggest various, mostly distinct, involvement techniques that are claimed to cover all needs. However, public participation is still a controversial issue. Several key questions need to be answered: why and when should who be involved, by whom, using which technique, and with which expected outcome? Here, a procedure with a functional-dynamic view of public participation is proposed that combines the decision-making process (DMP) with specific types and extents of public participation. We distinguish four discrete levels of public participation, namely information, consultation, collaboration, and empowerment. We argue that these levels of participation must fit the corresponding technical and non-technical requirements of the different phases of the DMP and illustrate our arguments using a proposed site selection process for nuclear waste. This means that the type and the extent of public participation vary over the time span of a long-term DMP.

TI Responding to spatial and temporal variations in predation risk: space

AB Predators generate a "landscape of fear" within which prey can minimize the risk of predation by selecting low-risk areas. Depending on the spatial structure of this "landscape", i.e., whether it is coarse- or fine-grained, prey may respond to increased risk by shifting their home ranges or by fine-scale redistributions within these ranges, respectively. We studied how wild boar (Sus scrofa L., 1758) responded to temporal changes in risk in hunted areas (risky habitat) surrounding a nature reserve (refuge habitat). Animals with home ranges "in contact" with the reserve during the low-risk season were the only ones to shift toward the refuge when the risk increased. These shifts occurred at two temporal scales in response to the increased risk during the daytime and during the hunting season. Whereas animals not influenced by the reserve found food and shelter in forest during the hunting season, shifts to the refuge area were detrimental to the rather scarce forest areas in the reserve. This confirms that spatiotemporal changes in risk are major drivers of animal distribution when predation strongly limits their fitness. Their response is, however, scale-dependent and reflects at the individual level the perceived structure of their "landscape of fear".

AB The management of tropical forest in timber concessions has been proposed as a solution to prevent further biodiversity loss. The effectiveness of this strategy will likely depend on species-specific, population-level responses to logging. We conducted a survey (749 line transects over 3450 km) in logging concessions (1.2 million ha) in the northern Republic of Congo to examine the impact of logging on large mammal populations, including endangered species such as the elephant (Loxodonta africana), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus). When we estimated species abundance without consideration of transect characteristics, species abundances in logged and unlogged forests were not different for most species. When we modeled the data with a hurdle model approach, however, analyzing species presence and conditional abundance separately with generalized additive models and then combining them to calculate the mean species abundance, species abundance varied strongly depending on transect characteristics. The mean species abundance was often related to the distance to unlogged forest, which suggests that intact forest serves as source habitat for several species. The mean species abundance responded nonlinearly to logging history, changing over 30 years as the forest recovered from logging. Finally the distance away from roads, natural forest clearings, and villages also determined the abundance of mammals. Our results suggest that logged forest can extend the conservation estate for many of Central Africa's most threatened species if managed appropriately. In addition to limiting hunting, logging concessions must be large, contain patches of unlogged forest, and include forest with different logging histories.

AB In the litter of six deciduous tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp., Fraxinus excelsior, Carpinus betulus, Acer pseudoplatanus and Acer platanoides) and in stand-specific litter mixtures, we compared mass loss and nutrient release across diversity levels along a gradient of decreasing proportion of Fagus in stands with similar environmental and physical soil conditions. The litterbag studies ran over 22 months. The decomposition rate constants (k) of the temperate forest species ranged from k = 0.5 for Fagus to k = 1.5-2 for all other tree species. In Fagus, k was closely negatively correlated with the thickness of the litter layer and positively correlated with soil pH and isopod abundance. k was significantly higher in the mixed species stands (except for Carpinus and Fraxinus) and was positively correlated with earthworm abundance. Over the whole incubation time, nutrient amount and release rates of N, P, K, Ca and Mg as well as C-related ratios showed significant differences between tree species but no consistent differences among the diversity levels. Initial C-related nutrient ratios of the leaf litter and abundance of mesofauna and macrofauna were correlated with the length of time lag before nutrient release. We conclude that the mere number of tree species is not the main driver of nutrient release and decomposition processes, but that key groups of the decomposer fauna as well as the characteristic traits of the individual tree species are decisive.

   References 306.Phytoplankton life forms, including unicells, colonies, pseudocolonies, and multicellular organisms, span a huge size range. The smallest unicells are less than 1 mu m(3) (e.g. cyanobacteria), while large unicellular diatoms may attain 10(9) mu m(3), being visible to the naked eye. Phytoplankton includes chemo-organotrophic unicells, colonies and multicellular organisms that depend on symbionts or kleptoplastids for their capacity to photosynthesize. Analyses of physical (transport within cells, diffusion boundary layers, package effect, turgor, and vertical movements) and biotic (grazing, viruses and other parasitoids) factors indicate potential ecological constraints and opportunities that differ among the life forms. There are also variations among life forms in elemental stoichiometry and in allometric relations between biovolume and specific growth. While many of these factors probably have ecological and evolutionary significance, work is needed to establish those that are most important, warranting explicit description in models. Other factors setting limitations on growth rate (selecting slow-growing species) await elucidation.

AB Variations in ring width and wood density of Picea brachytyla were used to develop high-resolution climate proxy data to extend the existing climate record in the central Hengduan Mountains, north-western Yunnan Province, China. Growth-climate response analyses showed that the total ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) in the sub-alpine zone are mainly influenced by summer temperature variability. Based on a MXD regional chronology derived from two high elevation sites, we developed a warm season (April-September) temperature reconstruction for the period A.D. 1750-2006. The climate/tree-growth model accounts for 41% of the instrumental temperature variance during the period 1958-2004. Warm summers occurred during 1750s, 1820-50s, 1880-1890s, 1930-1950s and 1990-present; while the periods of 1790-1810s, 1860-1870s, 1900-1920s, and 1960-1985 were relatively cold. Spatial climate correlation analyses with gridded land surface data revealed that our warm season temperature reconstruction contains a strong regional temperature signal for the Hengduan Mountain ranges. Our reconstruction successfully captured recent abrupt climatic changes and agreed in general with other tree ring-based temperature reconstructions from nearby regions on a decadal timescale. In addition, reconstructed summer temperature variations were consistent with recorded glacier fluctuations in the surrounding high mountains. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim We aimed to redress a current limitation of local ecological studies (i.e. piecemeal information on specific taxa) by integrating existing ecological knowledge with quantifiable patterns in primary habitat (i.e. composition, distribution and cover) from local to continental scales. By achieving this aim, we sought to provide a biogeographical framework for the interpretation of variation in the ecology of, and threats to, subtidal rocky landscapes.
   Location The subtidal rocky coast of continental Australia, with longitudinal comparisons spanning > 4000 km of southern coast (115 degrees 03' E-153 degrees 60' E) between latitudes of 33 degrees 05' S and 35 degrees 36' S, and latitudinal comparisons across 26 degrees 40' S to 37 degrees 08' S of eastern Australia.
   Methods The frequency and size of patches of major benthic habitat were quantified to indicate contemporary function (ecology) and to establish patterns that may result from contrasting regional-scale processes (biogeography). This was achieved by quantifying the composition and patchiness of key subtidal habitats across the continent and relating them to the known ecology of subsets of locations in each region. A nested design of several spatial scales (1000s, 100s, 10-1 km) was adopted to distinguish patterns at local through to biogeographical scales.
   Results We show biogeography (in terms of longitude and latitude) to have a fundamental influence on the patterns of abundance and composition of subtidal habitats across regional (1000s of kilometres) to local (10s of kilometres to metres) scales. Across the continent, the most fundamental patterns related to (1) the proportion of rock covered by kelp forests, as related to particular functional groups of herbivores, and (2) the small-scale heterogeneity (metres) that characterizes these forests.
   Main conclusions We interpret these results within a framework of alternative processes known to maintain habitat heterogeneity across these regions (e.g. productivity versus consumption as shapers of habitat structure). These interpretations illustrate how regional differences in ecological patterns and processes can create contradictory outcomes for the management of natural resources. We suggest that researchers and managers of natural resources alike may benefit from understanding local issues (e.g. the effects of fishing and its synergies with water pollution) in their biogeographical contexts.

AB 1. As species are often considered discrete natural units, interspecific sexual interactions are often disregarded as potential factors determining community composition. Nevertheless reproductive interference, ranging from signal jamming to hybridization, can have significant costs for species sharing similar signal channels.
   2. We combined laboratory and field experiments to test whether the coexistence of two congeneric ground-hopper species with overlapping ranges might be influenced by sexual interactions.
   3. In the laboratory experiment the number of conspecific copulations of Tetrix ceperoi decreased substantially in the presence of Tetrix subulata. Males of T. ceperoi performed more mating attempts with heterospecific females, whereas females of T. subulata rejected these heterospecific approaches more often than those of conspecifics. Although no heterospecific matings occurred in the laboratory, the reproductive success of T. ceperoi was reduced substantially in field experiments. Negative effects on T. subulata were found only at high densities.
   4. Our results suggest that reproductive interference could have similar consequences as competition, such as demographic displacement of one species ('sexual exclusion'). As reproductive interference should be selected against, it may also drive the evolution of signals (reproductive character displacement) or promote habitat, spatial or temporal segregation.

AB The tools and methods developed by different scientific communities to simulate the dynamics of land use have emphasised either processes or patterns of changes. Agent-based models (ABM) belong to the former category while many spatially explicit simulation models belong to the latter. These two different modelling approaches were jointly implemented at a study site in Vietnam to assess their respective strengths and weaknesses with respect to their capacity to support the formulation of land-use policy and to influence decision making by multiple groups of stakeholders. SAMBA is a people-centred approach combining an ABM, a role-playing game and a geographic information system. Participatory simulations help elicit the rules of the ABM and calibrate the model, while the model supports the participatory exploration of land-use change scenarios over longer time periods. CLUE-s is a spatial simulation model which explores changes in land-use patterns within user-specified rules of permissible change and rates of change. Driving factors that influence changes from one land-use type to another are defined by combining spatially explicit data on land use and supposed driving factors in a logistical regression analysis. Alternatively, the decision rules that were revealed during the participatory simulations - with the role plays and the multi-agent modelling of the SAMBA approach - were incorporated in the CLUE-s model to provide more realistic estimates for the varying influence of land-use drivers. We checked the respective validity of the two models by applying them at the same site and comparing their outputs. As a result, no single approach was obviously superior according to the validation statistics. The three approaches turned out to be complementary in simulating land-use patterns, while providing different types of information. Integration of the two models into a rule-based version of CLUE-s helped reconciling data-driven statistical models and process-driven agent-based models in LUCC research. This new model reinforced the overall framework by facilitating the partnership between researchers from different scientific communities and between researchers and multiple groups of stakeholders. it may also better respond to the expectations of land users at different levels of the decision-making hierarchy.

AB Within species, natural and sexual selection work together to shape the design of animal communicative systems, and sometimes act differentially on alternate components to produce a single elaborate phenotype that works well in several contexts. Here, we show a similar pattern at the interspecific level, and describe how an intricate selective regime can shape diversification of a complex behaviour across species. Using four phylogenetic comparative methods, alternative phylogenetic hypotheses, and a data set compiled from over 50 different sources representing 53 taxa, we test the relative importance of different ecological variables on the evolution of anole visual displays. Our study makes use of the inherent complexity of these signals and the availability of published descriptions in the form of display-action-patterns. Results indicate that different selective forces are linked to change in different display components. Whereas evolutionary changes in display duration appear to be linked to sexual size dimorphism, measures of display complexity (number and uniformity of display components) were more tightly associated with the need to facilitate species recognition and the type of light environment in which the display is typically performed. We also found some evidence that ecomorph distinctions, a major force in morphological evolution of anoles, have had an impact on the evolution of display structure. We use our findings to highlight areas for future research and discuss the similarities and differences between display evolution in anoles and in other lizard genera.

AB Aim To investigate environmental variation and associated assemblage changes of carabid beetles along an urban-rural gradient.
   Location 'Quercus-Acer' (oak-sycamore) woodlands in the city of Birmingham, UK.
   Methods We collected carabid data using pitfall traps on 12 sites in the city. The traps were run from April-September in 2000, and we collected environmental data on 24 individual variables associated with the individual sites and their landscape context. Changes in carabid assemblages were analysed using repeat measures ANOVA and the environment-species relationships with a Redundancy Analyses (RDA) and Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM).
   Results We found that: (1) species richness and diversity were lower in the urban and suburban zone and higher in the rural zone; (2) Berger Parker dominance index was higher in the urban and suburban zones; (3) the number of woodland and woodland associated species was significantly higher at the rural end of the gradient; (4) the number of short-winged (brachypterous) species was highest in the rural zone and decreased towards the urban woodlands, whereas the long-winged species were more abundant in suburban woodlands; (5) the median weight length (WML) of the assemblage declined along the gradient from the rural to the urban zone, as did the number of large species; and (6) five of the 24 environmental variables showed a significant relationship with variation in the carabid assemblage. At site level the carabid assemblages were related to the level of site disturbance and soil penetrability, whereas site size and amount of woodland and urban land within 5 km of the site were important at a larger landscape scale.
   Main conclusions The results suggest that urbanization has a deleterious impact on carabid assemblages, causing a reduction in species richness from the rural fringe to the centre of the city. Changes in assemblage structure were related to woodland fragmentation, which led to variations in woodland size, woodland location and site disturbance due to trampling. Large, flightless and specialist woodland species are more susceptible to changes associated with urbanization, presumably due to their longer life spans, lower reproductive rates, more specialized niches and more limited dispersal potential.

AB We compared woody plant species distributions across nested spatial scales (local scale to entire Western Himalaya) and explored landscape scale patterns in detail to obtain inferences about the elevational gradient in species richness. Distribution data were compiled for 1100 species in the Western Himalaya, and primary data, comprising 123 species and 47 000 individuals, were collected for a landscape. Correlates of diversity were examined for the five spatial scales, and for different biogeographic groups at the landscape scale. The results indicate multiple mechanisms both within and across scales. At the landscape scale, though the mechanisms explaining unimodal species richness patterns were hard to separate, the underlying correlates of biogeographic groups were more distinct; temperate species richness followed mid-domain model predictions, and showed a nonlinear relationship with temperature, whereas tropical species richness tracked temperature and area. Simulations demonstrated that models with varying assumptions, while resulting in monotonic, unimodal, or multimodal patterns at local scales, could all lead to unimodal patterns at regional scales when multiple local replicates are aggregated, with a peak in the major ecotone. The turnover or successive accumulation of marginal species in ecotones potentially explains the mid-elevational peak in this zone. Landscape scale primary data on distribution and abundance could therefore be critical to understanding key aspects of macroecological patterns.

AB Decisions made by birds during migration to breeding grounds can strongly affect the fitness of individuals. We investigated possible causes and reproductive consequences of inter-individual variation in the migratory behavior of an arctic-nesting species, the greater snow goose (Anser caerulescens atlanticus), by radio-tracking females at their staging area and on their breeding grounds. Females showed relatively high repeatability in the duration of migration (r(i)=0.37) and arrival date on the breeding grounds (r(i)=0.42) suggesting that these traits are characteristics of individuals. Conversely, no individual consistency in departure date from the staging area was detected (r(i)=-0.02) indicating that environmental factors may have a large influence. Females paired with dominant males departed slightly earlier from the staging area than females accompanied by subordinate males. However, neither social status on the staging area (i.e. paired vs unpaired) nor dominance scores were associated with arrival time of individuals. Finally, the probability of breeding was positively related to arrival date indicating a reproductive cost of arriving too early on the breeding grounds. The combination of breeding probability and seasonal decline in breeding success nonetheless suggests that females arriving a few days earlier than the median arrival date attained highest reproductive success. Our results show that assessing the fitness consequences of early arrival by focusing solely on breeding females would lead to an overestimation of the genuine benefits. This study also indicates possible genetically based differences among individuals in migration duration and arrival time on the breeding grounds.

TI On misinterpretations of pseudoreplication and related matters: a reply

SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Editorial Material
ID EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS
AB Pseudoreplication has become a widely accepted label for a certain class of statistical error common in the literature of ecology as well as of other fields. A wide-ranging critique by L. Oksanen recently published in this journal criticizes the term and concept and concludes it to be a "pseudoissue," one reflecting an intellectual disease, "a totally outdated epistemology" known as "inductionism." The present article addresses some of Oksanen's complaints. His critique is based on a misconception of pseudoreplication, reflects unawareness of most of the literature on the topic, and mistakenly argues that the seriousness of the error is a function of whether an experiment is conducted in an inductive or deductive spirit. Oksanen's advocacy of using resources available for large scale ecology more for large numbers of experiments with unreplicated treatments than for fewer experiments with modest replication of treatments is unrealistic. It is based on an overly optimistic view of the ability of a meta-analysis to compensate for deficiencies, such as very noisy estimates of treatment effects, of the individual studies that are fed into it. A definition is offered of the term manipulative experiment, since adequate ones are lacking in the literature. Attention is called to the fact that for certain types of manipulative experiments lacking treatment replication, there are valid ways to test for treatment effects.

AB We report the population genetic structure of the endangered tropical tree species Caryocar brasiliense, based on variability at 10 microsatellite loci. Additionally, we compare heterozygosity and inbreeding estimates for continuous and fragmented populations and discuss the consequences for conservation. For a total of 314 individuals over 10 populations, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 20 to 27 and expected and observed heterozygosity varied from 0.129 to 0.924 and 0.067 to 1.000, respectively. Significant values of theta and R-ST showed important genetic differentiation among populations. theta was much lower than R-ST, suggesting that identity by state and identity by descent have diverged in these populations. Although a significant amount of inbreeding was found under the identity by descent model (f = 0.11), an estimate of inbreeding for microsatellite markers based on a more adequate stepwise mutation model showed no evidence of nonrandom mating (R-IS = 0.04). Differentiation (pairwise F-ST) was positively correlated with geographical distance, as expected under the isolation by distance model. No effect of fragmentation on heterozygosity or inbreeding could be detected. This is most likely due to the fact that Cerrado fragmentation is a relatively recent event (similar to 60 years) compared to the species life cycle. Also, the populations surveyed from both fragmented and disturbed areas were composed mainly of adult individuals, already present prior to ecosystem fragmentation. Adequate hypothesis testing of the effect of habitat fragmentation will require the recurrent analysis of juveniles across generations in both fragmented and nonfragmented areas.

AB Theory concerning the evolution of life history (the schedule of reproduction and survival) focuses on describing the life history which maximises fitness. Although there is an intuitive link between life history and fitness, there are in fact several measures of the 'black box' concept of fitness. There has been a debate in the bio-mathematical literature on the predictive difference between the two most commonly used measures; intrinsic rate of increase, and net reproductive ratio R-0. Although both measures aim to describe fitness, models using one of the measures may predict the opposite of similar models using the other measure, which is clearly undesirable. Here, I review the evolution of these fitness measures over the last four decades, the predictive differences between these measures and the resulting shift of the fitness concept. I focus in particular on some recent developments, which have solved the dilemma of predictive differences between these fitness measures by explicitly acknowledging the game-theoretical nature of life-history evolution.

AB The harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, experiences high levels of nonnatural mortality owing to interactions with commercial fisheries throughout its range. To accurately evaluate the significance of this bycatch, information on population structure is required. We have examined the population structure of this species in the northwest Atlantic Ocean using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence and nuclear microsatellite data. Samples from four previously proposed summer breeding populations-the Gulf of Maine, eastern Newfoundland, the Gulf of St Lawrence and West Greenland-were analysed. Control-region sequences revealed a significant partitioning of genetic variation among most of these summer populations, indicating that northwest Atlantic harbour porpoises should not be considered one panmictic population. Analysis of females alone yielded the highest levels of population subdivision, suggesting that females are more philopatric than males. At least three management units may be defined for harbour porpoises in the northwest Atlantic based on these data. Analysis of six microsatellite loci failed to detect significant population subdivision. Male-mediated gene flow may maintain homogeneity among nuclear loci, while female philopatry is sufficient to produce a signal of population subdivision in the maternally inherited mtDNA genome, mtDNA analyses also indicate that winter aggregations of harbour porpoises along the US mid-Atlantic states comprise animals from more than one summer breeding population.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES

DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE; DIELDRIN; COLORADO; GROWTH
AB We present empirical support for a conceptual framework in which chemical contaminants are considered as sources of physiological stress to fish. Physiological stress was quantified in terms of energy by measuring routine metabolism, food consumption, activity, and growth rates of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) exposed to the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin. Regression analysis was used to estimate models that describe the response of each endpoint as a function of dieldrin concentration and duration of exposure, Metabolic rate, consumption, and growth were influenced by chemical exposure. At short durations of exposure (1-4 days), metabolic rate of exposed fish was depressed compared with controls, but at a longer duration (16 days), metabolic rate increased as a function of concentration. Food consumption and growth rates of fish exposed for 16 days declined as dieldrin concentration increased. The response of each endpoint was consistent with predictions of the general adaptation syndrome. Energetic costs of contaminant-induced changes in metabolism and food consumption can be integrated with a bioenergetics model to demonstrate biological significance of chemical exposure in a natural environment.

AB Weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration based optima anti tolerances of lakewater pH and temperature are presented for diatoms in ecologically sensitive, subarctic Fennoscandian lakes. The study sites are mostly small, simple, oligotrophic, low-conductivity lakes with a pH range from 5.0 to 7.7 and a temperature range (after data screening) from 9.3 to 15.0 degrees C. Experiments with inverse and classical deshrinking, with or without tolerance downweighting, were used to identify the best calibration functions. The model estimates were adjusted by jackknifing procedures. WA by inverse deshrinking and with tolerance downweighting performed best for pH prediction, whereas simple WA was marginally superior for predicting water temperature. The established pH model is accurate to within +/- 0.39 pH units, and the temperature model to within +/- 0.88 degrees Celcius. Fifteen diatom taxa were identified as potential indicator species for pH and three for temperature.

AB Invasive plants and plantations may be detrimental to native, ground-living, invertebrate fauna. Using pitfall traps at 20 sites in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, an assessment was made of the distribution of epigaeic fauna under stands of the exotic invader plants: Acacia longifolia (long-leaved wattle), Acacia mearnsii (black wattle), Lantana camara (lantana) and Solanum mauritianum (bugweed), and also under a canopy of two major plantation trees: Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus patula, Control plots were minimally disturbed grassland and woodland in the same area. The effects of the invasive and cultured plants suggest that the impact is a complex interaction of factors. In general, there was a lower (but not significantly so) species richness, and also diversity, of invertebrates in exotic compared with indigenous vegetation. Certain individual species rather than whole families were affected most by these types of vegetation, There was a different assemblage of species associated with exotic compared with indigenous vegetation, with some species being good indicators for exotic or for indigenous vegetation, Although the weeds and vegetation caused a few species to increase in abundance, many other species decreased or even disappeared locally. Whereas different species assembled according to whether vegetation was exotic or indigenous, families and orders assembled along a gradient of closed to open canopy vegetation irrespective of origin. Although a few species were restricted to exotic vegetation (presumably having invaded at some time in the past from somewhere apart from the control sites), many others were restricted to indigenous vegetation, Vegetation management should be-sensitive to the needs of certain invertebrate species so as to conserve them when native vegetation is replaced by exotics, Some management recommendations for conserving local invertebrate diversity are made.

AB Animals can use fat reserves as a source of energy whenever demand exceeds intake. The size of this 'insurance' is dependent on a trade-off between storage costs and anticipated needs. Previous theoretical and empirical studies in birds have shown that fat levels are tailored to short-term needs. However, in some situations animals must match intake to longer term requirements. Here we develop a model of this situation, and compare it with experimental data from juvenile Atlantic salmon, which become anorexic and gradually deplete their energy reserves over winter. Responses to experimentally-accelerated depletion of reserves matched theoretical predictions: an elevation of appetite to restore lost reserves was dependent not on current energy state, but on projected energy state at the end of the winter. This is the first demonstration of an adaptive regulation of appetite tailored to long-term requirements for an energy insurance rather than short-term needs.

AB The invertebrate zooplankton fauna of the Westerschelde (Belgium and The Netherlands) was investigated during 2 yr by means of monthly samples along a salinity gradient. Copepods were usually the most abundant holoplanktonic metazoans except in the freshwater zone where Rotifera were most numerous. The combination of a classification technique and an ordination-regression technique proved to be a valuable tool for the analysis of such an extensive data set. The presence of 4 groups was established, representing spatially distinct populations but with temporally shifting boundaries. Few zooplankton species were truly estuarine in their distribution, but many were derived from nearby coastal waters. This intrusion of marine species started in spring, reaching their most upstream distribution and highest densities in summer-early fall, then declining and retreating from the estuary, disappearing in winter. Fringing this community was a transition group with low densities, but many species. This brackish-water community consisted predominantly of the calanoid copepod Eurytemord affinis. It appeared in late fall, spread out seaward to obtain its maximum density and distribution in winter-early spring. Densities then declined and the community was absent by late summer-early fall. The freshwater zone near the port of Antwerp, Belgium, was characterized by a paucity of large zooplankters, despite the high primary production in this zone. This is probably due to the low oxygen availability in this area. A canonical Correspondence analysis revealed 2 major environmental axes. The salinity gradient (mainly spatial) explained most of the variance. Strongly correlated with this factor were dissolved oxygen content and secchi disc visibility. The temperature gradient (mainly temporal) was almost perpendicular to the salinity axis, indicating little or no correlation. Of lesser importance was the load of suspended matter, which was highest in the brackish area in autumn-winter. Chlorophyll content of the water was unimportant in explaining community structure. Copepod dry weight was maximal in spring in the brackish part (500 mg m-3); a lower maximum (260 mg m-3) was observed in summer in the marine part of the estuary.

TI Clinical characteristics and outcomes of inpatients with neurologic

SO NEUROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective
   To report clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of patients admitted for neurologic diseases with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
   Methods
   In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a neuro-COVID unit beginning February 21, 2020, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (false discovery rate corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period.
   Results
   One hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive and 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older (77.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 67.0-83.8 years vs 70.1 years, IQR 52.9-78.6 years, p = 0.006), had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders (n = 43, 76.8% vs n = 68, 58.1%), and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (0.9, IQR 0.7-1.1 vs 0.5, IQR 0.4-0.6, p = 0.006). In-hospital mortality rates (n = 21, 37.5% vs n = 5, 4.3%, p < 0.001) and incident delirium (n = 15, 26.8% vs n = 9, 7.7%, p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. Patients with COVID-19 and without COVID with stroke had similar baseline characteristics, but patients with COVID-19 had highermodified Rankin Scale scores at discharge (5.0, IQR 2.0-6.0 vs 2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0, p < 0.001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (n = 11, 25.6% vs n = 48, 70.6%, p < 0.001). In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of inhospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (odds ratio [OR] 4.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-16.5, p = 0.025), lower platelet count (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p = 0.005), and higher lactate dehydrogenase (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, p = 0.009) on admission.
   Conclusions
   Patients withCOVID-19 admittedwith neurologic disease, including stroke, have a significantly higher in-hospitalmortality and incident deliriumand higher disability than patients without COVID-19.

AB Complex societal or environmental problems require fast and substantial socio-technical transitions. For instance, in the case of climate change, these transitions need to take place in the energy, transport and several industry sectors. To induce and accelerate such transitions, numerous policy interventions are required, which interact with each other in policy mixes. While several conceptual studies on policy mixes have been published recently, there is very little empirical research apart from single case or small-n studies. It has been prominently argued that the debate about policy mixes has reached an impasse partly due to this lack of empirical work. This paper addresses this gap by providing a first analysis of the temporal dynamics of complex policy mixes. To do so, we develop a conceptualization and measurement of policy mix balance across instrument types as well as policy mix design features (in the form of intensity as a general and technology specificity as a technology-focused design feature). This allows us to answer the question how temporal dynamics of policy mixes differ between countries regarding their balance and design features. Our measurement approach is developed bottom-up, i.e., policies are assessed individually and then aggregated systematically at the policy mix level. This enables overcoming the 'dependent variable problem in the study of policy change', i.e., the problem of measuring policy output. More specifically, we develop a comparative dataset of 522 renewable energy policies in nine OECD countries. Our analysis shows that countries' policy mix dynamics vary strongly regarding some variables (e.g., technology specificity) but less regarding others (e.g., balance). As a validity check, we also test the effects of these mix dynamics on policy outcome in the form of renewable energy technology diffusion. We reflect our findings in light of the theoretical debates around policy mixes and policy design and discuss how our results provoke an agenda for the new generation of research on policy mixes. We specifically discuss avenues for future research with a particular focus on the 'politics of policy mixes'.

AB Alien species can have major ecological and socioeconomic impacts in their novel ranges and so effective management actions are needed. However, management can be contentious and create conflicts, especially when stakeholders who benefit from alien species are different from those who incur costs. Such conflicts of interests mean that management strategies can often not be implemented. There is, therefore, increasing interest in engaging stakeholders affected by alien species or by their management. Through a facilitated workshop and consultation process including academics and managers working on a variety of organisms and in different areas (urban and rural) and ecosystems (terrestrial and aquatic), we developed a framework for engaging stakeholders in the management of alien species. The proposed framework for stakeholder engagement consists of 12 steps: (1) identify stakeholders; (2) select key stakeholders for engagement; (3) explore key stakeholders' perceptions and develop initial aims for management; (4) engage key stakeholders in the development of a draft management strategy; (5) re explore key stakeholders' perceptions and revise the aims of the strategy; (6) co-design general aims, management objectives and time frames with key stakeholders; (7) co-design a management strategy; (8) facilitate stakeholders' ownership of the strategy and adapt as required; and (9) implement the strategy and monitor management actions to evaluate the need for additional or future actions. In case additional management is needed after these actions take place, some extra steps should be taken: (10) identify any new stakeholders, benefits, and costs; (11) monitor engagement; and (12) revise management strategy. Overall, we believe that our framework provides an effective approach to minimize the impact of conflicts created by alien species management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Warmer temperatures are accelerating the phenology of organisms around the world. Temperature sensitivity of phenology might be greater in colder, higher latitude sites than in warmer regions, in part because small changes in temperature constitute greater relative changes in thermal balance at colder sites. To test this hypothesis, we examined up to 20 years of phenology data for 47 tundra plant species at 18 high-latitude sites along a climatic gradient. Across all species, the timing of leaf emergence and flowering was more sensitive to a given increase in summer temperature at colder than warmer high-latitude locations. A similar pattern was seen over time for the flowering phenology of a widespread species, Cassiope tetragona. These are among the first results highlighting differential phenological responses of plants across a climatic gradient and suggest the possibility of convergence in flowering times and therefore an increase in gene flow across latitudes as the climate warms.

AB 1. Ecological studies identifying a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services motivate projections that higher plant diversity will increase services from agroecosystems. While this idea is compelling, evidence of generalizable relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services that could be broadly applied in agricultural systems is lacking.
   2. Cover crops grown in rotation with cash crops are a realistic strategy to increase agroecosystem diversity. We evaluated the prediction that further increasing diversity with cover crop polycultures would enhance ecosystem services and multifunctionality in a 2-year study of eighteen cover crop treatments ranging in diversity from one to eight species. Five ecosystem services were measured in each cover crop system and regression analysis used to explore the relationship between multifunctionality and several diversity indices.
   3. As expected, there was a positive relationship between species richness and multifunctionality, but it only explained a small fraction of variance in ecosystem services ( marginal R-2 = 0.05). In contrast, indices of functional diversity, particularly the distribution of trait abundances, were stronger predictors of multifunctionality (marginal R-2 = 0.15-0.38).
   4. Synthesis and application. In a corn production system, simply increasing cover crop species richness will have a small impact on agroecosystem services, but designing polycultures that maximize functional diversity may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality.

AB Organisms exhibit an incredible diversity of life history strategies as adaptive responses to environmental variation. The establishment of novel life history strategies involves multilocus polymorphisms, which will be challenging to establish in the face of gene flow and recombination. Theory predicts that adaptive allelic combinations may be maintained and spread if they occur in genomic regions of reducedrecombination, such as chromosomal inversion polymorphisms, yet empirical support for this prediction is lacking. Here, we use genomic data to investigate the evolution of divergent adaptive ecotypes of the yellow monkey flower Mimulus guttatus.We show that a large chromosomal inversion polymorphism is the major region of divergence between geographically widespread annual and perennial ecotypes. In contrast, approximate to 40,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in collinear regions of the genome show no signal of life history, revealing genomic patterns of diversity have been shaped by localized homogenizing gene flow and large-scale Pleistocene range expansion. Our results provide evidence for an inversion capturing and protecting loci involved in local adaptation, while also explaining how adaptive divergence can occur with gene flow.

AB Over the past decades, climate change has induced transformations in the weed flora of arable ecosystems in Europe. For instance, thermophile weeds, late-emerging weeds, and some opportunistic weeds have become more abundant in some cropping systems. The composition of arable weed species is indeed ruled by environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation. Climate change also influences weeds indirectly by enforcing adaptations of agronomic practice. We therefore need more accurate estimations of the damage potential of arable weeds to develop effective weed control strategies while maintaining crop yield. Here we review the mechanisms of responses of arable weeds to the direct and indirect effects of climate change. Climate change effects are categorized into three distinct types of shifts occurring at different scales: (1) range shifts at the landscape scale, (2) niche shifts at the community scale, and (3) trait shifts of individual species at the population scale. Our main conclusions are changes in the species composition and new species introductions are favored, which facilitate major ecological and agronomical implications. Current research mainly considers processes at the landscape scale. Processes at the population and community scales have prevalent importance to devise sustainable management strategies. Trait-climate and niche-climate relationships warrant closer consideration when modeling the possible future distribution and damage potential of weeds with climate change.

AB AimTo propose a unified framework for quantifying taxon (T), phylogenetic (P) and functional (F) beta diversity via pairwise comparisons of communities, which allows these types of beta diversity to be partitioned into ecologically meaningful additive components.
   LocationGlobal, with case studies in Europe and the Azores archipelago.
   MethodsUsing trees as a common representation for taxon, phylogenetic and functional diversity, we partition total beta diversity ((total)) into its replacement (turnover, (repl)) and richness difference ((rich)) components according to which part of a global tree was shared by or unique to communities that were being compared. We demonstrate the application of this framework using artificial and empirical examples (mammals in Europe and epigean arthropods in the Azores).
   ResultsOur empirical examples show that comparing P and F with the most commonly used T revealed previously hidden patterns of beta diversity. More importantly, we demonstrate that partitioning P-total and F-total into their respective (repl) and (rich) components facilitates the detection of more complex patterns than using the overall coefficients alone, further elucidating the different forces operating in community assembly.
   Main conclusionsThe methods presented here allow the integration and full comparison of T, P and F. They provide a tool for effectively disentangling the replacement (turnover) and richness difference components of the different biodiversity facets within the same methodological framework.

AB Life on earth spans a size range of around 21 orders of magnitude across species and can span a range of more than 6 orders of magnitude within species of animal. The effect of size on physiology is, therefore, enormous and is typically expressed by how physiological phenomena scale with mass(b). When b not equal 1 a trait does not vary in direct proportion to mass and is said to scale allometrically. The study of allometric scaling goes back to at least the time of Galileo Galilei, and published scaling relationships are now available for hundreds of traits. Here, the methods of scaling analysis are reviewed, using examples for a range of traits with an emphasis on those related to metabolism in animals. Where necessary, new relationships have been generated from published data using modern phylogenetically informed techniques. During recent decades one of the most controversial scaling relationships has been that between metabolic rate and body mass and a number of explanations have been proposed for the scaling of this trait. Examples of these mechanistic explanations for metabolic scaling are reviewed, and suggestions made for comparing between them. Finally, the conceptual links between metabolic scaling and ecological patterns are examined, emphasizing the distinction between (1) the hypothesis that size-and temperature-dependent variation among species and individuals in metabolic rate influences ecological processes at levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere and (2) mechanistic explanations for metabolic rate that may explain the size-and temperature-dependence of this trait.

AB Phenol is a common wastewater contaminant from various industrial processes, including petrochemical refineries and chemical compounds production. Due to its toxicity to microbial activity, it can affect the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment processes. In this study, the efficiency of an Anaerobic Sequencing Batch Reactor (ASBR) fed with increasing phenol concentrations (from 120 to 1200 mg L-1) was assessed and the relationship between phenol degradation capacity and the microbial community structure was evaluated. Up to a feeding concentration of 800 mg L-1, the initial degradation rate steadily increased with phenol concentration (up to 180 mg L-1 d(-1)) and the elimination capacity remained relatively constant around 27 mg phenol removed.gVSS(-1) d(-1). Operation at higher concentrations (1200 mg L-1) resulted in a still efficient but slower process: the elimination capacity and the initial degradation rate decreased to, respectively, 11 mg phenol removed.gVSS(-1) d(-1) and 154 mg L-1 d(-1). As revealed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, the increase of phenol concentration induced level-dependent structural modifications of the community composition which suggest an adaptation process. The increase of phenol concentration from 120 to 800 mg L-1 had little effect on the community structure, while it involved drastic structural changes when increasing from 800 to 1200 mg L-1, including a strong community structure shift, suggesting the specialization of the community through the emergence and selection of most adapted phylotypes. The thresholds of structural and functional disturbances were similar, suggesting the correlation of degradation performance and community structure. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) confirmed that the ASBR functional performance was essentially driven by specific community traits. Under the highest feeding concentration, the most abundant ribotype probably involved in successful phenol degradation at 1200 mg L-1 was affiliated to the Anaerolineaceae family.

AB Conservation science strives to inform management decisions. Applying niche models in concert with future climate projections to project species vulnerability to extinction, range size loss, or distribution shifts has emerged as a potentially useful tool for informing resource management decisions. Making climate change niche modeling useful to conservation decisions requires centering studies on the types of decisions that are made regarding the focal taxa of a niche model study. Recent recommendations for climate adaptation strategies suggest four types of decision makers: policy, habitat protection, habitat management, species management. Targeting research to questions relevant for management decisions will increase utility of a niche model study. Constraints to the accuracy and precision of niche models to project potential future distributions are well-recognized. How to incorporate these uncertainties into management decision-making remains a challenge. Refining estimates and making sound management recommendations is critical because species that are generally modeled to be the most vulnerable to climate change (i.e., narrow endemics), are also the most vulnerable to bad decisions based on uncertain models. I review uncertainties of niche models to assert that there is an inherent bias for models to over-estimate climate-driven vulnerability to extirpation. Explicit recognition of this bias leads to a decision framework that accommodates unbalanced uncertainty. Namely, niche models may be more useful for identifying conservation opportunities identifying newly available habitats under changing climate than they are for asserting where current habitat will no longer exist under future climate states.

AB In the next century, the boreal ecosystems are projected to experience greater rates of warming than most other regions of the world. As the boreal forest constitutes a reservoir of trees of huge ecological importance and only partially known economic potential, any possible climate-related change in plant growth and dynamics has to be promptly predicted and evaluated. A model for assessing xylem phenology in black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] using daily temperatures and thermal thresholds was defined and applied to predict changes in onset, ending and duration of xylem growth under different warming scenarios with temperatures rising by up to 3 degrees C. This was achieved by collecting and analyzing a dataset obtained from a 7-year monitoring of cambium phenology and wood formation on a weekly time-scale in trees growing in four sites at different latitudes and altitudes in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region (Quebec, Canada). The onset of xylem growth occurred between mid-May and early June while the end ranged between mid-September and early October, resulting in a growing season of 101-141 days. The model predicted longer duration of xylem growth at higher temperatures, with an increase of 8-11 days/ degrees C, because of an earlier onset and later ending of growth. With an increase of 3 degrees C in the mean temperature during the year, the duration of xylem growth changed on average from 125 to 160 days. The predicted changes in cambial phenology could significantly affect future wood production of the boreal ecosystems.

AB Andean plant species are predicted to shift their distributions, or 'migrate,' upslope in response to future warming. The impacts of these shifts on species' population sizes and their abilities to persist in the face of climate change will depend on many factors including the distribution of individuals within species' ranges, the ability of species to migrate and remain at equilibrium with climate, and patterns of human land-use. Human land-use may be especially important in the Andes where anthropogenic activities above tree line may create a hard barrier to upward migrations, imperiling high-elevation Andean biodiversity. In order to better understand how climate change may impact the Andean biodiversity hotspot, we predict the distributional responses of hundreds of plant species to changes in temperature incorporating population density distributions, migration rates, and patterns of human land-use. We show that plant species from high Andean forests may increase their population sizes if able to migrate onto the expansive land areas above current tree line. However, if the pace of climate change exceeds species' abilities to migrate, all species will experience large population losses and consequently may face high risk of extinction. Using intermediate migration rates consistent with those observed for the region, most species are still predicted to experience population declines. Under a business-as-usual land-use scenario, we find that all species will experience large population losses regardless of migration rate. The effect of human land-use is most pronounced for high-elevation species that switch from predicted increases in population sizes to predicted decreases. The overriding influence of land-use on the predicted responses of Andean species to climate change can be viewed as encouraging since there is still time to initiate conservation programs that limit disturbances and/or facilitate the upward migration and persistence of Andean plant species.

AB Neoplastic progression is an evolutionary process driven by the generation of clonal diversity and natural selection on that diversity within a neoplasm. We hypothesized that clonal diversity is associated with risk of progression to cancer. We obtained molecular data from a cohort of 239 participants with Barrett's esophagus, including microsatellite shifts and loss of heterozygosity, DNA content tetraploidy and aneuploidy, methylation, and sequence mutations. Using these data, we tested all major diversity measurement methods, including genetic divergence and entropy-based measures, to determine which measures are correlated with risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. We also tested whether the use of different sets of loci and alterations to define clones (e. g., selectively advantageous versus evolutionarily neutral) improved the predictive value of the diversity indices. All diversity measures were strong and highly significant predictors of progression (Cox proportional hazards model, P < 0.001). The type of alterations evaluated had little effect on the predictive value of most of the diversity measures. In summary, diversity measures are robust predictors of progression to cancer in this cohort. Cancer Prev Res; 3(11); 1388-97. (C) 2010 AACR.

AB Biological invasions may expose populations to strong selection for local adaptation along geographical gradients in climate. However, evolution during contemporary timescales can be constrained by low standing genetic variation and genetic correlations among life-history traits. We examined limits to local adaptation associated with northern migration of the invasive wetland plant purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) using a selection model incorporating a trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction, and common garden experiments of populations sampled along a latitudinal transect of approximately 1200 km in eastern North America. A strong trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction caused early-flowering plants to be smaller with reduced seed production in northern populations. Northward spread was associated with a decline in genetic variance within populations and an increase in genetic skew for flowering time and size, with limited genetic variation for small, early-flowering genotypes. These patterns were predicted by our selection model of local adaptation to shorter growing seasons and were not consistent with expectations from non-adaptive processes. Reduced fecundity may limit population growth and rates of spread in northern populations. Identifying genetic constraints on key life-history traits can provide novel insights into invasion dynamics and the causes of range limits in introduced species.

AB We explored the effects of prevalence, latitudinal range and clumping (spatial autocorrelation) of species distribution patterns on the predictive accuracy of eight state-of-the-art modelling techniques: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Boosting Method (GBM), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA) and Random Forest (RF). One hundred species of Lepidoptera, selected from the Distribution Atlas of European Butterflies, and three climate variables were used to determine the bioclimatic envelope for each butterfly species. The data set consisting of 2620 grid squares 30' x 60' in size all over Europe was randomly split into the calibration and the evaluation data sets. The performance of different models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. Observed differences in modelling accuracy among species were then related to the geographical attributes of the species using GAM. The modelling performance was negatively related to the latitudinal range and prevalence, whereas the effect of spatial autocorrelation on prediction accuracy depended on the modelling technique. These three geographical attributes accounted for 19-61% of the variation in the modelling accuracy. Predictive accuracy of GAM, GLM and MDA was highly influenced by the three geographical attributes, whereas RF, ANN and GBM were moderately, and MARS and CTA only slightly affected. The contrasting effects of geographical distribution of species on predictive performance of different modelling techniques represent one source of uncertainty in species spatial distribution models. This should be taken into account in biogeographical modelling studies and assessments of climate change impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB P>An emergency life-history stage is expressed in breeding vertebrates when the immediate survival is threatened by poor energetic conditions (i.e. allostatic overload). This emergency life-history stage shifts energy investment away from reproduction and redirects it toward immediate survival.
   In birds, this emergency life-history stage is promoted by a release of the stress hormone corticosterone. However, how corticosterone reduces the expression of parental cares remains to be clarified. One hypothesis is that the release of corticosterone may also affect prolactin levels, a pituitary hormone widely involved in regulating parental behaviours.
   We tested this hypothesis by experimentally increasing corticosterone levels of chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) over a 2-day period and by monitoring prolactin levels over an 8-day period. We also investigated whether this hormonal manipulation affected nest attendance, the motivation to come back to the nest after a short-term stress and breeding success.
   Corticosterone treatment resulted in a significant increase in plasma corticosterone levels during the first 2 days, which returned to pre-treatment values at day 3. This short-term corticosterone increase was accompanied by a 30% decrease in prolactin levels. Prolactin levels were reduced in a progressive and persistent manner and did not return to their initial levels when corticosterone levels returned to pre-treatment levels. Moreover, although corticosterone levels had returned to pre-treatment values, low prolactin levels were associated with a reduced nest attendance and a greater latency to come back to the nest after a short-term stress. This hormonal treatment also significantly reduced breeding success.
   This experimental treatment strongly supports the idea that the secretion of these two hormones might be mechanistically linked. Thus, we showed that even a relatively short-term increase in corticosterone levels can durably affect plasma prolactin levels. Therefore, the well-established suppressive action of corticosterone on parental behaviour is probably mediated and reinforced through an effect on prolactin levels. This study highlights the need to consider the potential synergistic effects of these two hormones when studying on the hormonal basis of parental decisions.

AB 1. Although litter decomposition is a fundamental ecological process, most of our understanding comes from studies of single-species decay. Recently, litter-mixing studies have tested whether monoculture data can be applied to mixed-litter systems. These studies have mainly attempted to detect non-additive effects of litter mixing, which address potential consequences of random species loss - the focus is not on which species are lost, but the decline in diversity per se.
   2. Under global change, species loss is likely to be non-random, with some species more vulnerable to extinction than others. Under such scenarios, the effects of individual species (additivity) as well as of species interactions (non-additivity) on decomposition rates are of interest.
   3. To examine potential impacts of non-random species loss on ecosystems, we studied additive and non-additive effects of litter mixing on decomposition. A full-factorial litterbag experiment was conducted using four deciduous leaf species, from which mass loss and nitrogen content were measured. Data were analysed using a statistical approach that first looks for additive identity effects based on the presence or absence of species and then significant species interactions occurring beyond those. It partitions non-additive effects into those caused by richness and/or composition.
   4. This approach addresses questions key to understanding the potential effects of species loss on ecosystem processes. If additive effects dominate, the consequences for decomposition dynamics will be predictable based on our knowledge of individual species, but not statistically predictable if non-additive effects dominate.
   5. We found additive (identity) effects on mass loss and non-additive (composition) effects on litter nitrogen dynamics, suggesting that non-random species loss could significantly affect this system. We were able to identify the species responsible for effects that would otherwise have been considered idiosyncratic or absent when analysed by the methods used in previous work.
   6. Synthesis. We observed both additive and non-additive effects of litter-mixing on decomposition, indicating consequences of non-random species loss. To predict the consequences of global change for ecosystem functioning, studies should examine the effects of both random and non-random species loss, which will help identify the mechanisms that influence the response of ecosystems to environmental change.

AB Question: Is the response of plant traits to environment at the community level similar when considering species abundance and when considering species presence only?
   Location: Mountain grasslands, central Argentina.
   Methods: We used data from 57 floristic samples, ordinated through DCCA along moisture and grazing gradients combined with trait values from 85 species (plant height, leaf area, leaf thickness leaf toughness and SLA). For each sample, we calculated the weighted average (considering species abundance) and the simple average (considering only species presence). Through multiple regressions we analysed how each average (dependent variable) responded to moisture and grazing (DCCA scores along Axes 1 and 2, respectively, as independent variables).
   Results: Weighted averages of all traits were significantly associated to both gradients, while simple averages did not always respond. In some cases the responses followed similar but weaker trends than the responses of weighted averages, but in other cases these responses were qualitatively different. Traits more associated with size (plant height, leaf area, leaf thickness) responded more consistently (similar trends for both averages) to grazing than to moisture, while traits more associated with plant resource acquisition (SLA, leaf toughness) responded more consistently to moisture than to grazing.
   Conclusion: The trait values and combinations which determine the probability of species presence are not necessary the same as those which determine their probability of becoming abundant. To understand community assembly rules, both species presence and species abundance should be taken into account as the result of different, although closely linked, filtering processes.

AB The function of bird song is closely linked to sexual selection through female choice and male-male competition, and thus variation in communication success is likely to have major fitness consequences for a singing male. A crucial constraint on signal transmission is imposed by background noise, which may include songs from other species. I investigated whether singing nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos) avoid temporal overlap with the songs of other bird species in a playback experiment. I analysed the temporal song patterns of six males, each of which were exposed to songs of other species. The nightingales significantly avoided overlapping their songs with the playback songs, and started singing preferentially during the silent intervals between the heterospecific songs. This timing of song onset produced a greater variability in pause duration compared to the nightingales' undisturbed solo singing. These findings suggest that birds adjust their song timing to avoid acoustic interference on short temporal scales, and thus are able to improve the efficiency of acoustic communication in complex sonic environments. Moreover, the results indicate that temporal song patterns can be affected by the songs of other species, and thus such influences should be taken into account when studying bird song in the field.

AB Cities have a major impact on Australian landscapes, especially in coastal regions, to the detriment of native biodiversity. Areas suitable for urban development often coincide with those areas that support high levels of species diversity and endemism. However, there is a paucity of reliable information available to guide urban conservation planning and management, especially regarding the trade-off between investing in protecting and restoring habitat at the landscape level, and investing in programmes to maintain the condition of remnant vegetation at the local (site) level. We review the literature on Australian urban ecology, focusing on urban terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate fauna. We identify four main factors limiting our knowledge of urban fauna: (i) a lack of studies focusing at multiple ecological levels; (ii) a lack of multispecies studies; (iii) an almost total absence of long-term (temporal) studies; and (iv) a need for stronger integration of research outcomes into urban conservation planning and management. We present a set of key principles for the development of a spatially explicit, long-term approach to urban fauna research. This requires an understanding of the importance of local-level habitat quality and condition relative to the composition, configuration and connectivity of habitats within the larger urban landscape. These principles will ultimately strengthen urban fauna management and conservation planning by enabling us to prioritize and allocate limited financial resources to maximize the conservation return.

AB Arabis drummondii, A. holboellii and their hybrid A. x divaricarpa are widespread perennials of open habitats in North America. A phylogenetic analysis based on noncoding chloroplast DNA sequences (trnL intron and trnL/F intergenic spacer) resolved A. drummondii as a monophyletic taxon, but found A. holboellii to bear chloroplast haplotypes from highly diverged evolutionary lineages. This raised the question of a possible polyphyletic origin of A. holboellii. Arabis x divaricarpa was found to be of recent and polytopic origin, a result consistent with its presumed hybrid origin. One hundred and three chloroplast haplotypes were detected within 719 Arabis accessions investigated. The majority of chloroplast-types were estimated to have arisen prior to the Wisconsin glaciation. Phylogeographical analysis using nested clade analysis, suggested for A. holboellii (i) past fragmentation events, partitioning genetic variation in several instances between the Sierra Nevada, the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau on the one hand and the Central to Northern Rockies of the United States and adjacent Cascades on the other; and for both parental species (ii) recolonization of major areas formerly covered by the Wisconsin glaciation by three haplotypes; and (iii) restricted gene flow indicating isolation by distance in areas south of the last glacial maximum. Arabis x divaricarpa is closely codistributed with its parental species and resampled their haplotypes. The highest genetic diversity was found in the Rocky Mountains from Idaho and Montana south to Utah and Colorado. This area was further hypothesized to have played a major role in the origin of both parental species and probably represented an important glacial refugium. However, evidence for glacial refugia was also found in arctic and boreal regions of Alaska and near the Great Lakes. In comparison to nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer data, chloroplast DNA divergence was very high and evidently predated the origin of A. drummondii and possibly A. holboellii. Divergence of major chloroplast lineages dates back to the middle of the Pleistocene at least. Extensive hybridization is the most likely evolutionary factor working on A. holboellii to explain the revealed discrepancy in nuclear DNA and chloroplast DNA diversification.

AB Induced plant responses to herbivory appear to be universal, yet the degree to which they are specific to sets of herbivores is poorly understood. The generalist/specialist hypothesis predicts that generalist herbivores are more often negatively affected by host plant defenses, wheras specialists may be either unaffected by or attracted to these same "plant defenses". Therefore, specialists should be less predictable than generalists in their responses to induced plant resistance traits. To better understand the variation in plant responses to herbivore attack, and the impacts these responses have on specialist herbivores, we conducted a series of experiments examining pairwise interactinos between two specialaist herbivores of the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). We damaged plants mechnically, with swamp milkweed beetles (Labidomera clivicollis), or with monarchs (Danaus plexippus), and then asessed specificity of elicitation, both by measuring a putative defensive trait (latex volume) and by challenging plants with insects of both species in bioasays. Latex production increased by 34%, and 13% following beetle and monarch herbivory, respectively, but only beetles significantly elevated latex production compared to undamaged controls. While beetle growth was negatively affected by latex across all experiments, beetles were not affected by previous damage caused by conspecifies or by monarchs. In contrast, monarchs feeding on previously damaged plants were 20% smaller, and their response was the same on plants damaged mechnically or by either herbivore. Therefore, these specialist herbivores exhibit both specificity of elicitation in plant responses and specificity of effects in response to prior damage.

AB On their way from the wintering area to the breeding grounds in Spitsbergen, barnacle geese Branta leucopsis stage on islands off the coast of Norway. The aim of this study was to describe when the geese migrate in relation to the body stores deposited and explore questions related to the concept of optimal migration schedules and on the possible mechanisms involved. We estimated fat stores by repeated assessments of the abdominal profile index of individually marked females throughout staging. Reproductive success was derived from observations of the same individuals later in the annual cycle. Females arriving late, or with low fat stores at arrival, achieved higher fat deposition rates, probably by spending more time foraging. But they were unable to match final fat scores of birds that arrived earlier or with larger fat stores. Reproductive success was correlated with the timing of migration and individuals departing at intermediate dates achieved highest success. The exact date of peak reproductive success depended on the size of fat stores accumulated, such that low-quality birds (depositing less fat) benefited most from an early departure to the breeding grounds. Observations in the breeding colonies showed that these birds did not initiate a nest earlier but they spent a longer time in Spitsbergen before settling. The length of stay in Norway was close to the prediction derived from an optimisation model relating spring events to eventual breeding success. Poorest performing birds stayed longer than expected, perhaps depositing more fat to avoid the risk of starvation. Two possible mechanisms of the timing of migration were contrasted and it seemed that the geese departed for migration as soon as they were unable to accumulate any more fat stores.

AB The main focus of this article is to present and relate four different frameworks in which spatially explicit individual-based models (IBMs) can be defined. These frameworks differ in the way space and time are modeled; each can be treated either discretely or continuously. The emphasis is put on constructing and simulating one of the simplest single-species IBMs in each spatio-temporal framework, discussing some of their technical subtleties, and deriving corresponding mean-field models when the homogeneous mixing conditions are assumed to hold. The four frameworks are more supplements than competitors. Since at almost every step of IBM construction several alternatives are a priori plausible I discuss the most important ones in more details. This article seems to be the first attempt to collect and synthesize information of this kind that is scattered over the literature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We review our recent studies on the genetic structure of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations in the NW Atlantic. Our conclusions are based on knowledge of polymorphism at microsatellite DNA loci combined with known aspects of cod biology and ecology and with known oceanographic features in the NW Atlantic. Three case studies illustrate genetic heterogeneity between cod populations at the meso- and large-scales of coastal embayments and offshore banks and at the small-scale of oceanographic features. Our results generally highlight the importance of combining genetic with physiological, ecological, and oceanographic information, when assessing the genetic structure of highly abundant, widely distributed, and high gene-flow marine fish species. We highlight the role that oceanographic features (e.g., gyre-like systems) and known spatio-temporal differences in spawning time may play as barriers to gene-flow between and among neighboring and often contiguous cod populations in the NW Atlantic. We suggest that bathymetric and hydrodynamic/oceanographic structure represents a rational starting point for developing hypotheses aimed at assessing the genetic structure of high gene-flow marine fish species.

AB The distribution pattern of individual plant species, as well as of plant communities, at the transition between the alpine and the nival environment (= alpine-nival ecotone) is likely to he drastically affected by climate change. Currently, the best way to explore the vegetation structure and to detect possible changes is the application of spatial modeling to predict vegetation patterns over larger areas combined with dynamic modeling techniques. Schrankogel in Tyrol, Austria, was selected as a typical high alpine mountain to establish and test such models. As a first step, the predictive model for the spatial pattern of species and plant communities is presented here. Direct and indirect gradient analyses (CA, CCA) were combined with GIS-techniques based on a fine-grained Digital Elevation Model (DEM; pixel size: 1 m(2)). Approximately 1000 field samples (vascular plant species and cover within 1 m(2) squares) distributed over the alpine-nival ecotone of the mountain were taken as the vegetation data input. Topographic descriptors were derived from the DEM as habitat characters of those samples. Using the correlations between vegetation samples and habitat characters, single plant species as well as community distribution could be predicted for the pixels of the whole model area (the studied ecotone area contained a total of 650,000 pixels) for which habitat characters were known from the DEM. Distinct distribution patterns at different spatial resolutions appeared for individual species, species groups, and communities in relation to the relief. Descriptors of relief curvature and roughness explained more of the variability than "classical" terrain attributes, such as elevation or exposure. Nevertheless, the altitudinal gradient was clearly reflected by the CCA ordination. As species richness of vascular plants was recorded in each sample plot, biodiversity distribution patterns could be modeled. These patterns showed the general trend of decline of biodiversity with altitude, but with a maximum of species richness at the ecotone itself. Since the relief modifies the high mountain climate remarkably, this differentiated relief dependency of vegetation supports the view that this type of environments will be affected significantly by climate change.

AB A simulation model containing size-based rules for foraging. growth, and probability of survival was created to track the fates of pelagic larval fish. The relative success of cohorts comprised of equivalent initial biomass but containing different numbers and sizes of first-feeding larvae was compared in environments having different levels of patchiness and densities of food resources. In environments containing randomly distributed prey, the rate of growth and probability of survival were always greater, and duration of the larval stage was shorter for larger larvae due to the size-based rules. Broods comprised of fewer but larger first-feeding larvae resulted in the greatest number of survivors in low-prey-density environments. In prey-rich environments, broods containing the same initial biomass divided into greater numbers of small first-feeding larvae resulted in more survivors. This result occurred despite the fact that. on a per-individual basis, survival rate was much lower initially in larger broods. We used a negative binomial algorithm to generate encounter probabilities with patchily distributed prey on small spatial scales in which the previous day's experiences had no relationship to current probabilities for encounter. In prey-poor environments, the strategy of producing fewer large larvae was superior at all levels of small-scale prey patchiness. In prey-rich environments, broods containing larger numbers of smaller larvae resulted in more survivors in simulations for randomly distributed and moderately clumped prey. With greater clumping of prey, the greatest number of survivors resulted from the strategy of producing fewer but larger larvae. To examine the effect of large-scale prey patchiness, we solved for the percentage of a larval cohort that would have to settle and remain within a prey-rich patch, in order for a strategy of producing many small larvae to yield more survivors than a strategy of producing fewer larger larvae under the same conditions. When prey patches contained 200 prey/L (compared with 50 prey/L outside) and as few as 1% of the brood settled into the prey-rich patches, large broods comprised of 3-mm larvae yielded more survivors than small broods comprised of 10-mm larvae. Our simulations indicate that the superior evolutionary strategy is the investment in larger numbers of smaller eggs when resources are patchy on a relatively large spatial scale.

AB 1. Two-phase mosaics (densely vegetated patches regularly alternating with almost bare areas) occur on smooth slopes of many arid lands of the world as a result of rainwater redistribution through sheet-flow run off. This paper reports the vegetation dynamics (through synchronic and diachronic approaches) of both the upslope and downslope fringes of vegetated patches (vegetation arcs) located in the Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico. 2. Ten vegetation arcs were used in a synchronic study and one of them in an 8-year diachronic study (1982-90). Data gathered in 2-m-wide, 8-15-m-long grids of 25-cm x 25-cm contiguous quadrats were used to study the variation of species richness, life-form dominance, dominance-diversity relationships and species composition across the fringes. 3. A colonization process developed in the upslope fringes; (i) species richness increased gradually to a peak and then decreased, as would be expected in an ecotone; (ii) this peak coincided spatially with a change in life form and floristic dominance; and (iii) communities with geometric-like distributions of abundance were replaced by communities with log-normal-like distributions of abundance, which are common in successional processes. 4. The diachronic study showed that the peak of species richness had moved upslope with a concomitant colonization of new space in that direction. The displacement of that peak, coupled with changes over time in the dominance of life forms and in the dominance-diversity relationships, provided additional evidence that a successional process of colonization develops. Likewise, long-term variations in floristic composition of the upslope quadrats were explained by time, position along the grid and rainfall, in order of decreasing importance. 5. There was a determinism both in the life form and in the floristic replacement processes observed upslope, suggesting a general scheme of obligatory succession. The bare area was colonized by short-lived perennials and/or facultative therophytes that almost never appear in the main body of the arcs. These species are gradually replaced by tussock grasses and seedlings of woody species which are the dominants in the main body of the arcs. 6. A different process can be inferred from the structural variability in space observed in the downslope fringes. A spatially non-contagious variation in species richness, a spatially non-patterned variation in life-form dominance, and a constancy in geometric-like dominance-diversity relationships suggested that colonization processes were not developing. A long-term decrease in species richness as well as in life-form diversity and a reduction in the abundance of tussock grasses suggested that a process of senescence without new recruitments was occurring. Analysis of the variation of floristic data through time showed the floristic impoverishment of a grassland community dominated by Hilaria mutica coupled with a reduction in the abundance of that species. 7. The dynamics of colonization of bare areas in two-phase mosaics offers an example of succession in arid lands that is probably present in all the world areas where these two-phase mosaics have been reported (the Middle East, Africa, Australia and North America).

AB It is proposed that evaluations of disturbance effects upon community diversity will be influenced by two factors currently overlooked in models addressing disturbance-diversity relationships: (1) the spatial scale of inquiry, and (2) the level of the species abundance (dominance) hierarchy at which the search for diversity is done. We analyzed how two disturbance types - cattle grazing and large flooding - affected community diversity at two spatial scales (stand and patch) and three levels of species dominance in a grassland of the Flooding Pampa, Argentina. The effect of disturbance interaction was also examined. Species diversity at the stand scale was reduced by either grazing or flooding. Both disturbances decreased community spatial heterogeneity. At the patch scale, diversity declined with flooding but was enhanced by grazing. Flooding increased diversity under grazing conditions. However, stand diversity was highest in the undisturbed grassland; pattern diversity was the salient feature in this condition. The combination of disturbances yielded the highest patch-scale diversity; grazing increased richness whilst flooding enhanced evenness. Comparisons among grassland conditions appeared scale-dependent. Moreover, the extent of disturbance effects varied with the level of dominance hierarchy considered. We point out the relevance of site history and initial conditions, encompassing the possibility of disturbances interaction, to the patterns produced by disturbance events. Effects perceived at different spatial scales, or in species positioned at separate dominance levels, may parallel meaningful changes in the relative importance of factors controlling species coexistence and community organization.

AB Several advanced treatments, such as ozonation or activated carbon adsorption, are currently considered for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). However, little is known on the overall performances of a WWTP upgraded with those processes and the benefits provided regarding the elimination of multiple families of OMPs. In this study, 5 sampling campaigns were performed to determine the removal of 48 OMPs in a WWTP followed by an activated carbon pilot. The primary treatment had no effect on OMPs (removals < 20%), whereas the biological treatment removed OMPs that can be easily sorbed onto sludges or biodegraded (>60%). The additional elimination provided by the advanced treatment was not significant (<10%) for OMPs already well removed in the WWTP) but was substantial (>30%) for recalcitrant OMPs. Removals higher than 60% were obtained for all OMPs (except azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole) over the WWTP and the activated carbon pilot. The adsorption conditions (10 g/m(3) fresh activated 'Carbon addition) were not sufficient to achieve the 80% removal targeted in Switzerland for compounds suggested as indicator substances for wastewater treatment. A higher dose of activated carbon or the combination with another advanced treatment should be used to achieve a satisfactory removal of those compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the late twentieth century, "citizen science" has become an increasingly fashionable label for a growing number of participatory research activities. This paper situates the origins and rise of the term "citizen science" and offers a new framework to better understand the diversity of epistemic practices involved in these participatory projects. It contextualizes "citizen science" within the broader history of public participation in science and analyzes critically the current promises-democratization, education, discoveries-emerging within the "citizen science" discourse. Finally, it maps a number of historical, political, and social questions for future research in the critical studies of "citizen science."

AB Lake Tanganyika is the oldest and phenotypically most diverse of the three East African cichlid fish adaptive radiations. It is also the cradle for the younger parallel haplochromine cichlid radiations in Lakes Malawi and Victoria. Despite its evolutionary significance, the relationships among the main Lake Tanganyika lineages remained unresolved, as did the general timescale of cichlid evolution. Here, we disentangle the deep phylogenetic structure of the Lake Tanganyika radiation using anchored phylogenomics and uncover hybridization at its base, as well as early in the haplochromine radiation. This suggests that hybridization might have facilitated these speciation bursts. Time-calibrated trees support that the radiation of Tanganyika cichlids coincided with lake formation and that Gondwanan vicariance concurred with the earliest splits in the cichlid family tree. Genes linked to key innovations show signals of introgression or positive selection following colonization of lake habitats and species' dietary adaptations are revealed as major drivers of colour vision evolution. These findings shed light onto the processes shaping the evolution of adaptive radiations.

AB Boreal forests and arctic tundra cover 33% of global land area and store an estimated 50% of total soil carbon. Because wildfire is a key driver of terrestrial carbon cycling, increasing fire activity in these ecosystems would likely have global implications. To anticipate potential spatiotemporal variability in fire-regime shifts, we modeled the spatially explicit 30-yr probability of fire occurrence as a function of climate and landscape features (i.e. vegetation and topography) across Alaska. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models captured the spatial distribution of fire across boreal forest and tundra ecoregions (AUC from 0.63-0.78 and Pearson correlations between predicted and observed data from 0.54-0.71), highlighting summer temperature and annual moisture availability as the most influential controls of historical fire regimes. Modeled fire-climate relationships revealed distinct thresholds to fire occurrence, with a nonlinear increase in the probability of fire above an average July temperature of 13.4 degrees C and below an annual moisture availability (i.e. P-PET) of approximately 150 mm. To anticipate potential fire-regime responses to 21st-century climate change, we informed our BRTs with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate projections under the RCP 6.0 scenario. Based on these projected climatic changes alone (i.e. not accounting for potential changes in vegetation), our results suggest an increasing probability of wildfire in Alaskan boreal forest and tundra ecosystems, but of varying magnitude across space and throughout the 21st century. Regions with historically low flammability, including tundra and the forest-tundra boundary, are particularly vulnerable to climatically induced changes in fire activity, with up to a fourfold increase in the 30-yr probability of fire occurrence by 2100. Our results underscore the climatic potential for novel fire regimes to develop in these ecosystems, relative to the past 6000-35 000 yr, and spatial variability in the vulnerability of wildfire regimes and associated ecological processes to 21st-century climate change.

AB Habitat fragmentation, an important element of current global change, has profound repercussions on population and species extinction. Landscape fragmentation reduces individual movements between patches (i.e. dispersal) while such movements connecting patches enhance the persistence of metapopulations and metacommunities. Through the recognition of non-random movements, dispersal has recently been recognized as a highly complex process. This complexity likely changes the predictions on the evolution of dispersal in spatially structured populations and communities. In this article, we emphasize the effects of fragmentation on the evolution of non-random dispersal. Habitat fragmentation may shape local and global selective pressures acting on a large array of phenotypic traits known to covary with dispersal behaviors. On top of changes in dispersal propensity, habitat fragmentation could therefore modify dispersal syndromes (i.e. dispersers' phenotypic specializations). Habitat fragmentation often leads to spatial structuring of local conditions and consequently may lead to the evolution of different dispersal syndromes at the landscape scale. By neglecting impacts on dispersal syndromes, we might underestimate the impacts of fragmentation on a crucial biodiversity level for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning. We highlight a set of priorities for future empirical and theoretical work that together would provide the understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics of dispersal syndromes required for improving our ability to predict and manage spatially structured populations and communities.
