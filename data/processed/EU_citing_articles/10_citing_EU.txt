AB Abies, the second largest genus of Pinaceae, consists of approximately 48 species occurring in the north temperate region. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies improved our understanding of relationships within the genus, but were limited by relying on only DNA sequence data from single genome and low taxonomic sampling. Here we use DNA data from three genomes (sequences of internal transcribed spacer of nrITS, three chloroplast DNA intergenic spacers, and two mitochondria( intergenic spacers) from 42 species to elucidate species relationships and construct the biogeographic history of Abies. We further estimated the divergence times of intercontinental disjunction using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with three macro-fossils. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered six robust clades largely consistent with previous classifications of sections. A sister relationship between the eastern Asian and Europe-Mediterranean clades was highly supported. The monophyly of section Balsamea, disjunct in Far East and western North America, is supported by the nrITS data but not by the cpDNA data. Discordance on placement of section Balsamea between the paternally inherited cpDNA and maternally inherited mtDNA trees was also observed. The data suggested that ancient hybridization was likely involved in the origin of sect. Balsamea. Results from biogeographic analyses and divergence time estimation suggested an origin and early diversification of Abies in an area of high latitude around the Pacific during the Eocene. The present disjunction in eastern Asia and Europe-Mediterranean area of Abies was likely the result of southward migration and isolation by the Turgai Strait in the Late Eocene. An 'out-of-America' migration, for the origin of an eastern Asian and western North American disjunct species pairs in section Amabilis was supported. The results suggested a western North American origin of the section with subsequent dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) to Japan during the Middle Miocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding the ecological mechanisms driving beta diversity is a major goal of community ecology. Metacommunity theory brings new ways of thinking about the structure of local communities, including processes occurring at different spatial scales. In addition to new theories, new methods have been developed which allow the partitioning of individual and shared contributions of environmental and spatial effects, as well as identification of species and sites that have importance in the generation of beta diversity along ecological gradients. We analyzed the spatial distribution of dung beetle communities in areas of Atlantic Forest in a mainland-island scenario in southern Brazil, with the objective of identifying the mechanisms driving composition, abundance and biomass at three spatial scales (mainland-island, areas and sites). We sampled 20 sites across four large areas, two on the mainland and two on the island. The distribution of our sampling sites was hierarchical and areas are isolated. We used standardized protocols to assess environmental heterogeneity and sample dung beetles. We used spatial eigenfunctions analysis to generate the spatial patterns of sampling points. Environmental heterogeneity showed strong variation among sites and a mild increase with increasing spatial scale. The analysis of diversity partitioning showed an increase in beta diversity with increasing spatial scale. Variation partitioning based on environmental and spatial variables suggests that environmental heterogeneity is the most important driver of beta diversity at the local scale. The spatial effects were significant only at larger spatial scales. Our study presents a case where environmental heterogeneity seems to be the main factor structuring communities at smaller scales, while spatial effects are more important at larger scales. The increase in beta diversity that occurs at larger scales seems to be the result of limitation in species dispersal ability due to habitat fragmentation and the presence of geographical barriers.

AB 1. Research concerning spatial dynamics of biodiversity generally has been limited to considerations of the taxonomic dimension, which is insensitive to interspecific variation in ecological or evolutionary characteristics that play important roles in species assembly and provide linkages to ecosystem services. Consequently, the assumption that the taxonomic dimension is a good surrogate for other dimensions remains unconfirmed.
   2. We assessed variation in taxonomic (species richness) as well as phylogenetic and functional (Rao's quadratic entropy, a measurement of dispersion) dimensions of bat biodiversity along an elevational gradient in the Manu Biosphere Reserve of Peru. Phylogenetic dispersion was based on relatedness of species derived from a mammalian supertree. Functional dispersion was estimated separately for each of six functional components that reflect particular niche axes (e. g. diet, foraging strategy, body size) and for all functional components combined.
   3. Species richness declined nonlinearly with elevation, whereas phylogenetic dispersion and functional dispersion based on all functional components were not significantly associated with elevation (orthogonal polynomial regression). Moreover, considerable heterogeneity in the form of elevational relationships existed among functional components. After accounting for variation in species richness, dispersion of phylogenetic, diet and foraging strategy attributes were significantly greater than expected at high elevations, whereas dispersion of body size was significantly less than expected at high elevations.
   4. Species richness was a poor surrogate for phylogenetic or functional dispersion. Functional dispersion based on multiple components obscured patterns detected by particular components and hindered identification of mechanistic explanations for elevational variation in biodiversity.
   5. Variation in phylogenetic dispersion effectively captured the composite variation represented by all functional components, suggesting a phylogenetic signal in functional attributes.
   6. Mechanisms that give rise to variation in richness do not fully account for variation in phylogenetic or functional characteristics of assemblages. Greater than expected phylogenetic, diet and foraging strategy dispersion at high elevations were associated with the loss of phylogenetically or functionally redundant species, suggesting that increasing interspecific competition with decreasing productivity resulted in competitive exclusion. In contrast, low dispersion of size attributes at high elevations suggests the importance of abiotic filtering that favours small-sized species that can more easily enter torpor.

AB Urbanization is a strong and extensive driver that causes environmental pollution and climate change from local to global scale. Modeling cities as ecosystems has been initiated by a wide range of scientists as a key to addressing challenging problems concomitant with urbanization. In this paper, 'urban ecosystem modeling (UEM)' is defined in an inter-disciplinary context to acquire a broad perception of urban ecological properties and their interactions with global change. Furthermore, state-of-the-art models of urban ecosystems are reviewed, categorized as top-down models (including materials/energy-oriented models and structure-oriented models), bottom-up models (including land use-oriented models and infrastructure-oriented models), or hybrid models thereof. Based on the review of UEM studies, a future framework for explicit UEM is proposed based the integration of UEM approaches of different scales, guiding more rational urban management and efficient emissions mitigation.

AB Agrobiodiversity can improve the sustainability of cropping systems in a context of low external inputs and unpredictable climate change. Agrobiodiversity strategies to grow wheat are breeding ad hoc cultivars for organic and low-input systems, wheat-legume intercrops and living mulches, cultivar mixtures, and the use of genetically heterogeneous populations. However, applying those strategies can fail due the lack of a well-focused framework. Therefore, we need a better integration between breeding and management and a clear focus on crop traits related to key agroecosystem services. Here, we review the use of agrobiodiversity in wheat production, focusing on breeding and management. We discuss five agroecosystem services: (1) weed reduction, (2) nitrogen use efficiency, (3) abiotic stress tolerance, (4) disease and pest reduction and (5) yield and yield stability. We categorise agrobiodiversity into functional identity, functional composition, and functional diversity, in order to link crop traits to agroecosystem services. Linking crop traits to agroecosystem services could in turn lead to concrete options for farmers and policy. We discuss the relations between crop identity and crop heterogeneity. We also discuss the partitioning of crop heterogeneity between functional composition and functional diversity.

AB Increase in temperature under the projected future climate change would affect tree growth, including the physiological mechanisms related to sapling responses, which has been examined recently. The study investigated the plant water relations, cambial activity and wood formation in black spruce saplings [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] subjected to water deficit and warming. Four-year-old saplings growing in three greenhouses were submitted to different thermal conditions: T0, with a temperature equal to the external air temperature; and T + 2 and T + 5, with temperatures set at 2 and 5 K higher than T0, respectively. We also submitted saplings to two irrigation regimes and studied the effects of a water deficit of 32 days in May-June. We evaluated plant water relations, cambial activity, wood formation and anatomical characteristics from May to October 2010. Lower needle physiology rates were observed during water deficit, with 20-day suspension of irrigation, but after re-watering, non-irrigated saplings attained the same values as irrigated ones in all thermal conditions. Significant differences between irrigation regimes were detected in cambial activity at the end of the water deficit and after resumption of irrigation. Under warmer conditions, the recovery of non-irrigated saplings was slower than T0 and they needed from 2 to 4 weeks to completely restore cambial activity. No significant differences in wood anatomy were observed between irrigation regimes, but there was a sporadic effect on wood density under warming. During wood formation, the warmer conditions combined with water deficit increased sapling mortality by 5 and 12.2% for T + 2 and T + 5, respectively. The black spruce saplings that survived were more sensitive to water availability, and the restoration of cambial activity was slower at temperatures higher than T0. Our results suggest that black spruce showed a plastic response to intense water deficit under warming, but this would compromise their survival.

AB Synthesis The temporal stability of plant production is greater in communities with high than low species richness, but stability also may depend on species abundances and growth-related traits. Annual precipitation varied by greater than a factor of three over 11 years in central Texas, USA leading to large variation in production. Stability was greatest in communities that were not dominated by few species and in which dominant species rooted shallowly, had dense leaves, or responded to the wettest year with a minimal increase in production. Stability may depend as much on species abundances and functional traits as on species richness alone. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) varies in response to temporal fluctuations in weather. Temporal stability of community ANPP may be increased by increasing plant species richness, but stability often varies at a given richness level implying a dependence on abundances and functional properties of member species. We measured stability in ANPP during 11 years in field plots (Texas, USA) in which we varied the richness and relative abundances of perennial grassland species at planting. We sought to identify species abundance patterns and functional traits linked to the acquisition and processing of essential resources that could be used to improve richness-based predictions of community stability. We postulated that community stability would correlate with abundance-weighted indices of traits that influence plant responses to environmental variation. Annual precipitation varied by a factor of three leading to large inter-annual variation in ANPP. Regression functions with planted and realized richness (species with > 1% of community ANPP during the final four years) explained 32% and 25% of the variance in stability, respectively. Regression models that included richness plus the fraction of community ANPP produced by the two most abundant species in combination with abundance-weighted values of either the fraction of sampled root biomass at 20-45 cm depth, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), or response to greater-than-average precipitation of plants grown in monocultures explained 58-69% (planted richness) and 58-64% (realized richness) of the variance in stability. Stability was greatest in communities that were not strongly dominated by only two species and in which plants rooted shallowly, had high values of LDMC, or responded to the wettest year with a minimal increase in ANPP. Our results indicate that the temporal stability of grassland ANPP may depend as much on species abundances and functional traits linked to plant responses to precipitation variability as on species richness alone.

AB Aim Species inhabiting fresh waters are severely affected by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Effective management and conservation plans require advances in the accuracy and reliability of species distribution forecasts. Here, we forecast distribution shifts of Salmo trutta based on environmental predictors and examine the effect of using different statistical techniques and varying geographical extents on the performance and extrapolation of the models obtained.
   Location Watercourses of Ebro, Elbe and Danube river basins (c. 1,041,000 km(2); Mediterranean and temperate climates, Europe).
   Methods The occurrence of S. trutta and variables of climate, land cover and stream topography were assigned to stream reaches. Data obtained were used to build correlative species distribution models (SDMs) and forecasts for future decades (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) under the A1b emissions scenario, using four statistical techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, random forest, and multivariate adaptive regression).
   Results The SDMs showed an excellent performance. Climate was a better predictor than stream topography, while land cover characteristics were not necessary to improve performance. Forecasts predict the distribution of S. trutta to become increasingly restricted over time. The geographical extent of data had a weak impact on model performance and gain/loss values, but better species response curves were generated using data from all three basins collectively. By 2080, 64% of the stream reaches sampled will be unsuitable habitats for S. trutta, with Elbe basin being the most affected, and virtually no new habitats will be gained in any basin.
   Main conclusions More reliable predictions are obtained when the geographical data used for modelling approximate the environmental range where the species is present. Future research incorporating both correlative and mechanistic approaches may increase robustness and accuracy of predictions.

AB Recent studies assessing the role of biological diversity for ecosystem functioning indicate that the diversity of functional traits and the evolutionary history of species in a community, not the number of taxonomic units, ultimately drives the biodiversity-ecosystem-function relationship. Here, we simultaneously assessed the importance of plant functional trait and phylogenetic diversity as predictors of major trophic groups of soil biota (abundance and diversity), six years from the onset of a grassland biodiversity experiment. Plant functional and phylogenetic diversity were generally better predictors of soil biota than the traditionally used species or functional group richness. Functional diversity was a reliable predictor for most biota, with the exception of soil microorganisms, which were better predicted by phylogenetic diversity. These results provide empirical support for the idea that the diversity of plant functional traits and the diversity of evolutionary lineages in a community are important for maintaining higher abundances and diversity of soil communities.

AB Human-wildlife conflicts are a global problem, and are occurring in many countries where human and wildlife requirements overlap. Conflicts are particularly common near protected areas where societal unrest is large. To ease conflict, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) have been implemented. The Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) is an example of an ICDP. We hypothesized that (i) a higher perceived effectiveness of CAMPFIRE would be associated with a decline in human-wildlife conflicts, and (ii) local communities with higher perceived effectiveness of CAMPFIRE programs would have more favorable attitudes towards problematic wild animals. Four focus group discussions and interviews with 236 respondents were conducted in four local communities adjacent to northern Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe from December 2010 to August 2011. Moreover, we included data on recorded incidences of human-wildlife conflicts and CAMPFIRE financial returns to study communities between 2000 and 2010. Our results indicate that local communities showed considerable differences in how CAMPFIRE effectiveness was perceived. Local communities with higher ratings of CAMPFIRE effectiveness generally perceived a decline in human-wildlife conflicts, although some people had experienced problems with wild animals. Attitudes towards main problematic wild animals varied across the study communities and were partly associated with perceived CAMPFIRE effectiveness. Our findings partly support both of our study hypotheses. Contextual factors across the four local communities seemed to influence the perceived effectiveness of CAMPFIRE programs and attitudes towards problematic wildlife species. We recommend that decisions and actions regarding the control of problem animals be devolved to the community level in order to help reduce human-wildlife conflicts in community-based natural resources management programs.

AB Results of a lake model intercomparison study conducted within the framework of Lake Model Intercomparison Project are presented. The investigated lake was Grosser Kossenblatter See (Germany) as a representative of shallow, (2 m mean depth) turbid midlatitude lakes. Meteorological measurements, including turbulent fluxes and water temperature, were carried out by the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory of the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). Eight lake models of different complexity were run, forced by identical meteorological variables and model parameters unified as far as possible given different formulations of processes. All models generally captured diurnal and seasonal variability of lake surface temperature reasonably well. However, some models were incapable of realistically reproducing temperature stratification in summer. Total heat turbulent fluxes, computed by the surface flux schemes of the compared lake models, deviated on average from those measured by eddy covariance by 17-28 W m(-2). There are a number of possible reasons for these deviations, and the conclusion is drawn that underestimation of real fluxes by the eddy covariance technique is the most probable reason. It is supported by the fact that the eddy covariance fluxes do not allow to close the heat balance of the water column, the residual for the whole period considered being approximate to -28 W m(-2). The effect of heat flux to bottom sediments can become significant for bottom temperatures. It also has profound influence on the surface temperatures in autumn due to convective mixing but not in summer when the lake stratification is stable. Thus, neglecting sediments shifts the summer-autumn temperature difference in models lacking explicit treatment of sediments considerably. As a practical recommendation based on results of the present study, we also infer that in order to realistically represent lakes in numerical weather prediction and climate models, it is advisable to use depth-resolving turbulence models (or equivalent) in favor of models with a completely mixed temperature profile.

AB The functional diversity of a community can influence ecosystem functioning and reflects assembly processes. The large number of disparate metrics used to quantify functional diversity reflects the range of attributes underlying this concept, generally summarized as functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence. However, in practice, we know very little about which attributes drive which ecosystem functions, due to a lack of field-based tests. Here we test the association between eight leading functional diversity metrics (Rao's Q, FD, FDis, FEve, FDiv, convex hull volume, and species and functional group richness) that emphasize different attributes of functional diversity, plus 11 extensions of these existing metrics that incorporate heterogeneous species abundances and trait variation. We assess the relationships among these metrics and compare their performances for predicting three key ecosystem functions (above-and belowground biomass and light capture) within a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. Many metrics were highly correlated, although unique information was captured in FEve, FDiv, and dendrogram-based measures (FD) that were adjusted by abundance. FD adjusted by abundance outperformed all other metrics in predicting both above-and belowground biomass, although several others also performed well (e. g. Rao's Q, FDis, FDiv). More generally, trait-based richness metrics and hybrid metrics incorporating multiple diversity attributes outperformed evenness metrics and single-attribute metrics, results that were not changed when combinations of metrics were explored. For light capture, species richness alone was the best predictor, suggesting that traits for canopy architecture would be necessary to improve predictions. Our study provides a comprehensive test linking different attributes of functional diversity with ecosystem function for a grassland system.

AB Aim A debate exists as to whether present-day diversity gradients are governed by current environmental conditions or by changes in environmental conditions through time. Recent studies have shown that latitudinal richness gradients might be partially caused by incomplete post-glacial recolonization of high-latitude regions; this leads to the prediction that less mobile taxa should have steeper gradients than more mobile taxa. The aim of this study is to test this prediction. Location Europe. Methods We first assessed whether spatial turnover in species composition is a good surrogate for dispersal ability by measuring the proportion of wingless species in 19 European beetle clades and relating this value to spatial turnover (beta sim) of the clade. We then linearly regressed beta sim values of 21 taxa against the slope of their respective diversity gradients. Results A strong relationship exists between the proportion of wingless species and beta sim, and beta sim was found to be a good predictor of latitudinal richness gradients. Main conclusions Results are consistent with the prediction that poor dispersers have steeper richness gradients than good dispersers, supporting the view that current beetle diversity gradients in Europe are affected by post-glacial dispersal lags.

AB Defoliation by herbivores may alter the source:sink balance of trees leading to transient decreases in carbon (C) stores. When C stores are replenished concurrently with re-growth both processes may compete, store formation proceeding at the expenses of growth. However, the interactions between both processes are not fully understood. We investigated the effects of defoliation by the pine processionary moth (PPM, Thaumetopoea pityocampa Dennis and Schiff.) on the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and nitrogen (N) stores and the growth of Pinus nigra Arnold trees. Short-term effects were evaluated immediately after a PPM outbreak and at the end of the first growing season in trees suffering a range of defoliation damage. Long-term effects were explored by a 17-year-long PPM defoliation experiment, with 11 years of repeated defoliation treatments followed by 6 years of recovery. Defoliation by PPM was followed by transient NSC decreases, but trees were able to exceed initial NSC pools and compensate growth in just one growing season. Such recovery was linked to increased foliage N. Repeated severe defoliations decreased growth and survival of trees in the long-term, but trees increased starch allocation to stems. Defoliation led to an accumulation of C storage compounds in P. nigra trees irrespective of their ability to re-grow. In trees included in the short-term experiment, the accumulation of stores proceeded concurrently with re-growth. However, the repeated severe defoliations included in our long-term experiment impaired the growth of trees, surplus C being accumulated as stores. These results indicate that, growth declines in pines defoliated by PPM are not due to C (source) limitation but may respond to the reduced sink strength of growing meristems due to defoliation, and thus, a decrease in C allocation to growth.

AB Non-native species have reached South American ecosystems and may be threatening the exceptional biodiversity of this region. However, people often value and exploit introduced species not knowing that they are non-natives, nor understanding their impacts. In this paper we analyze the trend of scientific research on introduced species in South America and whether a socio-cultural explanation could underlie the results by comparing them with European, North American and Australasian countries. We also controlled for research effort, which could reflect economic inequalities, by analyzing the articles published on introduced species in relation to the total number of articles published on related disciplines. Research trends suggest that non-native species are not of major concern for South American countries, there being less research on this topic in countries with higher biodiversity. Compared to other colonized countries such as the USA, New Zealand and Australia, research on non-native species was lagging and less abundant in South America, even when controlling for research effort. Historical and recent socio-cultural particularities may explain the similar attitudes and research input seen in South American countries and their Spanish and Portuguese colonizers. A generational amnesia, where younger generations descendent from European colonizers are not aware of past biological conditions, could be exacerbating this lack of concern. South American policies seem to reflect the low level of interest in non-native species shown by their citizens. National policies are poorly developed and mainly deal with alien species threatening productive systems. Given the strong cultural component of this dilemma, integrated ways to reverse this situation are needed, including education, international research collaboration, and a common South American policy.

AB 1. Alterations in land use and biological invasions are two major components of global change that threaten biodiversity. There is high concern about their impact on pollinators and the pollination services they provide. However, the growing literature shows different, even contradictory results. 2. We present a global meta-analysis of 58 publications reporting 143 studies (37 on landscape alteration and 21 on biological invasions) to assess the extent to which these components affect pollinators, and whether taxonomic and ecosystem-type differences in pollinator responses occur. We also quantified which component of landscape alteration had the largest effect on pollinators and assessed whether animal invasions differ from plant invasions in their effect on native pollinators. 3. Habitat alteration and invasions affected pollinators to the same magnitude by decreasing visitation rates. Vertebrates in altered landscapes and insects (excluding bees) in invaded areas were the most affected pollinator taxa. 4. Pollinator abundance was more reduced in altered forest ecosystems than in altered grasslands; while the reverse pattern was found for pollinator richness. However, the response of pollinators to invasions was independent of ecosystem type. 5. Disturbance of the surrounding matrix was more important in decreasing pollinator visitation rates than fragment size. 6. Invasive animals seemed to have a more consistent negative effect on visitation rates than invasive plants. 7. Synthesis. Our study highlights that different components of global change have similar negative outcomes on pollination patterns, but that responses of pollinators vary among taxa and ecosystem types, as well as the attributes of landscape alteration considered and whether the invader is an animal or a plant.

AB Many vertebrates eavesdrop on alarm calls of other species, which is a remarkable ability, given geographical variation in community composition and call diversity within and among species. We used micro-geographical variation in community composition to test whether individuals recognize heterospecific alarm calls by: (i) responding to acoustic features shared among alarm calls; (ii) having innate responses to particular heterospecific calls; or (iii) learning specific alarm calls. We found that superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) fled to cover to playback of noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) aerial predator alarm calls only in locations where miners were present, suggesting that learning rather than acoustic structure determines response. Sites with and without miners were well within the dispersal distance of fairy-wrens, and philopatric males and dispersing females showed the same pattern, so that local genetic adaptation is extremely unlikely. Furthermore, where miners were present, fairy-wrens responded appropriately to different miner calls, implying eavesdropping on their signalling system rather than fleeing from miners themselves. Learned eavesdropping on alarm calls enables individuals to harvest ecologically relevant information from heterospecifics on an astonishingly fine spatial scale. Such phenotypic plasticity is valuable in a changing world, where individuals can be exposed to new species.

AB To elucidate the evolutionary history of the genus Capsella, we included the hitherto poorly known species C.similar to orientalis and C.similar to thracica into our studies together with C.similar to grandiflora, C.similar to rubella and C.similar to bursa-pastoris. We sequenced the ITS and four loci of noncoding cpDNA regions (trnL F, rps16, trnH psbA and trnQ rps16). Sequence data were evaluated with parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Divergence time estimates were carried out with the software package BEAST. We also performed isozyme, cytological, morphological and biogeographic studies. Capsella orientalis (self-compatible, SC; 2n = 16) forms a clade (eastern lineage) with C.similar to bursa-pastoris (SC; 2n = 32), which is a sister clade (western lineage) to C.similar to grandiflora (self-incompatible, SI; 2n = 16) and C.similar to rubella (SC; 2n = 16). Capsella bursa-pastoris is an autopolyploid species of multiple origin, whereas the Bulgarian endemic C.similar to thracica (SC; 2n = 32) is allopolyploid and emerged from interspecific hybridization between C.similar to bursa-pastoris and C.similar to grandiflora. The common ancestor of the two lineages was diploid and SI, and its distribution ranged from eastern Europe to central Asia, predominantly confined to steppe-like habitats. Biogeographic dynamics during the Pleistocene caused geographic and genetic subdivisions within the common ancestor giving rise to the two extant lineages.

AB Performance in one stage of a complex life cycle may affect performance in the subsequent stage. Animals that start a new stage at a smaller size than conspecifics may either always remain smaller or they may be able to "catch up'' through plasticity, usually elevated growth rates. We study how size at and date of metamorphosis affected subsequent performance in the terrestrial juvenile stage and lifetime fitness of spadefoot toads (Pelobates fuscus). We analyzed capture-recapture data of >3000 individuals sampled during nine years with mark-recapture models to estimate first-year juvenile survival probabilities and age-specific first-time breeding probabilities of toads, followed by model selection to assess whether these probabilities were correlated with size at and date of metamorphosis. Males attained maturity after two years, whereas females reached maturity 2-4 years after metamorphosis. Age at maturity was weakly correlated with metamorphic traits. In both sexes, first-year juvenile survival depended positively on date of metamorphosis and, in males, also negatively on size at metamorphosis. In males, toads that metamorphosed early at a small size had the highest probability to reach maturity. However, because very few toadlets metamorphosed early, the vast majority of male metamorphs had a very similar probability to reach maturity. A matrix projection model constructed for females showed that different juvenile life history pathways resulted in similar lifetime fitness. We found that the effects of date of and size at metamorphosis on different juvenile traits cancelled each other out such that toads that were small or large at metamorphosis had equal performance. Because the costs and benefits of juvenile life history pathways may also depend on population fluctuations, ample phenotypic variation in life history traits may be maintained.

AB Although sewage treatment plants (STPs) play a crucial role in maintaining the water quality and flow of Mediterranean rivers, particularly during drought periods, few studies have addressed their impact on aquatic fauna. Here we analyzed the role of STPs as a source of metals in the Ripoll River, a heavily urbanized and industrialized watercourse with a long history of anthropogenic disturbance. For this purpose, we measured iron, mercury, cadmium, zinc, lead, nickel and copper accumulation in the liver and muscle of the Mediterranean barbel, Barbus meridionalis and also the concentrations of these metals in the river water. Industrial and urban sewage treatment plants are source of metals in Ripoll River but the former mainly increases Zn and Ni values. Significant differences in metal bioaccumulation between reference and polluted sites were detected. Nevertheless, there was only a significant positive relationship between bioaccumulation of Cu and Hg, and their concentration in water. In addition, the lead concentration in fish was not clearly associated with the presence of STPs. On the basis of morphometric parameters, the hepato-somatic index was the only one denoting significant differences between polluted and references sites. Given that fish are key elements in food webs, recreational fishing is practice in this area and that river water is used for agricultural purposes, we recommend long-term studies to analyze the impact of metal pollution in this river.

AB Maintaining biodiversity in urbanised landscapes has become a conservation issue. Although numerous studies have shown that avifauna decreases according to urbanisation level, little is known about the influence of urban characteristics on avifauna in densely urbanised areas. This study took place in the centre of a highly urbanised area, Paris, France, where we defined a grid of 94 cells of 1 km(2) each. Using Bayesian model averaging, we examined the variation of diversity and abundance of breeding birds (41 species) through their feeding and nesting behaviours. We then analysed the responses of these guilds to composition (proportion of different types of buildings and green spaces) and configuration (heterogeneity, spatial arrangement of green spaces). The abundance of omnivorous and tree nester species was influenced by urban characteristics such as building heterogeneity. The positive influence of shrub cover on insectivorous species abundance was greater in areas with a high density of medium-height buildings. Omnivorous species abundance increased with the juxtaposition of vegetation when the bare soil cover was low, and decreased otherwise. Globally, the abundance of omnivorous, ground and tree nester species was sensitive to building characteristics, whereas insectivorous and granivorous species as well as roof nesters may benefit from green space management. We concluded that urban planning can also promote avifauna abundance in the city centre by varying the heights of buildings in urban renewal projects rather than clustering buildings of similar height, or by focusing on the spatial configuration of green spaces (especially their proximity) rather than their area.

AB Migrating birds are believed to minimize the time spent on migration rather than energy. Birds seem to maximize migration speed in different ways as a noteworthy variation in migration strategies exists. We studied migration strategies of a flight mode and feeding generalist, the Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus, using GPS-based satellite telemetry. We expected the gulls to achieve very high overall migration speeds by traveling via the shortest direct route, traveling during a large part of the day and night, and making few and short stopovers. Fourteen individuals were tracked between the Dutch breeding colony and the wintering sites in England, southern Europe and northwest Africa. The gulls did not travel via the shortest possible route but made substantial detours by their tendency to follow coasts. Although the gulls traveled during most of the day, and sometimes during the night, they did not achieve long daily distances (177 and 176 km/day in autumn and spring, respectively), which is explained by the gulls stopping frequently on travel days to forage. Furthermore, due to frequent and long migratory stopovers, their overall migration speed was among the lowest recorded for migratory birds (44 and 98 km/day, in autumn and spring, respectively). A possible explanation for the unexpected frequent stopovers and low migration speeds is that gulls do not minimize the duration of migration but rather minimize the costs of migration. Energy rather than time might be important for short-distance migrating birds, resulting in very different migration strategies compared with long-distance migrants.

AB Remaining patches of semi-natural grasslands are hot spots for biodiversity in modern agricultural landscapes. In Sweden semi-natural pastures cover approximately 500,000 ha. However, power-line corridors, road verges and clear-cuts cover larger areas (in total about 2,000,000 ha), and these open, less intensively managed habitats are potentially important for species associated with taller vegetation and flower resources (e.g. pollinating insects). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative importance of semi-natural pastures and the other three open habitats for butterflies in 12 forest-farmland mosaic landscapes in south central Sweden. Species composition differed significantly between habitats in multivariate analyses. Power-line corridors and semi-natural pastures harbored several species that were disproportionally abundant in these habitats (13 and 8 species, respectively), and power-line corridors also harbored several species that were classified as typical in indicator species analyses. There were more butterfly species, higher abundances and a tendency for more individuals of red-listed species in power-line corridors than in the other three habitats. Effects of the surrounding landscape composition seemed to be weaker than that of the local habitat. However, species composition was significantly associated with landscape composition and species with intermediate and low mobility were more abundant in forested landscapes than in landscapes dominated by arable fields. Analyses of flying time and host plants for larvae suggest that early flying species and species associated with dwarf shrubs were more common in power-line corridors than in the other habitats. A landscape perspective, which takes several habitats into account, is needed for conservation of butterfly communities in forest-farmland landscapes. Power-line corridors and road verges offer possibilities for creating habitats that are suitable for pollinating insects through conservation-oriented management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Population subdivision and migration are generally considered to be important causes of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We explore the combined effects of recombination and gene flow on the amount of LD, the maintenance of polymorphism, and the degree of local adaptation in a subdivided population by analyzing a diploid, deterministic continent-island model with genic selection on two linked loci (i.e., no dominance or epistasis). For this simple model, we characterize explicitly all possible equilibrium configurations. Simple and intuitive approximations for many quantities of interest are obtained in limiting cases, such as weak migration, weak selection, weak or strong recombination. For instance, we derive explicit expressions for the measures D (= p(AB) - p(A)p(B)) and r(2) (the squared correlation in allelic state) of LD. They depend in qualitatively different ways on the migration rate. Remarkably high values of r(2) are maintained between weakly linked loci, especially if gene flow is low. We determine how the maximum amount of gene flow that admits preservation of the locally adapted haplotype, hence of polymorphism at both loci, depends on recombination rate and selection coefficients. We also investigate the evolution of differentiation by examining the invasion of beneficial mutants of small effect that are linked to an already present, locally adapted allele. Mutants of much smaller effect can invade successfully than predicted by naive single-locus theory provided they are at least weakly linked. Finally, the influence of linkage on the degree of local adaptation, the migration load, and the effective migration rate at a neutral locus is explored. We discuss possible consequences for the evolution of genetic architecture, in particular, for the emergence of clusters of tightly linked, slightly beneficial mutations and the evolution of recombination and chromosome inversions.

AB 1. Recent studies have documented shifts in habitat associations of single tropical tree species from one life stage to the next. However, the community-level consequences of such shifts have not been investigated, and it is not clear whether they would amplify, neutralize or completely alter habitat structuring during the transitions to the adult community.
   2. We compared habitat-driven species assemblages at three life stages (i.e. recruitment, juvenile and reproductive stages) and six censuses for tree and shrub species in a fully censused 50-ha plot of Panamanian lowland forest. Habitat types were determined using multivariate regression trees that group areas with similar species composition (i.e. species assemblages) according to their topographical characteristics.
   3. Three topographical variables (a topographical wetness index, slope and elevation) were major determinants of species assemblages. When analysing individuals of all life stages together, we found a distinct and temporally consistent structuring of the plot into four dominant habitat types (low and high plateaus, slope and swamp) which was consistent with previous classifications. Basically, the same habitat structuring emerged for the juvenile communities of individual censuses. However, recruits showed a weak and temporally inconsistent habitat structuring.
   4. A notable homogenization in species assemblages occurred during the transition from juvenile to reproductive, through both a reduction in the number of species assemblages (in 3 censuses, one large reproductive assemblage covered 93% of the plot, and in others, an additional slope habitat emerged) and a reduction in the classification error. Overall, habitat structuring became noisier and weaker over the 25 years of the study.
   5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that mortality processes during the transition from recruits to juveniles must enhance the signal of habitat structuring. However, during the transition to the reproductive stage, species may have lost the advantage of being in the habitat with which they had become associated, or the quality of habitat changed during their life span because of larger climatic changes. The homogeneous assemblages of the reproductive stage could be interpreted as support for neutral theories, but further research is required to unravel the mechanisms behind these intriguing observations.

AB Foraging innovation occurs when animals exploit novel food sources or invent new foraging techniques. Species vary widely in their rates of innovation, and these differences can be quantified using counts of novel behavior observed in the wild. One of the assumed benefits of innovativeness is that it allows species to exploit a wider variety of habitats and foods, enhancing survival when resources are in shortage or when individuals invade new environments. However, the relationship between innovation propensity and ecological generalism lacks firm empirical support. Moreover, innovativeness does not only imply benefits but may also lead to higher risks incurred in the wide array of habitats exploited. In this study, we test whether innovative species exploit a wider variety of habitats and food types as well as face the potential risk of more predators as a consequence of their ecological generalism. Using data for 193 North American bird species in a phylogenetically informed analysis, we find a significant positive relationship between innovation rate and habitat generalism, but not diet breadth. Although habitat generalism is also associated with exposure to a wider variety of predators, there is no direct relationship between innovation rate and predation. Our results suggest that although innovators use a wider variety of habitats, they are not necessarily diet generalists, challenging the classic view that feeding generalism is equivalent to feeding flexibility.

AB Increasingly government agencies are seeking to quantify the outcomes of proposed policy options in terms of ecosystem service benefits, yet conflicting definitions and ad hoc approaches to measuring ecosystem services have created confusion regarding how to rigorously link ecological change to changes in human well-being. Here, we describe a step-by-step framework for producing ecological models and metrics that can effectively serve an economic-benefits assessment of a proposed change in policy or management. A focus of the framework is developing comparable units of ecosystem goods and services to support decision-making, even if outcomes cannot be monetized. Because the challenges to translating ecological changes to outcomes appropriate for economic analyses are many, we discuss examples that demonstrate practical methods and approaches to overcoming data limitations. The numerous difficult decisions that government agencies must make to fairly use and allocate natural resources provides ample opportunity for interdisciplinary teams of natural and social scientists to improve methods for quantifying changes in ecosystem services and their effects on human well-being. This framework is offered with the intent of promoting the success of such teams as they support managers in evaluating the equivalency of ecosystem service offsets and trades, establishing restoration and preservation priorities, and more generally, in developing environmental policy that effectively balances multiple perspectives.

AB The Gollum Channels and Whittard Canyon (NE Atlantic) are two areas that receive high input of organic matter and phytodetritus from euphotic layers, but they are typified by different trophic and hydrodynamic conditions. Sediment biogeochemistry was analysed in conjunction with structure and diversity of the nematode community and differences were tested between study areas, water depths (700 m vs 1000 m), stations, and sediment layers. The Gollum Channels and Whittard Canyon harboured high meiofauna abundances (1054-1426 ind. 10 cm(-2)) and high nematode diversity (total of 181 genera). Next to enhanced meiofauna abundance and nematode biomass, there were signs of high levels of organic matter deposition leading to reduced sedimentary conditions, which in turn structured the nematode community. Striking in this respect was the presence of large numbers of 'chemosynthetic' Astomonema nematodes (Astomonema southwardorum, Order Monhysterida, Family Siphonolaimidae). This genus lacks a mouth, buccal cavity and pharynx and possesses a rudimentary gut containing internal, symbiotic prokaryotes which have been recognised as sulphur-oxidising bacteria. Dominance of Astomonema may indicate the presence of reduced environments in the study areas, which is partially confirmed by the local biogeochemical environment. The nematode communities were mostly affected by sediment layer differences and concomitant trophic conditions rather than other spatial gradients related to study area, water depth or station differences, pointing to small-scale heterogeneity as the main source of variation in nematode structure and function. Furthermore, the positive relation between nematode standing stocks, and quantity and quality of the organic matter was stronger when hydrodynamic disturbance was greater. Analogically, this study also suggests that structural diversity can be positively correlated with trophic conditions and that this relation is tighter when hydrodynamic disturbance is greater.

AB It is widely accepted that species diversity is contingent upon the spatial scale used to analyze patterns and processes. Recent studies using coarse sampling grains over large extents have contributed much to our understanding of factors driving global diversity patterns. This advance is largely unmatched on the level of local to landscape scales despite being critical for our understanding of functional relationships across spatial scales. In our study on West African bat assemblages we employed a spatially explicit and nested design covering local to regional scales. Specifically, we analyzed diversity patterns in two contrasting, largely undisturbed landscapes, comprising a rainforest area and a forest-savanna mosaic in Ivory Coast, West Africa. We employed additive partitioning, rarefaction, and species richness estimation to show that bat diversity increased significantly with habitat heterogeneity on the landscape scale through the effects of beta diversity. Within the extent of our study areas, habitat type rather than geographic distance explained assemblage composition across spatial scales. Null models showed structure of functional groups to be partly filtered on local scales through the effects of vegetation density while on the landscape scale both assemblages represented random draws from regional species pools. We present a mixture model that combines the effects of habitat heterogeneity and complexity on species richness along a biome transect, predicting a unimodal rather than a monotonic relationship with environmental variables related to water. The bat assemblages of our study by far exceed previous figures of species richness in Africa, and refute the notion of low species richness of Afrotropical bat assemblages, which appears to be based largely on sampling biases. Biome transitions should receive increased attention in conservation strategies aiming at the maintenance of ecological and evolutionary processes.

AB The worldwide loss of natural habitats leads not only to the loss of habitat-endemic species but also to further and protracted extinctions in the reduced areas that remain. How rapid is this process? We use the neutral theory of biodiversity to answer this question, and we compare the results taken with observed rates of avifaunal extinctions. In the neutral model, we derive an exact solution for the rate of species loss in a closed community. The simple, closed-form solution exhibits hyperbolic decay of species richness with time, which implies a potentially rapid initial decline followed by much slower rates long term. Our empirical estimates of extinction times are based on published studies for avifaunal extinctions either on oceanic islands or in forest fragments, which span a total of six orders of magnitude in area. These estimates show that the time to extinction strongly depends on the area. The neutral-theory predictions agree well with observed rates over three orders of magnitude of area (between 100 and 100,000 ha) both for islands and forest fragments. Regarding the species abundance distribution, extinction times based on a broken-stick model led to better agreement with observation than if a log-series model was used. The predictions breakdown for very small or very large areas. Thus, neutrality may be an affordable assumption for some applications in ecology and conservation, particularly for areas of intermediate size.

AB Bushmeat hunting is one of the primary threats to many large-bodied vertebrate species in African forests. However, species vary in their degree of vulnerability to hunting. We investigated the impact of hunting on monkey species in Cameroon's Korup National Park (KNP) and examined how vulnerability to hunting varies among species. Data on primate abundance and hunting intensity were collected along 10 line transects, distributed across three survey areas in KNP. We assessed how the relative abundance of seven monkey species spatially varied between heavily and lightly hunted areas and evaluated temporal changes in the relative abundance and proportional representation of these species at a single hunted forest site and in bushmeat harvests. The putty-nosed and mona monkeys are most tolerant to heavy hunting pressure whereas the crowned monkey, drill, and red colobus are among the most vulnerable. At our heavily hunted survey site, the overall relative density of monkey groups increased through time but primate species richness declined. The proportional representation of Cercopithecus species, especially putty-nosed monkeys, increased through time, possibly due to competitive release. We also observed an increase in the proportional representation of the putty-nosed and mona monkeys and a reduced percent contribution of the red colobus and drill in hunter harvests. We conclude that hunting is driving some of Africa's most threatened primate species (e.g.. Preuss's red colobus and the drill) to local extinction in KNP. We discuss intrinsic factors of species that might influence their degree of vulnerability and strategies to improve protection efforts in KNP. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since 1970, measurement of the soil microbial biomass (SMB) has been widely adopted as a relatively simple means of assessing the impact of environmental and anthropogenic change on soil microorganisms. The SMB is living and dynamic, and its activity is responsible for the regulation of organic matter transformations and associated energy and nutrient cycling in soil. At a gross level, an increase in SMB is considered beneficial, while a decline in SMB may be considered detrimental if this leads to a decline in biological function. However, absolute SMB values are more difficult to interpret. Target or reference values of SMB are needed for soil quality assessments and to allow ameliorative action to be taken at an appropriate time. However, critical values have not yet been successfully identified for SMB. This paper provides a conceptual framework which outlines how SMB values could be interpreted and measured, with examples provided within an Australian context.

AB Fire is common in savannas but its effects on soil are poorly understood. We analyzed long-term effects of fire on surface soil of an open Brazilian savanna (campo sujo) in plots submitted to different fire regimes during 18 years. The five fire regimes were: unburned, quadrennial fires in middle dry season, and biennial fires in early, middle or late dry season. Soil was collected during the wet and the middle dry season of 2008, and analyzed for pH, organic matter, total N, potential acidity, exchangeable cations and available P, S, Mn, Cu, Zn and Fe. We applied multivariate analysis to search for patterns related to fire regimes, and to local climate, fuel, and fire behavior. Spearman test was used to establish correlations between soil variables and the multivariate analysis gradient structure. Seasonal differences were tested using t-test. We found evidence of long-term fire effects: the unburned plot was segregated mainly by lower soil pH; the quadrennial plot was also segregated by lower soil pH and higher amount of exchangeable cations; the time of burning during the dry season in biennial plots did not significantly affect soil availability of nutrients. Differences in elements amounts due to the season of soil sampling (wet or dry) were higher than due to the effect of fires. Higher availability of nutrients in the soil during the wet season was probably related to higher nutrient inputs via rainfall and higher microbial activity.

AB Questions
   How can one explicitly quantify, and separately measure, stress and disturbance gradients? How do these gradients affect functional composition in early successional plant communities and to what extent? Can we accurately predict trait composition from knowledge of these gradients?
   Location
   Southern Quebec, Canada.
   Methods
   Using eight environmental variables measured in 48 early successional plant communities, we estimated stress and disturbance gradients through structural equation modelling. We then measured 10 functional traits on the most abundant species of these 48 communities and calculated their community-level mean and variance weighted by the relative abundance of each species. Finally, we related these community-weighted means and variances to the estimated stress and disturbance gradients using general linear models or generalized additive models.
   Results
   We obtained a well-fitting measurement model of the stress and disturbance gradients existing in our sites. Of the 10 studied traits, only average plant reproductive height was strongly correlated with the stress (r2=0.464) and disturbance (r2=0.543) gradients. Leaf traits were not significantly related to either the stress or disturbance gradients.
   Conclusions
   The well-fitting measurement model of the stress and disturbance gradients, combined with the generally weak trait-environment linkages, suggests that community assembly in these early successional plant communities is driven primarily by stochastic processes linked to the history of arrival of propagules and not to trait-based environmental filtering.

AB Dietary information of apex predators is crucial to understanding community dynamics and ecosystem processes. However, as dietary studies traditionally involve lethal sampling, obtaining this essential information can have repercussions on predator populations and the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. With stronger emphasis being placed on conservation of species that are vulnerable to overexploitation, the need for non-destructive methods of sampling is imperative, as is the requirement to maximize the information obtained from each sample. Stomach flushing (gastric lavage) and DNA analysis of stomach contents methods were tested on the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus Peron 1807. Acoustic tracking and recaptures of sharks implied high survivorship post-fishing and stomach flushing. From 85 prey items collected, 36 (43%) could be identified to species level using morphological analysis. After DNA analysis, a further 35 items were identified to species level, doubling the information obtained from these stomachs. The number of N. cepedianus that were confirmed to have eaten gummy sharks Mustelus antarcticus Gunther 1870 also doubled after DNA analysis. Without DNA analysis (of stomach contents) the importance of M. antarcticus in the diets of N. cepedianus would have been substantially underestimated. In addition, the non-lethal approach provides an opportunity to obtain meaningful information from non-harvested, endangered or rare species or sampling of species within protected areas.

Here, we examine the role of sperm quantity and quality for fertilization success of individual males in a Canadian population of tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, a socially monogamous, but highly promiscuous passerine. Male fertilization success (the sum of withinpair and extrapair young) was significantly associated with the size of the cloacal protuberance (a proxy for sperm quantity), but not with sperm size or in vitro sperm swimming speed. In a multivariate analysis, both cloacal protuberance volume and relative sperm midpiece size (i.e. high mitochondrial loading) had significant effects on male fertilization success. However, relative sperm midpiece size was not associated with fertilization success in a simple regression. Further, both cloacal protuberance volume and relative midpiece size had significant effects on sperm velocity, both in simple regressions and in a multivariate analysis. The finding that males with large relative midpiece size had both higher fertilization success and faster swimming sperm, suggests an indirect link between sperm morphology and male fertility mediated through sperm velocity. In conclusion, both quantitative and qualitative sperm traits seem to affect male fertilization success in tree swallows.

AB From December 2005 to November 2006, 216 samples were taken from the main channel of the Goiana Estuary, representing a total sampled area of 23 ha. Ariidae species were the most abundant in density (1600 individuals ha(-1), 53%) and biomass (18 813 g ha(-1), 63%). Cathorops spixii was the most abundant in density (1340 individuals ha(-1)) and biomass (14 203 g ha(-1)). The variables: number of species, total density and biomass, showed significant interactions between the factors of areas and seasons (P < 0.01). The highest total density (7394 individuals ha(-1)) and biomass (70 292 g ha(-1)) occurred in the middle and upper estuaries, respectively, during the early-rainy season. The density of C. spixii differed significantly between areas and seasons (P < 0.01), while Cathorops agassizii differed significantly only between seasons (P < 0.01). The biomass differed significantly for the species C. spixii, C. agassizii and Sciades herzbergii between seasons, and C. spixii and C. agassizii between areas. Also, the density and biomass of C. spixii and C. agassizii showed interaction between areas and seasons. Only the biomass of S. herzbergii showed interaction between areas and seasons (P < 0.01). This indicates that seasonal variations influenced the distribution of Ariidae species in the different areas of the Goiana Estuary. Moreover, canonical correspondence analysis highlighted a strongly significant correlation (P < 0.01) between the seasonal variations of the environmental gradients (salinity and water temperature) and distribution of catfishes. The management and conservation of estuaries should take into account the life cycle of these species in different estuarine areas and hydrological seasons.

AB Biodiversity monitoring is critical to assess the effectiveness of management activities and policy change, particularly in the light of accelerating impacts of environmental change, and for compiling national responses to international obligations and agreements. Monitoring methods able to identify species most likely to be affected by environmental change, and pinpoint those changes with the strongest impacts, will enable managers to target efforts towards vulnerable species and significant threats. Here we take a new approach to carnivore monitoring, combining camera-trap surveys with ecological niche factor analysis to assess distribution and patterns of habitat use of mammalian carnivore assemblages across northern Tanzania. We conducted 11 surveys over 430 camera-trap stations and 11 355 trap-days. We recorded 23 out of 35 carnivore species known to occur in Tanzania and report major extensions to the known distribution of the bushy-tailed mongoose Bdeogale crassicauda, previously thought to be rare. Carnivore biodiversity tended to be higher in national parks than in game reserves and forest reserves. We explored habitat use for seven species for which we had sufficient information. All species tended to be found near rivers and southern Acacia commiphora woodlands (except one mongoose species), and avoided deciduous shrubland, favouring deciduous woodland and/or open grassland. All species tended to avoid croplands suggesting that habitat conversion to agriculture could have serious implications for carnivore distribution. Our study provides a first example where camera-trap data are combined with niche analyses to reveal patterns in habitat use and spatial distribution of otherwise elusive and poorly known species and to inform reserve design and land-use planning. Our methodology represents a potentially powerful tool that can inform national and site-based wildlife managers and policy makers as well as international agreements on conservation.

AB Male pregnancy in seahorses, pipefishes and sea dragons ( family Syngnathidae) represents a striking reproductive adaptation that has shaped the evolution of behaviour and morphology in this group of fishes(1-4). In many syngnathid species, males brood their offspring in a specialized pouch, which presumably evolved to facilitate male parental care(5,6). However, an unexplored possibility is that brood pouch evolution was partly shaped by parent-offspring or sexual conflict, processes that would result in trade-offs between current and future pregnancies. Here we report a controlled breeding experiment using the sexually dimorphic Gulf pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli, to test for post-copulatory sexual selection within broods and for trade-offs between successive male pregnancies as functions of female attractiveness. Offspring survivorship within a pregnancy was affected by the size of a male's mate, the number of eggs transferred and the male's sexual responsiveness. Significantly, we also found that embryo survivorship in a current pregnancy was negatively related to survivorship in the prior pregnancy, clearly demonstrating fitness trade-offs between broods. Overall, our data indicate that post-copulatory sexual selection and sexual conflict occur in Gulf pipefishes. The conflict seems to be mediated by a strategy of cryptic choice in which males increase rates of offspring abortion in pregnancies from unattractive mothers to retain resources for future reproductive opportunities. Hence, the male brood pouch of syngnathid fishes, which nurtures offspring(7-9), also seems to have an important role as an arbiter of conflict between the sexes.

AB Pollination interaction networks exhibit structural regularities across a wide range of natural environments. Long-tailed degree distribution, nestedness, and modularity are the most prevalent topological patterns found in most bipartite networks analyzed up to day. In this work we evaluate the variation of these topological properties along an altitudinal gradient. To this end, we examined four plant-pollinator networks from the Chilean Andes at 33 degrees S, in range from 1800 to 3600 m elevation. Our results indicate that network topology is strongly and systematically affected by elevation. At increasing altitude, the number of potential visitors per plant decreased, and species degree distributions are closer to random expectations. On the other hand, the nested structure of mutualistic interactions systematically decreased with elevation, and network modularity was significantly higher than random expectations over the entire altitudinal range. In addition, at increasing elevations the pollination networks were organized in fewer and more strongly connected modules. Our results suggest that the severe abiotic conditions found at increased elevations translate into less organized pollination networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In ectotherms, variation in life history traits among populations is common and suggests local adaptation. However, geographic variation itself is not a proof for local adaptation, as genetic drift and gene flow may also shape patterns of quantitative variation. We studied local and regional variation in means and phenotypic plasticity of larval life history traits in the common frog Rana temporaria using six populations from central Sweden, breeding in either open-canopy or partially closed-canopy ponds. To separate local adaptation from genetic drift, we compared differentiation in quantitative genetic traits (Q(ST)) obtained from a common garden experiment with differentiation in presumably neutral microsatellite markers (F-ST). We found that R. temporaria populations differ in means and plasticities of life history traits in different temperatures at local, and in F-ST at regional scale. Comparisons of differentiation in quantitative traits and in molecular markers suggested that natural selection was responsible for the divergence in growth and development rates as well as in temperature-induced plasticity, indicating local adaptation. However, at low temperature, the role of genetic drift could not be separated from selection. Phenotypes were correlated with forest canopy closure, but not with geographical or genetic distance. These results indicate that local adaptation can evolve in the presence of ongoing gene flow among the populations, and that natural selection is strong in this system.

AB The acceptance of the generalized or unified concept of species (i.e. that species are segments of population lineages) implies that an important task for systematists is to focus on identifying lineages and on testing hypotheses about the acquisition of properties such as phenotypic diagnosability, reciprocal monophyly, or mechanisms of reproductive isolation. However, delimiting species objectively remains one of the most challenging problems faced by biologists. In the present study, we begin to tackle the thorny issue of species delimitation in a complicated group of Neotropical passerine birds (the Arremon torquatus complex, Emberizidae) in which sets of characters vary substantially across space, but do not obviously vary in a concerted fashion. To earlier discussions of species limits in the group, we add a historical perspective offered by a recent molecular phylogeny, present quantitative analyses of morphological and vocal variation, and incorporate ecological niche models as a new tool that aids species delimitation by highlighting cases of ecological distinctiveness and cases where populations appear to be in independent evolutionary trajectories, despite being connected by environments unlikely to represent barriers to gene flow. We demonstrate that at least one pair of taxa (and likely another) currently treated as conspecific are, in fact, distinct lineages that merit species status under essentially any species criterion. However, other pairwise comparisons are not as straightforward owing to nonconcordant patterns of variation in different traits and to the impossibility of distinguishing which characters are causes and which are consequences of reproductive (and evolutionary) isolation. After considering several alternatives, we propose a provisional classification of the complex recognizing eight tentative species-level taxa. Although this classification is likely to change as more detailed work is conducted, it provides a better foundation for studying the biology of these birds and helps to better describe their diversity, which is obscured when all taxa are subsumed into a single species name. The present study highlights several outstanding challenges, both practical and conceptual, for future studies.

AB Riparian zones are important for the many ecosystem services they supply. In settled areas, the vegetation of such zones is shaped by human land-use; this often creates conditions under which alien plant species thrive. Alien plants have been shown to induce large-scale changes in riparian habitats, and they pose a major threat to the continued provision of key ecosystem services. We used direct gradient analysis to assess correlations between land-use and the composition of vegetation along a riparian river corridor in the highly transformed landscape surrounding Stellenbosch in South Africa's Western Cape Province. Vegetation plots were sampled along the entire length of the river from headwaters to estuary (ca. 40 km). Plant community composition was analyzed in relation to land-use data collected in the field, and additional land-use variables computed from digital land-cover data. Patterns of plant community structure were found to be directly related to land-use, with measures of cover, richness, and diversity differing significantly among land-use types. Portions of the riparian zone adjacent to agricultural land had the greatest level of alien plant cover, while areas bordered by urban land maintained the highest alien species richness. Areas adjacent to grazing and natural lands showed intermediate and low levels of invasion, respectively. Several native species were found to persist in areas with high abundance and diversity of invasive alien plants, suggesting that they will be valuable focal species for future restoration attempts. Due to the level of human-mediated change in many areas of the riparian zone, restoration to historic conditions over most of the river is not considered feasible. These areas should be recognized as examples of novel ecosystems, and management efforts should focus on restoring or creating desirable ecosystem functions, rather than on achieving assemblages comprising only native species.

AB The eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) is among the most invasive fish worldwide and yet, while very abundant in most Mediterranean countries, it is unable to tolerate the colder winters of northern and central Europe. Understanding the effects of latitude on its life-history traits is essential to predict the potential for its invasion of central Europe in current scenarios of climate change. We studied the variation of life-history traits and parasite load in the eastern mosquitofish along a latitudinal gradient from southern France to southern Spain, sampling mosquitofish populations in eight Mediterranean river mouths ranging 5A degrees in latitude. Southern mosquitofish populations displayed higher catch rates, allocated more energy to reproduction (gonadosomatic index and gonadal weight after accounting for fish size) and had a lower condition (total weight and eviscerated weight after accounting for fish size) than in northern populations. Despite variability among populations, size-at-maturity (L-50) significantly varied with latitude and northern individuals matured at smaller size (lower L-50). Parasite prevalence ranged from 0.0 to 26.7% but parasite richness was very low; all the parasites identified were larvae of pleurocercoid cestodes belonging to the order Pseudophyllidea. The abundance of mosquitofish parasites decreased with latitude and the presence and number of parasites infecting the mosquitofish had a significant negative effect on fish condition. The significant effects of latitude on the catch rates, life history and parasites of mosquitofish highlight the importance of latitudinal studies of invasive species to understand the interactive mechanisms of climate change and biological invasions.

AB In the classic spatially implicit formulation of Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity a local community receives immigrants from a metacommunity operating on a relatively slow timescale, and dispersal into the local community is governed by an immigration parameter m. A current problem with neutral theory is that m lacks a clear biological interpretation. Here, we derive analytical expressions that relate the immigration parameter m to the geometry of the plot defining the local community and the parameters of a dispersal kernel. Our results facilitate more rigorous and extensive tests of the neutral theory: we conduct a test of neutral theory by comparing estimates of m derived from fits to empirical species abundance distributions to those derived from dispersal kernels and find acceptable correspondence; and we generate a new prediction of neutral theory by investigating how the shapes of species abundance distributions change theoretically as the spatial scale of observation changes. We also discuss how our main analytical results can be used to assess the error in the mean-field approximations associated with spatially implicit formulations of neutral theory.

AB P>Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs), comprising organisms < 3 mu m in size, are important primary producers in marine food webs and include representatives from all known algal lineages. Little is known, however, regarding the composition and distribution of PPE communities, particularly at large spatial scales, or in relation to the underlying biotic and abiotic factors that influence this structure. Here, we analysed PPE community structure along a transect in the South East Pacific Ocean (BIOSOPE cruise) that encompassed a large trophic gradient, including hyper-oligotrophic waters in the South Pacific Gyre (SPG), considered to be some of the 'clearest' natural waters on Earth. Using dot blot hybridizations with 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probes, we established that the PPE community was dominated by members of the classes Prymnesiophyceae and Chrysophyceae throughout the transect. Moreover, clone library construction followed by phylogenetic analysis of sequenced clones revealed several novel 16S rRNA gene lineages, including new clades of prymnesiophytes (designated Prym 16S-III) and prasinophytes (Pras 16S-VIII). Pras 16S-VIII was found at all five stations at which clone libraries were constructed, representing a range of trophic conditions, including the South Pacific Gyre, suggesting members of this clade have a broad distribution in this part of the South East Pacific at least. In contrast, Prym 16S-III sequences were largely restricted to oligotrophic stations of the SPG. Subsequent multivariate statistical analyses showed that, within the measured factors, chemical and biological factors seem to influence PPE community structure more than physical parameters. However, more than 50% of the variation in distribution of PPE classes remained unexplained.

AB P>1. Interspecific competition is a recognized but under-studied mechanism by which invasive species affect native fauna.
   2. We experimentally reduced populations of the introduced black rat Rattus rattus in relatively undisturbed littoral rainforest in south-eastern Australia to test its competitive impact on populations of the native bush rat Rattus fuscipes.
   3. Removal of R. rattus resulted in significant and sustained increases in populations of the native rodent due to immigration, juvenile recruitment and increases in residency of females. Native juveniles were particularly vulnerable to R. rattus, being largely absent from untreated populations despite indications of breeding in females, but responding rapidly to their removal.
   4. The absence of changes in body condition and reproduction of adult R. fuscipes with long-term removal of R. rattus suggests that direct interference by R. rattus rather than competition for resources best explains the low densities and poor juvenile recruitment of R. fuscipes.
   5. The behavioural dominance of R. rattus was not due to an inherent competitive ability because they did not re-establish post-removal as expected if competition was asymmetrical. Instead, competitive dominance seemingly shifted to R. fuscipes with changes in residency status of populations. Improved survivorship among native females reveals that they were particularly important in establishing resident populations following removal of R. rattus.
   6.Synthesis and applications. These findings identify R. rattus as a significant competitive threat to native R. fuscipes. Removal of invasive rodents and active conservation of common native species is recommended to forest managers based on the potential for R. fuscipes to prevent re-invasion subsequent to pest control efforts and maintain invasion resistance.

AB Question
   How to map continuous fields of forest alpha and beta diversity in remote areas, based on easily accessible spatial data.
   Location
   Kyrgyzstan/Central Asia.
   Methods
   The study relied on a combination of predictive mapping and remote sensing. Punctual measurements of alpha diversity were linked to topography and reflectance using regression models. For beta diversity, ordination techniques were employed to extract major vegetation gradients. Scores on the ordination axes were regressed against topography as well as reflectance and subsequently mapped. Beta diversity was mapped as spatial turnover rate along these axes.
   Results
   The diversity maps quantified species counts and turnover in a spatially contiguous manner while taking into account fuzzy transitions. The variance explained by regression models ranged from 51% to 61% in cross-validation. Many of the observed differences were caused by differences in species shares. The occurrence of walnut, in particular, showed a negative relation to woody species numbers.
   Conclusion
   Mapping biodiversity in remote areas can be based on easily accessible spatial data in combination with a set of calibration field samples. With regard to human influence on walnut dominance, a total removal of human land use would be counterproductive in terms of diversity conservation. The results of this study highlight the need for comprehensive analyses of diversity patterns that include spatially contiguous quantifications of species numbers, shares and turnover rates.

AB P>We demonstrate here results showing that bottom-up and top-down control mechanisms can operate simultaneously and in concert in marine microbial food webs, controlling prokaryote diversity by a combination of viral lysis and substrate limitation. Models in microbial ecology predict that a shift in the type of bacterial growth rate limitation is expected to have a major effect on species composition within the community of bacterial hosts, with a subsequent shift in the composition of the viral community. Only moderate effects would, however, be expected in the absolute number of coexisting virus-host pairs. We investigated these relationships in nutrient-manipulated systems, under simulated in situ conditions. There was a strong correlation in the clustering of the viral and bacterial community data supporting the existence of an important link between the bacterial and viral communities. As predicted, the total number of viral populations was the same in all treatments, while the composition of the viral community varied. Our results support the theoretical prediction that there is one control mechanism for the number of niches for coexisting virus-host pairs (top-down control), and another mechanism that controls which virus-host pairs occupy these niches (bottom-up control).

ID COMMONNESS; PATTERNS
AB We present an individual-based predator-prey model with, for the first time, each agent behavior being modeled by a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), allowing the evolution of the agent behavior through the epochs of the simulation. The FCM enables the agent to evaluate its environment (e. g., distance to predator or prey, distance to potential breeding partner, distance to food, energy level) and its internal states (e. g., fear, hunger, curiosity), and to choose several possible actions such as evasion, eating, or breeding. The FCM of each individual is unique and is the result of the evolutionary process. The notion of species is also implemented in such a way that species emerge from the evolving population of agents. To our knowledge, our system is the only one that allows the modeling of links between behavior patterns and speciation. The simulation produces a lot of data, including number of individuals, level of energy by individual, choice of action, age of the individuals, and average FCM associated with each species. This study investigates patterns of macroevolutionary processes, such as the emergence of species in a simulated ecosystem, and proposes a general framework for the study of specific ecological problems such as invasive species and species diversity patterns. We present promising results showing coherent behaviors of the whole simulation with the emergence of strong correlation patterns also observed in existing ecosystems.

AB The outcome of fights between males can often represent an honest signal of male quality and are therefore widely used by females in mate choice. Indeed, female preference for males that win fights has been demonstrated in numerous animal taxa, and many recent studies have focused attention on how subordinate males compensate for this disadvantage through postcopulatory mating strategies, such as increased investment in their ejaculates. Here, using the Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, we show that rather than investing more in postcopulatory strategies, subordinate males invest in an alternative precopulatory mating approach. We find that subordinate males produce ejaculates of lower quality than dominate males and sire less offspring when competing for fertilizations. However, subordinate males upregulate the quantity of a number of cuticular compounds that have previously been shown to increase male mating success. Our results suggest that male reproductive success is likely to result from the interaction of multiple traits in this species.

AB Landscape genetics is an important framework for investigating the influence of spatial pattern on ecological process. Nevertheless, the standard analytic frameworks in landscape genetics have difficulty evaluating hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. We use a predictive hypothesis-driven approach to quantify the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. By confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes, we identify dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. We demonstrate the approach using a case study of microsatellite polymorphism and indirect estimates of gene flow for a rainforest bird, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in the reconstructed historic landscape and contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from nonindependent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternative hypotheses. The contemporary landscape explained slightly more information in the genetic differentiation data than the historic landscape, and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. In contrast, migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. We discovered that landscape heterogeneity facilitated gene flow before European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal.

AB To explore the potential impacts of climatic change on species with different migratory strategies using Sylvia warblers breeding in Europe as a 'model' species group.
   Europe and Africa.
   Climate response surfaces and generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to model relationships between species recorded breeding and non-breeding ranges and recent climate. Species potential future breeding and non-breeding ranges were simulated for three scenarios of late 21st-century climate. The simulated potential future and present ranges were compared in terms of their relative extent and overlap, as well as their location. The impact of any shifts in potential range location on migration distance were quantified.
   Potential breeding ranges consistently showed a shift northwards, whereas potential non-breeding ranges showed no consistent directional shift, even when trans-Saharan migrants were considered separately from resident/short-distance or partial migrants. Future potential range extent relative to simulated recent range extent varied considerably among species, although on average range extent increased. Overlap between future and recent simulated range was generally low, averaging < 36% for both breeding and non-breeding ranges. Overlap was consistently less for range-restricted than for widespread species. Migration distance increased generally, by about twice as much in the case of trans-Saharan migrant species than for short-distance migrants. In many cases potential future non-breeding areas were simulated in regions far from the species present non-breeding area, suggesting that new migration strategies and routes may need to be developed in response to climatic change.
   Migratory species can be expected to suffer greater negative impacts from climatic change than species that are resident or undertake only short-distance or partial migrations. Trans-Saharan migrants face the greatest potential increases in migration distances, whereas range-restricted species are expected to experience major population reductions because of the limited, or in some cases lack of, overlap between their present and potential future ranges.

AB Hybridization between genetically distinguishable taxa provides opportunities for investigating speciation. While hybridization is a common phenomenon in various macro-organisms, natural hybridization among micro-eukaryotes is barely studied. Here we used a nuclear and a chloroplast molecular marker and morphology to demonstrate the presence of natural hybrids between two genetically and morphologically distinct varieties of the marine planktonic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia pungens (vars. pungens and cingulata) in a contact zone in the northeast Pacific. Cloning and sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region revealed strains containing ribotypes from both varieties, indicating hybridization. Both varieties were found to also have different chloroplast-encoded rbcL sequences. Hybrid strains were either hetero- or homoplastidial, as demonstrated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which is in accordance with expectations based on the mode of chloroplast inheritance in Pseudo-nitzschia. While most hybrids are probably first generation, there are also indications for further hybridization. Morphologically, the hybrids resembled var. pungens for most characters rather than having an intermediate morphology. Further research should focus on the hybridization frequency, by assessing the spatial and temporal extent of the contact zone, and hybrid fitness, to determine the amount of gene flow between the two varieties and its evolutionary consequences.

AB Sexual selection theory makes clear predictions regarding male spermatogenic investment. To test these predictions we used experimental sexual selection in Drosophila pseudoobscura, a sperm heteromorphic species in which males produce both fertile and sterile sperm, the latter of which may function in postmating competition. Specifically, we determined whether the number and size of both sperm types, as well as relative testis mass and accessory gland size, increased with increased sperm competition risk and whether any fitness benefits could accrue from such changes. We found no effect of sexual selection history on either the number or size of either sperm morph, or on relative testis mass. However, males experiencing a greater opportunity for sexual selection evolved the largest accessory glands, had the greatest mating capacity, and sired the most progeny. These findings suggest that sterile sperm are not direct targets of sexual selection and that accessory gland size, rather than testis mass, appears to be an important determinant of male reproductive success. We briefly review the data from experimental sexual selection studies and find that testis mass may not be a frequent target of postcopulatory sexual selection and, even when it is, the resulting changes do not always improve fitness.

AB The classical version of the differential allocation hypothesis states that, when females reproduce over their lifetime with partners that differ in their genetic quality, they should invest more in reproduction with high-quality males. However, in species with lifetime monogamy, such as the zebra finch, partner quality will typically remain the same. In this case, the compensatory investment (CI) hypothesis predicts higher investment for low-quality males, because low genetic quality offspring are more dependent on maternal resources. Here, we show that female zebra finches invested more resources, both in terms of egg volume and yolk carotenoid content, when paired to a low genetic quality male, as judged from his previous ability to obtain extra-pair paternity in aviary colonies. We also found that females deposited slightly larger amounts of testosterone into eggs when paired to a low parental quality male, as judging from his previous success in rearing offspring. This is, to our knowledge, the first experimental support for the CI hypothesis in a species with lifetime monogamy. We stress that in more promiscuous species, the benefits of classical differential allocation may partly be neutralized by the supposed benefits of CI.

AB Assessing the hydrological imbalance and associated land degradation issues facing much of southern Australia and other parts of the world requires a better understanding of the defining features of ecosystem water use and the design of sustainable agroecosystems. Thus, by grouping species with similar water-use strategies into 'hydraulic functional types' (HFTs), we investigated the characteristics of water use in species-rich plant communities of south-western Australia. HFTs were determined using multiple-trait associations between morphological and physiological traits relating to water transport, water-use efficiency and response to water deficit. Sixteen traits were assessed from a subset of 21 species from three plant communities located along a topographically determined soil- and water-availability gradient. Multivariate analyses showed that trait variation was least at sites with shallower soils and putatively lower water availability, suggesting a convergence of water-use strategies at sites where plants are exposed to large seasonal water deficits. Stem hydraulic parameters, including stem-specific hydraulic conductivity, conduit diameter and maximum percentage embolism, were positively correlated, indicating the generality that larger conduit diameter permits greater hydraulic efficiency and is associated with greater seasonal reductions in hydraulic conductivity in this ecosystem. Wood density was not correlated with these traits, but closely associated with species' ability to withstand more negative water potentials during summer. Long-term integrated water-use efficiency was lower in shallow-rooted species that exhibited more negative summer water potentials. Specific leaf area and minimum leaf water potential were correlated with a number of separate traits, and appear to represent key axes of trait variation that describe the water-use strategies of different HFTs along the topographic gradient. Five HFTs were classified using a resemblance analysis according to combinations of traits that pertain to different water-use strategies among species; year-round active tree, year-round active shrub, hemiparasite, drought-suppressed broad-leaved shrub and drought-suppressed narrow-leaved shrub.

AB Inbreeding avoidance and asymmetric competition over resources have both been identified as factors favoring the evolution of sex-biased dispersal. It has also been recognized that sex-specific costs of dispersal would select for sex-biased dispersal, but there is little quantitative information on this aspect. In this paper we explore (i) the quantitative relationship between cost-asymmetry and a bias in dispersal, (ii) the influence of demographic stochasticity on this effect, and (iii) how inbreeding and cost-asymmetry interact in their effect on sex-specific dispersal. We adjust an existing analytical model to account for sex-specific costs of dispersal. Based on numerical calculations we predict a severe bias in dispersal already for small differences in dispersal costs. We corroborate these predictions in individual-based simulations, but show that demographic stochasticity generally leads to more balanced dispersal. In combination with inbreeding, cost asymmetries will usually determine which of the two sexes becomes the more dispersive. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In postcopulatory sexual selection both sperm competition and cryptic female choice are considered to be important selective agents, but their relative importance for male fertilization success has received little attention. We tested whether sperm quality, male spawning coloration, male heterozygosity, and genetic overlap with the female explained a male's fertilization success in controlled in vitro fertilization competition trials between equal numbers of sperm from pairs of male Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), an external fertilizer. Offspring were genotyped to determine each males' share of paternity. The velocity of a male's sperm relative to the velocity of the competing male's sperm was the best predictor of male fertilization success. Yet, sperm velocity was not related to spawning coloration or male heterozygosity. In fact, the most brightly colored male in a pair had the lowest fertilization probability. This could result from cryptic female choice for pale males, but might rather be a result of paler males producing more competitive sperm than more colored males. Furthermore, the more microsatellite alleles a male shared with the female relative to the competing male, the higher fertilization success he had. We argue that this latter may be an effect of assortative cryptic female choice, which might prevent hybridization with sympatric Arctic charr morphs or one form of kin selection.

AB Previous studies from Central Europe and North America showed that species richness is higher in urban than in rural landscapes. Do protected areas, which can be found in both city and countryside, reflect this species richness pattern? The impact of urban land-use might reduce conservation success and necessitate special management strategies. We compared species richness and species spatial turnover of selected animal and plant taxa (carabids, butterflies, snails, birds, lichens, mosses, vascular plants) in 30 protected areas in the city of Halle and 56 protected areas in the adjacent rural district of Saalkreis (Central Germany). Species were mapped by experienced biologists within a systematic species inventory. We corrected species numbers for the effects of landscape structure (e.g. size, shape and distance of habitats) which might influence species diversity beyond urbanisation effects. Butterflies, birds and lichens had significantly higher species numbers in the rural protected areas. Species spatial turnover was higher among urban areas than among rural areas or pairs of urban and rural areas for most taxa. Diversity in all taxa depended on the size of a protected area. We discussed these patterns in the context of the general urban-rural species diversity patterns. Our results indicate an increasing isolation of species assemblages with urbanisation and highlight that space for protected areas is even more limited in urban than rural areas. An effective conservation of urban species diversity should include both typical urban and semi-natural habitats to cover the full range of species living in cities.

AB Biological invasions offer excellent systems to study the evolutionary processes involved in introductions of species to new ranges. Molecular markers can reveal invasion histories and the effects of introductions on amounts and structuring of genetic variation. We used five polymorphic microsatellite loci to elucidate genetic diversity and population structure between native range and introduced range populations of a prominent North American rangeland weed, Centaurea diffusa (Asteraceae). We found that the total number of alleles and the number of private alleles was slightly higher in the native Eurasian range, and that allelic richness did not differ between the ranges, indicating overall levels of diversity were similar in Eurasia and North America. It therefore seems unlikely that this invasion has been affected by genetic bottlenecks or founder effects. Indeed, results of assignment tests suggest that multiple introductions have contributed to North America's C. diffusa invasion. Additionally, assignment tests show that both Eurasian and North American sites had a strong pattern of mixed genetic ancestry. This mixed assignment corresponded to a lack of geographic population structure among Eurasian samples. The lack of population structure in the native range conflicts with general expectations and findings to date for invasion genetics, and cautions that even species' native ranges may show signs of recent ecological upheaval. Despite the mixed assignments, North American samples showed strong population structure, suggesting that the invasion has been characterized by long-range dispersal of genetically distinct propagules across the introduced range.

AB Recognizing the severity of road effects and need for developing a natural and self-sustained roadside vegetation cover, this study aimed to provide an ecological basis for selecting desirable native plants based on their autecological attributes by floristic analysis of naturally colonized plants in roadside microhabitats. We hypothesized that (i) vegetation zonation along roadsides is a function of the different microtopography and substrate types (microhabitats) created by road construction and (ii) plant colonization in these microhabitats is dependant upon the presence of suitable regeneration traits adapted to the specific microhabitats. We identified four distinct microhabitats namely shoulder, side slope, ditch and back slope from the edge of the road to the edge of the forest. We conducted vegetation and soil analyses in these microhabitats along 34 random transects running perpendicular to the road to the edge of forest in a 14 km section of the Trans Canada Highway (TCH) in Terra Nova National Park (TNNP), Newfoundland, Canada. The multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) confirmed that the plant communities of the four roadside microhabitats were significantly different from each other. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that composition of roadside plant communities was related to gradients of soil moisture content, bulk density, organic matter depth and pH. Several indicator plants, determined by indicator species analysis (ISA), were abundant in their respective microhabitats, indicating their affinity to particular sets of environmental conditions. The root-shoot analysis of selected dominant plants across the roadside habitats revealed that plants of a particular microhabitat had similar above and below ground spread and biomass allocation patterns. We found that floristic zonation along roadsides is a function of roadside microtopography, substrate type and environmental gradients created by the road building process. The similarities in above and below ground spread and biomass allocation patterns of dominant plants of respective microhabitats could be used as a basis of interpreting the role of autecological attributes of the species that enable them to establish in specific microhabitats. Several native plants, such as Empetrum nigrum, Juniperus communis, Vaccinium angustifolium, Trifolium repens, and Anaphalis margaritaceae are naturally abundant in side slopes and possess autecological attributes such as low stature, widespread above- and below-ground parts, and drought tolerance. Presence of these desirable properties and their perennial habit make them excellent candidates for roadside revegetation. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The frequency and duration of macroalgal blooms have increased in many coastal waters over the past several decades. We used field surveys and laboratory culturing experiments to examine the nitrogen content and delta N-15 values of Ulva and Gracilaria, two bloom-forming algal genera in Narragansett Bay, RI (USA). The northern end of this bay is densely populated with large sewage treatment plant nitrogen inputs; the southern end is more lightly populated and opens to the Atlantic Ocean. Field-collected Ulva varied in 6 N-15 among sites, but with two exceptions had delta N-15 above 10 parts per thousand, reflecting a significant component of heavy anthropogenic N. This variation was not correlated with a north-south gradient. Both Ulva and Gracilaria cultured in water from across Narragansett Bay also had high signals (delta N-15 = similar to 14-17 parts per thousand and 8-12 parts per thousand, respectively). These results indicate that inputs of anthropogenic N can have far-reaching impacts throughout estuaries. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To determine the influence of fire and thermokarst in a boreal landscape, we investigated peat cores within and adjacent to a permafrost collapse feature on the Tanana River Floodplain of Interior Alaska. Radioisotope dating, diatom assemblages, plant macrofossils, charcoal fragments, and carbon and nitrogen content of the peat profile indicate similar to 600 years of vegetation succession with a transition from a terrestrial forest to a sedge-dominated wetland over 100 years ago, and to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland in approximately 1970. The shift from sedge to Sphagnum, and a decrease in the detrended tree-ring width index of black spruce trees adjacent to the collapse coincided with an increase in the growing season temperature record from Fairbanks. This concurrent wetland succession and reduced growth of black spruce trees indicates a step-wise ecosystem-level response to a change in regional climate. In 2001, fire was observed coincident with permafrost collapse and resulted in lateral expansion of the peatland. These observations and the peat profile suggest that future warming and/or increased fire disturbance could promote permafrost degradation, peatland expansion, and increase carbon storage across this landscape; however, the development of drought conditions could reduce the success of both black spruce and Sphagnum, and potentially decrease the long-term ecosystem carbon storage.

AB Most of our knowledge regarding ontogenetic niche shifts in plants has been derived from studies involving only two or unconnected life stages. Approaches covering a broader range of different life stages are still needed to fully understand the implications of ontogenetic niche shifts for plant regeneration dynamics. We investigated ontogenetic shifts in the endangered Mediterranean tree species Acer opalus ssp. granatense (A. opalus) comparing the environmental characteristics of individuals of different ages with those of a random sample of available microsites. In addition, since herbivory could be limiting factor, herbivory damage was quantified. Differences in environmental characteristics between locations of individual plants and randomly selected points became larger with plant age. suggesting that the regeneration niche of A. opalus shifts during ontogeny, undergoing a contraction. The presence of shrubs and adult trees, the depth of the litter layer, and herbivory were the main factors influencing these changes. A. opalus can germinate in all available microhabitats its seeds can reach, but samplings establish and grow only in a subset of microhabitats, which represent a change in tolerence to extrinsic factors. Old saplings establish under the canopy of shrubs, far away from tree cover that could block light required in the oldest stage. Therefore, temporal changes in the nature and strength of plant-plant interactions are also occuring. The ecological concept of niche shifts reveals the microsites with higher probabilities of long-term sapling survival of A. opalus: shurb cover involves an array of environmental changes crucial for the successful establishment of A. opalus saplings under stressful Mediterranean conditions, from microhabitat amelioration to herbivory protection.

AB There is now overwhelming evidence that an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere has caused global temperatures to increase by 0.6 degrees C since 1900 and further increases of between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees C are predicted over the next century. Changes in climatic conditions have already influenced the demography, phenology and distribution of a wide range of plant and animal taxa. This review focuses on the impacts, both observed and potential, of climate change on birds breeding in temperate woodlands of the Western Palaearctic, a significant proportion of which are currently declining. Changes in ambient temperatures and patterns of precipitation may have direct and indirect effects on the survival rates and productivity of bird species, thus influencing population sizes. For some species or populations, the timing of events such as egg-laying and return from the wintering grounds is also changing in relation to shifts in the peak of food availability during the breeding season. The degree to which different individuals are able to track these temporal changes will have a significant bearing on population sizes and distributions in the future. Unless active management steps are taken, the relatively low dispersal rates of tree species may lead to a decrease in the total area of some woodland habitat types as losses at the southern edge of the range are likely to occur much more quickly than expansion at the northern edge. In addition, the dispersal rates of many woodland birds are themselves low, which could affect their ability to move to new habitat patches if currently occupied areas become unsuitable. Thus, woodland birds may be particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change.

AB The mating system of a plant is the prime determinant of its population genetic structure. However, mating system effects may be modified by postzygotic mechanisms like inbreeding depression. Furthermore, historical as well as contemporary ecological factors and population characteristics, like the location within the species range can contribute to genetic variability. Using microsatellite markers we assessed the population genetic structure of the wind-pollinated Juncus atratus in 16 populations from peripheral and nearly central areas of the distribution range and studied the mating system of the species. In three peripheral populations, outcrossing rates at seeds stage were low (mean t(m) = 5.6%), suggesting a highly autogamous mating system. Despite this fact, on adult stage both individual heterozygosity (mean H-O = 0.48) and gene diversity (mean H-E = 0.58) were high even in small populations. Inbreeding coefficients were consistently low among all populations (mean F-IS = 0.15). Within the three peripheral populations indirect estimates of lifetime inbreeding depression were surprisingly high (delta(eq) = 0.96) and inbreeding depression could be shown to act mostly on early seedling establishment. Similar conditions of autogamy combined with high inbreeding depression are typical for plants with a large lifetime genomic mutation rate that cannot avoid selfing by geitonogamy. However, the results presented here are unexpected for small-statured, herbaceous plants. Substantial genetic differentiation among all populations was found (mean F-ST = 0.24). An isolation-by-distance pattern was apparent on large scale but not on local scale suggesting that the overall pattern was largely influenced by historical factors, e. g. colonization, whereas locally genetic drift was of greater importance than gene flow. Peripheral populations exhibited lower genetic diversity and higher inbreeding coefficients when compared with subcentral populations.

AB Prolonged postfledging care is a commonly observed behavior in many cooperatively breeding species and has been shown to provide young with both survival and developmental benefits. However, the causes of intraspecific variation in postfledging care and the consequences of this variation on the development of young remain unclear. Here we investigate factors affecting the duration of postfledging care in the cooperatively breeding pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor). We show that the duration of care is variable (40-97 days) and is determined primarily by the cost of care. Adults in groups with a low adult: fledgling ratio were unable to maintain body mass during the period of chick provisioning and subsequently ceased care of young earlier. This had a strong influence on offspring development: fledglings that received longer periods of care attained higher foraging efficiency and body mass than their counterparts at 6 months of age. The duration of postfledging care also had long-term effects, with individuals that received longer periods of postfledging care more likely to successfully disperse from their natal group. This had important fitness implications as successful dispersers became reproductively active at an earlier age than their "failed-disperser" counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of considering long-term influences when assessing the benefits of prolonged postfledging care on offspring fitness and development in cooperative societies.

AB A recent study of mitochondrial phylogeography of tawny owls (Strix aluco) in western Europe suggested that this species survived the Pleistocene glaciations in three allopatric refugia located in Iberia, Italy, and the Balkans, and the latter was likely the predominant source of postglacial colonization of northern Europe. New data from seven microsatellite loci from 184 individual owls distributed among 14 populations were used to assess the genetic congruence between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers. Microsatellites corroborated the major phylogeographical conclusions reached on the basis of the mtDNA sequences, but also showed important differences leading to novel inferences. Microsatellites corroborated the three major refugia and supported the Balkan origin of northern populations. When corrected for differences in effective population size, microsatellites and mtDNA yielded generally congruent overall estimates of population structure (N*(ST) = 0.12 vs. R-ST = 0.16); however, there was substantial heterogeneity in the RST among the seven nuclear loci that was not correlated with heterozygosity. Populations representing the Balkans postglacial expansion interact with populations from the other two refugia forming two clines near the Alps and the Pyrenees. In both cases, the apparent position of the contact zones differed substantially between markers due to the genetic composition of populations sampled in northern Italy and Madrid. Microsatellite data did not corroborate the lower genetic diversity of northern, recently populated regions as was found with mtDNA; this discrepancy was taken as evidence for a recent bottleneck recovery. Finally, this study suggests that congruence among genetic markers should be more likely in cases of range expansion into new areas than when populations interact across contact zones.

AB Field surveys and laboratory experiments were used to investigate the influence of the physical environment on variability in delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of Ulva pertusa, an abundant macroalgae inhabiting the low salinity layer (LSL) of Doubtful Sound, a New Zealand fjord. Field surveys revealed significant spatial variability in delta C-13 (-18 parts per thousand to -12 parts per thousand) and delta N-15 (0 parts per thousand to 6 parts per thousand). delta C-13 was enriched at high irradiance sites and depleted at the fjord's wave-exposed entrance. delta N-15 signatures increased from 0 parts per thousand at the fjord head where freshwater influence is greatest to an oceanic signature of 6 parts per thousand at the fjord entrance. delta N-15 also increased by up to 4 parts per thousand between 2-m depth and the LSL-seawater interface (4-m depth); this pattern was less pronounced near the ocean. During laboratory experiments, delta C-13 of U. pertusa became significantly enriched under high levels of irradiance (> 50 umol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). When exposed to high irradiance, increases in water motion rapidly depleted delta C-13 signatures by as much as 5 parts per thousand. Variability in delta C-13 of U. pertusa in Doubtful Sound is largely a function of the light regime, which influences rates of photosynthesis and in turn the algae's dependence on HCO3-, an enriched source of carbon. However, increased water motion at the fjord entrance counteracts the influence of irradiance, leading to enhanced flux of CO2 and depleted delta C-13 signatures. Variation in delta N-15 of U. pertusa is less dependent on the physical environment and instead is driven by the source pool signature, which in turn varies between freshwater and marine sources of nitrogen.

AB The Andes provide an extensive latitudinal and topographical framework for studying the factors that control the spatial patterns of forests (timberlines) and their species components expressed through the presence of tree growth forms ( tree lines). Despite consistent overall similarities in landscape patterns, many processes must be unique, given the dramatic differences in species richness and biophysical constraints along the Andes. In all cases evaluated to date, morphological plasticity is a common trait of plant species that dominate at tree lines. In fact, many changes observed can be related to species- specific traits. Physiological limitations on tree growth form only explain species limits, while disturbances and cyclical climate fluctuations interact to affect many landscape patterns. Over long periods of time, tree lines provide unique habitats and perhaps opportunities for speciation. Understanding the spatial organization of tree-line dynamics is one viable research approach for evaluating the likely past fluxes and possible future changes.

AB Environment-friendly farming techniques seek to increase invertebrate biodiversity in part with the intention of encouraging greater numbers of predators that will help to control crop pests. However, in theory, this effect may be negated if the availability of a greater abundance and diversity of alternative prey diverts predators away from feeding on pests. The hypothesis that access to alternative prey can lead to reduced pest suppression under semi-field conditions was tested. Alternative prey type and diversity were manipulated in 70 mesocosms over 7+ weeks in the presence of the carabid Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), a known predator of slugs, and reproducing populations of the slug Deroceras reticulatum (Muller). Significantly fewer slugs survived where no alternative prey were provided. Maximum slug numbers and biomass were found in treatments containing either carabids plus a high diversity of alternative prey (many species of earthworm and three of Diptera larvae) or a single additional prey (blowfly larvae, Calliphora vomitoria Linnaeus). In these treatments slug numbers and biomass were as high as in plots lacking predators. The effects of alternative prey were taxon-specific. Alternative prey strongly affected carabid fitness in terms of biomass and egg load. The fittest predators (those with access to high alternative prey diversity or C. vomitoria larvae) reduced slug numbers the least. The mean individual slug weights were greater in treatments with alternative prey than where no alternative prey were provided to the carabids. These results suggest that pests may survive and reproduce more rapidly in patches where predators have access to alternative prey.

AB Opinions about how disturbance affects stream biodiversity differ. Models that assume that communities are shaped by biotic interactions emphasize the positive effects of stream disturbance (such as possible colonization by species that would be outcompeted understable environmental conditions), whereas models assuming that communities are shaped by physical habitat factors emphasize the negative effects (such as the exclusion of species lacking adaptations to stress). Empirical studies on macroinvertebrate assemblages show that at small spatial scales, disturbance caused by floods affects diversity negatively. However, the same mechanisms that disturb the biota-scour and fill of sediments-also maintain the heterogeneity of riverine habitats, which underpins the existence of rich communities in the long term and at larger spatial scales. Therefore, the effects of flood-mediated disturbance on biodiversity probably depend on the spatiotemporal scale of observation. The magnitude of the observed effects is modulated by the predictability and severity of floods and the availability of food resources.

AB According to the size-advantage hypothesis, protandric sequential hermaphroditism is expected when the increase in reproductive success with age or size is small for males but large for females. Interestingly, some protandrous molluscs have developed gregarious strategies that might enhance male reproductive success but at the cost of intraspecific competition. The gastropod Crepidula fornicata, a European invading species, is ideal for investigating mating patterns in a sequential hermaphrodite in relation to grouping behaviour because individuals of different size (age) live in perennial stacks, fertilization is internal and embryos are brooded. Paternity analyses were undertaken in stacks sampled in three close and recently invaded sites in Brittany, France. Paternity assignment of 239 larvae, sampled from a set of 18 brooding females and carried out using five microsatellite loci, revealed that 92% of the crosses occurred between individuals located in the same stack. These stacks thus function as independent mating groups in which individuals may reproduce consecutively as male and female over a short time period, a pattern explained by sperm storage capacity. Gregariousness and sex reversal are promoting reproductive insurance in this species. In addition, females are usually fertilized by several males (78% of the broods were multiply sired) occupying any position within the stack, a result reinforcing the hypothesis of sperm competition. Our study pointed out that mating behaviours and patterns of gender allocation varied in concert across sites suggesting that multiple paternities might enhance sex reversal depending on sperm competition intensity.

AB To examine the resilience of soil animal communities to large-scale disturbances. we studied the recovery of total abundance, diversity and community composition of forest soil mesofauna after a 6-year climatic disturbance. This was done in a pre-established experiment in a Norway spruce Picea abies stand in southern Sweden in which long-term summer droughts had been experimentally imposed and had caused large changes in soil fauna communities. We included both predators (mesostigmatid mites) and fungivores/detritivores (oribatid mites, collembolans) in the study because of the likelihood that they would differ in recovery ability due to differences in their feeding habits, dispersal ability and reproductive strategies. Total abundances of Collembola, Oribatida and Mesostigmata were similar in recovery and control plots after three years, but species richness, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and community composition recovered more slowly, particularly among the Oribatida. To only use total abundance of higher taxonomic groups was thus not sufficient when measuring community recovery. There was a tendency for more mobile groups to recover faster than the slow-moving oribatids, indicating the importance of dispersal ability for the resilience of soil communities.

AB Ecologists and economists both use models to help develop strategies for biodiversity management. The practical use of disciplinary models, however, can be limited because ecological models tend not to address the socioeconomic dimension of biodiversity management, whereas economic models tend to neglect the ecological dimension. Given these shortcomings of disciplinary models, there is a necessity to combine ecological and economic knowledge into ecological-economic models. It is insufficient if scientists work separately in their own disciplines and combine their knowledge only when it comes to formulating management recommendations. Such an approach does not capture feedback loops between the ecological and the socioeconomic systems. Furthermore, each discipline poses the management problem in its own way and comes up with its own most appropriate solution. These disciplinary solutions, however are likely to be so different that a combined solution considering aspects of both disciplines cannot be found. Preconditions for a successful model-based integration of ecology and economics include (1) an in-depth knowledge of the two disciplines, (2) the adequate identification and framing of the problem to be investigated, and (3) a common understanding between economists and ecologists of modeling and scale. To further advance ecological-economic modeling the development of common benchmarks, quality controls, and refereeing standards for ecological-economic models is desirable.

AB Intercropping soybean (Glycine mar L.) with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) is common in the semiarid tropics of India. In most intercropping studies, little attention has been paid to belowground interaction and nutrient management other than N while assessing yield advantage. In a 5-yr field experiment (2000-2004), we evaluated the impact of fertilizer and organic manures on below- and aboveground interaction, competitive ability, and economic viability of this intercropping at the Indian Institute of Soil Science, Bhopal for deep Vertisol (isohyperthermic Typic Haplustert) of central India. Above-and belowground growth components as well as biological activities were greatly improved in intercropped sorghum while the value of these except nitrate reductase (NR) activity, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) were reduced in intercropped soybean indicating interspecies competition between component crops. The increased NR activity, SMBC, and DHA in intercropped soybean revealed interspecies facilitation between the component crops. This showed that interspecies competition concurred with interspecies facilitation in this system. We observed that yield and land equivalent ratio (LER) of both the intercrops increased over sole crops though based on aggressivity and relative crowding coefficient (RCC), sorghum (+) is more competitive than soybean. Interaction of yield with different components indicated that three belowground components, i.e., NR activity in root (r = 0.62, r = 0.63, P < 0.05), root length density (r = 0.36, r = 0.33, P < 0.05), and SMBC (r = 0.71, r = 0.66, P < 0.05) of both intercrop soybean and intercrop sorghum, respectively, had the greater effect on yield advantage in the intercropping system. Soybean did not benefit from intercropping to the same degree as sorghum under N-P-K. Nutrient application influenced LER, RCC, and monetary advantage index and was found in the order of N-P-K plus farmyard manure (FYM) > N-P-K plus poultry manure (PM) > N-P-K plus phosphocompost (PC) > N-P-K > control. However, based on competition ratio, yield advantage was greater under N-P-K plus PM. The results suggest that sorghum is the major contributor to the mixture yield and that the integrated use of N-P-K plus FYM or N-P-K plus PM is an important nutrient management option for sustaining this intercropping system, particularly to benefit the legume component.

AB The extent to which offspring resemble their parents in genotype and phenotype underpins patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation, selection, and evolution in natural populations. Genetic and phenotypic resemblance can clearly result from additive genetic variance and can be shaped by nongenetic parental and common environmental influences. In contrast, there is no straightforward expectation that inbreeding coefficient (f), a nonadditive component of genetic "quality," should be correlated across parents and offspring in sexually reproducing species or consequently cause resemblance across generations. Here, we report a significant parent f-offspring f correlation within a free-living pedigreed population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) on Mandarte Island, Canada. Across 15 years, relatively inbred parents had relatively inbred offspring on average. We show that rather than requiring nonrandom pairing with respect to f and kinship, parent f-offspring f correlations arise as an intrinsic consequence of random pairing within Mandarte's open population, where immigrants interbreed with Mandarte-hatched natives. However, on Mandarte, parent f offspring f correlations may have been exacerbated because relatively inbred individuals paired with more closely related mates than expected by chance. Such intrinsic parent f-offspring f correlations have major implications for the understanding of resemblance, selection, and evolution in natural populations.

AB Current neutral theory in macroecology has many parallels with neutral theory in population genetics, but it also has many distinct features that arise because it focuses mainly on questions at the community level rather than at the population level. Here we highlight the similarities and differences between these two bodies of theories from the aspects of the operational units, definitions of neutrality, basic parameters, driving forces, spatial structure and community assembly rules. Compared with neutral theory in population genetics, whose development spans more than 40 years, neutral theory in ecology, which is only a few years old, is still immature and under-developed. There are many opportunities for major theoretical contributions, some of which can be adopted directly from population genetics, while others will require new theoretical work. We critically discuss these opportunities and theoretical challenges in neutral macroecology, particularly in regard to effective community size, ecological drift, community differentiation and ecological dominance.

AB Diversity-stability relationships have long been a topic of controversy in ecology, but one whose importance has been re-highlighted by increasing large-scale threats to global biodiversity. The ability of a community to recover from a perturbation (or resilience) is a common measure of stability that has received a large amount of theoretical attention. Yet, general expectations regarding diversity-resilience relations remain elusive. Moreover, the effects of productivity and its interaction with diversity on resilience are equally unclear. We examined the effects of species diversity, species composition, and productivity on population- and community-level resilience in experimental aquatic food webs composed of bacteria, algae, heterotrophic protozoa, and rotifers. Productivity manipulations were crossed with manipulations of the number of species and species compositions within trophic groups. Resilience was measured by perturbing communities with a nonselective, density-independent, mortality event and comparing responses over time between perturbed communities and controls. We found evidence that species diversity can enhance resilience at the community level (i.e., total community biomass), though this effect was more strongly expressed in low-productivity treatments. Diversity effects on resilience were driven by a sampling/selection effect, with resilient communities showing rapid response and dominance by a minority of species (primarily unicellular algae). In contrast, diversity had no effect on mean population-level resilience. Instead, the ability of a community's populations to recover from perturbations was dependent on species composition. We found no evidence of an effect of productivity, either positive or negative, on community- or population-level resilience. Our results indicate that the role of diversity as an insurer of stability may depend on the level of biological organization at which stability is measured, with effects emerging only when focusing on aggregate community properties.

AB We analyzed data from 287 streams in Wisconsin and northern Michigan to evaluate the relative effects of human disturbance levels on the influence of catchment, network riparian, reach riparian, and instrearn variables on fish assemblages. The streams were divided into high, medium, and low human disturbance groups based on catchment and network riparian urban and agricultural land uses. We used canonical correspondence analyses to evaluate relations among variables at the four spatial scales and fish assemblage composition, abundance, and presence/absence and to partition the relative importance of spatial scales. Catchment and network riparian land uses were among the dominant variables correlated with fish for high disturbance catchments but not for low disturbance catchments. The variations in fish assemblage composition, abundance, and presence/absence explained by catchment factors were substantially higher for high than for low disturbance catchments, although the variations explained by network riparian factors and reach riparian land uses were similar among disturbance levels. In contrast, the variations in fish variables explained by instream factors and the interaction of the four spatia ' I scale environmental factors were considerably lower for high disturbance than for low disturbance catchments. We concluded that in largely undisturbed catchments, fish assemblages were predominantly influenced by local factors, but as disturbance increased in catchments and riparian areas, the relative importance of local factors declined and that of catchment increased. Hence, instrearn and riparian habitat improvements would be most effective in catchments that are largely undisturbed and catchment scale land-use management would be more effective for improving stream quality in degraded catchments.

AB Helpers in cooperative and communal breeding species are thought to accrue fitness benefits through improving the condition and survival of the offspring that they care for, yet few studies have shown conclusively that helpers benefit the offspring they rear. Using a novel approach to control for potentially confounding group-specific variables, I compare banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) offspring within the same litter that differ in the amount of time they spend with a helper, and hence the amount of care they receive. I show that pups that spend more time in close proximity to a helper are fed more, grow faster and have a higher probability of survival to independence than their littermates. Moreover, high growth rates during development reduce the age at which females breed for the first time, suggesting that helpers can improve the future fecundity of the offspring for which they care. These results provide strong evidence that it is the amount of investment per se that benefits offspring, rather than some correlate such as territory quality, and validate the assumption that helpers improve the reproductive success of breeders, and hence may gain fitness benefits from their actions. Furthermore, the finding that helpers may benefit offspring in the long-term suggests that current studies underestimate the fitness benefits that helpers gain from rearing the offspring of others.

AB Genetic differentiation in 20 hierarchically sampled populations of wild barley was analyzed with quantitative traits, allozymes and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNAs ( RAPDs), and compared for three marker types at two hierarchical levels. Regional subdivision for both molecular markers was much lower than for quantitative traits. For both allozymes and RAPDs, most loci exhibited minor or no regional differentiation, and the relatively high overall estimates of the latter were due to several loci with exceptionally high regional differentiation. The allozyme- and RAPD- specific patterns of differentiation were concordant in general with one another, but not with quantitative trait differentiation. Divergent selection on quantitative traits inferred from very high regional Q(ST) was in full agreement with our previous results obtained from a test of local adaptation and multilevel selection analysis. In contrast, most variation in allozyme and RAPD variation was neutral, although several allozyme loci and RAPD markers were exceptional in their levels of regional differentiation. However, it is not possible to answer the question whether these exceptional loci are directly involved in the response to selection pressure or merely linked to the selected loci. The fact that Q(ST) and F-ST did not differ at the population scale, that is, within regions, but differed at the regional scale, for which local adaptation has been previously shown, implies that comparison of the level of subdivision in quantitative traits, as compared with molecular markers, is indicative of adaptive population differentiation only when sampling is carried out at the appropriate scale.

AB 1. Compared with most terrestrial data sets used in development of theoretical models, what characterizes data sets from marine soft sediments is that they have a very high number of species. Marine data also show large numbers of rare species, even if the extent of the study is greatly increased from a few square metres to hundreds of square kilometres.
   2. Fitting log-normal distributions to data on species abundance distributions (SADs) for marine benthic assemblages from the continental shelf of Norway, and for the well-studied tropical tree data of Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), show patterns suggesting that more than one log-normal distribution occurs.
   3. We have developed a simple model of SADs comprising two groups of log-normally distributed species, a group of rare species and a group of common species. The model appears to fit the marine data and also applies to the BCI tropical tree data and yet is simpler than Hubbell's Zero-Sum Multinomial (ZSM) distribution model.
   4. The plots of the model results show that the marine data are dominated by the rare group of species at all scales studied. In the tropical tree assemblage a similar pattern to that in the marine data is apparent only at small spatial scales (5 and 10 ha), but not at the larger extent (25-50 ha). It is important to note, however, that marine data at all the scales studied are samples from a given area, whereas the terrestrial data are exact counts of all species of tree within the total 50 ha plot studied.
   5. Most ecological data are likely to be based on samples rather than exact counts so the patterns found with the marine data are likely to be common, and our findings general ones.
   6. A biological explanation for the two-group log-normal model is that recruitment of rare species from outside the studied area dominates benthic assemblages of soft sediments at all sampled scales. Within the tropical forest the dominance of recruitment processes are only apparent at small scales.
   7. Thus, the interpretation of SAD patterns depends greatly on the type of data collected, i.e. whether they are exact counts or samples. We believe that structuring processes are similar in marine and many terrestrial systems and these processes probably conform to the mass-effects paradigm of the newly termed meta-community concept.

AB We present a simple nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) model that incorporates adaptive evolution and allometric relations to examine the patterns and consequences of adaptive changes in plankton body size. Assuming stable environmental conditions, the model makes the following predictions. First, phytoplankton should evolve toward small sizes typical of picoplankton. Second, in the absence of grazers, nutrient concentration is minimized as phytoplankton reach their fitness maximum. Third, increasing nutrient flux tends to increase phytoplankton cell size in the presence of phytoplankton-zooplankton coevolution but has no effect in the absence of zooplankton. Fourth, phytoplankton reach their fitness maximum in the absence of grazers, and the evolutionary nutrient-phytoplankton system has a stable equilibrium. In contrast, phytoplankton may approach their fitness minimum in the evolutionary NPZ system where phytoplankton and zooplankton are allowed to coevolve, which may result in oscillatory ( unstable) dynamics of the evolutionary NPZ system, compared with the otherwise stable nonevolutionary NPZ system. These results suggest that evolutionary interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton may have contributed to observed changes in phytoplankton sizes and associated biogeochemical cycles over geological time scales.

AB Under high nutrient concentrations and sufficient light conditions, large phytoplankton may display higher photosynthetic efficiency than smaller cells. This is unexpected since smaller phytoplankton, because of their higher surface to volume ratio, possess a greater ability to take up nutrients and absorb light. In order to investigate the causes of the increased photosynthetic efficiency in larger phytoplankton, we assessed the maximum photosynthetic efficiency of coastal assemblages in three size classes (< 5, 5-20, and > 20 mu m) by concurrently conducting C-14- based photosynthesis-irradiance experiments and fast repetition rate fluorescence measurements. The light-saturated, chlorophyll-specific photosynthesis (P-max(b)) and the maximum photosystem II (PSII) photochemical efficiency (F-v/ F-m) of each size class were determined during winter mixing (March 2003) and summer stratification (June 2003). During winter mixing, size-fractionated P-max(b) and F-v/F-m were similar in all size classes. In contrast, during summer stratification, size-fractionated P-max(b) and F-v/F-m were significantly higher in the > 20-mu m size class. In the entire data set, size-fractionated P-max(b) and F-v/F-m were not significantly correlated. However, a significant relationship was found between size-fractionated P-max(b) and F-v/F-m for phytoplankton assemblages acclimated to low light conditions. Under high light, an excess PSII capacity may be responsible for the discrepancy between size-fractionated P-max(b) and F-v/F-m measurements, whereas under low light conditions, photosynthetic electron transport chain and components downstream of PSII become more balanced, which results in a tight covariation between both variables. Higher maximum photosynthetic efficiencies of large-sized phytoplankton might be associated with a higher PSII photochemical efficiency characteristic of certain taxonomic groups such as diatoms.

AB The European aspen (Populus tremula) is thought to reproduce mostly asexually. Thus aspen forms clones, in which several ramets belong to one genetically defined genet. We compared the clonal structure of aspen in old-growth and managed forests in southern and northeastern Finland. Clones were identified using morphological characters and nine microsatellite loci originally developed for Populus tremuloides. There were more clones identified by microsatellites than morphotypes both in old-growth and managed forest. The average size of the clones was only 2.3 ramets and most clones (70%) consisted of just one ramet. The size of the clones showed no difference between managed and old-growth forests or between northeastern and southern Finland. The small size of the clones suggests that most of them are relatively young. Therefore, sexual reproduction may be more common than previously thought. There was an aggregated spatial genetic structure as measured by Moran's I (0-10 m) and by co-ancestry (rho(ij), 0-20 m). Low level of co-ancestry can be explained by relatively unrestricted gene flow, the important role of disturbance in reproduction, and/or local selection.

AB Understanding factors that influence birth mass of mammals provides insights to nutritional trade-offs made by females to optimize their reproduction, growth, and survival. I evaluated variation in birth mass of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in central Alaska relative to maternal characteristics (age, body mass, cohort, and nutritional condition as influenced by winter severity) during 11 years with substantial variation in winter snowfall. Snowfall during gestation was the predominant factor explaining variation in birth masses, influencing birth mass inversely and through interactions with maternal age and lactation status. Maternal age effects were noted for females <= 5 years old, declining in magnitude with each successive age class. Birth mass as a proportion of autumn maternal mass was inversely related to winter snowfall, even though there was no decrease in masses of adult females in late winter associated with severe winters. I found no evidence of a hypothesized intergenerational effect of lower birth masses for offspring of females born after severe winters. Caribou produce relatively small offspring but provide exceptional lactation support for those that survive. Conservative maternal investment before parturition may represent an optimal reproductive strategy given that caribou experience stochastic variation in winter severity during gestation, uncertainty of environmental conditions surrounding the birth season, and intense predation on neonates.

AB Predation by wolves Canis lupus on roe deer Capreolus capreolus was studied by scat analysis in five areas of the Province of Arezzo, north-eastern Tuscany, Italy. In the intensive study area (ISA) roe deer represented 19.1% of mean per cent volume (MPV) while in the other areas its use ranged between 10.9% and 53.4% of MPV A low degree of variation was found in both annual and seasonal use of roe deer, although seasonal differences were more marked in those areas where roe deer use was lower. In ISA, roe deer was negatively selected among species: the Ivlev's electivity index ranged between - 0.41 and - 0.89. Analysing intra-specific selection, in ISA < 1-year-old individuals were preferred by wolves, mainly during the fawns' first months of life. This trend was confirmed in the other areas, where fawns represented more than 50% of the relative number of roe deer prey. In ISA, the use of roe deer (as MPV) was not correlated with its density or with that of the main prey, wild boar, and in almost all the other areas no relation between use and density of roe deer was founded. However, in the one area where both roe deer density and use were the highest, these two variables seemed to exhibit a comparable trend. The use of roe deer was negatively correlated with the percentage of forest cover among all the study areas.

AB Question: What are the correlations between the degree of drought stress and temperature, and the adoption of specific adaptive strategies by plants in the Mediterranean region? Location: 602 sites across the Mediterranean region. Method: We considered 12 plant morphological and phenological traits, and measured their abundance at the sites as trait scores obtained from pollen percentages. We conducted stepwise regression analyses of trait scores as a function of plant available moisture (alpha) and winter temperature (MTCO). Results: Patterns in the abundance for the plant traits we considered are clearly determined by alpha, MTCO or a combination of both. In addition, trends in leaf size, texture, thickness, pubescence and aromatic leaves and other plant level traits such as thorniness and aphylly, vary according to the life form (tree, shrub, forb), the leaf type (broad, needle) and phenology (evergreen, summer-green). Conclusions: Despite conducting this study based on pollen data we have identified ecologically plausible trends in the abundance of traits along climatic gradients. Plant traits other than the usual life form, leaf type and leaf phenology carry strong climatic signals. Generally, combinations of plant traits are more climatically diagnostic than individual traits. The qualitative and quantitative relationships between plant traits and climate parameters established here will help to provide an improved basis for modelling the impact of climate changes on vegetation and form a starting point for a global analysis of pollen-climate relationships.

AB It has been an enduring belief that increasing aridity combined with Pliocene-Pleistocene glacial cycles resulted in the formation of distinct and zone and temperate zone faunas within Australia. We assembled a molecular phylogeny for the Egernia whitii species group, an endemic group of skinks that comprises representatives from and and temperate Australia, in order to test several biogeographical hypotheses regarding the origin of the Australian and zone fauna. Sequence data were obtained from ten of the 11 species within the species group, plus three other Egernia species and an outgroup (Eulamprus heatwolei). We targeted portions of the ND4 (696 base pairs) and 16S rRNA (500 bp) mitochondrial genes and the beta-Fibrinogen 7th Intron nuclear gene (648 bp). The edited alignment comprised 1844 characters, of which 551 (30%) were variable and 382 (69%) were parsimony informative. We analysed the data using maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques and produced a single optimal tree. Our phylogeny strongly supports two major clades within the species group, corresponding to temperate-adapted rock-dwelling species and arid-adapted obligate burrowing species. However, the phylogenetic affinities of E. pulchra were not resolved. Our topology indicates that the New South Wales population of E. margaretae is actually E. whitii and reveals that E. margaretae margaretae and E. m. personata are distinct species. There also appears to be a major phylogeographical break within E. whitii occurring in eastern Victoria. Although our data supported several previously proposed phylogenetic relationships, Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests soundly rejected several suggested affinities between certain species. The and zone members of the E. whitii species group had been suggested to have originated as a result of multiple periods of colonization during the Pleistocene glaciation cycles. However, our genetic data suggest a single origin (presumably from a semiarid E. multiscutata-like ancestor) for the and zone members of the group prior to the Plio-Pleistocene, probably during the late Miocene to early Pliocene. Our topology displays substantial sequence divergence between species with short internodes and long terminal branches, indicating rapid adaptive radiations within the and and temperate zones. The presence of temperate-adapted species within more mesic refugia of the and zone suggests that the necessary adaptations to aridity for colonizing the dry interior of the continent have not evolved since the initial period of adaptive radiation, despite the long evolutionary history of the species group.

AB The series of papers introduced by this one address a range of statistical applications in plant pathology, including survival analysis, nonparametric analysis of disease associations, multivariate analyses, neural networks, meta-analysis, and Bayesian statistics. Here we present an overview of additional applications of statistics in plant pathology. An analysis of variance based on the assumption of normally distributed responses with equal variances has been a standard approach in biology for decades. Advances in statistical theory and computation now make it convenient to appropriately deal with discrete responses using generalized linear models, with adjustments for overdispersion as needed. New nonparametric approaches are available for analysis of ordinal data such as disease ratings. Many experiments require the use of models with fixed and random effects for data analysis. New or expanded computing packages, such as SAS PROC MIXED, coupled with extensive advances in statistical theory, allow for appropriate analyses of normally distributed data using linear mixed models, and discrete data with generalized linear mixed models. Decision theory offers a framework in plant pathology for contexts such as the decision about whether to apply or withhold a treatment. Model selection can be performed using Akaike's information criterion. Plant pathologists studying pathogens at the population level have traditionally been the main consumers of statistical approaches in plant pathology, but new technologies such as microarrays supply estimates of gene expression for thousands of genes simultaneously and present challenges for statistical analysis. Applications to the study of the landscape of the field and of the genome share the risk of pseudoreplication, the problem of determining the appropriate scale of the experimental unit and of obtaining sufficient replication at that scale.

AB The role of habitat heterogeneity as a key factor in determining species pools in habitat mosaics has been acknowledged, but we still know little on the relative importance of the different ecological processes acting within such complex landscapes. We compared species richness and distribution in forest fragments imbedded in shrub-lands to those in continuous forests or in continuous shrublands. We examined the consistency of our data with the predictions of two hypotheses: 1) the Habitat fragmentation hypothesis which states that fragmentation has negative effects on the species from the original continuous habitat; 2) the Habitat supplementation /complementation hypothesis which stipulates that the presence of a matrix habitat around the fragments will mitigate negative effects on the species from the original habitat (supplementation) or allow the presence of species that depend on the presence of both the fragment and matrix habitats (complementation). We show that: 1) species richness in forest fragments did not differ from species richness in segments of continuous forests of equal area; 2) the bird community of forest fragments got impoverished in some forest species but a higher proportion of species common in continuous forests were not affected by fragmentation; 3) fragment communities had a significant proportion of common species that were scarce in, or absent from both continuous forests and shrublands. While, a few forest species supported predictions from the fragmentation hypothesis, occurrence patterns observed in several other species were consistent with either the supplementation or the complementation hypotheses. Our results suggest that there is no single hypothesis that properly captures the consequences of a shift from continuous forests to a mosaic of forest fragments and shrublands and that different ecological mechanisms act in conjunction to determine species pools in habitat mosaics. Habitat heterogeneity at a local scale appears a key factor in maintaining bird diversity in fire driven Mediterranean landscapes.

AB Are setts significant determinants of badger socio-spatial organisation, and do suitable sett sites represent a limited resource, potentially affecting badger distributions? The factors determining diurnal resting den, or sett, location and selection by Eurasian badgers Meles meles L. were investigated in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. 279 sett sites were located. The habitat parameters that were associated with the siting of these setts were analysed and associations were sought between sett location and character and the body condition and body weight of resident badgers Habitat characteristics in the vicinity of setts were significantly different from randomly selected points. Badgers preferentially selected sites with sandy, well-drained soils, situated on NW-facing, convex and moderately inclined slopes at moderate altitude. There was no evidence that sett morphology (number of entrances, sett area, number of hinterland latrines) was affected by the surrounding sett site habitat characteristics. Mean body weight was significantly higher for badgers occupying territories with setts in sandy soils, situated on NW-facing slopes, than in territories with less optimal sett characteristics. Contrary to the hypothesis that the availability of sett sites was limiting, and therefore that sett dispersion dictates the spatial and social organisation of their populations, the badgers were clearly able to excavate new setts. On our measures, these new setts were not inferior to old established ones, despite occupying subsequently exploited sites; the badgers utilising these new setts had neither lighter body weights nor poorer body condition scores. During the period of our study badgers have manifestly been able to dig numerous new setts; as satisfactory sites still remain available, this indicates that suitable sett sites have not yet become a limiting resource. There was no relationship between sett age and the characteristics of the site in which it was dug, as suitable sites were not limiting. Significantly, population expansion during the decade 1987-1997 was not constrained by lack of setts, rather the main proliferation in setts occurred after the population size had peaked in 1996. Some implications for the management and conservation of the Eurasian badger are considered.

AB Early arrival at the breeding area after spring migration determines several fitness benefits to migratory birds, including an early start of reproduction and a greater seasonal reproductive success. Environmental conditions determine the onset of migration at the population level, while physiological costs associated with migration and imposed on individuals determine the level of asynchrony in the pattern of arrival. These costs include several physiological changes, suppression of immune response, and an increased risk of oxidation by production of free radicals due to energetically expensive activities. According to the condition-dependent hypothesis of arrival date, only healthy individuals in prime condition can afford to arrive and thus reproduce early in the season.
   We investigated condition-dependence of arrival date in male barn swallow (Hirundo rustica L.), a migratory passerine, in two years that differed in environmental condition, and the role of carotenoids in mediating arrival date. We show that male tail length, the main secondary sexual character, body condition, and hematocrit were negatively correlated with arrival date in the first year, indicating better quality of early arriving males. In the second year, better environmental conditions advanced arrival of the entire population by weeks. In this season we could show no relationship between arrival and tail length or body condition. Moreover, a lower value of sedimentation rate and a brighter colour of the red throat feathers indicated better health status of the population. Arrival date is a condition-dependent character in barn swallows, since we found high repeatability of arrival date, lower values of carotenoids in blood and a lower depletion of carotenoids in blood shortly after arrival in early arriving males. This suggests that early arriving males either use fewer antioxidants for free radical scavenging, or they have differential access to antioxidants.

AB Assessing the impact of management scenarii on multi-species multi-fleet fisheries requires spatially and seasonally explicit simulation tools. No such tools are currently available in fisheries science. This paper presents a software that evaluates the impact of management measures on the dynamics of a complex fishery. The simulation model is generic in order to be used for different types of fisheries. Existing knowledge about each fishery is stored in a database included in the software, and may be easily modified. This includes the parameters describing each population and each fishing activity. Furthermore, the software allows for flexibility in several model assumptions. Both management measures and behaviour of fishermen in reaction to these measures may be interactively designed through a Script language. The simulation tool thus enables one to compare the respective impacts of conventional management measures like catch and effort controls, and measures more recently advocated like marine protected areas.

AB We studied the establishment and inclusion of native and alien plant species in nature reserves in the Czech Republic. Our aim was to answer the following questions: Do young and old nature reserves contain the same proportion of invasive plant species? Does the time of their introduction affect their representation in these reserves? We obtained recent lists of vascular plant species for 302 reserves established since 1838 and designated the species as native or alien. We divided the latter category into archaeophytes and neophytes, introduced before and after 1500, respectively. The increase in the number of reserves and species was evaluated by inclusion curves. For inclusion curves describing an increase in the number of reserves, the estimated time of 50% inclusion indicated when half the reserves of a particular type were established. For inclusion curves describing an increase in the number of species, the estimated time of 50% inclusion indicated when half the species of a particular category (native species, all aliens, archaeophytes, neophytes), reported from the country, were included in the nature reserves. The forest and dry-grassland reserves were established earlier than those in wetlands and peat bogs, whereas humid-grassland reserves tended to be the most recently established. Half the native species were included significantly earlier ( after 25 years) than half of alien species (86 years), and half the neophytes were included later ( 143 years) than half the archaeophytes (31 years). Early reserves harbor a significantly lower number of alien species than those established later. These reserves include a higher proportion of the Czech Republic's native species and archaeophytes than of its neophytes. There was no difference in the relative rates of inclusion of native species, archaeophytes, and neophytes. However, the fact that the same inclusion rate applies to neophytes, a group with an increasing species pool, as to archaeophytes and native species, which both have constant species pools, suggests that natural vegetation in nature reserves is an effective barrier against the establishment of alien species. On a historical time scale, the early establishment of nature reserves in a given country decreases the probability that the reserve will be invaded by alien plants.

AB It has been theorized that photosynthetic radiation use efficiency (PhRUE) over the course of a day is constant for leaves throughout a canopy if leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic properties are adapted to local light so that canopy photosynthesis over a day is optimized. To test this hypothesis, 'daily' photosynthesis of individual leaves of Solanum melongena plants was calculated from instantaneous rates of photosynthesis integrated over the daylight hours. Instantaneous photosynthesis was estimated from the photosynthetic responses to photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR) and from the incident PAR measured on individual leaves during clear and overcast days. Plants were grown with either abundant or scarce N fertilization. Both net and gross daily photosynthesis of leaves were linearly related to daily incident PAR exposure of individual leaves, which implies constant PhRUE over a day throughout the canopy. The slope of these relationships (i.e. PhRUE) increased with N fertilization. When the relationship was calculated for hourly instead of daily periods, the regressions were curvilinear, implying that PhRUE changed with time of the day and incident radiation. Thus, linearity (i.e. constant PhRUE) was achieved only when data were integrated over the entire day. Using average PAR in place of instantaneous incident PAR increased the slope of the relationship between daily photosynthesis and incident PAR of individual leaves, and the regression became curvilinear. The slope of the relationship between daily cross photosynthesis and incident PAR of individual leaves increased for an overcast compared with a clear day, but the slope remained constant for net photosynthesis. This suggests that net PhRUE of all leaves (and thus of the whole canopy) may be constant when integrated over a day, not only when the incident PAR changes with depth in the canopy, but also when it varies on the same leaf owing to changes in daily incident PAR above the canopy. The slope of the relationship between daily net photosynthesis and incident PAR was also estimated from the photosynthetic light response curve of a leaf at the top of the canopy and from the incident PAR above the canopy, in place of that measured on individual leaves. The slope (i.e. net PhRUE) calculated in this simple way did not differ statistically from that calculated using data from individual leaves. (C) 2003 Annals of Botany Company.

AB Variation in seasonal time constraints and temperature along latitudinal gradients are expected to select for life history trait differentiation, but information about the relative importance of these factors in shaping patterns of divergence in embryonic traits remains sparse. We studied embryonic survival, growth and development rates in the common frog (Rana temporaria) along a 1,400-km latitudinal gradient across Sweden by raising embryos from four populations in the laboratory at seven temperatures (9degreesC, 12degreesC, 15degreesC, 18degreesC, 21degreesC, 24degreesC, 27degreesC). We found significant differences in mean values of all traits between the populations and temperature treatments, but this variation was not latitudinally ordered. In general, embryonic survival decreased at the two highest temperatures in all populations, but less so in the southernmost as compared to the other populations. The northernmost population developed slowest at the lowest temperature, while the two mid-latitude populations were slowest at the other temperatures. Hatchling size increased with increasing temperature especially in the two northern populations, whereas the two southern populations showed peak hatchling size at 15degreesC. Analyses of within-population genetic variation with a half-sib design revealed that there was significant additive genetic variation in all traits, and egg size-related maternal effects were important in the case of hatchling size. Overall, our results indicate that unlike larval growth and development, variation in embryonic development and growth in R. temporaria cannot be explained in terms of a latitudinal gradient in season length. While adaptation to a latitudinal variation in temperature might have contributed to the observed differentiation in embryonic performance, the effects of other, perhaps more local environmental. factors, seem to have overridden them in importance.

AB The role of natural hybridization and introgression as part of the evolutionary process is of increasing interest to zoologists, particularly as more examples of gene exchange among species are identified. We present mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data for Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma truncatum, and Hyalomma marginatum rufipes (Acari: Ixodidae) collected from one-humped camels in Ethiopia. These species are well differentiated morphologically and genetically; sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I gene indicates 10-14% divergence between the species. However, incongruence between morphology and the mtDNA phylogeny was observed, with multiple individuals of H. dromedarii and H. truncatum present on the same mtDNA lineage as H. marginatum rufipes. Thus, individuals with morphology of H. dromedarii and H. truncatum are indistinguishable from H. marginatum rufipes on the basis of mtDNA. Multiple copies of ITS-2 were subsequently cloned and sequenced for a subset of individuals from the mtDNA phylogeny, representing both 'normal' and 'putative hybrid' individuals. Very low sequence divergence (0.3%) was observed within 'normal' individuals of both H. dromedarii and H. truncatum relative to the I putative hybrid' individuals (6 and 2.7%, respectively). The pattern of intra-individual variation in ITS-2 within 'putative hybrid' individuals, particularly in H. dromedarii, strongly suggests that gene flow has occurred among these Hyalomma species, but no indication of this is given by the morphology of the individuals.

AB Plankton community structure and production was investigated along a freshwater-influenced Norwegian fjord system, from the innermost branch, across the sill, to more open waters. The water column shifted from being highly stratified, with a brackish surface layer (6 psu) separated from > 30 psu water by a strong pycnocline, to a more open system outside the front. The zooplankton community in the brackish surface layer was dominated by ciliates, heterotrophic dinoflagellates, the cladoceran Evadne nordmanni and the copepod Eurytemora affinis. In and below the pycnocline and off the sill the diversity of the zooplankton increased, and 20 copepod and 36 protozoan taxa were observed. Meso-zooplankton was sampled both with a WP-2 net (mesh size 200 mum) and with 10 1 Niskin bottles. The biomass from the net samples was only 35-72% compared to the estimates from the Niskin bottles. Especially copepod nauplii, Oithona spp. and Microsetella norvegica were severely underestimated. Calanus finmarchicus dominated the copepod community. However, the bottle sampling demonstrated that also Oithona spp. and M. norvegica contributed significantly to copepod biomass and production. Protozooplankton contributed with 54-87% of the total zooplankton production and of potential grazing along the fjord, stressing the importance of the smaller grazers in the food web. A simple modeling approach shows that overall exchange processes between the fjord and coastal waters and in-fjord production of copepods are equally important forces determining in-fjord copepod biomass. In the surface layer, however, only E. affinis, E. nordmanni and the protozooplankton had growth rates that could compensate for advective loss.

AB A diatom transfer function to infer epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) concentration was derived using surface sediment diatom data from 68 medium-sized (10-1000 ha) lakes in Southern Finland. Publicly available monitoring records were used in lake selection to avoid gradients caused by pH and humic substances. Constrained and partially constrained ordinations indicated that TP was an important variable influencing diatom assemblages. A long floristic gradient in relation to TP was also apparent and therefore an inference model was developed for TP using unimodal-based regression and calibration methods. The final model included 61 lakes with epilimnetic TP concentrations between 3 and 89 mug P l(-1), measured during the autumnal circulation period. It has a jackknifed-estimated root mean squared error of prediction of 0.16 log mug P l(-1), a maximum bias of 0.28 log mug P l(-1), and an r(j)(2)ack of 0.76.
   The model was tested in the presently eutrophic Lake Valkjarvi (epilimnetic [TP] 60-85 mug P l(-1)), located in Southern Finland. It successfully predicted the measured autumnal epilimnetic TP concentration for the past twenty years and the changes in inferred [TP] reflected disturbances known to have occurred before that time. The diatom-based inferences show that Lake Valkjarvi was oligo-mesotrophic as late as the 1930's and has become eutrophic because of nutrient inputs from agriculture and, especially, municipalities. However, epilimnetic TP concentration has not increased further.

AB Interspecific relationships of 4 dominant fish species of the Great Meteor seamount fish community (subtropical NE Atlantic, 30degreesN, 28.5degreesW), Macroramphosus spp. Lacepede 1803, Capros aper (L. 1758), Antigonia capros Lowe 1843 and Zenopsis conchifer (Lowe 1852) were analysed with respect to diet composition, habitat-dependent resource utilisation and niche overlap. For all 4 species, planktonic and micronektonic prey prevailed. In terms of the Relative Importance index (RI), the benthic share was 18.25 % RI for Macroramphosus spp., 19 % RI for C. aper and 20.38 % RI for A. capros. Prey of Z. conchifer consisted of 48.57 % RI mesopelagic and pelagic fishes and of 47.7 % RI bentho-pelagic fishes. For all fishes, a permutation test revealed significant selection of prey in plateau margins of the seamount. Unweighted and novel-weighted overlap indices combining prey composition, habitat use and prey utilisation within habitats revealed high overlap between the boarfishes A. capros and C. aper and smaller overlap between other pairs. The results are in support of the sound scattering layer interception hypothesis (Isaacs & Schwartzlose 1965), which implies: (1) primarily pelagic food utilisation for bentho-pelagic fishes; (2) increased habitat-dependent utilisation rates at locations of interception with the sound-scattering layer; (3) diel changes in utilisation rates due to availability of prey; (4) sufficient resource partitioning among species in order to avoid competitive exclusion.

AB Lichen community development was examined in a postfire chronosequence from lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud var. latifolia Engelm.) forests in the Omineca region of north-central British Columbia and in stands originating from logging in the early 1980s. Fire-origin stands showed dense regeneration of pine and widespread growth of acrocarpous mosses such as Polytrichum spp. As canopy thinning progressed, Cladonia spp. lichens initiated development at the forest floor surface. By 50-100 years after stand origin, Cladina mitis and Cladina rangiferina dominated at the forest floor surface, remaining at high cover values well into the second century of stand development. Late seral stages of stand development (approximately 150+ years) showed increasing basal area and canopy cover of lodgepole pine, with feathermoss mats (e.g., Pleurozium schreberi) replacing terrestrial lichens at the forest floor surface. Stand ordinations confirmed these groupings of species. Stand structural factors that correlate best with lichen mat development include tree density, basal area, and canopy cover. Changes in the leaf area index and associated litterfall loading appear to precipitate the replacement of terrestrial lichen mats in "old-growth" stands. Interestingly, this trend was reversed in mature stands where winter harvesting of trees removed canopy cover without disturbing the forest floor surface. Lichen cover in these sites, 15 years after harvest, exceeded that of comparably aged fire-origin stands. Summer harvesting (with a presumed greater disturbance of soils) did not trigger a similar rebound of lichen communities. Instead, vascular plants appeared to invade these sites, following a seral sequence different from that occurring in fire-origin stands.

AB The relationship between biodiversity and individual ecosystem processes is often asymptotic, saturating at relatively low levels, with some species contributing more strongly than others. This has cast doubt on arguments for conservation based on maintenance of the functioning of ecosystems. However, we argue that the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is an important additional argument for conservation for several reasons. (1) Although species differ in importance to ecosystem processes, we do not believe that this argues for preservation of just a few species for two reasons: first, it is nearly impossible to identify all species important to the numerous systems and processes on which humans depend; second, the important species themselves may depend on an unknown number of other species in their communities. (2) Arguments for conservation based on ecosystem functioning are complementary to other utilitarian, ethical and aesthetic justifications. No single reason will convince all people or protect all species, however the combination produces a strong case for conservation of biodiversity. (3) Even if the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is asymptotic at local spatial scales and in the short term, effects of biodiversity loss are likely to be important at larger temporal and spatial scales. (4) Initial arguments for the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning were largely based on a precautionary approach (points 1-3). However, we are now moving to a scientific position based on accumulating experimental evidence. The future challenge is the integration of this scientific research with policy.

   COMMUNITY; FIRE; INVASIBILITY; DISTURBANCE; PHOSPHORUS; DEPOSITION
AB Grasslands of the western United States and Canada are being converted to ecosystems that resemble "old fields," dominated in terms of percent cover or biomass by forb species, In particular, five species of the genus Centaurea (star thistle, diffuse, spotted, squarrose, and Russian knapweed) have invaded millions of hectares of western United States and Canadian grasslands. Centaurea species are fundamentally different from the preexisting dominant species and may exploit changes in resource availability to become established. We suspect that they then maintain dominance by preventing resources from returning to levels that favor the native species. Increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition, reduced fire frequency, and, possibly, direct and indirect fertilization resulting from cattle grazing appear to have reduced the historically strong nitrogen limitation to which native species of western grasslands are adapted, We suggest that the success of Centaurea species in dominating grasslands is explained by their ability to compete successfully for the neu, limiting resource or resources. Our preliminary evidence suggests that phosphorus limitation or a colimitation of phosphorus and water best explains the current dominance patterns.

AB On intertidal sandflats spatial patterns of benthic communities are influenced by biogenic habitat structures such as mussel beds or seagrass meadows. These structures represent ecological islands hosting a different and often more diverse and abundant community than surrounding sandflats. However, few studies have been carried out on tube aggregations of the polychaete Lanice conchilega, although its tube tops are conspicuous habitat features on European intertidal coasts with densities reaching several thousand per m(2).
   The aim of this study was to determine differences between benthic communities associated with tube aggregations and tube-free areas, and to investigate the longevity of community patterns around L. conchilega tubes. From 1995 to 2000, the L. conchilega population of an intertidal sandflat off the Eastern Friesian coast, was sampled annually. Multivariate analysis showed significant differences between the L. conchilega and reference communities. Species diversity,and abundance were higher among tube aggregations. This pattern developed rapidly after L. conchilega colonisation but was also readily destroyed, mainly due to dynamic changes of the L. conchilega population.
   Five species of benthic macrofauna were exclusively found among L. conchilega tubes, and four species were more abundant in tube aggregations than in reference areas. Only one species, the polychaete Aphelochaeta marioni, was found in lower numbers in dense L. conchilega aggregations.
   Hence, it is concluded that L. conchilega is a habitat engineer, which alters the composition of the benthic community and contributes to its patchy distribution pattern. However, this pattern is dynamic and ephemeral. Effects of tube aggregations depend on the population dynamic of L. conchilega itself and the species composition in the surrounding sands.

AB Since many wood-living forest species are influenced by the dynamics of coarse woody debris (CWD), information about the spatial pattern of CWD under natural conditions is essential to understand species distributions. In this we examined the spatial pattern of downed logs and wood-decaying fungi in an old-growth boreal Picea abies forest in northwestern Sweden that is governed by gap-phase dynamics. The spatial pattern of wood-decaying fungi was studied to draw conclusions about species dispersal abilities. A total of 684 logs with a diameter > 10 cm were mapped and analysed with Ripley's K-function. The distribution of all logs taken together displayed a significant aggregated pattern up to 45 m. The different decay stages also deviated from random expectations. Fairly fresh logs and logs in the middle decay stage were clumped up to about 25 and 35 in respectively, and late decayed logs aggregated up to 95 in. Logs with diameters from 10-29 cm were aggregated up to 25 in, whereas logs greater than or equal to 30cm diameter were randomly distributed. The result suggests that gap-dynamics do have an impact on the spatial pattern of the CWD, creating fine-scale clumping. The random distribution of large logs may result from the slightly regular spacing of large living trees. The spatial patterns of 16 species (n > 20) of wood-decaying fungi were analysed with Ripley's K-function. Three patterns were aggregated, for Gloeophyllum sepiarium, Coniophora olivacea and Vesiculomyces citrinus. These results indicate that the distribution of most species at the stand level is generally not influenced by dispersal limitations.

TI A general model of site-dependent population regulation:
   population-level regulation without individual-level interactions
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID HABITAT; DYNAMICS; DENSITY; SIZE
AB In this paper, we use a modeling approach to explore the population regulatory consequences of individual choices for where to breed in heterogeneous environments. In contrast to standard models, we focus on individuals that interact only indirectly through their choices of breeding sites (i.e., individuals preempt the occupation of a breeding site by others when they choose to breed there). We consider the consequences of individuals choosing breeding sites either randomly or sequentially from best to worst. Our analysis shows that average per-capita fecundity of the population is independent of the number of occupied breeding sites if individuals choose sites at random and that variation in average per-capita fecundity increases as population size declines. In contrast, if individuals choose breeding sites sequentially from highest to lowest quality, then as population size increases average per-capita fecundity declines and variation in average per-capita fecundity increases. Consequently, aggregate population-level demographic rates can change in ways that generate population regulation, even when change in population size does not change the demographic performance of any individual on any particular breeding site. However, such regulation occurs only when individuals make adaptive choices of where to breed. Because variation in average per-capita fecundity decreases when population size declines, populations regulated in a site-dependent manner should be much less susceptible to the vicissitudes of small population size than those which choose breeding sites at random.

AB Broad-scale anthropogenic disturbances that reduce the density of epifauna and homogenise surficial sediments can have important consequences for seafloor biodiversity, We investigated the habitat structure and macrofaunal diversity of relatively simple soft-sediment habitats over a number of spatial scales (cm to km) to identify the role of habitat structure in influencing macrobenthic diversity and to assess the validity of using habitat structure as a surrogate measure for biodiversity. We sampled 10 locations with differences in habitat structure using a sampling design that nested macrobenthic core samples within videoed transects of the seafloor. This allowed us to determine relationships between observable habitat structure and macrobenthic diversity at a number of spatial scales. We characterised elements of habitat structure based on direct counts of surficial sediment characteristics and the presence of other immobile features, many of which were biogenic in origin. We also used multivariate measures (the relative multivariate dispersion, the mean and range of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity along the transects) to characterise habitat structure at the transect scale. We developed regression models based on measures of habitat structure that explained 74 to 86% of the variance in macrobenthic diversity. This result suggests that removal of habitat structure in relatively low-structure soft-sediment systems will significantly decrease their biodiversity, and consequently that of the wider marine ecosystem.

AB Over 100 allometric regressions on rare [kg kg(-1) d(-1) = d(-1)], age [d] and density [kg km(-2)] parameters often used in ecological models were collected in a literature review. For each parameter, typical coefficients and exponents that covered most of the correlations found were selected. The parameters were checked for consistency by comparing them to each other, e.g. mortality versus age and to independent data, e.g. production and respiration rate constants versus production efficiency.
   Exponents for consumption, production and respiration rates on the one hand and slopes for maturation. average and maximum age on the other, scale to size with an exponent of the same magnitude but opposite sign. Most values are between +/- 0.25 and +/- 0.33. No consistent differences between parameters and species were found.
   Coefficients for production and respiration were largely consistent with those for ingestion and with independent data on assimilation and production efficiencies. The same was concluded for production versus mortality. for mortality versus age as well as maximum versus average production and consumption. Warm-blooded animals consume, produce and respite at rates about 10 times higher than equally sized cold-blooded species. The reverse uas noted for age and possibly density.
   Population density of individual species and biota density of geometric size classes are nearly independent of size for regressions that span a wide size range. The coefficients for density vary up to two orders of magnitude. depending on local conditions.
   Most allometric regressions reported apply to aquatic invertebrates or terrestrial birds and mammals of the biophageous food chain. Yet, the rate and age regressions that include other species do not indicate substantial deviations for bacteria, micro-and macrophytes and for terrestrial (saprophageous) invertebrates.
   The set of typical values derived may facilitate parameter estimation for generic models. For specific models, the regressions collected in the literature review may provide initial values for parameters.

AB 1. The relationship between fish and benthic invertebrate communities in wadeable streams in southern Ontario, Canada, was examined using three independent and spatially distinct data sets.
   2. Associations between fish and benthos were always significant when benthos were identified to family and often at the level of phylum. Identification to genus improved the strength of the fish-benthos association in one case. In contrast, identification to species did not improve the strength of the fish-benthos association. Associations between benthos and fish were weaker for one study utilizing a 'rapid' bio-assessment protocol involving field sorting and identification, and a second study which utilized winter benthic collections.
   3. In two surveys, stream temperatures were important to the distributions of both fish and benthos, while in a third survey, fish and benthos were primarily influenced by stream size. In all three studies, fish and benthos were associated with similar suites of environmental variables, suggesting that the fish-benthos associations in these streams was driven by corresponding environmental tolerances.
   4. Although there was significant variation in the strength of the fish-benthos association which could be attributed to differences in sampling methodologies, the findings from the present study confirm that stream fish and benthos are significantly associated. Therefore, surveys of benthos can be used to make inferences on the condition of fish community composition.

AB Based on variation in ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA a method was developed to identify wood-inhabiting fungi without being dependent on fruit body formation or direct identification of mycelia isolated from wood. A reference library containing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles of 39 fungal species was constructed by digesting the amplified ITS region with three endonucleases (Cfo1, Hinf1 and Mbo1). To test the method, early succession of wood-inhabiting fungi was studied in an unmanaged Picea abies forest in Sweden. Fungal species that were present in wood in and at the border of two canopy gaps and a randomly chosen transect of the forest were identified. Bore core samples were taken from 78 standing trees and snags at two gaps and from 30 standing trees positioned in the closed stand. DNA was extracted both directly from wood and from mycelia isolated from wood. Fifteen samples from wood or mycelia from wood were identified as Armillaria borealis, Coniophora arida, Fomitopsis pinicola, Heterobasidion annosum or Resinicium bicolor by comparing RFLP profiles.

AB We performed two glasshouse experiments to determine whether the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis reduces the intensity of intraspecific competition at low concentrations of available phosphorus (P), and whether this effect is modified by a reduction in light intensity. In the first experiment, Trifolium subterraneum cv. Mt. Barker was grown at different densities in controlled conditions of light and temperature, and half of the pots were inoculated with spores of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Gigaspora margarita. In the second experiment, the plants were grown in similar controlled conditions but the light intensity received by half of the pots was reduced by >50%. The biomass and P content of individual mycorrhizal plants and the biomass response to mycorrhizal infection were drastically reduced as plant density increased. The effects of density on percentage infection, shoot and root P concentrations, and root: shoot ratios were inconsistent. Generally reduction in light intensity did not alter these effects. Mycorrhizal symbiosis increased intraspecific competition intensity thorough an increase in the availability of soil P. This increase in competition was reflected in the greater size inequality of low density mycorrhizal treatments. Our results emphasize that the main effects of mycorrhizas at the individual level cannot be expected to be apparent at the population level, because they are overridden by density-dependent processes.

AB Rates of maximum food consumption and growth were determined for immature mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi (47.2-540.2 g) and Chinese snakehead Channa argus (45.0-546.2 g) at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. The relationship between maximum rate of food consumption (C-max), body weight (W) and temperature (T) was described by the multiple regression equations: lnC(max) = -4.880 + 0.597 lnW+0.284T - 0.0048T(2) for the mandarin fish, and lnC(max)= -6.718 + 0.522 lnW+0.440T-0.0077T(2) for the Chinese snakehead. The optimum temperature for consumption was 29.6 degrees C for the mandarin fish and 28.6 degrees C for the Chinese snakehead. The relationship between growth rate (G), body weight and temperature was ln(G+0.25)= - 0.439 - 0.500 lnW+0.270T - 0.0046T(2) for the mandarin fish, and ln(G+0.25)= - 6.150+ (0.175 - 0.026T) lnW+0.571T - 0.0078T(2) for the Chinese snakehead. The weight exponent in the growth-weight relationship was -0.83 for the mandarin fish, but decreased with increasing temperature for the Chinese snakehead. The optimum temperature for growth was 29.3 degrees C for the mandarin fish, but tended to decrease with increasing weight for the Chinese snakehead, being 30.3 degrees C for a 45-g fish, and 26.1 degrees C for a 550-g fish.

AB Empirical relationships between body size and temperature, and daily PIE of temperate freshwater zooplankton species were derived from the literature. Body size explained 81% of the variation in daily PIE of zooplankton at temperatures less than or equal to 10 degrees C and 48% at temperatures >10 degrees C. The two relationships did not differ in slope but significantly differed in elevation. The regression models were then applied to zooplankton samples collected from a midlake station in Lake Ontario to predict zooplankton seasonal production. Production estimates from the regression models, when compared with estimates from the egg ratio method for the same data set, were similar for cladoceran species, four and 10 times higher for two copepod species, and two times higher for total zooplankton production. In general, these differences are within the range expected based on previous studies that compared different production models. The regression models can provide quick, independent estimates of zooplankton production to complement estimates based on traditional, species-specific methods. Furthermore, the models can be used in conjunction with automated synoptic instruments, such as optical plankton counters and temperature probes, to provide production estimates that better represent large, complex systems such as the Great Lakes.

AB Nitrogen fertilization increases yield of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) but little knowledge exists on the effect of N fertilization on the growth processes of field-grown timothy. The objective of this study was to analyze the growth of timothy fertilized with increasing rates of N in spring and summer and, in particular, to determine the relative importance of radiation interception and radiation-use efficiency in explaining the differences in shoot growth caused by N deficiency. In two separate experiments conducted in spring 1993 and summer 1994, shoot growth, leaf area development, radiation interception and radiation-use efficiency of timothy grown with four N rates (0, 70, 140 and 210 kg N ha(-1) in 1993; 0, 60, 120 and 180 kg N ha(-1) in 1994) were determined using weekly sampling. Maximum leaf photosynthesis was also measured. The maximum shoot growth and LAI were reached with 140 kg N ha(-1) in the spring of 1993 and 120 kg N ha(-1) in the summer of 1994. The rates of N fertilization required to produce these maximum values of shoot growth were those that resulted in shoot N concentration equal to or greater than the optimal N concentration. The concept of an optimum N concentration was therefore useful in identifying situations of N deficiencies. When no N was applied, the growth rates were 32;and 33% of the maximum growth rates in spring and summer, respectively. The impact of the N deficiency was greater on RUE than on cumulative intercepted PAR. When no N was applied, the RUE and cumulative intercepted PAR were respectively 45 and 61% of their maximum values in spring, and 52% and 80% of their maximum values in summer. A general and synthetic expression of the effect of crop N concentration on shoot growth was developed using the concept of an optimal N concentration.

TI Application of fragmentation and variegation models to epigaeic
   invertebrates in South Africa
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Landscape fragmentation restricts certain species to remnant patches of vegetation within a matrix of less favorable habitat conditions. The concept of variegation is a modification of the fragmentation model, in which the landscape elements are seen as a fuzzy-edged mosaic, resulting in differential filtration of species across them. Each species responds to a landscape's pattern in its own particular way, which may not coincide with human visual perception of the landscape pattern. We tested the two extremes of the fragmentation and variegation model (totally discontinuous, fragmented distribution versus continuous, and variegated distribution) using epigaeic macroarthropods in South Africa as a model. The results suggest that the Blattodea, Hemiptera, and Diptera are the most stenotopic taxa, generally restricted to remnant patches of vegetation and highly negatively affected by fragmentation. In contrast, the Hymenoptera, Arachnida, and Orthoptera were generally more cosmopolitan and were distributed regardless of obvious landscape boundaries. All the orders contained at least some species that tended to eurytopy and others that were more stenotopic, illustrating that the landscape pattern should be viewed at the species level (and perhaps even a particular life stage) rather than at higher taxonomic levels. Although these results tend to favor the concept of variegation, some species do respond to the landscape pattern as seen through human eyes. To maximize biodiversity there should be rotational management of edges coupled with encouragement of various stages of secondary succession. Gradual rather than sharp ecotones should be established. Also, because generalized corridor management is utopian, wide corridors with biotype ''stepping stones'' are probably the best option.

AB The effects of hydraulic disturbances on the impact of two predatory benthic invertebrates on their prey were examined in a stream at two distinct spatial scales. At the scale of small habitat patches (0.0625 m(2)), hydraulic patch type was an important determinant of the microdistribution of prey and predators. Prey abundances were similar across all patch types at baseflow, but local densities were higher in patches identified as low-flow refugia after periods of high and fluctuating flow. The microdistribution pattern of predatory larvae of a caddisfly, Plectrocnemia conspersa, was similar to that of its prey, whereas predatory larvae of an alderfly, Sialis fuliginosa, did not shift their microdistribution significantly with discharge and were always most abundant in low-flow refugia. There was little evidence of an aggregative response of predators with prey, even though both predators and prey are mobile. Both predator species showed similar patch-specific patterns of per capita consumption rates: uniform consumption-rates across hydraulic patch types at low and moderate flows, but highest in flow refugia during high flows. Species-specific patterns, however, were apparent in the magnitude and direction of differences between consumption rates during disturbance events, and in comparable patches at base flow: At high flow, consumption rates for P. conspersa were exaggerated (3.9 times higher) in flow refugia but ''at par'' in other patches; for S. fuliginosa they were ''at par'' in flow refugia but reduced in other patches (up to 3.3. times lower). These differences may be related to species-specific foraging behaviours (search vs ambush predators) and the influence of prey movements on feeding success. Using the patch-scale results only, it is difficult to predict the effects of physical disturbance on predation intensity at the larger scales of whole habitats, populations or communities. At the large scale (>200 m(2)), net predator impacts were estimated over the stream reach, using a spatially explicit model that accounts, in an additive way, for habitat heterogeneity and patch-specific responses of predators and prey. The relationship between predator impact over the whole reach and hydraulic disturbance differed for the two predators. The predator impact of S. fuliginosa decreased with increasing hydraulic disturbance, as predicted by the harsh-benign hypothesis. There was no directional trend for P. conspersa, however, and maximum predator impact may occur at intermediate disturbance levels. For the prey community in this stream, predation pressure from S. fuliginosa appears to fluctuate directly with the discharge hydrograph, whereas predation from P. conspersa may be more persistent. Flow refugia may play a dual role in the sructure of stream communities by preventing catastrophic mortality of animals (predators and prey) from physical forces during disturbances, and by maintaining (or perhaps increasing) predation pressure. Summing the effects of species interactions in small habitat patches to the larger scale of a whole stream reach indicates that the scale of approach influences the observed patterns and their implied underlying process.

AB We examined how condition (weight at length) of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss varied in relation to availability of drifting invertebrates and temperature at two locations over four seasons in the Green River, Utah. Food availability (daytime drift density) varied more than 17-fold across sites and seasons, and rainbow trout experienced an 11 degrees C range in mean monthly temperature. Both rainbow trout gut fullness and condition increased as joint, nonlinear functions of increasing food availability and increasing temperature. Variation in condition decreased with fish size, although condition of intermediate sized fish was most strongly related to variation in food and temperature. Observed relationships between rainbow trout condition, drift abundance, and temperature were qualitatively consistent with bioenergetic models that predict fish growth should vary as a joint function of food and temperature. However, the inferred temperature optima for rainbow trout seemed to be significantly higher than predicted. Our results support a growing body of evidence that stream trout may be frequently food-limited in nature.

AB 1 A metapopulation neighbourhood model of an annual plant species in a harsh environment is derived. It includes the effects of seed survival, dormancy, competition, dispersal, spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and stochastic local extinctions.
   2 The model contained the following assumptions: (i) the time step is 1 year; (ii) competition is density-dependent via a Hassell-type submodel; (iii) each local population is regulated separately within a hexagonal cell, 1 m across, and the cells form a tessellated array; (iv) dispersal is from a parent cell to its neighbours and declines exponentially with distance; (v) the harshness of the environment is a value set for each cell; spatial and temporal heterogeneity are introduced by altering this value; (vi) each local population is rounded to give an integer number of individuals at the end of each generation so that those with density below unity may become extinct, with a probability inversely proportional to density.
   3 In spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous harsh environments with moderate levels of density-dependent competition, all populations persisted and dispersal aided metapopulation growth when the population growth rate was sufficiently large. When the population growth rate was smaller, dispersal increased the risk of, and speeded up the time to, metapopulation extinction. Metapopulation growth was faster when the heterogeneity was at a larger-scale spatial pattern.
   4 Temporal heterogeneity had an adverse effect when added to the existing spatial heterogeneity; strongly dispersing metapopulations were affected only slightly, while those with only moderate or no dispersal became extinct. The more frequently the environment changed, the greater was the probability of extinction.
   5 The model simulations in 2-4 were repeated for more-severe density-dependence. In the spatially homogeneous environment dispersal prevented metapopulation extinction, while lack of dispersal encouraged it. Dispersal aided metapopulation growth in the spatially heterogeneous unchanging environment. The addition of temporal heterogeneity had little effect on populations with strong dispersal but the effect on the other metapopulations was catastrophic.

AB 1. The effects of management were determined by comparing pairs of adjacent cut and uncut reed (Phragmites australis) beds at 12 sites, and by a randomized block experiment at a further site in which plots of reed were cut, burnt or left unmanaged.
   2. Most plant species were more abundant in the managed reed beds than the unmanaged ones, and only three were more abundant in the unmanaged beds. Several were more common in burnt than cut plots.
   3. Reeds were shorter and at higher densities where cut or burnt than where unmanaged. The proportion of reed flowering stems was highest in burnt plots.
   4. The rate of decomposition of reed leaf litter at the experimental site was determined by weight loss from litter bags and leaf bundles. There was no difference in weight loss and no difference in associated soil invertebrates between treatments.
   5. However, weight loss was inversely related to water depth in the plots and after 6 weeks correlated with the number of Oligochaetes, Psychodid larvae and some Coleoptera.
   6. Cutting and burning positively affected floristic diversity and most marsh plants, but had no effect on the rate of litter breakdown.

AB Understanding the likely future impacts of biological invasions is crucial yet highly challenging given the multiple relevant environmental, socio-economic and societal contexts and drivers. In the absence of quantitative models, methods based on expert knowledge are the best option for assessing future invasion trajectories. Here, we present an expert assessment of the drivers of potential alien species impacts under contrasting scenarios and socioecological contexts through the mid-21st century. Based on responses from 36 experts in biological invasions, moderate (20%-30%) increases in invasions, compared to the current conditions, are expected to cause major impacts on biodiversity in most socioecological contexts. Three main drivers of biological invasions-transport, climate change and socio-economic change-were predicted to significantly affect future impacts of alien species on biodiversity even under a best-case scenario. Other drivers (e.g. human demography and migration in tropical and subtropical regions) were also of high importance in specific global contexts (e.g. for individual taxonomic groups or biomes). We show that some best-case scenarios can substantially reduce potential future impacts of biological invasions. However, rapid and comprehensive actions are necessary to use this potential and achieve the goals of the Post-2020 Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

AB Purpose of Review Despite the rapidly increasing use of resilience indices to analyze responses of trees and forests to disturbance events, there is so far no common framework to apply and interpret these indices for different purposes. Therefore, this review aims to identify and discuss various shortcomings and pitfalls of commonly used resilience indices and to develop recommendations for a more robust and standardized procedure with a particular emphasis on drought events. Recent Findings Growth-based resilience indices for drought responses of trees are widely used but some important drawbacks and limitations related to their application may lead to spurious results or misinterpretation of observed patterns. The limitations include (a) the inconsistency regarding the selection and characterization of drought events and the climatic conditions in the pre- and post-drought period and (b) the calculation procedure of growth-based resilience indices. We discuss alternative options for metrics, which, when used in concert, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of drought responses in cases where common growth-based resilience indices are likely to fail. In addition, we propose a new analytical framework, the "line of full resilience," that integrates the three most commonly used resilience indices and show how this framework can be used for comparative drought tolerance assessments such as rankings of different tree species or treatments. The suggested approach could be used to harmonize quantifications of tree growth resilience to drought and it may thus facilitate systematic reviews and development of the urgently needed evidence base to identify suitable management options or tree species and provenances to adapt forests for changing climatic conditions.

AB Grasslands cover one third of the earth's terrestrial surface and are mainly used for livestock production. The usage type, use intensity and condition of grasslands are often unclear. Remote sensing enables the analysis of grassland production and management on large spatial scales and with high temporal resolution. Despite growing numbers of studies in the field, remote sensing applications in grassland biomes are underrepresented in literature and less streamlined compared to other vegetation types. By reviewing articles within research on satellite-based remote sensing of grassland production traits and management, we describe and evaluate methods and results and reveal spatial and temporal patterns of existing work. In addition, we highlight research gaps and suggest research opportunities. The focus is on managed grasslands and pastures and special emphasize is given to the assessment of studies on grazing intensity and mowing detection based on earth observation data. Grazing and mowing highly influence the production and ecology of grassland and are major grassland management types. In total, 253 research articles were reviewed. The majority of these studies focused on grassland production traits and only 80 articles were about grassland management and use intensity. While the remote sensing-based analysis of grassland production heavily relied on empirical relationships between ground-truth and satellite data or radiation transfer models, the used methods to detect and investigate grassland management differed. In addition, this review identified that studies on grassland production traits with satellite data often lacked including spatial management information into the analyses. Studies focusing on grassland management and use intensity mostly investigated rather small study areas with homogeneous intensity levels among the grassland parcels. Combining grassland production estimations with management information, while accounting for the variability among grasslands, is recommended to facilitate the development of large-scale continuous monitoring and remote sensing grassland products, which have been rare thus far.

AB The severity of plant diseases, traditionally the proportion of the plant tissue exhibiting symptoms, is a key quantitative variable to know for many diseases and is prone to error. Good quality disease severity data should be accurate (close to the true value). Earliest quantification of disease severity was by visual estimates. Sensor-based image analysis including visible spectrum and hyperspectral and multispectral sensors are established technologies that promise to substitute, or complement visual ratings. Indeed, these technologies have measured disease severity accurately under controlled conditions but are yet to demonstrate their full potential for accurate measurement under field conditions. Sensor technology is advancing rapidly, and artificial intelligence may help overcome issues for automating severity measurement under hyper-variable field conditions. The adoption of appropriate scales, training, instruction and aids (standard area diagrams) has contributed to improved accuracy of visual estimates. The apogee of accuracy for visual estimation is likely being approached, and any remaining increases in accuracy are likely to be small. Due to automation and rapidity, sensor-based measurement offers potential advantages compared with visual estimates, but the latter will remain important for years to come. Mobile, automated sensor-based systems will become increasingly common in controlled conditions and, eventually, in the field for measuring plant disease severity for the purpose of research and decision making.

AB The observed architecture of ecological and socio-economic networks differs significantly from that of random networks. From a network science standpoint, non-random structural patterns observed in real networks call for an explanation of their emergence and an understanding of their potential systemic consequences. This article focuses on one of these patterns: nestedness. Given a network of interacting nodes, nestedness can be described as the tendency for nodes to interact with subsets of the interaction partners of better-connected nodes. Known since more than 80 years in biogeography, nestedness has been found in systems as diverse as ecological mutualistic systems, world trade, inter-organizational relations, among many others. This review article focuses on three main pillars: the existing methodologies to observe nestedness in networks; the main theoretical mechanisms conceived to explain the emergence of nestedness in ecological and socio-economic networks; the implications of a nested topology of interactions for the stability and feasibility of a given interacting system. We survey results from variegated disciplines, including statistical physics, graph theory, ecology, and theoretical economics. Nestedness was found to emerge both in bipartite networks and, more recently, in unipartite ones; this review is the first comprehensive attempt to unify both streams of studies, usually disconnected from each other. We believe that the truly interdisciplinary endeavor - while rooted in a complex systems perspective - may inspire new models and algorithms whose realm of application will undoubtedly transcend disciplinary boundaries.

AB Personality-dependent space use and movement might be crucially influencing ecological interactions, giving way to individual niche specialization. This new approach challenges classical niche theory with potentially great ecological consequences, but so far has only scarce empirical support. Here, we investigated if and how consistent inter-individual differences in behavior predict space use and movement patterns in free-ranging bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and thereby contribute to individual niche specialization. Individuals were captured and marked from three different subpopulations in North-East Germany. Inter-individual differences in boldness and exploration were quantified via repeated standardized tests directly in the field after capture. Subsequently, space use and movement patterns of a representative sample of the behavioral variation (n=21 individuals) were monitored via automated VHF telemetry for a period of four days, yielding on average 384 locations per individual. Bolder individuals occupied larger home ranges and core areas (estimated via kernel density analyses), moved longer distances, spatially overlapped with fewer conspecifics and preferred different microhabitats based on vegetation cover compared to shyer individuals. We found evidence for personality-dependent space use, movement, and occupation of individual spatial niches in bank voles. Thus, besides dietary niche specialization also spatial dimensions of ecological niches vary among individuals within populations, which may have important consequences for ecological interactions within- and between species.

AB Land-use change pushes biodiversity into human-modified landscapes, where native ecosystems are surrounded by anthropic land covers (ALCs). Yet, the ability of species to use these emerging covers remains poorly understood. We quantified the use of ALCs by primates worldwide, and analyzed species' attributes that predict such use. Most species use secondary forests and tree plantations, while only few use human settlements. ALCs are used for foraging by at least 86 species with an important conservation outcome: those that tolerate heavily modified ALCs are 26% more likely to have stable or increasing populations than the global average for all primates. There is no phylogenetic signal in ALCs use. Compared to all primates on Earth, species using ALCs are less often threatened with extinction, but more often diurnal, medium or large-bodied, not strictly arboreal, and habitat generalists. These findings provide valuable quantitative information for improving management practices for primate conservation worldwide.

AB Determining the species compositions of local assemblages is a prerequisite to understanding how anthropogenic disturbances affect biodiversity. However, biodiversity measurements often remain incomplete due to the limited efficiency of sampling methods. This is particularly true in freshwater tropical environments that host rich fish assemblages, for which assessments are uncertain and often rely on destructive methods. Developing an efficient and nondestructive method to assess biodiversity in tropical freshwaters is highly important. In this study, we tested the efficiency of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess the fish diversity of 39 Guianese sites. We compared the diversity and composition of assemblages obtained using traditional and metabarcoding methods. More than 7,000 individual fish belonging to 203 Guianese fish species were collected by traditional sampling methods, and similar to 17 million reads were produced by metabarcoding, among which similar to 8 million reads were assigned to 148 fish taxonomic units, including 132 fish species. The two methods detected a similar number of species at each site, but the species identities partially matched. The assemblage compositions from the different drainage basins were better discriminated using metabarcoding, revealing that while traditional methods provide a more complete but spatially limited inventory of fish assemblages, metabarcoding provides a more partial but spatially extensive inventory. eDNA metabarcoding can therefore be used for rapid and large-scale biodiversity assessments, while at a local scale, the two approaches are complementary and enable an understanding of realistic fish biodiversity.

AB It has been shown that soil management under organic farming can enhance soil organic carbon, thereby mitigating atmospheric greenhouse gas increases, but until now quantitative evaluations based on long term experiments are scarce, especially under Mediterranean conditions. Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content were examined in response to organic management with cover crops in a Mediterranean citrus plantation using 21 years of survey data. Soil organic carbon increase was more apparent 5 years after a land management change suggesting that, for citrus plantations on Mediterranean conditions, studies should be longer than five years in duration. Soil organic carbon sequestration rate did not significantly change during the 21 years of observation, with values ranging from -1.10 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) to 1.89 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). After 21 years, 61 Mg CO2 ha(-1) were sequestered in long-lived soil C pools. These findings demonstrate that organic management is an effective strategy to restore or increase SOC content in Mediterranean citrus systems.

AB Despite considerable research demonstrating that biodiversity increases productivity in forests and regulates herbivory and pathogen damage, there remain gaps in our understanding of the shape, magnitude, and generality of these biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships. Here, we review findings from TreeDivNet, a global network of 25 tree diversity experiments, on relationships between levels of biodiversity and (a) tree growth and survival and (b) damage to trees from pests and pathogens. Tree diversity often improved the survival and above- and belowground growth of young trees. The mechanistic bases of the diversity effects on tree growth and survival include both selection effects (i.e., an increasing impact of particular species in more species-rich communities) and complementary effects (e.g. related to resource differentiation and facilitation). Plant traits and abiotic stressors may mediate these relationships. Studies of the responses of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivory and pathogen damage have demonstrated that trees in more diverse experimental plots may experience more, less, or similar damage compared to conspecific trees in less diverse plots. Documented mechanisms producing these patterns include changes in concentration, frequency, and apparency of hosts; herbivore and pathogen diet breadth; the spatial scale of interactions; and herbivore and pathogen regulation by natural enemies. Our review of findings from TreeDivNet indicates that tree diversity experiments are extending BEF research across systems and scales, complementing previous BEF work in grasslands by providing opportunities to use remote sensing and spectral approaches to study BEF dynamics, integrate belowground and aboveground approaches, and trace the consequences of tree physiology for ecosystem functioning. This extension of BEF research into tree-dominated systems is improving ecologists' capacity to understand the mechanistic bases behind BEF relationships. Tree diversity experiments also present opportunities for novel research. Since experimental tree diversity plantations enable measurements at tree, neighbourhood and plot level, they allow for explicit consideration of temporal and spatial scales in BEF dynamics. Presently, most TreeDivNet experiments have run for less than ten years. Given the longevity of trees, exciting results on BEF relationships are expected in the future.

AB In psychology, mixed-effects models and latent-curve models are both widely used to explore growth over time. Despite this widespread popularity, some confusion remains regarding the overlap of these different approaches. Recent articles have shown that the two modeling frameworks are mathematically equivalent in many cases, which is often interpreted to mean that one's choice of modeling framework is merely a matter of personal preference. However, some important differences in estimation and specification can lead to the models producing very different results when implemented in software. Thus, mathematical equivalence does not necessarily equate to practical equivalence in all cases. In this article, we discuss these two common approaches to growth modeling and highlight contexts in which the choice of the modeling framework (and, consequently, the software) can directly impact the model estimates, or in which certain analyses can be facilitated in one framework over the other. We show that, unless the data are pristine, with a large sample size, linear or polynomial growth, and no missing data, and unless the participants have the same number of measurements collected at the same set of time points, one framework is often more advantageous to adopt. We provide several empirical examples to illustrate these situations, as well as ample software code so that researchers can make informed decisions regarding which framework will be the most beneficial and most straightforward for their research interests.

AB Drought impacts on phloem transport have attracted attention only recently, despite the well-established, and empirically verified theories on drought impacts on water transport in plants in general. This is because studying phloem transport is challenging. Phloem tissue is relatively small and delicate, and it has often been assumed not to be impacted by drought, or having insignificant impact on plant function or survival compared to the xylem. New evidence, however, suggests that drought responses of the phloem might hold the key for predicting plant survival time during drought or revival capacity after drought. This review summarizes current theories and empirical evidence on how drought might impact phloem transport, and evaluates these findings in relation to plant survival during drought.

AB Although it has been established that there is a strong geographical component to conflicts, previous studies on Protected Area (PA) conflicts have tended to focus on assessing the underlying causes of PA conflicts without considering how these conflicts vary across development contexts. Our review therefore assessed the similarities and differences that characterise PA conflicts in developing and developed countries with the view to drawing the implications of the findings for management practice. We reviewed a total of 65 publications from an initial pool of 516 drawn from biological, ecological, social sciences as well as an emerging interdisciplinary literature in conservation conflict studies from 1993 to 2016. Results of this literature review indicate that: 1) the types of PA conflict, why they occur, where they occur and how they are managed varied between developed and developing countries and were determined by geographical location and specific socio-economic and cultural contexts; 2) while PA conflicts in developing countries were primarily driven by impacts on livelihoods, PA conflicts in developed countries were driven by social considerations including emotional, recreational and cultural values people attached to PAs; and 3) conflict management strategies that promoted participation of other stakeholders including local people in PA management and provided economic incentives to local people promoted cooperation and fostered the meeting of conservation goals while conflict management strategies which employed deterrent strategies such as guards, fencing and policing especially in developing countries often resulted in resentment and sometimes led to the escalation of the conflicts. Conflict management strategies must therefore take into consideration the differences in the context within which conflicts develop at various locations to inform the specific conflict management strategies to be applied.

AB Biodiversity loss can heavily affect the functioning of ecosystems, and improving our understanding of how ecosystems respond to biodiversity decline is one of the main challenges in ecology(1-4). Several important aspects of the longer-term effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystems remain unresolved, including how these effects depend on environmental context(5-7). Here we analyse data from an across-ecosystem biodiversity manipulation experiment that, to our knowledge, represents the world's longest-running experiment of this type. This experiment has been set up on 30 lake islands in Sweden that vary considerably in productivity and soil fertility owing to differences in fire history(8,9). We tested the effects of environmental context on how plant species loss affected two fundamental community attributes-plant community biomass and temporal variability-over 20 years. In contrast to findings from artificially assembled communities(10-12), we found that the effects of species loss on community biomass decreased over time; this decrease was strongest on the least productive and least fertile islands. Species loss generally also increased temporal variability, and these effects were greatest on the most productive and most fertile islands. Our findings highlight that the ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss are not constant across ecosystems and that understanding and forecasting these consequences necessitates taking into account the overarching role of environmental context.

AB Microorganisms are the main drivers shaping the functioning and equilibrium of all ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling, primary production, litter decomposition, and multi-trophic interactions. Knowledge about the microbial assemblies in specific ecological niches is integral to understanding the assemblages interact and function the function, and becomes essential when the microbiota intersects with human activities, such as protecting crops against pests and diseases. Metabarcoding has proven to be a valuable tool and has been widely used for characterizing the microbial diversity of different environments and has been utilized in many research endeavors. Here we summarize the current status of metabarcoding technologies, the advantages and challenges in utilizing this technique, and how this pioneer approach is being applied to studying plant diseases and pests, with a focus on plant protection and biological control. Current and future developments in this technology will foster a more comprehensive understanding of microbial ecology, and the development of new, innovative pest control strategies.

AB The shark fin trade is a major driver of shark exploitation in fisheries all over the world, most of which are not managed on a species-specific basis. Species-specific trade information highlights taxa of particular concern and can be used to assess the efficacy of management measures and anticipate emerging threats. The species composition of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, one of the world's largest fin trading hubs, was partially assessed in 1999-2001. We randomly selected and genetically identified fin trimmings (n = 4800), produced during fin processing, from the retail market of Hong Kong in 2014-2015 to assess contemporary species composition of the fin trade. We used nonparametric species estimators to determine that at least 76 species of sharks, batoids, and chimaeras supplied the fin trade and a Bayesian model to determine their relative proportion in the market. The diversity of traded species suggests species substitution could mask depletion of vulnerable species; one-third of identified species are threatened with extinction. The Bayesian model suggested that 8 species each comprised >1% of the fin trimmings (34.1-64.2% for blue [Prionace glauca], 0.2-1.2% for bull [Carcharhinus leucas] and shortfin mako [Isurus oxyrinchus]); thus, trade was skewed to a few globally distributed species. Several other coastal sharks, batoids, and chimaeras are in the trade but poorly managed. Fewer than 10 of the species we modeled have sustainably managed fisheries anywhere in their range, and the most common species in trade, the blue shark, was not among them. Our study and approach serve as a baseline to track changes in composition of species in the fin trade over time to better understand patterns of exploitation and assess the effects of emerging management actions for these animals.

AB Multispectral imagery is a widely used source of information to address post-fire ecosystem management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of remotely sensed indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS to assess initial bum severity (overall, on vegetation and on soil) in fire-prone pine forests along the Mediterranean Transition-Oceanic climatic gradient in the Mediterranean Basin. We selected four large wildfires which affected pine forests in a climatic gradient within the Iberian Peninsula. In each wildfire we established CBI plots to obtain field values of three bum severity metrics: site, vegetation and soil burn severity. The ability of 13 spectral indices to match these three field burn severity metrics was compared and their transferability along the climatic gradient assessed using linear regression models. Specifically, we analysed the performance of 12 indices previously used for bum severity assessments (8 reflective, 2 thermal, 2 mixed) and a new reflective index (dNBR-EVI). The results showed that Landsat spectral indices have a greater ability to determine site and vegetation bum severity than soil burn severity. We found large differences in indices performances among the three different climatic regions, since most indices performed better in the Mediterranean and Transition regions than in the Oceanic one. In general, the dNBR-EVI showed the best fit to site, vegetation and soil bum severity in the three regions, demonstrating broad transferability along the entire climatic gradient.

AB Despite the ubiquitous distributions and critical ecological functions of microorganisms in pedogenesis and ecosystem development in recently deglaciated areas, there are contrasting successional trajectories among bacteria and fungi, but the driving forces of community assembly still remain poorly resolved. In this study, we analyzed both bacterial and fungal lineages associated with seven different stages in the Hailuogou Glacier Chronosequence, to quantify their taxonomic composition and successional dynamics, and to decipher the relative contribution from the bottom-up control of soil nutrients and altered vegetation as well as top-down pressures from nematode grazers. Co-occurrence networks showed that the community complexity for both bacteria and fungi typically peaked at the middle chronosequence stages. The overlapping nodes mainly belonged to Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria in bacteria, and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota in fungi, which was further supported by the indicator species analysis. Variation in partitioning and structural equation modeling suggested that edaphic properties were the primary agents shaping microbial community structures, especially at the early stages. The importance of biotic factors, including plant richness and nematode feeding, increased during the last two stages along with the establishment of a coniferous forest, eventually governing the turnover of fungal communities. Moreover, bacterial communities exhibited a more compact network topology during assembly, thus supporting determinism, whereas the looser clustering of fungal communities illustrated that they were determined more by stochastic processes. These pieces of evidence collectively reveal divergent successional trajectories and driving forces for soil bacterial and fungal communities along a glacier forefield chronosequence.

AB Understanding the mechanisms of rapid adaptive radiation has been a central problem of evolutionary ecology. Recently, there is a growing recognition that hybridization between different evolutionary lineages can facilitate adaptive radiation by creating novel phenotypes. Yet, theoretical plausibility of this hypothesis remains unclear because, for example, hybridization can negate pre-existing species richness. Here, we theoretically investigate whether and under what conditions hybridization promotes ecological speciation and adaptive radiation using an individual-based model to simulate genome evolution following hybridization between two allopatrically evolved lineages. The model demonstrated that transgressive segregation through hybridization can facilitate adaptive radiation, most powerfully when novel vacant ecological niches are highly dissimilar, phenotypic effect size of mutations is small and there is moderate genetic differentiation between parental lineages. These results provide a theoretical basis for the effect of hybridization facilitating adaptive radiation.

AB Eutrophication has become one of the most widespread anthropogenic forces impacting freshwater biological diversity. One potentially important mechanism driving biodiversity changes in response to eutrophication is the alteration of seasonal patterns of succession, particularly among species with short, synchronous, life cycles. We tested the hypothesis that eutrophication reduces seasonally driven variation in species assemblages by focusing on an understudied aspect of biodiversity: temporal beta diversity ((t)). We estimated the effect of eutrophication on (t) by sampling benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages bimonthly for two years across 35 streams spanning a steep gradient of total phosphorus (P) and benthic algal biomass (as chlorophyll a [chl a]). Two widely used metrics of diversity both declined sharply in response to increasing P and chl a, regardless of covariates. The most parsimonious explanatory model for (t) included an interaction between P and macroinvertebrate biomass, which revealed that (t) was lower when macroinvertebrate biomass was relatively high. Macroinvertebrate biomass explained a greater amount of deviance in (t) at lower to moderate concentrations of P, providing additional explanatory power where P concentration alone was unable to fully explain declines in (t). Chl a explained similar amounts of deviance in (t) in comparison to the best P model, but only when temperature variability, which was positively related to (t), also was included in the model. Declines in (t) suggest that nutrient enrichment decreases the competitive advantage that specialists gain by occupying particular temporal niches, which leads to assemblages dominated by generalists that exhibit little seasonal turnover. The collapse of seasonal variation in assemblage composition we observed in our study suggests that treating dynamic communities as static assemblages is a simplification that may fail to detect the full impact of anthropogenic stressors. Our results show that eutrophication leads to more temporally homogenous communities and therefore degrades a fundamental facet of biodiversity.

AB The aim of this work is to investigate the topsoil thickness affected by burning under contrasting soil moisture content (field capacity versus air-dried conditions). A mollic horizon of an Aleppo pine forest was sampled and burned in the laboratory, recording the temperature continuously at the topsoil surface and at soil depths of 1, 2, and 3 cm. Changes in soil properties were measured at 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 cm.
   Both the maximum temperature and the charring intensities were significantly lower in wet soils than in air-dried soils up to 3 cm in depth. Moreover, soil heating was slower and cooling faster in wet soils as compared to dry soils. Therefore, the heat capacity increase of the soil moistened at field capacity plays a more important role than the thermal conductivity increase on heat transfer on burned soils. Burning did not significantly modify the pH, the carbonate content and the chroma, for either wet or dry soil. Fire caused an immediate and significant decrease in water repellency in the air-dried soil, even at 3 cm depth, whereas the wet soil remained hydrophilic throughout its thickness, without being affected by burning. Burning depleted 50% of the soil organic C (OC) content in the air-dried soil and 25% in the wet soil at the upper centimeter, which was blackened. Burning significantly decreased the total N (TN) content only in the dry soil (to one-third of the original value) through the first centimeter of soil depth. Soluble ions, measured by electrical conductivity (EC), increased after burning, although only significantly in the first centimeter of air-dried soils. Below 2 cm, burning had no significant effects on the brightness, OC, TN, or EC, for either wet or dry soil. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Functional traits and phylogeny offer different, and often complementary, information about ecological differences between species, an essential step to uncover biodiversity assembly mechanisms and their feedbacks to ecosystem functions. However, traits and phylogeny are often related due to underlying trait evolution. Consequently, when combined, their shared information can be overemphasized, hindering their complementarity. It is therefore desirable to decouple their unique and overlapping contributions.
   2. We propose a conceptual and mathematical framework that produces a set of meaningful measures of ecological differences between species.
   3. We test the properties of these measures and the validity of the approach with extensive simulated data to show (i) the information provided by decoupling traits from phylogeny and vice versa, and (ii) that decoupling trait and phylogenetic information can uncover otherwise hidden signals underlying species coexistence and turnover. The application of the approach is further illustrated using a large dataset of Central European meadows as a case study.
   4. Decoupling traits and phylogeny particularly reveals the importance of differentiation between phylogenetically related species, which can be essential to understand species replacements along environmental gradients and the combined action of environmental filtering and limiting similarity within communities.
   5. Decoupling traits and phylogeny provides an avenue for connecting macro-evolutionary and local factors affecting coexistence and for understanding how complex species differences affect multiple ecosystem functions. We present an R function called 'decouple', which allows a simple and wide application of the framework.

AB Chromosomal inversions evolve frequently but the reasons for this remain unclear. We used cytological descriptions of 411 species of passerine birds to identify large pericentric inversion differences between species, based on the position of the centromere. Within 81 small clades comprising 284 of the species, we found 319 differences on the 9 largest autosomes combined, 56 on the Z chromosome, and 55 on the W chromosome. We also identified inversions present within 32 species. Using a new fossil-calibrated phylogeny, we examined the phylogenetic, demographic and genomic context in which these inversions have evolved. The number of inversion differences between closely related species is consistently predicted by whether the ranges of species overlap, even when time is controlled for as far as is possible. Fixation rates vary across the autosomes, but inversions are more likely to be fixed on the Z chromosome than the average autosome. Variable mutagenic input alone (estimated by chromosome size, map length, GC content or repeat density) cannot explain the differences between chromosomes in the number of inversions fixed. Together, these results support a model in which inversions increase because of their effects on recombination suppression in the face of hybridization. Other factors associated with hybridization may also contribute, including the possibility that inversions contain incompatibility alleles, making taxa less likely to collapse following secondary contact.

AB Citizen science, where citizens play an active role in the scientific process, is increasingly used to expand the reach and scope of scientific research while also achieving engagement and educational goals. Despite the emergence of studies exploring data outcomes of citizen science, the process and experience of engaging with citizens and citizen-lead groups through participatory science is less explored. This includes how citizen perspectives alter data outcomes, a critical upshot given prevalent mistrust of citizen versus scientist data. This study uses a citizen science campaign investigating watershed impacts on water quality to interrogate the nature and implications of citizen involvement in producing scientifically and societally relevant data. Data representing scientific outcomes are presented alongside a series of vignettes that offer context regarding how, why, and where citizens engaged with the project. From these vignettes, six specific lessons are examined towards understanding how integration of citizen participation alters data outcomes relative to 'professional' science. In particular, elements of participant social identity (e.g., their motivation for participation), and contextual knowledge (e.g., of the research program itself) can shape participation and resulting data outcomes. Such scientific outcomes are particularly relevant given continued concerns regarding the quality of citizen data, which could hinder scientific acceptance of citizen sciences. Importantly, the potential for meaningful engagement with citizen and participants within citizen groups - given significant capacity within the community - represents a substantial and under-realized opportunity.

AB Dispersal is one of the key mechanisms affecting the distribution of individuals, populations, and communities in nature. Despite advances in the study of single species, it has been notoriously difficult to account for dispersal in multispecies metacommunities, where it potentially has strong effects on community structure beyond those of local environmental conditions. Dispersal should thus be directly integrated in both basic and applied research by using proxies. Here, we review the use of proxies in the current metacommunity research, suggest new proxies, and discuss how proxies could be used in community modelling, particularly in freshwater systems. We suggest that while traditional proxies may still be useful, proxies formerly utilized in transport geography may provide useful novel insights into the structuring of biological communities in freshwater systems. We also suggest that understanding the utility of such proxies for dispersal in metacommunities is highly important for many applied fields such as freshwater bioassessment, conservation planning, and recolonization research in the context of restoration ecology. These research fields have often ignored spatial dynamics and focused mostly on local environmental conditions and changes therein. Yet, the conclusions of these applied studies may change considerably if dispersal is taken into account.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are global threats to biodiversity and major research topics in ecology and conservation biology. We conducted a systematic review to assess where the geographic locations, and habitat types - and how - the study designs, conceptual underpinnings, landscape metrics and biodiversity measures scientists have studied fragmentation over the last two decades. We sampled papers from 1994 to 2016 and used regression modelling to explore changes in fragmentation research over time. Habitat loss and fragmentation studies are geographically and taxonomically biased. Almost 85% of studies were conducted in America and Europe, with temperate forests and birds the most studied groups. Most studies use a binary conceptual model of landscapes (habitat versus non-habitat) and static measures of biodiversity. However, research on fragmentation is slowly shifting from a focus on coarse patterns to more nuanced representations of biodiversity and landscapes that better represent ecological processes. For example, empirical research based on gradient or continuum models, that offer new insights into landscape complexity and species-specific responses to habitat fragmentation, are increasing in prevalence. We recommend that fragmentation research focuses on developing knowledge on underlying mechanisms and processes of how species respond to landscape changes, and that fragmentation studies be conducted in the full range of habitats currently experiencing high rates of landscape modification. This is crucial if we are to understand relationships between biodiversity and ecosystems and to develop effective management strategies in fragmented landscapes.

AB Increasing habitat fragmentation and human population growth in Africa has resulted in an escalation in human-elephant conflict between small-scale farmers and free-ranging African elephants (Lox-odonta Africana). In 2012 Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) implemented the national 10-year Conservation and Management Strategy for the Elephant in Kenya, which includes an action aimed at testing whether beehive fences can be used to mitigate human-elephant conflict. From 2012 to 2015, we field-tested the efficacy of beehive fences to protect 10 0.4-ha farms next to Tsavo East National Park from elephants. We hung a series of beehives every 10 m around the boundary of each farm plot. The hives were linked with strong wire. After an initial pilot test with 2 farms, the remaining 8 of 10 beehive fences also contained 2-dimensional dummy hives between real beehives to help reduce the cost of the fence. Each trial plot had a neighboring control plot of the same size within the same farm. Of the 131 beehives deployed 88% were occupied at least once during the 3.5-year trial. Two hundred and fifty-three elephants, predominantly 20-45 years old entered the community farming area, typically during the crop-ripening season. Eighty percent of the elephants that approached the trial farms were kept out of the areas protected by the beehive fences, and elephants that broke a fence were in smaller than average groups. Beehive fences not only kept large groups of elephants from invading the farmland plots but the farmers also benefited socially and financially from the sale of 228 kg of elephant-friendly honey. As news of the success of the trial spread, a further 12 farmers requested to join the project, bringing the number of beehive fence protected farms to 22 and beehives to 297. This demonstrates positive adoption of beehive fences as a community mitigation tool. Understanding the response of elephants to the beehive fences, the seasonality of crop raiding and fence breaking, and the willingness of the community to engage with the mitigation method will help contribute to future management strategies for this high human-elephant conflict hotspot and other similar areas in Kenya.

AB Hybridization is often considered maladaptive, but sometimes hybrids can invade new ecological niches and adapt to novel or stressful environments better than their parents. The genomic changes that occur following hybridization that facilitate genome resolution and/or adaptation are not well understood. Here, we examine hybrid genome evolution using experimental evolution of de novo interspecific hybrid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces uvarum and their parentals. We evolved these strains in nutrient-limited conditions for hundreds of generations and sequenced the resulting cultures identifying numerous point mutations, copy number changes, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events, including species-biased amplification of nutrient transporters. We focused on a particularly interesting example, in which we saw repeated LOH at the high-affinity phosphate transporter gene PHO84 in both intra-and interspecific hybrids. Using allele replacement methods, we tested the fitness of different alleles in hybrid and S. cerevisiae strain backgrounds and found that the LOH is indeed the result of selection on one allele over the other in both S. cerevisiae and the hybrids. This is an example where hybrid genome resolution is driven by positive selection on existing heterozygosity and demonstrates that even infrequent outcrossing may have lasting impacts on adaptation.

AB Particle-associated bacteria (PAB) and free-living bacteria (FLB) from aquatic environments during phytoplankton blooms differ in their physical distance from algae. Both the interactions within PAB and FLB community fractions and their relationship with the surrounding environmental properties are largely unknown. Here, by using high-throughput sequencing and network-based analyses, we compared the community and network characteristics of PAB and FLB from a plateau lake during a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom. Results showed that PAB and FLB differed significantly in diversity, structure and microbial connecting network. PAB communities were characterized by highly similar bacterial community structure in different sites, tighter network connections, important topological roles for the bloom-causing M. aeruginosa and Alphaproteobacteria, especially for the potentially nitrogen-fixing (Pleomorphomonas) and algicidal bacteria (Brevundimonas sp.). FLB communities were sensitive to the detected environmental factors and were characterized by significantly higher bacterial diversity, less connectivity, larger network size and marginal role of M. aeruginosa. In both networks, covariation among bacterial taxa was extensive (>88% positive connections), and bacteria potentially affiliated with biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (i.e., denitrification, nitrogen-fixation and nitrite-oxidization) were important in occupying module hubs, such as Meganema, Pleomorphomonas, and Nitrospira. These findings highlight the importance of considering microbial network interactions for the understanding of blooms.

AB Camellia oleifera is a woody oil plant, which suffers from low yields in mid-subtropical areas of China. While increasing yields plays an important role in the development and security of the national edible oil industry, scientific evaluation of soil quality, which is essential for improving yields, has not yet been conducted for C. oleifera. To study soil quality and determine the factors limiting yields, 60 soil samples were collected from plantation stands producing different oil yields in mid-subtropical China. Thirty-two physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil were examined based on a one-way analysis of variance, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). In addition, soil quality was assessed by the soil quality index (SO) and grey relational analysis (GRA). Significantly high values were found for most properties in the high oil yield soil (HYS) samples, including soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available calcium (ACa), available boron (AB), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP), bacteria, actinomycetes, total phosphatase (TOP), and urease. Conversely, available P (AP), available potassium (AK), and AB were depleted in the low oil yield soil (LYS) samples. Five soil indicators, namely SOM, AP, ACa, MBC, and catalase, were selected to establish a minimum data set. From this, soil quality was ranked as HYS > medium oil yield soil (MYS) > LYS, with SQI values of 0.65, 0.46, and 0.38, respectively. A similar trend was observed for the GRA results. A significant correlation (coefficient value of 0.699) was found between the SQI and oil yield. With higher SQI scores and a higher association degree, HYS had a greater nutrient supply and microbiological activity than MYS and LYS. SOM appeared to be the limiting factor for low oil yield, with deficiencies in AP found to be major constraints of yield in mid-subtropical China. Measures to improve the AB and AK content should also be considered in the study areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adaptive immunity is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clones. Each clone is the progeny of a single B cell responding to Ag, with diversified Ig receptors. These receptors can now be profiled on a large scale by nextgeneration sequencing. Such data provide a window into the microevolutionary dynamics that drive successful immune responses and the dysregulation that occurs with aging or disease. Clonal relationships are not directly measured, but they must be computationally inferred from these sequencing data. Although several hierarchical clustering-based methods have been proposed, they vary in distance and linkage methods and have not yet been rigorously compared. In this study, we use a combination of human experimental and simulated data to characterize the performance of hierarchical clustering-based methods for partitioning sequences into clones. We find that single linkage clustering has high performance, with specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value all > 99%, whereas other linkages result in a significant loss of sensitivity. Surprisingly, distance metrics that incorporate the biases of somatic hypermutation do not outperform simple Hamming distance. Although errors were more likely in sequences with short junctions, using the entire dataset to choose a single distance threshold for clustering is near optimal. Our results suggest that hierarchical clustering using single linkage with Hamming distance identifies clones with high confidence and provides a fully automated method for clonal grouping. The performance estimates we develop provide important context to interpret clonal analysis of repertoire sequencing data and allow for rigorous testing of other clonal grouping algorithms.

AB Urbanization is a severe form of habitat fragmentation that can cause many species to be locally extirpated and many others to become trapped and isolated within an urban matrix. The role of drift in reducing genetic diversity and increasing genetic differentiation is well recognized in urban populations. However, explicit incorporation and analysis of the demographic and temporal factors promoting drift in urban environments are poorly studied. Here, we genotyped 15 microsatellites in 320 fire salamanders from the historical city of Oviedo (Est. 8th century) to assess the effects of time since isolation, demographic history (historical effective population size; N-e) and patch size on genetic diversity, population structure and contemporary N-e. Our results indicate that urban populations of fire salamanders are highly differentiated, most likely due to the recent N-e declines, as calculated in coalescence analyses, concomitant with the urban development of Oviedo. However, urbanization only caused a small loss of genetic diversity. Regression modelling showed that patch size was positively associated with contemporary N-e, while we found only moderate support for the effects of demographic history when excluding populations with unresolved history. This highlights the interplay between different factors in determining current genetic diversity and structure. Overall, the results of our study on urban populations of fire salamanders provide some of the very first insights into the mechanisms affecting changes in genetic diversity and population differentiation via drift in urban environments, a crucial subject in a world where increasing urbanization is forecasted.

AB The large-scale use of neonicotinoid insecticides has raised growing concerns about their potential adverse effects on farmland birds, and more generally on biodiversity. Imidacloprid, the first neonicotinoid commercialized, has been identified as posing a risk for seed-eating birds when it is used as seed treatment of some crops since the consumption of a few dressed seeds could cause mortality. But evidence of direct effects in the field is lacking. Here, we reviewed the 103 wildlife mortality incidents reported by the French SAGIR Network from 1995 to 2014, for which toxicological analyses detected imidacloprid residues. One hundred and one incidents totalling at least 734 dead animals were consistent with an agricultural use as seed treatment. Grey partridges (Perdix perdix) and "pigeons" (Columba palumbus, Columba livia and Columba oenas) were the main species found. More than 70% of incidents occurred during autumn cereal sowings. Furthermore, since there is no biomarker for diagnosing neonicotinoid poisonings, we developed a diagnostic approach to estimate the degree of certainty that these mortalities were due to imidacloprid poisoning. By this way, the probability that mortality was due to poisoning by imidaclopridtreated seeds was ranked as at least Blikely<^> in 70% of incidents. As a result, this work provides clear evidence to risk managers that lethal effects due to the consumption by birds of imidacloprid-treated seeds regularly occur in the field. This in turn raises the question of the effectiveness of the two main factors (seed burying and imidacloprid-treated seeds avoidance) that are supposed to make the risk to birds negligible. Risk factors and the relevance of mitigation measures are discussed.

AB Functional traits and diversity indices have provided new insights into community responses to stressors. Most traits of aquatic organisms have frequently been tested for predictability and geographical stability in response to environmental variables, but such tests of functional diversity indices are rare. We sampled macroinverte-brates at 18 reference sites (RS) and 35 disturbed sites (DS) from headwater streams in the upper Mekong River Basin, Xishuangbanna (XSBN), China. We selected 29 qualitative categories of eight traits and then calculated five functional diversity indices, namely functional richness (FRic), functional evenness (FEve), functional dispersion (FDis), functional divergence (FDiv) and Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RaoQ), and two trait diversity indices, namely trait richness (TR) and trait diversity (TD). We used combination of RLQand fourth-corner to examine the response of traits and functional diversity to the disturbance and environmental variables. We used variance partitioning to explore the relative role of environmental variables and spatial factors in constraining trait composition and functional diversity. We found that the relative frequency of ten trait categories, and the values of TD, TR, FRic and FDis in RS were significantly different (p < 0.05) from DS. In addition, the seven traits (except for "habit") demonstrated a predictable response of trait patterns along the integrative environmental gradients. Environmental variables significantly contributed to most of the traits, functional diversity and trait diversity. However, spatial variables were mainly significant in shaping ecological traits, FRic and FEve. Our results confirm the dominant role of environmental variables in the determination of community trait composition and functional diversity, and substantiate the contribution of spatial vectors in explaining the variance of functional traits and diversity. We conclude that the traits "Refuge", "External protection", "Respiration" and "Body shape", and diversity indices FDis, TD, and TR are promising indicators of stream conditions at XSBN.

AB Efficient and reliable monitoring of wild animals in their natural habitats is essential to inform conservation and management decisions. Automatic covert cameras or "camera traps" are being an increasingly popular tool for wildlife monitoring due to their effectiveness and reliability in collecting data of wildlife unobtrusively, continuously and in large volume. However, processing such a large volume of images and videos captured from camera traps manually is extremely expensive, time-consuming and also monotonous. This presents a major obstacle to scientists and ecologists to monitor wildlife in an open environment. Leveraging on recent advances in deep learning techniques in computer vision, we propose in this paper a framework to build automated animal recognition in the wild, aiming at an automated wildlife monitoring system. In particular, we use a single-labeled dataset from Wildlife Spotter project, done by citizen scientists, and the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network architectures, to train a computational system capable of filtering animal images and identifying species automatically. Our experimental results achieved an accuracy at 96.6% for the task of detecting images containing animal, and 90.4% for identifying the three most common species among the set of images of wild animals taken in South-central Victoria, Australia, demonstrating the feasibility of building fully automated wildlife observation. This, in turn, can therefore speed up research findings, construct more efficient citizen science based monitoring systems and subsequent management decisions, having the potential to make significant impacts to the world of ecology and trap camera images analysis.

AB A unique and intensive flux observation matrix was established during May to September of 2012 in an oasis-desert area located in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, China. The flux observation matrix included 22 eddy covariance systems belonging to the first thematic experiment of the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) project. The energy balance closure ratio (EBR) was assessed and possible mechanisms were investigated using remote sensing data. The results showed that 1) the EBR was in the range of 0.78-1.04 at all sites with an average EBR of 0.92, and 2) the calculated daily EBR exhibited better performance than the 30-min averages. 3) The heat storage cannot be ignored during the crop growing season. An improvement of approximately 6% in the total closure was found after considering the heat storage terms (canopy and photosynthesis storage) in the energy budget at the maize surface, and the canopy and photosynthesis showed approximately equal contributions of 3% for each storage term. The results also showed that 4) the land heterogeneous surface had a significant effect on the EBR. The EBR decreased with land surface heterogeneity increasing (taking the standard deviation of the surface temperature in the eddy covariance system source area as an index). The EBR also decreased when irrigation occurred and increased after irrigation was completed. The advection or secondary circulation broke the closed system of the energy balance given the phenomenon of EBR increasing when the advection or secondary circulation occurred.

AB Conserving large carnivores in an increasingly crowded planet raises difficult challenges. A recurring debate is whether large carnivores can be conserved in human used landscapes (land sharing) or whether they require specially designated areas (land sparing). Here we show that 40% of the 170 protected areas in the global range of the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) are smaller than the home range of a single adult male and only 4-13% are large enough for a 90% probability of containing 15 or more adult females. We used data from 16 snow leopards equipped with GPS collars in the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, Mongolia, to calculate home range size and overlap using three different estimators: minimum convex polygons (MCP), kernel utility distributions (Kernel), and local convex hulls (LoCoH). Local convex hull home ranges were smaller and included lower proportions of unused habitats compared to home ranges based on minimum convex polygons and Kernels. Intra-sexual home range overlap was low, especially for adult males, suggesting that snow leopards are territorial. Mean home range size based on the LoCoH estimates was 207 km(2) +/- 63 SD for adult males and 124 km(2) +/- 41 SD for adult females. Our estimates were 6-44 times larger than earlier estimates based on VHF technology when comparing similar estimators, i.e. MCP. Our study illustrates that protected areas alone will not be able to conserve predators with large home ranges and conservationists and managers should not restrict their efforts to land sparing.

AB Projecting the fates of populations under climate change is one of global change biology's foremost challenges. Here, we seek to identify the contributions that temperature-mediated local adaptation and plasticity make to spatial variation in nesting phenology, a phenotypic trait showing strong responses to warming. We apply a mixed modeling framework to a Britain-wide spatiotemporal dataset comprising > 100 000 records of first egg dates from four single-brooded passerine bird species. The average temperature during a specific time period ( sliding window) strongly predicts spatiotemporal variation in lay date. All four species exhibit phenological plasticity, advancing lay date by 2-5 days degrees C (1). The initiation of this sliding window is delayed further north, which may be a response to a photoperiod threshold. Using clinal trends in phenology and temperature, we are able to estimate the temperature sensitivity of selection on lay date ( B), but our estimates are highly sensitive to the temporal position of the sliding window. If the sliding window is of fixed duration with a start date determined by photoperiod, we find B is tracked by phenotypic plasticity. If, instead, we allow the start and duration of the sliding window to change with latitude, we find plasticity does not track B, although in this case, at odds with theoretical expectations, our estimates of B differ across latitude vs. longitude. We argue that a model combining photoperiod and mean temperature is most consistent with current understanding of phenological cues in passerines, the results from which suggest that each species could respond to projected increases in spring temperatures through plasticity alone. However, our estimates of B require further validation.

AB Marine ecosystems are constantly being threatened by contaminants produced by human activities. There is an urge to better understand their impacts on marine organisms and develop reliable tools for biomonitoring studies, while also assessing their potential impacts on human health. Given their position on top of food webs, sharks are particularly susceptible to bioaccumulation, making them potential sentinel species of marine contamination. The main objective of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for future marine pollution biomonitoring studies by correlating biochemical responses with tissue contaminant body burden in blue sharks (Prionace glauca), a species heavily caught and consumed by humans, while also addressing their general health. The chemical contaminants analysed comprised different persistent organic pollutants (POPS) families from polychlorinated compounds to brominaled flame retardants (BERN) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and different trace and heavy metals. Concentrations of some contaminants in sharks' tissues were found to be above the legally allowed limits for human consumption. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed and some strong associations were found between biochemical responses and contaminants' accumulation levels. DNA damage and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as the inhibition of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, were the main effects and consequences of contamination. The impact of contamination on these vital macromolecules underlines the suboptimal conditions of the sampled P. glauca, which can ultimately lead to the degradation of core ecological aspects, such as swimming, feeding, and reproduction. It can be concluded that P. glauca demonstrates great potential to be used as environmental sentinel and suitable biomarker candidates were identified in this work. Moreover, this study also highlights the risks that the consumption of blue shark derived products can pose to human health, which is of upmost interest as the sampled organisms were still juveniles and already presented values above regulatory limits.

AB Following the Blue Growth ambition of the European Commission, the interest in the potential of offshore is growing. This paper aimed to contribute to the discussion on the feasibility of offshore aquaculture development and its potential for multi-use with other maritime activities. A review of national and international projects forms the basis of the paper, where the Dutch North Sea is used as a case-study area. Analysis of technical, economic and ecological boundaries indicated that the potential of fish culture is limited, that seaweed cultivation is likely to gain potential when challenges related to processing will be overcome and that mussel culture has the highest potential in the near future. The North Sea is an area where many stakeholders claim space, which might set boundaries to the number of sites available for mussel culture. Competing claims are a potential source of conflict but may also lead to mutual benefits when smart combinations are sought, e.g. with wind parks, fisheries and nature conservation; especially, the possibility of combining mussel culture in or around wind parks is worthwhile to be further explored. A spatial distribution model adapted for the Dutch North Sea conditions demonstrated that offshore mussel production in wind farms can be profitable. Yet, the commercial interest for offshore development of mussel culture is still limited. Actions required to stimulate further development of the offshore mussel industry are presented for the government, the private sector, research institutes and civil society organizations.

AB Economic stability is dependent on the effective functioning and resilience of energy systems. Resilience is a term used across all research disciplines and in everyday discourse. As a concept it purports to serve as a useful indicator of sustainability and robustness, but it has proved difficult to measure. Ecological resilience, psychological resilience, risk management and energy security are all fields of research in which measures of the ability to respond to the unexpected are sought. The goal is to build adaptive capacity but quite different methods have been developed to achieve this end. Research on energy security, in particular, has focused on the security of oil supplies, not resilience or the adaptive capacity of the energy system or the role that renewable energy plays in building such capacity. This paper discusses how different disciplines seek to measure and build resilience and explores its connection with the state or quality of a system's adaptive capacity. When the parameters of redundancy and diversity are present, resilience is enhanced. For this reason, in energy systems we must understand the size and scope of the key parameters required to facilitate the development of adaptive capacity and to build resilience that can enhance economic stability.

AB Soil diazotrophs play important roles in ecosystem functioning by converting atmospheric N-2 into biologically available ammonium. However, the diversity and distribution of soil diazotrophic communities in different forests and whether they follow biogeographic patterns similar to macroorganisms still remain unclear. By sequencing nifH gene amplicons, we surveyed the diversity, structure and biogeographic patterns of soil diazotrophic communities across six North American forests (126 nested samples). Our results showed that each forest harboured markedly different soil diazotrophic communities and that these communities followed traditional biogeographic patterns similar to plant and animal communities, including the taxa-area relationship (TAR) and latitudinal diversity gradient. Significantly higher community diversity and lower microbial spatial turnover rates (i.e. z-values) were found for rainforests (similar to 0.06) than temperate forests (similar to 0.1). The gradient pattern of TARs and community diversity was strongly correlated (r(2) > 0.5) with latitude, annual mean temperature, plant species richness and precipitation, and weakly correlated (r(2) < 0.25) with pH and soil moisture. This study suggests that even microbial subcommunities (e.g. soil diazotrophs) follow general biogeographic patterns (e.g. TAR, latitudinal diversity gradient), and indicates that the metabolic theory of ecology and habitat heterogeneity may be the major underlying ecological mechanisms shaping the biogeographic patterns of soil diazotrophic communities.

TI Unpeeling the layers of language: Bonobos and chimpanzees engage in
   cooperative turn-taking sequences
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English

ID PAN-PANISCUS; ORGANIZATION
AB Human language is a fundamentally cooperative enterprise, embodying fast-paced and extended social interactions. It has been suggested that it evolved as part of a larger adaptation of humans' species-unique forms of cooperation. Although our closest living relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees, show general cooperative abilities, their communicative interactions seem to lack the cooperative nature of human conversation. Here, we revisited this claim by conducting the first systematic comparison of communicative interactions in mother-infant dyads living in two different communities of bonobos (LuiKotale, DRC; Wamba, DRC) and chimpanzees (Tai South, Cote d'Ivoire; Kanyawara, Uganda) in the wild. Focusing on the communicative function of joint-travel-initiation, we applied parameters of conversation analysis to gestural exchanges between mothers and infants. Results showed that communicative exchanges in both species resemble cooperative turn-taking sequences in human conversation. While bonobos consistently addressed the recipient via gaze before signal initiation and used so-called overlapping responses, chimpanzees engaged in more extended negotiations, involving frequent response waiting and gestural sequences. Our results thus strengthen the hypothesis that interactional intelligence paved the way to the cooperative endeavour of human language and suggest that social matrices highly impact upon communication styles.

AB East Asia has been hypothesized to be subdivided into two distinct northern and southern areas, separated by a band of dry climate that was far more severe in the early Tertiary but still exists today. However, this biogeographic hypothesis has rarely been tested using a molecular phylogeographic approach.
   We genotyped 70 populations throughout the distributional range of Asian butternuts (Juglans section Cardiocaryon) using eight chloroplast DNA regions, one single-copy nuclear gene, and 17 nuclear microsatellite loci, supplemented with paleodistribution modeling of the major genetic clades.
   The genetic data consistently identified two clades, one northern, comprising Juglans mandshurica and Juglans ailantifolia, and one southern, comprising Juglans cathayensis. The two clades diverged through climate-induced vicariance of an ancestral northern range during the mid-Miocene and remained mostly separate thereafter, with geographical isolation of the Japanese Islands and refugial isolation or secondary contacts in the late Pleistocene producing further subdivision within the northern clade. But beyond all that, we also discovered a role of environmental adaptation in maintaining and/or reinforcing the north-south divergence.
   Asian butternuts offer a strong case for the existence of a biogeographic divide between the northern and southern parts of East Asia during the Neogene and into the Pleistocene.

AB Global transportation growth causes several disproportionate impacts on the environment as, for instance, noise pollution which is related to negative effects on human health but also to quiet natural areas decline and biodiversity loss. Besides, sound is a component of ecosystems severely threatened by transportation noise disturbance which is related to negative effects on ecosystem functions. This study deals with aircraft noise impact on natural environments from a multiple innovative perspective. It complementarily combines: noise modeling, field measurements, soundscape audibility, human perception and spatial pattern tools for assessing the chronic growing outdoor noise pollution of ecosystems at landscape scale. Firstly, noticeable soundscape degradation from aircraft overflights has been found causing severe acoustic fragmentation and disruptions in the quietness of a national park in Spain (European Union). Air traffic caused sound pressure levels to increase by approximately 8 decibels from natural ambient levels. Secondly, spatial pattern tools together with noise mapping have been found to be useful in providing decision support for decisions-making through anthropogenic noise impact assessment on the natural environment. Finally, public opinion did not perceive aircraft noise-disruption as being as relevant as that quantified by technical procedures. Although 82% of visitors agree that anthropogenic noise pollution may negatively impact on conservation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Intellectual Property and Consolidation in the Seed Industry
SO CROP SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Intellectual property protections on seeds have increased dramatically in recent decades, from the granting of patent-like protections on certain types of seeds in 1970 to the enforcement of contract provisions for seeds beyond the first sale in 2013. During this same period, the seed industry has experienced rapid consolidation. Although as recently as the 1970s, it was characterized by thousands of small, mostly family-owned business, by 2011, just three agrochemical firms controlled more than half of the global proprietary seed market. These trends have resulted in rapidly increasing prices for commodity seeds and reduced farmers' ability to save seeds. Given these important negative impacts, why do these trends continue? Expanding intellectual property protections and reducing the number of competitors are strategies that the largest firms understandably employ to increase their power but government support has also been essential to their success. Policy changes have reduced the enforcement of antitrust laws and increased the enforcement of alleged intellectual property infringements. In addition, synergies between stronger intellectual property protections and consolidation have further reinforced the dominance of top firms at the expense of a freely competitive industry. A better understanding of these trends is unlikely to reverse them in the near term but may increase the effectiveness of creating alternatives to a seed oligopoly.

AB Describing, understanding and predicting the spatial distribution of genetic diversity is a central issue in biological sciences. In river landscapes, it is generally predicted that neutral genetic diversity should increase downstream, but there have been few attempts to test and validate this assumption across taxonomic groups. Moreover, it is still unclear what are the evolutionary processes that may generate this apparent spatial pattern of diversity. Here, we quantitatively synthesized published results from diverse taxa living in river ecosystems, and we performed a meta-analysis to show that a downstream increase in intraspecific genetic diversity (DIGD) actually constitutes a general spatial pattern of biodiversity that is repeatable across taxa. We further demonstrated that DIGD was stronger for strictly waterborne dispersing than for overland dispersing species. However, for a restricted data set focusing on fishes, there was no evidence that DIGD was related to particular species traits. We then searched for general processes underlying DIGD by simulating genetic data in dendritic-like river systems. Simulations revealed that the three processes we considered (downstream-biased dispersal, increase in habitat availability downstream and upstream-directed colonization) might generate DIGD. Using random forest models, we identified from simulations a set of highly informative summary statistics allowing discriminating among the processes causing DIGD. Finally, combining these discriminant statistics and approximate Bayesian computations on a set of twelve empirical case studies, we hypothesized that DIGD were most likely due to the interaction of two of these three processes and that contrary to expectation, they were not solely caused by downstream-biased dispersal.

AB Studies on elevation diversity gradients have covered a large number of taxa and regions throughout the world; however, studies of freshwater fish are scarce and restricted to examining their changes along a specific gradient. These studies have reported a monotonic decrease in species richness with increasing elevation, but ignore the high taxonomic differentiation of each headwater assemblage that may generate high -diversity among them. Here, we analyzed how fish assemblages vary with elevation among regional elevation bands, and how these changes are related to four environmental clines and to changes in the distribution, habitat use, and the morphology of fish species. Using a standardized field sampling technique, we assessed three different diversity and two structural assemblage measures across six regional elevation bands located in the northern Andes (Colombia). Each species was assigned to a functional group based on its body shape, habitat use, morphological, and/or behavioral adaptations. Additionally, at each sampling site, we measured four environmental variables. Our analyses showed: (1) After a monotonic decrease in species richness, we detected an increase in richness in the upper part of the gradient; (2) diversity patterns vary depending on the diversity measure used; (3) diversity patterns can be attributed to changes in species distribution and in the richness and proportions of functional groups along the regional elevation gradient; and (4) diversity patterns and changes in functional groups are highly correlated with variations in environmental variables, which also vary with elevation. These results suggest a novel pattern of variation in species richness with elevation: Species richness increases at the headwaters of the northern Andes owing to the cumulative number of endemic species there. This highlights the need for large-scale studies and has important implications for the aquatic conservation of the region.

AB Social animals can greatly benefit from well-developed social skills. Because the frequency and diversity of social interactions often increase with the size of social groups, the benefits of advanced social skills can be expected to increase with group size. Variation in social skills often arises during ontogeny, depending on early social experience. Whether variation of social-group sizes affects development of social skills and related changes in brain structures remains unexplored. We investigated whether, in a cooperatively breeding cichlid, early group size (1) shapes social behavior and social skills and (2) induces lasting plastic changes in gross brain structures and (3) whether the development of social skills is confined to a sensitive ontogenetic period. Rearing-group size and the time juveniles spent in these groups interactively influenced the development of social skills and the relative sizes of four main brain regions. We did not detect a sensitive developmental period for the shaping of social behavior within the 2-month experience phase. Instead, our results suggest continuous plastic behavioral changes over time. We discuss how developmental effects on social behavior and brain architecture may adaptively tune phenotypes to their current or future environments.

AB Aims Few direct tests of phosphorus (P) limitation on highly-weathered soils have been conducted, especially in mature, native Eucalyptus stands. We tested whether growth in a mature >80-year old stand of Eucalyptus tereticornis in Cumberland Plain Woodland was limited by P, and whether this P-limitation affected leaf photosynthetic capacity.
   Methods P was added to trees at the native woodland site at 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in each of 3 years, and stem and leaf responses were measured.
   Results Leaf P concentrations before fertilisation were <1 mg g(-1) and N: P ratios ranged between 16 and 23. Addition of 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of P increased leaf P concentration significantly (+50 %) compared to non-fertilised trees, for two but not for the 3 years. Despite higher leaf P in fertilised trees, photosynthetic capacity was unaffected. However, there was a 54 % increase in tree stem basal area growth during the first and second years of P fertilisation, statistically significant in the second year of the experiment.
   Conclusions Our evidence shows that E. tereticornis is P-limited on Cumberland Plain soils. This has implications for forest responses to rising atmospheric [CO2], because photosynthesis in elevated [CO2] may become further constrained by required phosphate pools within the photosynthetic apparatus.

AB Climatic and edaphic conditions in the Amazon basin are ideal for the cultivation of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), this has led to a major expansion in plantations in recent years, to the point where oil palm cultivation has become one of the main threats to biodiversity in this biome. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of oil palm crops on the integrity of freshwater environments and assess the response of aquatic assemblages. A set of 244 environmental metrics were measured at 22 Amazonian streams, either reference sites located in natural forest or oil palm plantation sites. We developed an aquatic environment integrity index for these sites. Biological sampling consisted of the collection of specimens of aquatic and semi-aquatic Heteropteran species. From environmental variables dataset, some were evaluated and five were screened to assess the environments and employed in the streams abiotic integrity index (SAII) to these environments. The SAII proved an excellent for assessing aquatic environments and assaying changes in the freshwater habitats (forest and oil palm) analysed in this study. The forest streams had higher environmental integrity than the plantation streams. Environmental integrity was associated with Heteropteran species richness, although not to abundance of individual species. These results are consistent with previous research on the effects of oil palm crops on aquatic habitats, which showed that the greatest impact was on factors associated with the structure of the riparian zone. These findings should inform development of a strategy to mitigate or minimise the environmental problems caused by ongoing expansion of oil palm plantations in the Amazon basin, in order to safeguard the region's aquatic biodiversity.

AB Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) are critical to maintain plant metabolism under stressful environmental conditions, but we do not fully understand how NSC allocation and utilization from storage varies with stress. While it has become established that storage allocation is unlikely to be a mere overflow process, very little empirical evidence has been produced to support this view, at least not for trees. Here we present the results of an intensively monitored experimental manipulation of whole-tree carbon (C) balance (young Picea abies (L.) H Karst.) using reduced atmospheric [CO2] and drought to reduce C sources. We measured specific C storage pools (glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch) over 21 weeks and converted concentration measurement into fluxes into and out of the storage pool. Continuous labeling (C-13) allowed us to track C allocation to biomass and non-structural C pools. Net C fluxes into the storage pool occurred mainly when the C balance was positive. Storage pools increased during periods of positive C gain and were reduced under negative C gain. C-13 data showed that C was allocated to storage pools independent of the net flux and even under severe C limitation. Allocation to below-ground tissues was strongest in control trees followed by trees experiencing drought followed by those grown under low [CO2]. Our data suggest that NSC storage has, under the conditions of our experimental manipulation (e.g., strong progressive drought, no above-ground growth), a high allocation priority and cannot be considered an overflow process. While these results also suggest active storage allocation, definitive proof of active plant control of storage in woody plants requires studies involving molecular tools.

AB Freshwaters are being transformed by multiple environmental drivers, creating uncertainty about future conditions. One way of coping with uncertainty is to manage for resilience to unanticipated events while facilitating learning through adaptive management. We outline the application of these strategies to freshwater recreational fisheries management using a case study in Wisconsin, USA, where black bass (Micropterus spp.) populations are increasing, while Walleye (Sander vitreus) populations are decreasing. Managing for heterogeneity in functional groups (e.g., age classes and prey species of sport fishes), fishery objectives, and regulations can increase resilience, although heterogeneity must be balanced with replication to facilitate learning. Monitoring designed to evaluate management objectives and inform about critical uncertainties, when combined with heterogeneity, creates opportunities for adaptive management, another critical resilience strategy. Although barriers exist to implementing resilience strategies, management designed to accommodate uncertainty and illuminate its consequences is needed to maintain critical fisheries in a rapidly changing world. Los cuerpos de agua dulce estan siendo transformados por multiples factores ambientales, lo que genera incertidumbre sobre lo que sucedera en el futuro. Una forma de enfrentar esta incertidumbre es el manejo de la resiliencia con respeto a eventos no anticipados y, simultaneamente, facilitar el aprendizaje a traves del manejo adaptativo. En este trabajo se muestra la aplicacion de estas estrategias en el manejo de pesquerias recreativas de agua dulce tomando un caso de estudio en Wisconsin, en el que las poblaciones de la lobina negra (Micropterus spp.) estan incrementandose, en tanto que las de la lucioperca americana (Sander vitreus) estan disminuyendo. El manejo enfocado en la heterogeneidad de grupos funcionales (p.e., ciertas clases de edad y presas de peces de pesca deportiva), en los objetivos y en las regulaciones de la pesqueria pueden aumentar la resiliencia, no obstante atender la heterogeneidad debe equilibrarse usando replicas que faciliten el aprendizaje. El monitoreo disenado para evaluar los objetivos del manejo e informar acerca de imprecisiones importantes que, al combinarse con la heterogeneidad, generan oportunidades para el manejo adaptativo, representa otra estrategia critica para incrementar la resiliencia. Aunque existen obstaculos para implementar las estrategias enfocadas en la resiliencia, se necesita un manejo que incorpore la incertidumbre y que advierta sobre sus consecuencias, con el fin de mantener vivas importantes pesquerias en un mundo que esta en constante cambio.

AB Expectations about ecosystem based management (EBM) differ due to diverging perspectives about what EBM should be and how it should work. While EBM by its nature requires trade-offs to be made between ecological, economic and social sustainability criteria, the diversity of cross-sectoral perspectives, values, stakes, and the specificity of each individual situation determine the outcome of these trade-offs. The authors strive to raise awareness of the importance of interaction between three stakeholder groups (decision makers, scientists, and other actors) and argue that choosing appropriate degrees of interaction between them in a transparent way can make EBM more effective in terms of the three effectiveness criteria salience, legitimacy, and credibility. This article therefore presents an interaction triangle in which three crucial dimensions of stakeholder interactions are discussed: (A) between decision makers and scientists, who engage in framing to foster salience of scientific input to decision making, (B) between decision makers and other actors, to shape participation processes to foster legitimacy of EBM processes, and (C) between scientists and other actors, who collaborate to foster credibility of knowledge production. Due to the complexity of EBM, there is not one optimal interaction approach; rather, finding the optimal degrees of interaction for each dimension depends on the context in which EBM is implemented, i.e. the EBM objectives, the EBM initiator's willingness for transparency and interaction, and other context-specific factors, such as resources, trust, and state of knowledge.

AB Background: The microbial community in a biogas reactor greatly influences the process performance. However, only the effects of deterministic factors (such as temperature and hydraulic retention time (HRT)) on the microbial community and performance have been investigated in biogas reactors. Little is known about the manner in which stochastic factors (for example, stochastic birth, death, colonization, and extinction) and disturbance affect the stable-state microbial community and reactor performances.
   Results: In the present study, three replicate biogas reactors treating cattle manure were run to examine the role of stochastic factors and disturbance in shaping microbial communities. In the triplicate biogas reactors with the same inoculum and operational conditions, similar process performances and microbial community profiles were observed under steady-state conditions. This indicated that stochastic factors had a minor role in shaping the profile of the microbial community composition and activity in biogas reactors. On the contrary, temperature disturbance was found to play an important role in the microbial community composition as well as process performance for biogas reactors. Although three different temperature disturbances were applied to each biogas reactor, the increased methane yields (around 10% higher) and decreased volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentrations at steady state were found in all three reactors after the temperature disturbances. After the temperature disturbance, the biogas reactors were brought back to the original operational conditions; however, new steady-state microbial community profiles were observed in all the biogas reactors.
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that temperature disturbance, but not stochastic factors, played an important role in shaping the profile of the microbial community composition and activity in biogas reactors. New steady-state microbial community profiles and reactor performances were observed in all the biogas reactors after the temperature disturbance.

AB Parents influence the development of their offspring in many ways beyond the transmission of DNA. This includes transfer of epigenetic states, nutrients, antibodies and hormones, and behavioural interactions after birth. While the evolutionary consequences of such non-genetic inheritance are increasingly well understood, less is known about how inheritance mechanisms evolve. Here, we present a simple but versatile model to explore the adaptive evolution of non-genetic inheritance. Our model is based on a switch mechanism that produces alternative phenotypes in response to different inputs, including genes and non-genetic factors transmitted from parents and the environment experienced during development. This framework shows how genetic and non-genetic inheritance mechanisms and environmental conditions can act as cues by carrying correlational information about future selective conditions. Differential use of these cues is manifested as different degrees of genetic, parental or environmental morph determination. We use this framework to evaluate the conditions favouring non-genetic inheritance, as opposed to genetic determination of phenotype or within-generation plasticity, by applying it to two putative examples of adaptive non-genetic inheritance: maternal effects on seed germination in plants and transgenerational phase shift in desert locusts. Our simulation models show how the adaptive value of non-genetic inheritance depends on its mechanism, the pace of environmental change, and life history characteristics.

AB AimPatterns of biological diversity are often investigated across space but little work has attempted to explore the consistency of such observations through time. Here, our aim was to understand the patterns of diversity for a functionally critical taxon, the ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), through space and time using an extensive dataset collected across an elevational gradient. In addition, we evaluated the importance of two key postulated drivers of elevational diversity patterns: temperature and available area.
   LocationThe Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains of southern Africa.
   MethodsWe sampled epigaeic ant communities biannually for 7years (2006-2012) at eight different elevational sites. We then used an information theoretic approach combined with generalized linear mixed models to: (1) describe diversity patterns through space and time; (2) assess the importance of different abiotic drivers; and (3) understand how much spatio-temporal variation can be explained by these drivers. Simple regression approaches were also used to test for differences in seasonal variation along the elevational gradient.
   ResultsWe found clear mid-elevational peaks of species density and evenness measures. Abundance patterns were complex. The spatial distributions of all three metrics changed across seasons and years. Temperature variables had important roles in explaining both species density and abundance patterns, whilst species density was also influenced by available area. In conjunction, we found much greater seasonal variability in species density at low elevations. This variation was independent of differences in species pool size.
   Main conclusionsWe found patterns of ant diversity that are strongly modulated by temporal change. There was a consistent and strong signature of seasonality on the elevation-diversity patterns of the ants, whilst annual changes throughout the study period had a weaker influence. We conclude that both spatial and temporal patterns are driven primarily by temperature, with only a weak influence of available elevational area. This study is the first to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of a suite of community-level metrics along an elevational gradient and implies that temporal variation should be considered more carefully in studies of invertebrate diversity, particularly with respect to elevation and the mechanisms that may be maintaining diversity patterns.

AB AimFungi are drivers of wood decay in forested ecosystem, while bryophytes use dead wood as a platform for their autotrophic lifestyle. We tested the hypothesis that fungal communities on beech logs are mainly structured by substrate quality, while bryophyte communities are structured by climatic gradients. In addition, we tested whether community structure in both organism groups is altered along a gradient from nearly pristine forest to forests heavily affected by management and human disturbance in the past.
   LocationEurope.
   MethodsWe surveyed 1207 fallen beech logs in 26 of the best-preserved forest stands across six European countries, representing a gradient in overall naturalness of the forest landscape. Recorded species were classified into ecological guilds. Indirect ordination and variation partitioning was used to analyse the relationship between species composition and environmental variables, recorded at log or site level.
   ResultsIn total, 10,367 bryophyte and 15,575 fungal records were made, representing 157 and 272 species, respectively. Fungal communities were more clearly structured by substrate quality than were bryophyte communities. In both groups a distinct turnover in species composition was evident along a longitudinal gradient from Central to Western Europe. Fungi specialized in trunk rot and specialized epixylic bryophytes were scarcely represented in Atlantic regions, and partly replaced by species belonging to less specialized guilds. Variables related to climate and forest conditions were confounded along this main geographical gradient in community composition.
   Main conclusionsWe found that bryophyte and fungal communities co-occurring on fallen beech logs in European beech forest reserves differed in their responses to biogeographical drivers and local-scale habitat filters. Both groups responded to major gradients in climate and forest conditions, but the loss of specialist guilds in degraded forest landscapes points to a functionally important effect of forest landscape degradation at the European continental scale.

AB Myctophids are among the most abundant fishes in the world's ocean and occupy a key position in marine pelagic food webs. Through their significant diel vertical migrations and metabolism they also have the potential to be a significant contributor to carbon export. We investigated the feeding ecology and contribution to organic carbon export by three myctophid species, Benthosema glaciale, Proto-myctophum arcticum, and Hygophum hygomii, from a structurally and ecologically unique ecosystem- the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Similar to the results of previous studies, the diet of these fishes was primarily copepods and euphausiids, however, gelatinous zooplankton was identified in the diet of B. glaciale for the first time. Ridge section and time of day were significant explanatory variables in the diet of B. glaciale as determined by canonical correspondence analysis, while depth was the only significant explanatory variable in the diet of P. arcticum. Daily consumption by MAR myctophids was less than 1% of dry body weight per day and resulted in the removal of less than 1% of zooplankton biomass daily. Although lower than previous estimates of carbon transport by myctophids and zooplankton in other areas. MAR myctophid active transport by diel vertical migration was equivalent to up to 8% of sinking particulate organic carbon in the North Atlantic. While highly abundant, myctophids do not impart significant predation pressure on MAR zooplankton, and play a modest role in the active transport of carbon from surface waters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mortality and injuries caused by ship strikes in U. S. waters are a cause of concern for the endangered population of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) occupying the eastern North Pacific. We sought to determine which areas along the U.S. West Coast are most important to blue whales and whether those areas change inter-annually. Argos-monitored satellite tags were attached to 171 blue whales off California during summer/early fall from 1993 to 2008. We analyzed portions of the tracks that occurred within U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone waters and defined the 'home range' (HR) and 'core areas' (CAU) as the 90% and 50% fixed kernel density distributions, respectively, for each whale. We used the number of overlapping individual HRs and CAUs to identify areas of highest use. Individual HR and CAU sizes varied dramatically, but without significant inter-annual variation despite covering years with El Nino and La Nina conditions. Observed within-year differences in HR size may represent different foraging strategies for individuals. The main areas of HR and CAU overlap among whales were near highly productive, strong upwelling centers that were crossed by commercial shipping lanes. Tagged whales generally departed U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone waters from mid-October to mid-November, with high variability among individuals. One 504-d track allowed HR and CAU comparisons for the same individual across two years, showing similar seasonal timing, and strong site fidelity. Our analysis showed how satellite-tagged blue whales seasonally used waters off the U.S. West Coast, including high-risk areas. We suggest possible modifications to existing shipping lanes to reduce the likelihood of collisions with vessels.

AB Land-use change and current game management have favored an increasing population of wild ungulates (especially deer) in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we assess the impact of high deer densities (> 30 ind km(-2)) on the highly diverse woody vegetation of Mediterranean ecosystems, where big game have been favored for the last decades. We examine whether prolonged deer browsing (over 30 years) affected plant composition, diversity and dynamics of the original (non-browsed) vegetation. Deer browsing led to an average decrease of 30.4 % in woody plant diversity (species richness), due to a lack of regeneration for the most preferred plant species. Species belonging to early stages of succession (mostly Labiatae and Cistaceae) were non-preferred by deer. Conversely, the most preferred species belonged mainly to late stages of plant succession. Deer impact on Mediterranean shrublands is causing biotic homogenization of plant communities and is threatening vegetation dynamics by forcing it to return to earlier succession stages. Strict deer population control favouring larger trophies but lower offspring numbers together with an adequate habitat management (increasing grass and acorn availability) would be the most efficient measures to reverse this diversity loss. Restoration work seems only appropriate for the most vulnerable species. We highlight the need of sampling deer-free areas with low or null historical browsing to assess the real impact of deer on woody plant diversity and vegetation dynamics.

AB The surface radiation and energy exchange processes are important drivers of lake evaporation and the associated hydrological cycle. In this paper, we investigated the temporal and spatial variations in evaporation and the associated radiation and energy fluxes across Lake Taihu, China with an eddy covariance mesonet consisting of three lake sites and one land site. The results indicate that on the diurnal scale, water heat storage showed a similar behavior to net radiation with comparable magnitudes and fueled the substantial nighttime evaporation (48% of annual evaporation). Unlike boreal deep lakes, the monthly mean sensible and latent heat flux was tightly coupled with seasonal variations in net radiation at this large (size 2400 km(2)), subtropical (30.9-31.6 degrees N) shallow (mean depth 1.9 m) Lake Taihu. On the monthly to annual scales, the radiation and energy fluxes showed little spatial variations across the lake, indicating a lack of sensitivity to wind speed, water depth, water quality and the presence of submerged macrophytes. The annual mean Bowen ratio (0.12-0.13) of the lake was lower than those found in the literature for subtropical and northern lakes and also much lower than that observed at the adjacent land site (0.58). The experimental data were used to evaluate the performance of 19 lake evaporation models of varying complexities. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Species distribution models are increasingly applied to freshwater ecosystems. Most applications use large scales, coarse resolutions and anthropocentric modelling extents, thus not being able to consider important environmental predictors and ecological processes detectable within a catchment and at finer scales. Moreover, high resolution predictions of species distribution in streams can help improve our understanding of how environmental variables within a catchment affect the distribution of stream macroinvertebrates. We built models at a resolution of 25 m x 25 m for a 488 km(2) catchment in northern Germany to determine whether the spatial approach in which environmental predictors are implemented in the model affects the overall performance. We used predictors from four different categories relevant to freshwater ecosystems: bioclimatic, topographic, hydrologic and land use. Two spatial approaches were tested: a local one, or grid based and a cumulative for the upstream area, or subcatchment specific. Models were evaluated in terms of model performance and accuracy in order to identify the approach best suited for each category, as well as the most important predictor in each. In the case of the land use category, the subcatchment approach made a significant difference, increasing performance. A final model, calibrated with the selected predictors, resulted in the highest model performance and accuracy. Our results indicate that species distribution models perform well and are accurate at high resolutions, within small catchments. We conclude that catchment wide models, especially when using predictors from multiple categories, have the potential to significantly improve modelling framework of species distribution in freshwater ecosystems. The information produced by accurate, small scale, species distribution models can guide managers and conservation practitioners, by predicting the effects of management decisions within a catchment. We suggest that highly resolved predictors be applied in models using the catchment approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Decentralization of governance is an emerging trend in many natural resource sectors in both developed and developing countries. Despite the normative agenda of community-based natural resource management for social and ecological outcomes, a shift to multilevel or polycentric theorizing is warranted. Polycentric governance recognizes the importance of cross-scale interactions, as well as the horizontal and vertical institutional linkages of authority, networks, and markets in which community institutions are embedded. Based on qualitative community forestry research in Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada, this article explores the themes of livelihood and local economy, collaborative forest planning and participation, and environmental governance. Bottom-up empirical evidence suggests that viewing community forestry through a polycentric governance network is necessary for theorizing complex cross-scale dynamics. Incentivizing policies that encourage the development of polycentric systems for natural resource governance is important for maintaining local benefits, while increasing adaptive capacity to deal with complex social-ecological challenges.

AB Trends of biomass production and land processes in the Sahel have been widely studied since the droughts of 1970s. Satellite data have been an important source of information because of limited in situ data. Previous studies relied on the assumed existence of a relationship between vegetation productivity and the NDVI, in particular the annually integrated NDVI (iNDVI). This study examines this assumption and its limitations, based on in situ time series measurements of biomass, species composition, NDVI and soil moisture at the Dahra test site in northern Senegal. It is shown that, there are large differences between the NDVI - vegetation productivity relationships, and these differences can be linked to species composition. There is moderate correlation between NDVI and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) at the peak season (r(2) = 0.39). In particular, the species Zornia glochidiata is characterized by high peak NDVI and low ANPP, compared to other common species such as Cenchrus biflorus and Aristida adscensionis. It is concluded that spatial and temporal variations in species dominance is likely to add noise to the relationship between NDVI and biomass. However, the seasonal cyclic fraction of the NDVI - "small seasonal integral" - reduces such noise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Free-roaming cats are a common element of urban landscapes worldwide, often causing controversy regarding their impacts on ecological systems and public health. We monitored cats within natural habitat fragments in the Chicago metropolitan area to characterize population demographics, disease prevalence, movement patterns and habitat selection, in addition to assessing the possible influence of coyotes on cats. The population was dominated by adults of both sexes, and 24% of adults were in reproductive condition. Annual survival rate was relatively high (S=0.70, SE=0.10), with vehicles and predation the primary causes of death. Size of annual home range varied by sex, but not reproductive status or body weight. We observed partitioning of the landscape by cats and coyotes, with little interspecific overlap between core areas of activity. Coyotes selected for natural habitats whereas cats selected for developed areas such as residences. Free-roaming cats were in better condition than we predicted, but their use of natural habitat fragments, and presumably their ecological impact, appeared to be limited by coyotes through intraguild competition.

AB Background: Some of the most marked temporal fluctuations in species abundances are linked to seasons. In theory, multispecies assemblages can persist if species use shared resources at different times, thereby minimizing interspecific competition. However, there is scant empirical evidence supporting these predictions and, to the best of our knowledge, seasonal variation has never been explored in the context of fluctuation-mediated coexistence.
   Results: Using an exceptionally well-documented estuarine fish assemblage, sampled monthly for over 30 years, we show that temporal shifts in species abundances underpin species coexistence. Species fall into distinct seasonal groups, within which spatial resource use is more heterogeneous than would be expected by chance at those times when competition for food is most intense. We also detect seasonal variation in the richness and evenness of the community, again linked to shifts in resource availability.
   Conclusions: These results reveal that spatiotemporal shifts in community composition minimize competitive interactions and help stabilize total abundance.

AB Questions: Ecosystem functions and underlying services are strongly influenced by multitrophic relationships, with functional traits playing a central role in structuring them. Which traits and functional metrics mediate the impact of different types of land use on ecosystem function within and across trophic levels? \
   Methods: We studied the functional relationships between plants and grasshoppers in sub-alpine grasslands under different management regimes in the Central French Alps. We applied the theoretical multitrophic response-effect framework described by (Journal of Vegetation Science, 24, this issue) to identify key traits linking plants and grasshoppers to biomass production. The linkages between selected plant and grasshopper traits were analysed using community-weighted mean traits (CWM) and functional diversity (FD; Rao's quadratic diversity).
   Results: Uni-and multivariate models provided evidence about the relative importance of trait linkages within and across trophic levels. We showed that management affected both plant and grasshopper traits and that the interaction between themwas linked to biomass production. While a number ofCWMtraits and FD were involved in the interaction, CWM of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and grasshopper dry bodymass (GMass) chieflymediated the impact of management change on biomass production.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that both trait values of the most abundant species and functional trait variation within and across trophic levels in combination may best explain the impact of land-use changes on ecosystem function. To improve ourmechanistic understanding across trophic levels, a better knowledge of response and effect traits remains a major goal, especially for animal ecologists, while a strong collaboration among disciplines is needed to bridge the existing gaps.

AB The contrasting distribution of species diversity across the major lineages of cichlids makes them an ideal group for investigating macroevolutionary processes. In this study, we investigate whether different rates of diversification may explain the disparity in species richness across cichlid lineages globally. We present the most taxonomically robust time-calibrated hypothesis of cichlid evolutionary relationships to date. We then utilize this temporal framework to investigate whether both species-rich and depauperate lineages are associated with rapid shifts in diversification rates and if exceptional species richness can be explained by clade age alone. A single significant rapid rate shift increase is detected within the evolutionary history of the African subfamily Pseudocrenilabrinae, which includes the haplochromins of the East African Great Lakes. Several lineages from the subfamilies Pseudocrenilabrinae (Australotilapiini, Oreochromini) and Cichlinae (Heroini) exhibit exceptional species richness given their clade age, a net rate of diversification, and relative rates of extinction, indicating that clade age alone is not a sufficient explanation for their increased diversity. Our results indicate that the Neotropical Cichlinae includes lineages that have not experienced a significant rapid burst in diversification when compared to certain African lineages (rift lake). Neotropical cichlids have remained comparatively understudied with regard to macroevolutionary patterns relative to African lineages, and our results indicate that of Neotropical lineages, the tribe Heroini may have an elevated rate of diversification in contrast to other Neotropical cichlids. These findings provide insight into our understanding of the diversification patterns across taxonomically disparate lineages in this diverse clade of freshwater fishes and one of the most species-rich families of vertebrates.

AB Species density is higher in the tropics (low latitude) than in temperate regions (high latitude) resulting in a latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG). The LBG must be generated by differential rates of speciation and/or extinction and/or immigration among regions, but the role of each of these processes is still unclear. Recent studies examining differences in rates of molecular evolution have inferred a direct link between rate of molecular evolution and rate of speciation, and postulated these as important drivers of the LBG. Here we review the molecular genetic evidence and examine the factors that might be responsible for differences in rates of molecular evolution. Critical to this is the directionality of the relationship between speciation rates and rates of molecular evolution.

AB Despite African rivers containing high species diversity, continental-scale studies investigating the mechanisms generating biological diversity of African riverine faunas are limited compared with lacustrine systems. To investigate the build-up of diversity in a tropical aquatic continental radiation, we test different models of lineage diversification and reconstruct the biogeographic history in a species-rich siluriform genus, Synodontis (similar to 130 species), with a broad distribution across all major tropical African drainage basins. The resulting robust species-level phylogeny (similar to 60% complete, based on a multigene data set) exhibits a near constant rate of lineage accumulation throughout the mid-Cenozoic to recent, irrespective of missing species and despite the changing environmental conditions that were prevalent during this time period. This pattern contrasts with the findings for species-level diversification of large clades that commonly show an early burst of cladogenesis followed by declining rates through time. The identification of distinct biogeographic clades demonstrates a correlation between river hydrology and cladogenesis, although there is evidence of recent repeat dispersal into the southern range of the focal group. We conclude that diverse freshwater fish radiations with tropical continental distributions represent important organisms to test hypotheses of diversification and investigate the effects of palaeo-landscapes and climates on present day biodiversity.

AB We forecasted potential impacts of climate change on the ability of a network of key sites for bird conservation (Important Bird Areas; IBAs) to provide suitable climate for 370 bird species of current conservation concern in two Asian biodiversity hotspots: the Eastern Himalaya and Lower Mekong. Comparable studies have largely not accounted for uncertainty, which may lead to inappropriate conclusions. We quantified the contribution of four sources of variation (choice of general circulation models, emission scenarios and species distribution modelling methods and variation in species distribution data) to uncertainty in forecasts and tested if our projections were robust to these uncertainties. Declines in the availability of suitable climate within the IBA network by 2100 were forecast as extremely likely' for 45% of species, whereas increases were projected for only 2%. Thus, we predict almost 24 times as many losers' as winners'. However, for no species was suitable climate extremely likely' to be completely lost from the network. Considerable turnover (median=43%, 95% CI=3569%) in species compositions of most IBAs were projected by 2100. Climatic conditions in 47% of IBAs were projected as extremely likely' to become suitable for fewer priority species. However, no IBA was forecast to become suitable for more species. Variation among General Circulation Models and Species Distribution Models contributed most to uncertainty among forecasts. This uncertainty precluded firm conclusions for 53% of species and IBAs because 95% confidence intervals included projections of no change. Considering this uncertainty, however, allows robust recommendations concerning the remaining species and IBAs. Overall, while the IBA network will continue to sustain bird conservation, climate change will modify which species each site will be suitable for. Thus, adaptive management of the network, including modified site conservation strategies and facilitating species' movement among sites, is critical to ensure effective future conservation.

AB Apex carnivores around the world have experienced rapid population declines and local extirpation due to anthropogenic pressures, and they are increasingly restricted to government-protected areas (GPAs). Though GPAs are critical for carnivore conservation, mixed-use landscapes may be crucial for sustaining viable populations. Few studies, particularly in Africa, have examined joint use of a landscape by people and conflict-prone carnivores, such as the African lion (Panthera leo), in a situation where conflict is low. In southern Kenya, we studied a lion population in an unfenced rangeland occupied by the Maasai people and their livestock. The Maasai shift their settlements and grazing areas seasonally across a permanent river, a practice we hypothesized might promote coexistence. We radio-collared lions (n = 6) to determine density and document spatial patterns in response to seasonal movements of people in a Conservation Area and buffer zone (250 km(2)). Despite high livestock density, lion density was comparable to many GPAs (0.136 individuals/km(2)). Lion spatial distribution and habitat selection shifted in relation to seasonal movements of people and livestock. Conflict was low, likely because lions increased their use of the Conservation Area and dense habitats when people were nearby. Lion responses to human movements reduced access to permanent water, but not prey. A land use system based on temporary settlements and grazing areas allowed lions to co-occur with people and livestock at high density. These results suggest a general strategy for the conservation of apex carnivores outside of GPAs, focusing on areas that exhibit spatiotemporal variation in human land use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim The relationship between geographic distance and similarity in species composition is regularly used as a measure of species turnover and beta diversity. Distancedecay analyses are applied, cited and compared despite the variable extent, and different grain sizes of records (e.g. plots, islands, states) are regularly used within such analyses. Currently, differences among distancedecay relationships that cover different grain sizes and extents are attributed to ecological processes that are suspected to operate differently over varying extents and grain sizes. We assess whether the implicit assumption that the distancedecay relation is independent of grain size and study extent is valid, or whether sampling design could be the underlying cause for observed differences. Location An artificial one-dimensional landscape. Methods The distancedecay relationship was quantified in simulated communities. Grain and study extent were varied systematically. In each sampled data set the linear relation of Simpson and Sorensen similarity to geographic distance (on both log-transformed and original scales) between 100 even-sized equidistant plots was assessed using linear regression and generalized linear regression with a log-link function. Regressions were applied either including or removing zero similarities from the data. Results Both the slope (measuring turnover) and the goodness of fit measure r2 (quantifying the influence of space on species composition) of the distancedecay relationship were strongly influenced by grain and study extent. Approaches that are able to cope with zero similarity values of large distance comparisons were less dependent on grain and extent. Main conclusions Reported differences between landscapes detected by current distancedecay measures cannot be explicitly traced back to ecological scale-specific processes. Instead, they can largely be attributed to sampling design and are highly sensitive to grain size and study extent. More appropriate approaches for the study of distancedecay and the understanding of scale-specific processes are required.

AB The extensive number of hydropower dams being planned in southwest China has attracted much attention in recent years. Eight cascading dams along the middle and lower reaches of the Lancang-Mekong River basin were selected to assess the riparian and upland vegetation. A total of 24 transects and 126 quadrats perpendicular to the river channel were surveyed from upstream to downstream. By using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), the vegetation types in this region were classified into 21 vegetation classes. The ecological gradient analysis was completed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and demonstrated that the dominant environmental factors impacting vegetation distribution were the variations in latitude and altitude. The vegetation impact index (VII) was developed as a quantitative index to assess the impact of dam inundation and operation on the upland and riparian vegetation. The values of VII showed that the most endangered vegetation communities were the shrub and herb communities in riparian habitats along this river. The effects of cascading hydropower dams on riparian and upland vegetation distribution were more complex than those of single dams. Cascading hydropower dams can enhance habitat fragmentation, reduce the distribution ranges (latitude and altitude) of primary vegetation and reduce the complexity of the vegetation types along the river as well as induce the loss of primary vegetation in the whole watershed.

AB Introgression in admixed populations can be used to identify candidate loci that might underlie adaptation or reproductive isolation. The Bayesian genomic cline model provides a framework for quantifying variable introgression in admixed populations and identifying regions of the genome with extreme introgression that are potentially associated with variation in fitness. Here we describe the bgc software, which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate the joint posterior probability distribution of the parameters in the Bayesian genomic cline model and designate outlier loci. This software can be used with next-generation sequence data, accounts for uncertainty in genotypic state, and can incorporate information from linked loci on a genetic map. Output from the analysis is written to an HDF5 file for efficient storage and manipulation. This software is written in C++.

AB Projected climate changes and expansion of viticulture to drier regions justify the installation and management of deficit irrigation (DI) strategies. Contradictory results on the effect of DI on crops may be ascribed to the incorrect application of these techniques. The lack of discrimination between basal crop (K (cb)) and stress coefficients (K (s)) can be an obstacle to proper irrigation management. A sap flow (SF) technique associated with microlysimeters and eddy covariance (EC) methods was applied to five commercial vineyards, aiming to discriminate those coefficients, during the driest period of the vegetative cycle. A comparative analysis of the coefficients, in relation to measured vegetation parameters (for K (cb)) and plant water status (for K (s)) is presented. K (cb), ranging from about 0.35 to 0.75, was highly correlated with leaf area index at stand level. K (s), which decreased till 0.2 in the most stressed vineyard, was well correlated to plant water status (K (s) function), represented by predawn leaf water potential. K (s) functions for the different experiments exhibited falling slopes with decreasing water status, with variable trends depending on the rates of maximal crop transpiration (T (m)). These experimental results show that specific parameters for K (s) functions, necessary to estimate water use and irrigation depths, in order to control the stress levels in DI scheduling, are also dependent on T (m).

AB Roughly 40 years after its introduction, the metapopulation concept is central to population ecology. The notion that local populations and their dynamics may be coupled by dispersal is without any doubt of great importance for our understanding of population-level processes.
   A metapopulation describes a set of subpopulations linked by (rare) dispersal events in a dynamic equilibrium of extinctions and recolonizations. In the large body of literature that has accumulated, the term "metapopulation'' is often used in a very broad sense; most of the time it simply implies spatial heterogeneity. A number of reviews have recently addressed this problem and have pointed out that, despite the large and still growing popularity of the metapopulation concept, there are only very few empirical examples that conform with the strict classical metapopulation (CM) definition.
   In order to understand this discrepancy between theory and observation, we use an individual-based modeling approach that allows us to pinpoint the environmental conditions and the life-history attributes required for the emergence of a CM structure. We find that CM dynamics are restricted to a specific parameter range at the border between spatially structured but completely occupied and globally extinct populations. Considering general life-history attributes, our simulations suggest that CMs are more likely to occur in arthropod species than in (large) vertebrates.
   Since the specific type of spatial population structure determines conservation concepts, our findings have important implications for conservation biology. Our model suggests that most spatially structured populations are panmictic, patchy, or of mainland-island type, which makes efforts spent on increasing connectivity (e.g., corridors) questionable. If one does observe a true CM structure, this means that the focal metapopulation is on the brink of extinction and that drastic conservation measures are needed.

AB The green rice leafhopper Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) is a commonly distributed pest of rice in East Asia. Early histological studies describe the presence of two bacteriome-associated symbionts and a rickettsial microorganism in N. cincticeps, but their microbiological affiliations have been elusive. We identified these bacterial symbionts using modern microbiological techniques. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from dissected bacteriomes yielded two major and a minor bacterial sequences: a major sequence was placed in the Bacteroidetes clade of Sulcia muelleri, an ancient symbiont lineage associated with diverse hemipteran insects; another major sequence was allied to a beta-proteobacterial sequence from a leafhopper Matsumuratettix hiroglyphicus; the minor sequence fell in the alpha-proteobacterial genus Rickettsia. In situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy showed that the Sulcia symbiont and the beta-proteobacterial symbiont are harbored within different types of bacteriocytes that constitute the outer and inner regions of the bacteriome, respectively. Oral administration of tetracycline to nymphal N. cincticeps resulted in retarded growth, high mortality rates, and failure in adult emergence, suggesting important biological roles of the symbionts for the host insect. The designation Candidatus Nasuia deltocephalinicola is proposed for the beta-proteobacterial symbiont clade associated with N. cincticeps and allied leafhoppers of the subfamily Deltocephalinae.

AB Social structure, limited dispersal, and spatial heterogeneity in resources are ubiquitous in wild vertebrate populations. As a result, relatives share environments as well as genes, and environmental and genetic sources of similarity between individuals are potentially confounded. Quantitative genetic studies in the wild therefore typically account for easily captured shared environmental effects (e.g., parent, nest, or region). Fine-scale spatial effects are likely to be just as important in wild vertebrates, but have been largely ignored. We used data from wild red deer to build animal models to estimate additive genetic variance and heritability in four female traits (spring and rut home range size, offspring birth weight, and lifetime breeding success). We then, separately, incorporated spatial autocorrelation and a matrix of home range overlap into these models to estimate the effect of location or shared habitat on phenotypic variation. These terms explained a substantial amount of variation in all traits and their inclusion resulted in reductions in heritability estimates, up to an order of magnitude up for home range size. Our results highlight the potential of multiple covariance matrices to dissect environmental, social, and genetic contributions to phenotypic variation, and the importance of considering fine-scale spatial processes in quantitative genetic studies.

AB Baselga [Partitioning the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19, 134143, 2010] proposed pairwise (beta nes) and multiple-site (beta NES) beta-diversity measures to account for the nestedness component of beta diversity. We used empirical, randomly created and idealized matrices to show that both measures are only partially related to nestedness and do not fit certain fundamental requirements for consideration as true nestedness-resultant dissimilarity measures. Both beta nes and beta NES are influenced by matrix size and fill, and increase or decrease even when nestedness remains constant. Additionally, we demonstrate that beta NES can yield high values even for matrices with no nestedness. We conclude that beta nes and beta NES are not true measures of the nestedness-resultant dissimilarity between sites. Actually, they quantify how differences in species richness that are not due to species replacement contribute to patterns of beta diversity. Finally, because nestedness is a special case of dissimilarity in species composition due to ordered species loss (or gain), the extent to which differences in species composition is due to nestedness can be measured through an index of nestedness.

AB Restoration of degraded land has been identified as a top research priority in conservation. Fauna plays a critical role in the re-establishment of a functional ecosystem, yet fauna recolonization of restored areas is less studied than flora. We reviewed the findings of 71 publications on fauna recolonization, through the example of mining rehabilitation in the Australian continent, a global stronghold of large-scale mining.
   Species densities and richness were frequently lower in rehabilitated compared to undisturbed areas, even more so when only native species were considered. Amongst all criteria used to measure success, recovery of the pre-mining fauna community composition was the hardest to achieve. Introduced species were often found in rehabilitated areas but further research is needed to determine the duration of this association. Meta-analyses of the factors influencing mining rehabilitation success for fauna revealed that fauna groups recolonized heterogeneously. Recolonization was dependent on the methods used to rehabilitate and the number of years since rehabilitation. Notably, methods combining the use of fresh topsoil with the addition of seeds and seedlings were most successful for fauna recolonization, both in term of fauna density and richness.
   Limitations to this review included strong biases toward certain mining companies, as well as missing data, which decreased the power of meta-analysis. Available publications did not evenly represent all fauna taxa and studies were short when compared to the time needed to re-construct whole ecosystems. We consider the development of comprehensive fauna standards for assessing rehabilitation success critical. This could be the next challenge in restoration ecology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Delayed planting date and unfavorable environmental conditions have a negative effect on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] growth, development, and yield. Changes in photoperiod, temperature, and precipitation with delayed planting affect the duration ofvegetative and reproductive stages, number of branches and pods, plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and hence the grain yield. Delayed planting can also affect the soybean seed quality by changing the oil and protein content. Environmental factors like extremely high temperature and drought stress, which are often associated with delayed planting, have also a negative effect on plant development and yield. Compared to optimum air temperature, reduction in photosynthetic rate during heat stress decreases seed set and size, and seed yield. Drought stress during reproductive stages reduces carbon dioxide exchange rate (CER), photosynthesis, sugar production, and flow of metabolites to the expanding cells, which increases flower and pod abortion and decreases vegetative growth, duration of the seed filling stage, seed number, and seed size. Generally, the combined effect of photoperiod, temperature, and precipitation with delayed planting most likely contributes to decreased duration of vegetative and reproductive growth stages, reduced photosynthesis and plant growth, and therefore significant reduction in grain yield of soybean.

AB The European Landscape Convention (ELC) brings the social dimension of landscapes to the forefront of its definition of landscape. Landscape indicators need to take this requirement into account. Landscape fragmentation, which is one of the most widespread landscape processes in Europe, has been studied in both conservation biology and landscape ecology disciplines. Quantitative indicators capable of measuring landscape patterns and changes are used to examine landscape fragmentation and assess the impact on the environment and biodiversity. In addition, qualitative indicators are used to measure the social dimension and perception of landscape fragmentation by humans (with little connection to ecological processes). In this article, we summarize and analyze the current assessments used to study landscape fragmentation. We report the strengths, limitations, successes and challenges of the quantitative and perceptive approaches and provide insight into the possibilities and potential of combining these approaches into one assessment. Based on the existing literature and pioneering integrative approaches, we conclude that it is convenient and feasible to design an indicator of landscape fragmentation that is consistent with the ELC framework. This indicator would be informative of changes in the landscape pattern and meaningful for land planners and society as a whole. Such an indicator, however, should be constrained in scope to focus on people and our unique perception of scale, visual fragmentation, and human societal context and cultural background.

AB Water limited ecohydrological systems (WLES), with their broad extent, large stores of global terrestrial carbon, potential for large instantaneous fluxes of carbon and water, sensitivity to environmental changes, and likely global expansion, are particularly important ecohydrological systems. Strong nonlinear responses to environmental variability characterize WLES, and the resulting complexity of system dynamics has challenged research focussed on general understanding and site specific predictions. To address this challenge our synthesis brings together current views of complexity from ecological and hydrological sciences to look towards a framework for understanding ecohydrological systems (in particular WLES) as complex adaptive systems (CAS). This synthesis suggests that WLES have many properties similar to CAS. In addition to exhibiting feedbacks, thresholds, and hysteresis, the functioning of WLES is strongly affected by self-organization of both vertical and horizontal structure across multiple scales. As a CAS, key variables for understanding WLES dynamics are related to their potential for adaptation, resistance to variability, and resilience to state changes. Several essential components of CAS, including potential for adaptation and rapid changes between states, pose challenges for modelling and generating predictions of WLES. Model evaluation and predictable quantities may need to focus more directly on temporal or spatial variance in contrast to mean state values for success at understanding system-level characteristics. How coupled climate and vegetation changes will alter available soil, surface and groundwater supplies, and overall biogeochemistry will reflect how self-organizational ecohydrological processes differentially partition precipitation and overall net metabolic functioning.

AB Some species have disproportionate influence on assemblage structure, given their numbers or biomass. Most examples of such "strong interactors'' come from small-scale experiments or from observations of the effects of invasive species. There is evidence that entire avian assemblages in open woodlands can be influenced strongly by individual species over very large areas in eastern Australia, with small-bodied species (<50 g) being adversely affected. We used data from repeated surveys in 371 sites in seven districts across a region from Victoria to Queensland (>2000 km). A series of linked Bayesian models was used to identify large-bodied (>= 50 g) bird species that were associated with changes in occurrence and abundance of small-bodied species. One native species, the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala; family Meliphagidae), was objectively identified as the sole large-bodied species having similar detrimental effects in all districts, depressing occurrence of 57 of 71 small-bodied species. Adverse effects on abundances of small-bodied species were profound when the Noisy Miner occurred with mean site abundances >= 1.6 birds/2 ha. The Noisy Miner may be the first species to have been shown to influence whole-of-avifauna assemblage structure through despotic aggressiveness over subcontinental scales. These substantial shifts in occurrence rates and abundances of small-bodied species flow on to alter species abundance distributions of entire assemblages over much of eastern Australia.

AB During the Oligocene-Miocene Greenhouse-to-Icehouse climatic transition, the biogeography of reef corals or zooxanthellate-like scleractinian corals was gradually changing from a pan-tropical Tethyan Province in the Eocene to three reef-coral Provinces of the Western Atlantic-Caribbean, Indo-Pacific and Mediterranean. Our REEFCORAL database encompasses updated and homogenized data on paleoenvironmental and systematics of scleractinian corals occurring in the Oligocene and Miocene outcrops from circum-Mediterranean regions, provided by most of relatively recently published data in the literature and by the study of published and unpublished collections of coral specimens from the same area, including the important collections housed at the MNHN (Paris) and our own collections. As there is no validated direct criterion for the identification of the coral-zooxanthellate symbiosis in the fossil record, and considering the difficulty to use the biogeochemical approaches in the context of this study, the subjectivity of the morphological criteria and the relative recent age of the fossil corals we are dealing with, a uniformitarian approach has been used for inferring the symbiotic status of scleractinian genera in REEFCORAL Among the 158 genera included in our database, 93 can be considered as zooxanthellate and 10 have a doubtful zooxanthellate status. This relatively exhaustive database was used to reconstruct the temporal and spatial distribution of scleractinian corals in the Mediterranean during the Oligocene-Miocene time in order to discuss the interplaying effects of the global cooling at that time, the re-organization of the Tethyan realm resulting from the African, Arabian and Eurasian plate collision and the emergence of the Alpine chains, driving the gradual northward movement of the whole region outside the tropical/subtropical belt.
   It is shown that the structure of the Mediterranean z-coral Oligocene-Miocene paleobiodiversity was characterized by many geographically-restricted genera with a moderate to short stratigraphical range and a few long-ranging widespread genera. A major consequence of this structure is that the extinction pattern has proceeded through the preferential extinction of rare-occurrence genera through time. The potential rapid long-distance dispersal of most coral larvae compared to the size of the Oligocene-Miocene Mediterranean, explains why no biogeographical subprovinces can be distinguished for the z-coral fauna. On a local scale, ecological processes tend to sort coral taxa by limiting z-coral development to geographically restricted and discontinuous areas. This accounts for the large amount of geographically-restricted taxa forming the Mediterranean coral fauna.
   The interaction of plate-tectonics, Alpine orogenesis and climate at local to subregional scales exerts strong controls over the spatio-temporal distribution of z-coral assemblages within the circum-Mediterranean realm. In particular, we suggest that the richness and composition of the Eastern Atlantic coral fauna are indirectly related to the opening and closure of the eastern seaway connection with the Indian Ocean, which controlled the E-W circulation of surface waters and hence the westwards dispersal of pelagic larvae. At the scale of the whole region, the gradual regional climatic change produced by the northwards migration of the entire area, superimposed on the global cooling, appears in large part responsible for the extinction pattern of z-corals through time in the Mediterranean biogeographical Province.

AB Prescribed burning is commonly used in forests to reduce fuel load, prevent encroachment of exotic species, maintain biological diversity and improve wildlife habitat. The low intensity burns that are conducted at intervals of 1-10 years may have long-term effects on the abiotic and biotic components of the soil. We assessed how prescribed burning altered litter, soil physical and chemical properties, and soil microbial communities in upland oak forests subjected to prescribed burning at frequencies of 0 (unburned), 2.5 and 5 fires per decade (FPD) over a 20 year period. Prescribed burning at 5 FPD reduced soil organic matter by 60% and soil organic carbon by 64% and increased bulk density by 20%. Compared to unburned controls, litter nitrogen was reduced by 20% and 21% and C/N ratio increased by 25% and 28% in sites burned at 2.5 and 5 FPD, respectively. Litter lignin/N ratio was reduced 28% at 2.5 FPD, compared to litter from unburned sites. We found no changes in soil pH, total N, NO3-N, NH3-N, plant-available Ps or K due to prescribed burning. Microbial biomass of Gram negative bacteria, as determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses, decreased from 25% of biomarker abundance at the unburned sites to 20% at the 5 FPD sites. No other microbial functional group was significantly influenced by fire frequency. Our results indicate prescribed burning with low intensity fires in upland oak forests do not have major effects on the soils if these fires occur infrequently, i.e. less frequent than 2.5 FPD. However, frequent burning of these upland oak forests (5 FPD) resulted in important changes in the litter and soil that may adversely affect litter decomposition rates, soil carbon storage, soil water holding capacity, and soil erosion rates. Our findings indicate prescribed burning can be an important management tool, however, at high fire frequencies there may be tradeoffs between vegetation management goals and long-term adverse affects on the soil.

AB The importance of soil organic matter (SOM) in the global carbon (C) cycle has been highlighted by many studies, but the way in which SOM stabilization processes and chemical composition affect decomposition rates under natural climatic conditions is not yet well understood. To relate the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration to the decomposition potential of SOM, we compared temperature sensitivities of respiration rates from a 2-year long soil translocation experiment from four elevations along a similar to 3000 m tropical forest gradient. We determined SOM stabilization mechanisms and the molecular structure of soil C from different horizons collected before and after the translocation. Soil samples were analysed by physical fractionation procedures, C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The temperature sensitivity (Q (10)) of heterotrophic soil respiration at the four sites along the elevation transect did not correlate with either the available amount of SOM or its chemical structure. Only the relative distribution of C into physical soil fractions correlated with Q (10) values. We therefore conclude that physical fractionation of soil samples is the most appropriate way to assess the temperature sensitivity of SOM.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important tool in biogeography and ecology and are widely used for both fundamental and applied research purposes. SDMs require spatially explicit information about species occurrence and environmental covariates to produce a set of rules that identify and scale the environmental space where the species was observed and that can further be used to predict the suitability of a site for the species. More spatially accurate data are increasingly available, and the number of publications on the influence of spatial inaccuracies on the performance of modelling procedures is growing exponentially. Three main sources of uncertainty are associated with the three elements of a predictive function: the dependent variable, the explanatory variables and the algorithm or function used to relate these two variables. In this study, we review how spatial uncertainties influence model accuracy and we propose some methodological issues in the application of SDMs with regard to the modelling of fundamental and realized niches of species. We distinguish two cases suitable for different types of spatial data accuracy. For modelling the realized distribution of a species, particularly for management and conservation purposes, we suggest using only accurate species occurrence data and large sample sizes. Appropriate data filtering and examination of the spatial autocorrelation in predictors should be a routine procedure to minimize the possible influence of positional uncertainty in species occurrence data. However, if the data are sparse, models of the potential distribution of species can be created using a relatively small sample size, and this can provide a generalized indication of the main regional drivers of the distribution patterns. By this means, field surveys can be targeted to discover unknown populations and species in poorly surveyed regions in order to improve the robustness of the data for later modelling of the realized distributions. Based on this review, we conclude that (1) with data that are currently available, studies performed at a resolution of 1-100 km(2) are useful for hypothesizing about the environmental conditions that limit the distribution of a species and (2) incorporating coarse resolution species occurrence data in a model, despite an increase in sample size, lowers model performance.

AB Competition over food and space is a primary driver of human-wildlife conflict. In the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) have adapted to a human-modified environment, sleeping on the urban edge and raiding anthropogenic food sources on a daily basis. Human monitors, who herd baboons away from residential areas, are currently the preferred method of conflict mitigation. However, this method is costly and suffers from short-term interruptions, wherein the unexpected absence of monitors may lead to unprepared residents using lethal force to deter raiding baboons. Elsewhere in the chacma baboon distribution (in nonconflict areas), artificial food patches have been shown to alter troop movements drastically by eliciting consistent leadership behavior from alpha males. We investigated whether an artificial patch could be used to draw baboons away from the urban environment in the absence of monitors. First, we introduced an artificial food patch into natural land within a troop's range and monitored movement and activity patterns. Although the troop utilized the patch, there was not a significant decline in use of the urban space as they continued to favor food in urban waste sites. Maintaining the patch, we then restricted access to these waste sites using wire-mesh fencing and observed a significant reduction in the time the troop spent within the urban space. In both experimental phases we observed consistent leadership, with dominant individuals arriving first at the patch and monopolizing food items thereon. Thus, we recommend the combined strategy of reducing raiding incentives in conjunction with provisioning as a short-term, cost-effective strategy to alter a baboon troop's movement patterns and raiding frequency.

AB The soundscape is proposed as a phenomenological entity with which to investigate environmental complexity. In particular, the avian soundtope, which is defined as a place in which sound is intentionally structured by different bird species, is regarded as an agency acting to achieve several goals. In fact, the soundtope could be viewed as a special case of an eco-field used by birds, not only to establish territorial ownership and patrol an area but also as a means of locating and evaluating the availability of many other material and immaterial resources. The meaning of the multifaceted acoustic pattern produced by bird communities during the breeding season is discussed here under the acoustic niche hypothesis in terms of community coalescence and the permanent establishment of an inter-specific communication network. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal dimensions of a bird soundscape have also been analyzed and discussed in terms of their relationship with environmental proxies. A new Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), coupled with the implementation (ACI plug-in) of a specific sound editor (WaveSurfer (c)), is proposed as a way of processing sound data efficiently, thus providing new opportunities to use the bird soundscape signature for landscape characterization and describing the ecological dynamics of long-term monitoring schemes.

AB Marine reserves are the primary management tool for Guam's reef fish fishery. While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations.

AB Benthic communities show changes in composition and structure across different environmental characteristics and habitats. However, incorporating species biological traits into the analysis can provide a better understanding of system functioning within habitats. We compare the functional diversity of macrobenthic communities from a contrasting shallow (15 m) and deep (50 m) sublittoral soft-sediment habitats in northern Chile, using biological traits analysis. Our aim was to highlight the biological characteristics responsible for differences between habitats and the implications for ecosystem functioning. Trait analysis showed that the deep habitat was restricted in providing functionally important biogenic structure and bioturbation and supports less diverse feeding-related energy pathways. The shallow habitat is characterized by more diverse energy pathways and a higher potential for matter exchange through bioturbation. We provide support to the predictions of transfer of energy from the benthos to upper trophic levels in the shallow, which is characterized mainly by normoxia and little organic matter content in the sediment. In the deep habitat, characterized by hypoxia and more organic matter, energy appears to be transferred to microbial components. We suggest that trait analysis should be added to the traditional approaches based on species diversity, because it provides indicators of ecosystem stress.

AB 1. Large-scale comparative studies of ecological responses to anthropological stressors in rivers require measures that are consistent across a range of spatial scales. The biological trait profile of communities offers an alternative approach to traditional measures of macroinvertebrate taxonomic identity and is less constrained by biogeographic influences.
   2. We compared the capacities of taxonomic composition and biological trait composition to discriminate the effects of land use (measured as percentage of the catchment in pasture) across a large geographic zone (the whole of New Zealand) in 30 sub-catchments grouped into five ecoregions throughout the North and South Islands of New Zealand. In addition, we investigated trait consistency (i.e. whether similar traits had similar trait responses to land use at local (catchment) and broad scales).
   3. The analysis of taxonomic composition showed that community structure was indeed influenced by land-use intensity, but that relationships differed among ecoregions. In contrast, traditional assessment metrics (Macroinvertebrate Community Index, richness in Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa) and trait composition were uninfluenced by region. Trait responses were consistent at the broad and catchment scales, with similar traits responding to pastoral land use at both scales.
   4. We used general linear modelling to investigate individual trait responses to land-use intensity, catchment area and region, focussing on 15 trait categories known to be influenced by land-use intensity at the catchment scale. Several trait categories varied with land-use intensity and demonstrated consistency at both catchment and broad scales. Of these, the representation of shorter generation time, asexual reproduction and hermaphroditism, ability to lay eggs beneath the water surface, egg protection and respiration types tolerant of oxygen depletion generally increased in assemblages exposed to more intense pastoral land use. At the same time, the representation of short life duration of adults, prevalence of laying eggs at the water surface, sexual reproduction and low body flexibility decreased in assemblages exposed to land-use intensification.

AB Remotely sensed, multiannual data sets of shortwave radiative surface fluxes are now available for assimilation into land surface schemes (LSSs) of climate and/or numerical weather prediction models. The RAMI4PILPS suite of virtual experiments assesses the accuracy and consistency of the radiative transfer formulations that provide the magnitudes of absorbed, reflected, and transmitted shortwave radiative fluxes in LSSs. RAMI4PILPS evaluates models under perfectly controlled experimental conditions in order to eliminate uncertainties arising from an incomplete or erroneous knowledge of the structural, spectral and illumination related canopy characteristics typical for model comparison with in situ observations. More specifically, the shortwave radiation is separated into a visible and near-infrared spectral region, and the quality of the simulated radiative fluxes is evaluated by direct comparison with a 3-D Monte Carlo reference model identified during the third phase of the Radiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) exercise. The RAMI4PILPS setup thus allows to focus in particular on the numerical accuracy of shortwave radiative transfer formulations and to pinpoint to areas where future model improvements should concentrate. The impact of increasing degrees of structural and spectral subgrid variability on the simulated fluxes is documented and the relevance of any thus emerging biases with respect to gross primary production estimates and shortwave radiative forcings due to snow and fire events are investigated.

AB The patterns of hybridization and asymmetrical gene flow among species are important for understanding the processes that maintain distinct species. We examined the potential for asymmetrical gene flow in sympatric populations of Eucalyptus aggregata and Eucalyptus rubida, both long-lived trees of southern Australia. A total of 421 adults from three hybrid zones were genotyped with six microsatellite markers. We used genealogical assignments, admixture analysis and analyses of spatial genetic structure and spatial distribution of individuals, to assess patterns of interspecific gene flow within populations. A high number of admixed individuals were detected (13.9-40% of individuals), with hybrid populations consisting of F(1) and F(2) hybrids and back-crosses in both parental directions. Across the three sites, admixture proportions were skewed towards the E. aggregata genetic cluster (x = 0.56-0.65), indicating that back-crossing towards E. aggregata is more frequent. Estimates of long-term migration rates also indicate asymmetric gene flow, with higher migration rates from E. aggregata to hybrids compared with E. rubida. Taken together, these results indicate a greater genetic input from E. aggregata into the hybrid populations. This asymmetry probably reflects differences in style lengths (E. rubida: similar to 7mm, E. aggregata: similar to 4mm), which can prevent pollen tubes of smaller-flowered species from fertilizing larger-flowered species. However, analyses of fine-scale genetic structure suggest that localized seed dispersal (< 40 m) and greater clustering between hybrid and E. aggregata individuals may also contribute to directional gene flow. Our study highlights that floral traits and the spatial distributions of individuals can be useful predictors of the directionality of interspecific gene flow in plant populations.

AB Aim
   Vegetation plots collected since the early 20th century and stored in large vegetation databases are an important source of ecological information. These databases are used for analyses of vegetation diversity and estimation of vegetation parameters, however such analyses can be biased due to preferential sampling of the original data. In contrast, modern vegetation survey increasingly uses stratified-random instead of preferential sampling. To explore how these two sampling schemes affect vegetation analyses, we compare parameters of vegetation diversity based on preferentially sampled plots from a large vegetation database with those based on stratified-random sampling.
   Location
   Moravian Karst and Silesia, Czech Republic.
   Methods
   We compared two parallel analyses of forest vegetation, one based on preferentially sampled plots taken from a national vegetation database and the other on plots sampled in the field according to a stratified-random design. We repeated this comparison for two different regions in the Czech Republic. We focussed on vegetation properties commonly analysed using data from large vegetation databases, including alpha (within-plot) diversity, cover and participation of different species groups, such as endangered and alien species within plots, total species richness of data sets, beta diversity and ordination patterns.
   Results
   The preferentially sampled data sets obtained from the database contained more endangered species and had higher beta diversity, whereas estimates of alpha diversity and representation of alien species were not consistently different between preferentially and stratified-randomly sampled data sets. In ordinations, plots from the preferential samples tended to be more common at margins of plot scatters.
   Conclusions
   Vegetation data stored in large databases are influenced by researcher subjectivity in plot positioning, but we demonstrated that not all of their properties necessarily differ from data sets obtained by stratified-random sampling. This indicates the value of vegetation databases for use in biodiversity studies; however, some analyses based on these databases are clearly biased and their results must be interpreted with caution.

AB Niche partitioning by time, space and chemical forms has been suggested as an important mechanism to maintain species coexistence. Climate warming is assumed to increase soil nutrient availability through enhancing mineralization of soil organic matter in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems. However, few studies have yet examined how dominant plant species contribute to species coexistence when nutrient enrichment occurs in native ecosystems. We studied a single fairy ring (5 m diameter) in a Kobresia meadow in the Tibetan Plateau. This kind of rings is caused by a basidiomycete fungus Agaricus campestris, and is evidenced by dark-green vegetation boundaries. Nutrient enrichment occurs due to enhanced decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) in the fungus growth zone of these rings. We conducted a short-term N-15 labelling experiment and found that dominant plant species shifted their N uptake patterns and preferred N form (NO (3) (-) , NH (4) (+) , and amino acid N) in response to nutrient enrichment in an N-limited alpine meadow. The legume Gueldenstaedtia diversifolia had the lowest aboveground biomass among the five plant species studied at low available N level, although it mainly utilized ammonium (the most abundant N form). The two graminoids (Elymus nutans and Stipa aliena) demonstrated similar aboveground biomass at low and high available N levels, showing a similar pattern switching from NH (4) (+) /NO (3) (-) uptake outside the ring to glycine uptake in the annulus zone of the ring. The biomass of the forb Gentiana straminea differed significantly at low and high available N levels, but its N uptake pattern almost remained unchanged. Species therefore differed in their response to nutrient enrichment, most species showing chemical niche shifts instead of niche conservatism. This finding has important implications with regard to understanding the mechanisms responsible for species coexistence when natural nutrient enrichment is induced by climate warming in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB The humic substances are an abundant and important part of soil organic matter which plays many roles in ecosystems. On the other hand, forest fires are known to have a potential impact on the soil organic matter. Consequently, we chose to study the impact of forest fires on humic substances and the three relevant fractions, e.g. humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and non-humified fraction (NHF), NHF being the fulvic acids not adsorbed on XAD-8 resins. The studied site is a Mediterranean forest called "Maures Mountains", in France, where 30 sites were sampled in two layers: 0-5 and 5 to 15 cm. In order to validate the method, the 2 horizons from 5 sites randomly chosen were analyzed in triplicates. The extraction and fractionation procedures were achieved using alkali- and acid-solutions. The measurement of total organic carbon (TOC) using the TOC-meter and the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy gave us quantitative and qualitative results to evaluate the impact of forest fires and the role of their repetition. The results show that the fires led to significant decreases (Student test, P=0.05) of humic substances (HS), HA and of the fulvic fractions (FF=FA+NHF) in surface layers, corresponding to 40%, 34% and 35%, respectively. Moreover, the significant HA/FF ratio increases (Student test, P=0.05), as a result of the fire, indicate that NHF was probably transformed in FA-like compounds. About the qualitative impact, the results showed a significant decrease of alkyl and hydroxyl groups (OH), carboxylic acids and carbohydrates in HA after a wildfire, whereas the decrease was significant only for alkyl groups and carboxylic acids in FA. Lastly, the design of this work (control and burned sites, number of samples, time elapsed after fires, etc.) enables one to show the recovery of the Mediterranean forest ecosystem. FA quality and OH groups in HA are recovered between 3 and 16 years after the fire whereas alkyl groups, carboxylic acids and carbohydrates in HA as well as HS contents are not returned to the control state 16 years after the last fire.

AB Surface (0-5 cm) and subsurface (-5 to 15 cm) soils from burned forest areas in South of France were analyzed to determine contents of 14 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their distribution profile. The sampling procedure allowed us to study the effect of the frequency of fire as well as the influence of the time elapsed since the last fire. The contribution of forest fires to the content of PAHs in soils was demonstrated, as well as the decrease of their total level with time. The hypothesis is that a natural remediation takes place a few years after the last fire event. The lowest molecular weight studied PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphtene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene) appear to be the major ones produced by forest fire. Naphtalene levels are remarkably high in burned soils (more than 70 mu g kg(-1), i.e. more than 20 times higher than in the control soils) and still remain important years after the last fire event. The time elapsed since the last fire appears to be a more influencing factor than the fire frequency. The index defined from the PAH levels shows values reflecting the time elapsed since the last fire. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An improved knowledge of how contrasting types of plant communities and their associated soil biota differ in their responses to climatic variables is important for better understanding the future impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Elevational gradients serve as powerful study systems for answering questions on how ecological processes can be affected by changes in temperature and associated climatic variables. In this study, we evaluated how plant and soil microbial communities, and abiotic soil properties, change with increasing elevation in subarctic tundra in northern Sweden, for each of two dominant but highly contrasting vegetation types, namely heath (dominated by woody dwarf shrubs) and meadow (dominated by herbaceous species). To achieve this, we measured plant community characteristics, microbial community properties and several soil abiotic properties for both vegetation types across an elevation gradient of 500 to 1000 m. We found that the two vegetation types differed not only in several above- and belowground properties, but also in how these properties responded to elevation, pointing to important interactive effects between vegetation type and elevation. Specifically, for the heath, available soil nitrogen and phosphorus decreased with elevation whereas fungal dominance increased, while for the meadow, idiosyncratic responses to elevation for these variables were found. These differences in belowground responses to elevation among vegetation types were linked to shifts in the species and functional group composition of the vegetation. Our results highlight that these two dominant vegetation types in subarctic tundra differ greatly not only in fundamental aboveground and belowground properties, but also in how these properties respond to elevation and are therefore likely to be influenced by temperature. As such they highlight that vegetation type, and the soil abiotic properties that determine this, may serve as powerful determinants of how both aboveground and belowground properties respond to strong environmental gradients.

AB Several of the major processes that result in N loss from soil (nitrification, ammonia volatilization, and denitrification) discriminate against N-15 and fractionate the stable N isotopes, thus delta N-15 of ecosystem components has been suggested as an indicator of ecosystem N leakiness. This concept has been applied more successfully to native systems (primarily forest) than to managed systems where N inputs are greater and N cycling processes have potentially been modified. We analysed 210 New Zealand soils (0-100 mm depth) from different land-use systems (increasing in intensity of land use management from indigenous, to plantation forestry, pasture under drystock, pasture under dairy, and cropping) for delta N-15 and measures of N availability (total N. C/N, and N mineralization) to determine whether increasing intensity of land use management would lead to increased soil delta N-15 values. Mean soil delta N-15 differed between land uses with intensively managed cropping having the highest mean soil delta N-15 (6.2 parts per thousand) followed by dairy (5.4 parts per thousand), drystock (3.8 parts per thousand), forestry (2.8 parts per thousand) and indigenous forests (2.1 parts per thousand). Over all land uses there was a negative correlation between delta N-15 and the soil C/N ratio (rho = -0.73) and regression analysis indicated a relatively strong linear relationship between delta N-15 and C/N (r(2) = 0.56, P < 0.001) when cropping sites (where significant loss of soil C had occurred), and sites with C/N ratio >18 were excluded. Typical N balances for each land use showed that total N loss (and in particular fractionating N losses from ammonia volatilization and nitrate leaching) also increased with increasing land-use intensity. Our. results indicate that soil delta N-15 may be a useful tool in assessing potential N losses in different soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is little comprehensive information on the distribution of root systems among coexisting species, despite the expected importance of those distributions in determining the composition and diversity of plant communities. This gap in knowledge is particularly acute for grasslands, which possess large numbers of species with morphologically indistinguishable roots. In this study we adapted a molecular method, fluorescent fragment length polymorphism, to identify root fragments and determine species root distributions in two grasslands in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Aboveground biomass was measured, and soil cores (2 cm in diameter) were collected to depths of 40 cm and 90 cm in an upland, dry grassland and a mesic, slope-bottom grassland, respectively, at peak foliar expansion. Cores were subdivided, and species that occurred in each 10-cm interval were identified. The results indicated that the average number of species in 10-cm intervals (31 cm(3)) throughout the sampled soil profile was 3.9 and 2.8 species at a dry grassland and a mesic grassland, respectively. By contrast, there was an average of 6.7 and 14.1 species per 0.5 m(2), determined by the presence of shoot material, at dry and mesic sites, respectively. There was no relationship between soil depth and number of species per 10-cm interval in either grassland, despite the exponential decline of root biomass with soil depth at both sites. There also was no relationship between root frequency (i.e., the percentage of samples in which a species occurred) and soil depth for the vast majority of species at both sites. The preponderance of species were distributed throughout the soil profile at both sites. Assembly analyses indicated that species root occurrences were randomly assorted in all soil intervals at both sites, with the exception that Festuca idahoensis segregated from Artemisia tridentata and Pseudoroegnaria spicata in 10-20 cm soil at the dry grassland. Root frequency throughout the entire sampled soil profile was positively associated with shoot biomass among species. Together these results indicated the importance of large, well-proliferated root systems in establishing aboveground dominance. The findings suggest that spatial belowground segregation of species probably plays a minor role in fostering resource partitioning and species coexistence in these YNP grasslands.

AB Species from many different habitats are responding to recent climate change. Mountainous areas are of particular interest as they provide pronounced gradients and have experienced above-average temperature increases. Data from the beginning of the 20th century of both the upper and lower range limits of plants of the European Alps were updated a century later and analyzed in order to identify common trends and deviating patterns of shifts at opposing ends of species' ranges. At the upper limit, there was a strong trend towards an increase in species richness per summit, including 33 species that were recorded for the first time on any of the investigated summit areas. The species experienced a consistent upward shift exceeding 100 elevational meters, and 49 out of the 125 investigated species shifted upwards to a present altitude which is higher than any reported occurrence in the region one century ago. The response at the lower range limit was more heterogeneous and suggests species-specific differences in responsiveness and response patterns. With this approach of the combined analysis of upper and lower range limits along elevational gradients, it is possible to identify candidate species that might not keep pace with climate change, and thus, might face an increased risk of extinction with continued global warming.

AB P>Ecologists debate whether tropical insect diversity is better explained by higher plant diversity or by host plant species specialization. However, plant-herbivore studies are primarily based in lowland rainforests (RF) thus excluding topographical effects on biodiversity. We examined turnover in Eois (Geometridae) communities across elevation by studying elevational transects in Costa Rica and Ecuador. We found four distinct Eois communities existing across the elevational gradients. Herbivore diversity was highest in montane forests (MF), whereas host plant diversity was highest in lowland RF. This was correlated with higher specialization and species richness of Eois/host plant species we found in MF. Based on these relationships, Neotropical Eois richness was estimated to range from 313 (only lowland RF considered) to 2034 (considering variation with elevation). We conclude that tropical herbivore diversity and diet breadth covary significantly with elevation and urge the inclusion of montane ecosystems in host specialization and arthropod diversity estimates.

AB Pharmacokinetics of melatonin in children might differ from that in adults.
   This study aims to establish a dose-response relationship for melatonin in advancing dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), sleep onset (SO), and reducing sleep onset latency (SOL) in children between 6 and 12 years with chronic sleep onset insomnia (CSOI).
   The method used for this study is the randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Children with CSOI (n = 72) received either melatonin 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 mg/kg or placebo during 1 week. Sleep was assessed with log and actigraphy during this week and the week before. Outcomes were the shifts in DLMO, SO, and SOL.
   Treatment with melatonin significantly advanced SO and DLMO by approximately 1 h and decreased SOL by 35 min. Within the three melatonin groups, effect size was not different, but the circadian time of administration (TOA) correlated significantly with treatment effect on DLMO (r (s) = -0.33, p = 0.022) and SO (r (s) = -0.38, p = 0.004), whereas clock TOA was correlated with SO shift (r = -0.35, p = 0.006) and not with DLMO shift.
   No dose-response relationship of melatonin with SO, SOL, and DLMO is found within a dosage range of 0.05-0.15 mg/kg. The effect of exogenous melatonin on SO, SOL, and DLMO increases with an earlier circadian TOA. The soporific effects of melatonin enhance the SO shift. This study demonstrates that melatonin for treatment of CSOI in children is effective in a dosage of 0.05 mg/kg given at least 1 to 2 h before DLMO and before desired bedtime.

AB Biodiversity studies aim to explain spatiotemporal patterns of species distributions. We propose a new methodology in which trait diversity is measured by the quadratic entropy index, with distances among species calculated from differences among trait states. We show how this index of trait diversity can be decomposed among the nodes of a phylogenetic tree. The contribution to trait diversity of a particular node is equal to the trait diversity among the n groups of species descending from it multiplied by an abundance weight (either proportional to the number of descendant species or to their relative abundance). We developed three tests to characterize the phylogenetic pattern of trait diversity and evaluated our methodology with seven evolutionary models. The power of the tests was high and increased with the number of extant taxa and the number of traits analyzed. The Type I error analyses (erroneous rejection of true null hypotheses) suggested that our tests are neither too liberal nor too conservative. Species abundances were found to modify the phylogenetic signal in trait diversity if only a few species were abundant and if species abundances were correlated to their phylogenetic relatedness and/or their trait states. By comparing phylogenetic signals in trait diversity from the local to the metacommunity level, we explored the factors that structure butterfly trait diversity in calcareous grasslands of northern France and southern Belgium. We show that partial phylogenetic signal in traits combined with habitat filtering determined which species and lineages were able to co-occur locally. Interestingly, no phylogenetic signal was detected when measures of abundance were included in our analyses. For most species and clades, the abundance distribution among communities at the regional scale was random. Overall, studying trait diversity in a phylogenetic context allows the link between current local ecological processes and lineage-dependent historical evolutionary factors to be thoroughly investigated.

AB During the last years, molecular studies revealed significant population differentiation and cryptic species within various benthic and pelagic marine Antarctic taxa. This is unexpected due to the lack of obvious barriers to gene flow and strong current systems. Using mitochondrial (COI, 16S rDNA) and nuclear (28S rDNA: D2) gene fragments, we tested whether two circum-Antarctic benthic shrimps with planktotrophic larvae, Chorismus antarcticus and Nematocarcinus lanceopes, show patterns of regional differentiation. For both species, the 16S and the 28S fragment were invariant. However, for COI we found 24 different haplotypes for Chorismus antarcticus and 54 for Nematocarcinus lanceopes. No significant differentiation was observed among populations or regions. Furthermore, we found signatures of a population expansion in the late Pleistocene hinting at an impact of large-scale glaciations in particular on the shallow-water shrimp Chorismus antarcticus, supporting a (re)colonization and demographic expansion of this shrimp species in response to climate oscillation.

AB Fungal breakdown of plant material rich in lignin and cellulose (i.e. lignocellulose) is of central importance to terrestrial carbon (C) cycling due to the abundance of lignocellulose above and below-ground. Fungal growth on lignocellulose is particularly influential in tropical forests, as woody debris and plant litter contain between 50% and 75% lignocellulose by weight, and can account for 20% of the C stored in these ecosystems. In this study, we evaluated factors affecting fungal growth on a common wood substrate along a wet tropical elevation gradient in the Peruvian Andes. We had three objectives: 1) to determine the temperature sensitivity of fungal growth - i.e. Q(10), the factor by which fungal biomass increases given a 10 degrees C temperature increase; 2) to assess the potential for above-ground fungal colonization and growth on lignocellulose in a wet tropical forest: and 3) to characterize the community composition of fungal wood decomposers across the elevation gradient. We found that fungal growth had a Q(10) of 3.93 (95% CI of 2.76-5.61), indicating that fungal biomass accumulation on the wood substrate nearly quadrupled with a 10 degrees C increase in temperature. The Q(10) for fungal growth on wood at our site is higher than Q(10) values reported for litter decomposition in other tropical forests. Moreover, we found that above-ground fungal growth on the wood substrate ranged between 37% and 50% of that measured in the soil, suggesting above-ground breakdown of lignocellulose represents an unexplored component of the C cycle in wet tropical forests. Fungal community composition also changed significantly along the elevation gradient, and Ascomycota were the dominant wood decomposers at all elevations. Fungal richness did not change significantly with elevation, directly contrasting with diversity patterns observed for plant and animal taxa across this gradient. Significant variation in fungal community composition across the gradient suggests that the characteristics of fungal decomposer communities are, directly or indirectly, influenced by temperature.

AB Rapid biodiversity assessment (RBA) is proposed as an affordable indicator for monitoring local species richness of arthropods and sustainability of related ecosystem services. The indicator is based on strictly standardised sampling procedures and the identification of parataxonomic units (morphospecies) instead of species identification. The collection of arthropods was optimized with regard to trap types, time and length of collecting period, selection of four out of seven weekly samples, and choice of counted taxa and trophic guilds. By measuring arthropod activity, RBA is an indicator for functional diversity. Over a period of 8 years, average yearly numbers of morphospecies were assessed in Switzerland in 15 agricultural habitats, 15 managed forests, and in 12 unmanaged habitats ranging from protected lowland wetlands to Alpine meadows. The yearly RBA-trend in unmanaged habitats is used for assessing the influence of climate and weather on biodiversity, and as a reference for measuring the relative influences of recent management changes in agriculture and forestry. The average number of morphospecies per sampling station per year depends on temperature, and was only marginally significantly increasing over time in agriculture, but not in forestry or unmanaged areas. Three RBA indices considered to be relevant for maintaining ecosystem services were calculated from the average number of morphospecies per location per year: (1) indicator for ecological resilience and sustainability (all morphospecies); (2) indicator for pollinator diversity (taxa with a majority of pollinators) and (3) indicator for biocontrol diversity (ratio between carnivore and herbivore guilds).

AB This article highlights advantages of entropy-based genetic diversity measures, at levels from gene expression to landscapes. Shannon's entropy-based diversity is the standard for ecological communities. The exponentials of Shannon's and the related "mutual information" excel in their ability to express diversity intuitively, and provide a generalised method of considering microscopic behaviour to make macroscopic predictions, under given conditions. The hierarchical nature of entropy and information allows integrated modeling of diversity along one DNA sequence, and between different sequences within and among populations, species, etc. The aim is to identify the formal connections between genetic diversity and the flow of information to and from the environment.

AB Terrestrial biosphere models are indispensable tools for analyzing the biosphere-atmosphere exchange of carbon and water. Evaluation of these models using site level observations scrutinizes our current understanding of biospheric responses to meteorological variables. Here we propose a novel model-data comparison strategy considering that CO2 and H2O exchanges fluctuate on a wide range of timescales. Decomposing simulated and observed time series into subsignals allows to quantify model performance as a function of frequency, and to localize model-data disagreement in time. This approach is illustrated using site level predictions from two models of different complexity, Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) and Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ), at four eddy covariance towers in different climates. Frequency-dependent errors reveal substantial model-data disagreement in seasonal-annual and high-frequency net CO2 fluxes. By localizing these errors in time we can trace these back, for example, to overestimations of seasonal-annual periodicities of ecosystem respiration during spring greenup and autumn in both models. In the same frequencies, systematic misrepresentations of CO2 uptake severely affect the performance of LPJ, which is a consequence of the parsimonious representation of phenology. ORCHIDEE shows pronounced model-data disagreements in the high-frequency fluctuations of evapotranspiration across the four sites. We highlight the advantages that our novel methodology offers for a rigorous model evaluation compared to classical model evaluation approaches. We propose that ongoing model development will benefit from considering model-data (dis) agreements in the time-frequency domain.

AB An ecological analysis of wetlands in the high mountain jalca above 3700 m elevation in the Andes near Cajamarca. Peru, indicated that most wetlands are groundwater-supported peat-accumulating fens. The floristic composition of fen communities was controlled largely by groundwater chemistry, which was highly variable and influenced by watershed bedrock composition. Watersheds with highly mineralized rock discharged water as acidic as pH 3.7, which was high in CaSO4, while watersheds with limestone, marble, and skarn produced groundwater as basic as pH 8.2 and high in CaHCO3. Of the 125 plots sampled in 36 wetland complexes, >50% of plots had at least 3 m of peat, and 21 plots had peat thicker than 7 m. Most soil horizons analyzed had 18 to 35% organic carbon, indicating high C storage. A total of 102 vascular plants, 69 bryophytes, and 10 lichens were identified. Study plots were classified using TWINSPAN into 20 plant communities, which were grouped into four broad categories by dominant life form: (1) cushion plant communities, (2) sedge- and rush-dominated communities, (3) bryophyte and lichen communities, and (4) tussock grass communities. Direct gradient analysis using canonical correspondence analysis indicated that Axis I was largely a water chemistry gradient, while Axis 2 was a complex hydrology and peat thickness gradient. Bryophytes and lichens were more strongly separated in the ordination space than vascular plants and were better indicators of specific environmental characteristics.

AB Aim To investigate taxonomic homogenization and/or differentiation of insect and vascular plant assemblages across the Southern Ocean Islands (SOI), and how they differ with changing spatial extent and taxonomic resolution.
   Location Twenty-two islands located across the Southern Ocean, further subdivided into five island biogeographical provinces. These islands are used because comprehensive data on both indigenous and non-indigenous insect and plant species are available.
   Methods An existing database was updated, using newly published species records, identifying the indigenous and non-indigenous insect and vascular plant species recorded for each island. Homogenization and differentiation were measured using Jaccard's index (JI) of similarity for assemblages across all islands on a pairwise basis, and for island pairs within each of the biogeographical provinces. The effects of taxonomic resolution (species, genus, family) and distance on levels of homogenization or differentiation were examined. To explore further the patterns of similarity among islands for each of the taxa and groupings (indigenous and non-indigenous), islands were clustered based on JI similarity matrices and using group averaging.
   Results Across the SOI, insect assemblages have become homogenized (0.7% increase in similarity at species level) while plant assemblages have become differentiated at genus and species levels. Homogenization was recorded only when pairwise distances among islands exceeded 3000 km for insect assemblages, but distances had to exceed 10,000 km for plant assemblages. Widely distributed non-indigenous plant species tend to have wider distributions across the SOI than do their insect counterparts, and this is also true of the indigenous species.
   Main conclusions Insect assemblages across the SOI have become homogenized as a consequence of the establishment of non-indigenous species, while plant assemblages have become more differentiated. The likely reason is that indigenous plant assemblages are more similar across the SOI than are insect assemblages, which show greater regionalization. Thus, although a suite of widespread, typically European, weedy, non-indigenous plant species has established on many islands, the outcome has largely been differentiation. Because further introductions of insects and vascular plants are probable as climates warm across the region, the patterns documented here are likely to change through time.

AB Song plays an important role in avian communication and acoustic variation is important at both the individual and population level. Habitat-related variation between populations in particular can reflect adaptations to the environment accumulated over generations, but this may not always be the case. In this study, we test whether variation between individuals matches local conditions with respect to noise level and territory density to examine whether short-term flexibility could contribute to song divergence at the population level. We conducted a case study on an urban and forest population of the European blackbird and show divergence at the population level (i.e. across habitats) in blackbird song, anthropogenic noise level and territory density. Unlike in several other species, we found a lack of any correlation at the individual level (i.e. across individuals) between song features and ambient noise. This suggests species-specific causal explanations for noise-dependent song differentiation which are likely associated with variation in song-copying behaviour or feedback constraints related to variable singing styles. On the other hand, we found that at the level of individual territories, temporal features, but not spectral ones, are correlated to territory density and seasonality. This suggests that short-term individual variation can indeed contribute to habitat-dependent divergence at the population level. As this may undermine the potential role for song as a population marker, we conclude that more investigations on individual song flexibility are required for a better understanding of the impact of population-level song divergence on hybridisation and speciation.

AB Reliable soil organic carbon (SOC) stock measurements of all major ecosystems are essential for predicting the influence of global warming on global soil carbon pools, but hardly any detailed soil survey data are available for tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) and adjacent high elevation grasslands above (puna). TMCF are among the most threatened of ecosystems under current predicted global warming scenarios. We conducted an intensive soil sampling campaign extending 40 km along the tree line in the Peruvian Andes between 2994 and 3860 m asl to quantify SOC stocks of TMCF, puna grassland, and shrubland sites in the transition zone between the two habitats. SOC stocks from the soil surface down to the bedrock averaged (+/- standard error SE) 11.8 (+/- 1.5, N = 24) kg C/m(2) in TMCF, 14.7 (+/- 1.4, N = 9) kg C/m(2) in the shrublands and 11.9 (+/- 0.8, N = 35) kg C/m(2) in the grasslands and were not significantly different (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, soil profile analysis revealed distinct differences, with TMCF profiles showing a uniform SOC distribution with depth, shrublands a linear decrease, and puna sites an exponential decrease in SOC densities with soil depth. Organic soil layer thickness reached a maximum (similar to 70 cm) at the upper limit of the TMCF and declined with increasing altitude toward puna sites. Within TMCF, no significant increase in SOC stocks with increasing altitude was observed, probably because of the large variations among SOC stocks at different sites, which in turn were correlated with spatial variation in soil depth.

AB Gene flow and genetic variability within and among alpine plant populations can be greatly influenced by the steep environmental gradients and heterogeneous topography of alpine landscapes. In this study, the effects are examined of natural isolation of alpine habitats on genetic diversity and geographic structure in populations of C. thyrsoides, a rare and isolated European Alpine monocarpic perennial with limited seed dispersal capacity.
   Molecular diversity was analysed for 736 individuals from 32 populations in the Swiss Alps and adjacent Jura mountains using five polymorphic microsatellite loci. Pollen flow was estimated using pollen grain-sized fluorescent powder. In addition, individual-based Bayesian approaches were applied to examine population structure.
   High within-population genetic diversity (H(E) = 0 center dot 76) and a relatively low inbreeding coefficient (F(IS) = 0 center dot 022) were found. Genetic differentiation among populations measured with a standardized measure was considerable (G'(ST) = 0 center dot 53). A significant isolation-by-distance relationship was found (r = 0 center dot 62, P < 0 center dot 001) and a significant geographic sub-structure, coinciding with proposed postglacial migration patterns. Altitudinal location and size of populations did not influence molecular variation. Direct measures of pollen flow revealed that insect-mediated pollen dispersal was restricted to short distances within a population.
   The natural isolation of suitable habitats for C. thyrsoides restricts gene flow among the populations as expected for a monocarpic species with very limited seed dispersal capacities. The observed high within-population genetic diversity in this rare monocarpic perennial is best explained by its outcrossing behaviour, long-lived individuals and overlapping generations. Despite the high within-population genetic diversity, the considerable genetic differentiation and the clear western-eastern differentiation in this species merits consideration in future conservation efforts.

AB As a result of diverse management policies, densities of red and roe deer have varied considerably for the last few decades in Europe. Their selective browsing on woody species can modify the interactions between competing species and thus change overall patterns of plant diversity in forests. However, no classification of woody species according to browsing by deer yet exists in Europe. The selectivity index, which measures the balance between availability and consumption of plant species by herbivores, could be used for such a classification. The aim of this study was, first, to rank woody species according to this selectivity index, then to test whether their rank changed when browsing pressure varied in space or time. We also explored morphological and ecological life traits (Ellenberg indicator values) that might explain differences in selectivity.
   In 2006, we re-sampled a network of 217 coupled floristic and browsing survey plots, which had been previously described twice (1976,1981). The plots were located in the forest of Arc-en-Barrois (France), a large woodland area divided into a North and a South Forest which have had different histories of browsing pressure.
   For the three samples and the two forests, we calculated a selectivity index for 19 woody species. Dogwood (Corpus sp.) and field rose (Rosa arvensis) appeared to be the most selected species whereas beech (Fagus sylvatica), common mezereon (Daphne mezereum) and wild-service tree (Sorbus torminalis) were always avoided. The rank order of species according to their selectivity index remained stable over the three sample years and between the two forests (Spearman's rank correlations: rho approximate to 0.8 spatially, and range from 0.3 to 0.8 temporally). This indicates that variations in browsing pressure did not strongly modify deer selectivity patterns. Selectivity was positively correlated with wood density and negatively correlated with maximum height of the species, but unrelated to other plant traits. Finally, selectivity can be seen as an intrinsic characteristic of those woody species, and could be used as an additional life trait when analyzing vegetation communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Utilizing general strain theory, this study explored the role experienced violent victimization, vicarious violent victimization, and two forms of anticipated violent victimization, played in the generation of street youths' violent offending. Basic models showed that experienced, vicarious, and fear of anticipated victimization were associated with violent offending. Full models suggested that only experienced violent victimization had a lower order relationship with violence. The relationship between experienced victimization and violence was further moderated by negative emotionality and low constraint. Males were also more likely to respond to experienced victimization with violence at higher levels of social support. Findings also revealed the relationship between vicarious violent victimization and violence was moderated by low constraint. Further, anticipated risk of violent victimization was associated with violent offending at lower levels of constraint, greater negative emotionality, and higher levels of social support. Results are discussed and avenues for future research are offered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   Non-indigenous species pose a significant threat to the environment and to global economies. Predictive and preventative measures are widely considered more effective in curtailing invasions than are eradication or control measures. Of key importance in the prediction of regional invasion risk are the environmental conditions that enable successful establishment.
   Location
   We surveyed native and non-indigenous sessile invertebrate diversity in each of two commercial (600-1500 vessels per year) and two recreational estuaries (seven to nine marinas) in New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods
   A nested hierarchical design was employed to investigate variation in sessile invertebrate diversity at the scales of site (1-3 km apart) and estuary (40-180 km apart). Settlement plates (15 x 15 cm) were used to sample invertebrates and background heavy metal loads were assessed using bioaccumulation in experimentally deployed oysters. Other physico-chemical variables were monitored monthly. Manipulative experiments were used to test the direct effects of exposure to copper and tributyltin (TBT) antifouling paints on sessile invertebrates.
   Results
   Native and non-indigenous species richness differed at various spatial scales, but showed no consistent difference between commercial and recreational estuaries. Instead, individual species distributions were strongly related to metal contamination, temperature, turbidity and pH. In experimental studies, several species (mostly invaders) were more abundant on plates exposed to copper and/or TBT antifouling paints. We found higher levels of copper (and in some instances TBT) in recreational marinas than in commercial harbours.
   Main conclusions
   Our results demonstrate the importance of metal pollution and physico-chemical variables in the establishment of invaders in new regions. We have identified several native Australian species that have been exported overseas and suggested mechanisms contributing to their transport and establishment. Combining physico-chemical information about donor and recipient regions with species tolerances could go some way to predicting where future invasions may occur.

AB The aim of this study was to determine effects of clear-cutting and prescribed clear-cut burning on the abundance and diversity of soil meso- and macrofauna during the early (0-5 years) recovery/recolonisation phase. A 115-year-old stand of mixed Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies in central Sweden was clear-cut in March 1999. Injune 1999, two plots on the clear-cut were burnt and two plots were left unburnt according to an experimental design with two blocks. Two plots of adjacent uncut forest were used as controls. The burning combusted the ground vegetation and the upper half of the 6-cm thick organic layer. In comparison with the unburnt clear-cut, burning decreased the abundances of Collembola, Protura, Mesostigmata, Araneae and Diptera larvae throughout the 5-year period, whereas Enchytraeidae, Lumbricidae, Oribatida, Prostigmata, Astigmata and Tardigrada decreased immediately after the fire but showed tendencies of recovery. Burning also decreased species richness. The majority of the species still absent after 5 years was surface-living species. Even animals with good ability to disperse (Diptera, Coleoptera and Araneae) had not recovered, which indicates a change of habitat or lack of food. Clear-cut burning was particularly detrimental to fungivores and predators, whereas microbidetritivores and herbivores were less affected. Prescribed burning, which is considered to increase aboveground biodiversity, dramatically reduced the soil fauna species richness for at least 5 years and did not add any species to those already present in the forest or clear-cut.

AB 1. Characterisation of biodiversity is typically based on taxonomic approaches, while much less is known about other related aspects. Functional trait diversity is one such component of biodiversity that has not been addressed rigorously in ecological research until recently. We tested the congruence between taxonomic- and trait-based approaches, and examined how spatial configuration, local abiotic environmental factors and biotic effects interact to influence taxonomic- and trait-based characterisation of freshwater fish assemblages.
   2. Fish assemblage data were compiled for 124 lakes in southern Finland. Variance partitioning in both linear regression analyses and redundancy analysis was used to quantify the relative contribution of spatial and environmental variables to taxonomic and functional trait diversity and structure. Additionally, a null model analysis was used to test for the potential effects of interspecific segregation and biotic interactions on the co-occurrence of species.
   3. The species pool was relatively poor. However, trait-based classification of species indicated that most species belonged to unique functional entities, which suggested low redundancy in species composition. Correlation analysis indicated a very strong relationship between species richness (SR) and the number of unique trait combinations (UTC). Ecoregion-level heterogeneity in SR and UTC were well represented in a relatively small group of randomly selected lakes (c. 30 lakes). Multiple regressions indicated moderate roles for abiotic environmental variables (i.e. lake surface area, depth, total phosphorous, colour and pH) in determining SR, UTC and the distribution of single trait categories, whereas geographical location was not generally influential.
   4. Redundancy analysis revealed similar patterns to those of diversity analyses for taxonomic and associated trait-based structure, emphasising the effect of abiotic environmental variables and the negligible effect of geographical position.
   5. Co-occurrence analysis indicated significant checkerboard distribution at the whole assemblage level, but interspecific segregation proved to be of relatively minor importance in the constrained analyses, where species pair combinations within trait category groups were evaluated.
   6. Our results suggest that taxonomic- and trait-based patterns of boreal lake fish assemblages are strongly interrelated. Environmental filtering through the effects of local abiotic variables seems to have the most prominent role in determining trait-based assemblage patterns among lakes, which may also be secondarily shaped by biotic interactions.
   7. From the applied perspective, it may not necessarily matter whether traditional taxonomic or more novel trait-based approaches are used in characterising spatial patterns in boreal fish assemblages. However, trait-based approaches may provide complementary information which cannot be directly revealed by taxonomic data.

AB The goal of this study was a harmonization of diatom identification and counting among diatomists from the Scandinavian and Baltic countries to improve the comparison of diatom studies in this geographical area. An analysis of the results of 25 diatomists following the European standard EN 14407 during an intercalibration exercise showed that a high similarity was achieved by harmonization and not because of a long experience with diatoms. Sources of error were wrong calibration scales, overlooking of small taxa, especially small Navicula s.l., misidentifications (Eunotia rhomboidea was mistaken for Eunotia incisa) and unclear separation between certain taxa in the identification literature. The latter was discussed during a workshop with focus on the Achnanthes minutissima group, the separation of Fragilaria capucina var. gracilis from F. capucina var. rumpens, and Nitzschia palea var. palea from N. palea var. debilis. The exercise showed also that the Swedish standard diatom method tested here worked fine with acceptable error for the indices IPS (Indice de Polluo-sensibilit, Sp,cifique) and ACID (ACidity Index for Diatoms) when diatomists with a low similarity (Bray-Curtis < 60%) with the auditor in at least one of the samples are excluded.

AB The characteristics of spread for an invasive species should influence how environmental authorities or government agencies respond to an initial incursion. High-resolution predictions of how, where, and the speed at which a newly established invasive population will spread across the surrounding heterogeneous landscape can greatly assist appropriate and timely risk assessments and control decisions.
   The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is a worldwide invasive species that was inadvertently introduced to New Zealand in 1990. In this study, a spatially explicit stochastic simulation model of species dispersal, integrated with a geographic information system, was used to recreate the historical spread of L. humile in New Zealand. High-resolution probabilistic maps simulating local and human-assisted spread across large geographic regions were used to predict dispersal rates and pinpoint at-risk areas. The spatially explicit simulation model was compared with a uniform radial spread model with respect to predicting the observed spread of the Argentine ant. The uniform spread model was more effective predicting the observed populations early in the invasion process, but the simulation model was more successful later in the simulation. Comparison between the models highlighted that different search strategies may be needed at different stages in an invasion to optimize detection and indicates the influence that landscape suitability can have on the long-term spread of an invasive species.
   The modeling and predictive mapping methodology used can improve efforts to predict and evaluate species spread, not only in invasion biology, but also in conservation biology, diversity studies, and climate change studies.

AB Allochthonous nutrient subsidies play an important role in shaping biotic communities, particularly in naturally oligotrophic ecosystems such as those commonly found in the Canadian High Arctic. Seabirds have been identified as an important vector capable of transporting significant quantities of nutrients from marine to terrestrial environments. However, the influence of seabird-derived nutrients on water quality and ecosystem functioning of Arctic freshwater systems has been largely unexplored. Here, we sampled 24 ponds on Cape Vera, Devon Island (Nunavut, Arctic Canada), an area that is home to over 10,000 nesting pairs of northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis), in order to explore the influence of seabirds on water quality and diatom ecology. Our data reveal distinctive water chemistry changes (e.g., high pH, nutrients) and diatom assemblages (e.g., very low diversity) related to varying degrees of bird influence. Using delta N-15 as a proxy of trophic level, we show that a small but significant portion of the variance in the diatom species data can be explained by seabird-derived nutrients. Although the generation of robust quantitative models predicting delta N-15 from fossil diatom data was limited by the overwhelming dominance of a few taxa, this study provides evidence that seabird-derived nutrients play a critical role in influencing the water quality of Arctic ponds. Interestingly, diatom assemblage composition does not respond in a simple fashion to seabird-derived nutrients, in contrast to diatom-nutrient relationships recorded in many temperate regions.

AB We studied elevational species richness patterns of Schizothorax fishes and identified the roles of ecological and evolutionary factors in shaping the patterns of elevational diversity.
   The Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent regions.
   We assembled distribution and altitude data for all Schizothorax species using the literature. We merged ecological and evolutionary approaches to test the relationships between species richness and ecological factors (climate, area, the mid-domain effect) or evolutionary factors (diversification rates and time of colonization).
   We found that species richness of Schizothorax fishes peaked at mid-elevations. Rainfall, area, the mid-domain effect and diversification rate were weak predictors of the richness pattern. Temperature showed a nonlinear relationship with species richness. Temperature and time of colonization were the most important variables in explaining the elevational diversity pattern.
   Our findings indicate that the time-for-speciation effect and niche conservatism play important roles in variation of species richness.

AB Functional diversity is regarded as a key in understanding the link between ecosystem function and biodiversity, but its measurement is rather problematic. The two widely used continuous measures are the dendrogram-based measure (DBM) and the functional attribute diversity (FAD). In contrast to DBM, FAD does not require the knowledge of the entire species pool before the analysis, and hence FAD is a more ideal tool for measuring functional diversity. However, the original form of FAD and its variants have several undesirable properties. Here, we suggest a modified FAD (denoted by MFAD), which-as illustrated by artificial and actual data sets-allows calculating functional diversity without violating the twinning and monotonicity criteria such that the number of species collected is compensated for. These requirements are met by replacing the original species by so-called functional species and then by dividing FAD by the number of functional units. Accordingly, MFAD measures the dispersion of species in the functional traits space so that MFAD values for different communities can directly be compared if the same set of functional traits is used. Finally, using data of two freshwater communities (caddisfly and riverine fish), we evaluate the change of species richness and functional diversity in relation to sampling effort (sample unit size). We found that functional diversity is a better and more reliable community descriptor than species richness in a sense that it converges to the maximum faster in the function of sampling effort.

AB Bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) adapted to rock outcrops or 'inselbergs' in neotropical rain forests have been identified as suitable plant models for studying population divergence and speciation during continental plant radiations. Little is known about genetic relationships and variation in reproductive strategies within and among inselberg-adapted species, yet knowledge of these parameters is important for understanding divergence processes and for conservation planning.
   Nuclear microsatellites were used to assess the role of clonal reproduction, estimate genetic diversity and explore genetic relationships and variation in reproductive strategies for a total of 15 populations of four closely related Alcantarea inselberg species in south-eastern Brazil: A. glaziouana, A. regina, A. geniculata and A. imperialis.
   Clonal propagation is frequent in coastal populations of A. glaziouana and A. regina, but absent in the high-altitude species A. geniculata and A. imperialis. Considerable variation in clonal diversity, gene diversity (H-e), allelic richness, and Wright's inbreeding coefficient (F-IS) exists within and between species of Alcantarea. A Bayesian analysis of coastal inselberg species indicated pronounced genetic structure. A neighbor-joining analysis grouped populations of each species together with moderate bootstrap support, except for the high altitude species A. imperialis.
   The coastal inselberg species A. glaziouana and A. regina tend to propagate asexually via vegetative clonal growth, and both reproductive strategies and breeding systems vary greatly between populations and species of Alcantarea. The microsatellite data indicate a history of hybridization and reticulation involving the high-altitude species A. geniculata and A. imperialis in areas of co-occurrence. The results highlight the need to understand similarities and differences in reproductive strategies both within and between related species for conservation planning and as a basis for understanding evolutionary processes in tropical radiations.

AB A multi-locus phylogenetic study of the order Arthoniales is presented here using the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (nuLSU), the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) and the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (mtSSU). These genes were sequenced from 43 specimens or culture isolates representing 33 species from this order, 16 of which were from the second largest genus, Opegrapha. With the inclusion of sequences from GenBank, ten genera and 35 species are included in this study, representing about 18% of the genera and ca 3% of the species of this order. Our study revealed the homoplastic nature of morphological characters traditionally used to circumscribe genera within the Arthoniales, such as exciple carbonization and ascomatal structure. The genus Opegrapha appears polyphyletic, species of that genus being nested in all the major clades identified within Arthoniales. The transfer of O. atra and O. calcarea to the genus Arthonia will allow this genus and family Arthoniaceae to be recognized as monophyletic. The genus Enterographa was also found to be polyphyletic. Therefore, the following new combinations are needed: Arthonia calcarea (basionym: O. calcurea), and O. anquinella (basionym: Stigmatidium anquinellum); and the use of the names A. atra and Enterographa zonata are proposed here. The simultaneous use of a mitochondrial gene and two nuclear genes led to the detection of what seems to be a case of introgression of a mitochondrion from one species to another (mitochondrion capture; cytoplasmic gene flow) resulting from hybridization.

In this study, we examined the demographic history and the local polymorphism patterns of candidate genes linked to drought tolerance of a widespread Mediterranean conifer (Pinus halepensis).
   To that end, we used cpSSRs and coalescence modelling of nuclear genes to infer the demographic history of natural populations covering the species range. Ten drought-response candidate genes were then examined for their patterns of polymorphism and tested for selection considering plausible demographic scenarios.
   Our results revealed a marked loss of genetic diversity from the relictual Greek population towards the western range of the species, as well as molecular signatures of intense bottlenecks. Moreover, we found an excess of derived polymorphisms in several genes sampled in the western part of the range - a potential result of the action of natural selection on populations confronted with new environments following long-range colonization.
   Wide-range expansions-contractions of forest trees are accompanied by strong selective pressures, resulting in distinct evolutionary units. This knowledge is of crucial importance for the conservation and management of forests in the face of climate change.

AB To test the influence of various species traits, elevation and phylogeographical history on the genetic diversity of high-mountain plants in the Alps and Carpathians.
   The regular sampling grid comprised the whole range of the European Alps and the Carpathians.
   Twenty-two high-mountain plant species were exhaustively sampled and their genetic diversity was assessed with amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). ANOVAs were used to check for relationships between species traits and species genetic diversity, and to test whether genetic diversity was influenced by altitude and phylogeographical history (i.e. Alps versus Carpathians).
   In both mountain systems, species dispersed and pollinated by wind showed higher genetic diversity than species with self or insect pollination, and with animal- or gravity-dispersed seeds. Only in the Alps did altitudinal range size affect species genetic diversity significantly: species with narrow altitudinal ranges in the highest vegetation belts had significantly higher genetic diversity than those expanding over wide altitudinal ranges. Genetic diversity was species specific and significantly higher in the Alps than in the Carpathians, but it was not influenced by elevation.
   Wind pollination and wind dispersal seem to foster high genetic diversity. However, species traits are often associated and their effects on genetic diversity cannot be clearly disentangled. As genetic diversity is species specific, comparisons across species need to be interpreted with care. Genetic diversity was generally lower in the Carpathians than in the Alps, due to higher topographical isolation of alpine habitats in the Carpathians and this mountain massif's divergent phylogeographical history. Elevation did not influence genetic diversity, challenging the long-held view of decreasing genetic diversity with increasing elevation in mountain plants.

AB BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to the Dutch famine is associated with an increased risk of chronic degenerative disease. We now investigate whether prenatal famine exposure affected reproductive success. METHODS: We assessed reproductive success (number of children, number of twins, age at delivery, childlessness) of men and women born around the time of the Dutch famine of 1944-1945 in the Wilhelmina Gasthuis, Amsterdam, whose birth records have been kept. RESULTS: Women who were exposed to the Dutch famine of 1944-1945 in utero are more reproductively successful than women who were not exposed to famine during their fetal development; they have more offspring, have more twins, are less likely to remain childless and start reproducing at a younger age. The increased reproductive success of these women is unlikely to be explained by genes which favor fertility and are passed from mothers to their daughters. In utero exposure to famine did not affect the reproductive success of males. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that poor nutrition during fetal development, followed by improved nutrition after birth can give rise to a female phenotype characterized by greater reproductive success.

AB The fragmentation of forests by the expansion of agriculture is recognized as an important factor influencing worldwide declines of forest-dependent species. Species that are forest dependent may be especially vulnerable to fragmentation because they have specialized resource requirements and may exhibit lower mobility in an agricultural matrix. We investigated movement patterns and resource selection of forest-dependent northern long-eared myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) in a forest-aricultural landscape on Prince Edward Island, Canada. Radiotelemetry was used to locate day-roosts and to estimate locations of female bats during nightly foraging bouts. Day-roost locations and foraging areas were mapped using a geographic information system to generally characterize the forest cover of foraging and roosting areas. Vegetative structure and insect prey availability were measured in the field and compared between foraging and roosting areas to describe resource selection at these sites. Movements of female northern long-eared myotis were constrained to forest features and foraging areas were concentrated along forest-covered creeks with bats roosting predominantly in deciduous trees within the same forest fragment, although bats at 1 site seemed to exclusively use a barn during late pregnancy and lactation. Differences in prey availability did not explain the spatial segregation of roosting and foraging areas. Relative to roost areas foraging sites were more likely to be close to forested creeks and densely forested areas, whereas roost sites were characterized by the availability of potentially suitable roosts. This study demonstrates the importance of investigating movements and resource selection of individuals in fragmented landscapes because a specialization oil forest resources can highly restrict the vagility of forest-dependent species to a local environment.

AB Plant resource partitioning of chemical forms of nitrogen (N) may be an important factor promoting species coexistence in N-limited ecosystems. Since the microbial community regulates N-form transformations, plant partitioning of N may be related to plant-soil feedbacks. We conducted a N-15 tracer addition experiment to study the ability of two alpine plant species, Acomastylis rossii and Deschampsia caespitosa, to partition organic and inorganic forms of N. The species are codominant and associated with strong plant-soil feedbacks that affect N cycling. We manipulated interspecific interactions by removing Acomastylis or Deschampsia from areas where the species were codominant to test if N uptake patterns varied in the presence of the other species. We found that Deschampsia acquired organic and inorganic N more rapidly than Acomastylis, regardless of neighbor treatment. Plant N uptake-specifically ammonium uptake-increased with plant density and the presence of an interspecific neighbor. Interestingly, this change in N uptake was not in the expected direction to reduce niche overlap and instead suggested facilitation of ammonium use. To test if N acquisition patterns were consistent with plant-soil feedbacks, we also compared microbial rhizosphere extracellular enzyme activity in patches dominated by one or the other species and in areas where they grew together. The presence of both species was generally associated with increased rhizosphere extracellular enzyme activity (five of ten enzymes) and a trend towards increased foliar N concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest that feedbacks through the microbial community, either in response to increased plant density or specific plant neighbors, could facilitate coexistence. However, coexistence is promoted via enhanced resource uptake rather than reduced niche overlap. The importance of resource partitioning to reduce the intensity of competitive interactions might vary across systems, particularly as a function of plant-soil feedbacks.

AB A polyphasic study was performed to determine the taxonomic position of strain EK05(T) isolated from a root-outgrowth of Entada koshunensis, a legume available in Okinawa, Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that the strain belongs to the genus Bradyrhizobium. Subsequent multilocus sequence analysis with ITS, glnII, recA, gyrB, and atpD sequences revealed that the isolate represents a distinct evolutionary lineage within the genus Bradyrhizobium. DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that strain EK05(T) shares <61% DNA relatedness with the type strains of all six recognized species of Bradyrhizobium, confirming that this strain is a novel species within the genus. Phylogenetic trees based on symbiotic loci, nifH and nodC, also placed strain EK05(T) clearly in a novel branch. On the basis of its phylogenetic distinctiveness, we propose Bradyrhizobium iriomotense sp. nov. for strain EK05(T). The type strain is EK05(T) (=NBRC 102520(T) = LMG 24129(T)).

AB Testosterone is assumed to be the key hormone related to resource-defence aggression. While this role has been confirmed mostly in the context of reproduction in male vertebrates, the effect of testosterone on the expression of resource-defence aggression in female vertebrates is not so well established. Furthermore, laboratory work suggests that progesterone inhibits aggressive behaviour in females. In this study, we investigated the hormonal changes underlying territorial aggression in free-living female African black coucals, Centropus grillii (Aves; Cuculidae). Females of this sex-role reversed polyandrous bird species should be particularly prone to be affected by testosterone because they aggressively defend territories similar tomales of other species. We show, however, that territorial aggression in female black coucals is modulated by progesterone. After aggressive territorial challenges female black coucals expressed lower levels of progesterone than unchallenged territorial females and females without territories, suggesting that progesterone may suppress territorial aggression and is downregulated during aggressive encounters. Indeed, females treated with physiological concentrations of progesterone were less aggressive than females with placebo implants. This is one of the first demonstrations of a corresponding hormone-behaviour interaction under challenged and experimental conditions in free-living females. We anticipate that our observation in a sex-role reversed species may provide a more general mechanism, by which progesterone-in interaction with testosterone-may regulate resource-defence aggression in female vertebrates.

AB Much of the research examining the effects of ambient noise on communication has focused on adult birds using acoustic signals in mate attraction and territory defense. Here, we examine the effects of noise exposure on young birds, which use acoustic signals to solicit food from parents. We found that nestling tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) exposed to playbacks of white noise, within natural amplitude levels, from days 3 to 15 posthatch had begging calls with higher minimum frequencies and narrower frequency ranges than control nestlings raised in nests without added noise. Differences in begging call structure also persisted in the absence of noise. Two days after the noise was removed, experimental nestlings produced calls that were narrower in frequency range and less complex than control nestlings. We found no difference in growth between experimental and control nestlings. Our results suggest that long-term noise exposure affects the structure of nestling begging calls. These effects persist in the absence of noise, suggesting that noise may affect how calls develop.

AB As is laid down in the convention on biodiversity, it is essential to install a sustainability monitoring system with integrated biodiversity indicators on both the regional and local levels. The resulting data derived from such a system would be instrumental in supporting the work of policy- and decision-makers as well as stakeholders. However, the integration of biodiversity indicators on the local level is still uncommon. Our aim was therefore to produce a set of biodiversity indicators that: (1) reflects all requirements for regional sustainability monitoring on the municipality level and (2) enables the derived multifaceted information to be simplified and used to improve the applicability and implementation of the system. To this end, we also aimed to assess the validity of the selected indicators in a case study area. Together with a team of 20 local experts composed of officials, stakeholders and scientists, we selected five common biodiversity indicators: landscape diversity, undissected landscape, hemeroby, naturalness of the riparian area and agricultural intensity. in addition, to describe the quality of an area in terms of the richness of species living in it, we developed two further indicators 'area weighted mean species richness of vascular plants' and 'frequency weighted absolute species richness of vascular plants'. In terms of practical and political implementation, we also defined theory-based desired levels, from which we derived performance rates.
   The study was carried out in 2004 for each of the 116 municipalities of South Tyrol, an alpine region in northern Italy and data were analysed using a maximum likelihood estimation (spatial lag model). The results clearly showed that the large variance of indicator values mainly arises from anthropogenic activities, and that all indicators are robust to spatial extent, and thus appropriate for multiscale assessment. Further, applying a factor analysis allowed three dimensions to be identified that account for more than 76% of the total variance: (1) naturalness, (2) landscape structure and (3) species diversity. Hence, factor analysis is an objective approach to reduce the number of indicators without loosing too much information. However, it should be borne in mind that for specific ecological questions, the use of single indicators is still inevitable. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The scaling of reproductive parameters to body size is important for understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns. Here, we derived allometric relationships for the number and mass of seeds, eggs and neonates from an existing model on population production. In a separate meta-analysis, we collected 79 empirical regressions on offspring mass and number covering different taxa and various habitats. The literature review served as a validation of the model, whereas, vice versa, consistency of isolated regressions with each other and related ecological quantities was checked with the model. The total offspring mass delivered in a reproductive event scaled to adult size with slopes in the range of about 3/4 to 1. Exponents for individual seed, egg and neonate mass varied around 1/2 for most heterotherms and between 3/4 and 1 for most homeotherms. The scaling of the progeny number released in a sowing, clutch or litter was opposite to that of their size. The linear regressions fitted into a triangular envelope where maximum offspring mass is limited by the size of the adult. Minimum seed and egg size scaled with weight exponents of approximately 0 up to 1/4. These patterns can be explained by the influence of parents on the fate of their offspring, covering the continuum of r-strategists (pelagic-aquatic, arial, most invertebrates, heterotherms) and K-strategists (littoral-terrestrial, some invertebrates, homeotherms).

AB Aim Tree-line conifers are believed to be limited by temperature worldwide, and thus may serve as important indicators of climate change. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential shifts in spatial distribution of three tree-line conifer species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem under three future climate-change scenarios and to assess their potential sensitivity to changes in both temperature and precipitation.
   Location This study was performed using data from 275 sites within the boundaries of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, primarily located in Wyoming, USA.
   Methods We used data on tree-line conifer presence from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. Climatic and edaphic variables were derived from spatially interpolated maps and approximated for each of the sites. We used the random-forest prediction method to build a model of predicted current and future distributions of each of the species under various climate-change scenarios.
   Results We had good success in predicting the distribution of tree-line conifer species currently and under future climate scenarios. Temperature and temperature-related variables appeared to be most influential in the distribution of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), whereas precipitation and soil variables dominated the models for subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The model for whitebark pine substantially overpredicted absences (as compared with the other models), which is probably a result of the importance of biological factors in the distribution of this species.
   Main conclusions These models demonstrate the complex response of conifer distributions to changing climate scenarios. Whitebark pine is considered a 'keystone' species in the subalpine forests of western North America; however, it is believed to be nearly extinct throughout a substantial portion of its range owing to the combined effects of an introduced pathogen, outbreaks of the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and changing fire regimes. Given predicted changes in climate, it is reasonable to predict an overall decrease in pine-dominated subalpine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. In order to manage these forests effectively with respect to future climate, it may be important to focus attention on monitoring dry mid- and high-elevation forests as harbingers of long-term change.

AB Because hormones mediate physiological or behavioral responses to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli, they can help us understand how animals adapt their foraging decisions to energetic demands of reproduction. Thus, the hormone corticosterone deserves specific attention because of its influence on metabolism, food intake and locomotor activities. We examined the relationships between baseline corticosterone levels and foraging behavior or mass gain at sea in a diving seabird, the Adelie penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae. Data were obtained from free-ranging penguins during the brooding period (Adelie Land, Antarctica) by using satellite transmitters and time-depth-recorders. The birds were weighed and blood sampled before and after a foraging trip (pre-trip and post-trip corticosterone levels, respectively). Penguins with elevated pre-trip corticosterone levels spent less time at sea and stayed closer to the colony than penguins with low pre-trip corticosterone levels. These short trips were associated with a higher foraging effort in terms of diving activity and a lower mass gain at sea than long trips. According to previous studies conducted on seabird species, these results suggest that penguins with elevated pre-trip corticosterone levels might maximize the rate of energy delivery to the chicks at the expense of their body reserves. Moreover, in all birds, corticosterone levels were lower post-foraging than pre-foraging. This decrease could result from either the restoration of body reserves during the foraging trip or from a break in activity at the end of the foraging trip. This study demonstrates for the first time in a diving predator the close relationships linking foraging behavior and baseline corticosterone levels. We suggest that slight elevations in pre-trip corticosterone levels could play a major role in breeding effort by facilitating foraging activity in breeding seabirds. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB As top predators, wild cats play a key ecological role in tropical forests, but little is known about the factors that regulate their abundance. This study looked for correlates of ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) abundance at two spatial scales. First, camera-trap surveys conducted in the Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina, were used to test the hypothesis that selective logging and poaching affect the local abundance of this cat. Second, published density estimates (N = 21) were used to test the hypothesis that rainfall and latitude are correlated with the abundance of ocelots across their continental range. In Misiones, ocelot densities ranged from 4.96 +/- 1.33 individuals per 100 km(2) in the intensely logged and hunted areas to 17.6 +/- 2.25 individuals per 100 km(2) in areas with low human impact. The frequency of records, number of individuals recorded per station, and density estimates were 2-3 times higher in areas with relatively low levels of logging and poaching. At a continental scale, ocelot densities decrease with latitude and increase with rainfall. Primary productivity seems to determine the abundance of wild cats across their range, but at a local scale their abundance may be affected by logging and poaching or by competition with other species.

AB The formation of islands following a rise in sea level at the end of Pleistocene is expected to disrupt the equilibrium between genetic drift and gene flow in species with limited ability to disperse. Here, we test the hypothesis that genetic drift in isolation has caused the differentiation of Galapagos lava lizards (Microlophus albemarlensis complex) found on 12 islets that are likely to have been connected to a larger island, Isla Santa Cruz, during the late Pleistocene. Using 11 microsatellite loci, screened on 524 individuals from 17 localities distributed among and within 15 islands, we found marked differences in allelic richness and heterozygosity. Genetic differentiation was strong (global F-ST = 0.44), with pairwise differences found among populations on islets being larger than differences among three localities sampled within Isla Santa Cruz. As expected under a scenario of drift in isolation, there was a positive correlation of genetic diversity with island size, no relationship between genetic and geographical distance and a strong negative correlation between heterozygosity and measures of genetic differentiation. We conclude that seawater is a significant barrier to gene flow in lava lizards on this timescale. Our results suggest that the shallow diversification of the M. albemarlensis complex is not due to recent gene flow and that genetic drift may have played a substantial role in observed patterns of phenotypic variation among islands.

AB Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were introduced on the island of Mauritius between 400 and 500 years ago and underwent a strong population expansion after a probable initial founding event. However, in practice, little is known of the geographical origin of the individuals that colonized the island, on how many individuals were introduced, and of whether the following demographic expansion erased any signal of this putative bottleneck. In this study, we asked whether the current nuclear genome of the Mauritius population retained a signature that would allow us to answer these questions. Altogether, 21 polymorphic autosomal and sex-linked microsatellites were surveyed from 81 unrelated Mauritius individuals and 173 individuals from putative geographical sources in Southeast Asia: Java, the Philippines islands and the Indochinese peninsula. We found that (i) the Mauritius population was closer to different populations depending on the markers we used, which suggests a possible mixed origin with Java playing most probably a major role; and (ii) the level of diversity was lower than the other populations but there was no clear and consistent bottleneck signal using either summary statistics or full-likelihood methods. However, summary statistics strongly suggest that Mauritius is not at mutation-drift equilibrium and favours an expansion rather than a bottleneck. This suggests that on a short time scale, population decline followed by growth can be difficult to deduce from genetic data based on mutation-drift theory. We then used a simple Bayesian rejection algorithm to estimate the number of founders under different demographic models (exponential, logistic and logistic with lag) and pure genetic drift. This new method uses current population size estimates and expected heterozygosity of Mauritius and source population(s). Our results indicate that a simple exponential growth is unlikely and that, under the logistic models, the population may have expanded from an initial effective number of individuals of 10-15. The data are also consistent with a logistic growth with different lag values, indicating that we cannot exclude past population fluctuation.

AB Microzooplankton grazing and virally mediated mortality of the eukaryotic (3 size classes) and prokaryotic (Synechococcus) picophytoplankton was investigated across the North Sea during summer 2003. The fate of picophytoplankton differed among algal groups and their area of occurrence. Highest viral lysis rates (0.16 to 0.23 d(-1)) were recorded for specific picoeukaryotic groups in the coastal region and at a station at the deep chlorophyll a maximum (DCM). Viral lysis was insignificant at the other stations, despite a considerable percentage of dead algal cells (up to 38 %), as determined by staining with the live/dead dye SYTOX Green. Microzooplankton actively grazed on picoeukaryotes (average per group 0.2 to 0.4 d(-1)), independent of the region studied. Grazing on Synechococcus was restricted to the coastal waters (0.7 d(-1)). Grazing by microzooplankton consumed 40 +/- 27 % (mean SD) of the carbon produced by picophytoplankton, constituting in general the main loss factor. Viral lysis released 8 +/- 13% of the total picophytoplankton carbon production, and locally up to 32 %.

AB Spatiotemporal changes in microphytobenthos species composition were investigated in relation to structural variables-biomass; life-forms; detritus ratio, pheopigment a (pheo a):chl a; and sediment characteristics-at mesoscale in a shellfish macrotidal ecosystem. To characterize algae assemblages, multivariate analyses were performed (multidimensional scaling [MDS] ordination and clustering), supported by correlations between structural variables. Microphytobenthos, dominated by 97% diatoms belonging to 89 taxa, was constituted by two main assemblages: The first one, composed of common species (occurrence > 50%), mainly nanobenthic (size < 30 mu m) and epipsammic (sand-fixed cells), was associated with mixed sediments. The major species contributing to this assemblage were Navicula perminuta, Achnanthes hauckiana, Fallacia tenera, A. lanceolata var. elleptica, Amphora spp., Plagiogrammopsis vanheurkii, and Plagiogramma tenuissimum (see Table 2 for taxonomic authors). Species diversity was high (N-1 similar to 11), often linked to high biomass values (> 70 mg chl a . m(-2)) and low detritus ratio. Conversely, the second assemblage comprised occasional species (occurrence from 10% to 50%), mainly microbenthic (> 30 mu m) and epipelic (moving cells), occurring during summer at muddy sites. This assemblage, characterized by low diversity, high biomass variability, and high detritus ratio, was dominated by Scolioneis tumida or Plagiotropis vitrea and Navicula spartinetensis. Whereas hydrodynamics globally explained the gradual assemblage changes throughout the entire mudflat and the year, oyster beds and ridge and runnel features appeared to be local spatial structuring factors allowing the establishment of specific assemblages. This study suggests a significant role for epipsammon biomass, until now underestimated, in the functioning of this turbid coastal ecosystem.

AB We report viral-induced mortality rates of the picoeukaryotic (two size classes) and prokaryotic (cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus) phytoplankton during a cruise in the oligotrophic subtropical northeastern Atlantic (October 2002). A dilution assay, simultaneously estimating viral lysis and microzooplankton grazing, was applied around the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) at six stations. For the smallest picoeukaryotes (group I), viral lysis was responsible for 50-100% of the total cell losses, with rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 d(-1). Viral lysis rates were positively linked to the abundance and contribution of large genome-sized (180-225 kb) putative algal viruses. In contrast, the prokaryotic picophytoplankton did not seem to be controlled by viral lysis. For Synechococcus, microzooplankton grazing dominated, with rates between 0.1 and 0.25 d(-1) (comparable to those for the eukaryotic algae). For Prochlorococcus, both viral lysis and microzooplankton grazing rates were very low (0-0.1 d(-1)). Overall, the total carbon production by the picophytoplankton community was balanced by the combined losses due to viral lysis and microzooplankton grazing. Viral lysis released 0.1-0.3 mu g of picophytoplanktonic C L-1 d(-1), which comprised 21% of the total carbon production by picophytoplankton.

AB Infectious diseases now threaten wildlife populations worldwide but population recovery following local extinction has rarely been observed. In such a case, do resistant individuals recolonize from a central remnant population, or do they spread from small, perhaps overlooked, populations of resistant individuals? Introduced avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) has devastated low-elevation populations of native birds in Hawaii, but at least one species (Hawaii amakihi, Hemignathus virens) that was greatly reduced at elevations below about 1000 m tolerates malaria and has initiated a remarkable and rapid recovery. We assessed mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers from amakihi and two other Hawaiian honeycreepers, apapane (Himatione sanguinea) and iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea), at nine primary study sites from 2001 to 2003 to determine the source of re-establishing birds. In addition, we obtained sequences from tissue from amakihi museum study skins (1898 and 1948-49) to assess temporal changes in allele distributions. We found that amakihi in lowland areas are, and have historically been, differentiated from birds at high elevations and had unique alleles retained through time; that is, their genetic signature was not a subset of the genetic variation at higher elevations. We suggest that high disease pressure rapidly selected for resistance to malaria at low elevation, leaving small pockets of resistant birds, and this resistance spread outward from the scattered remnant populations. Low-elevation amakihi are currently isolated from higher elevations (> 1000 m) where disease emergence and transmission rates appear to vary seasonally and annually. In contrast to results from amakihi, no genetic differentiation between elevations was found in apapane and iiwi, indicating that slight variation in genetic or life-history attributes can determine disease resistance and population recovery. Determining the conditions that allow for the development of resistance to disease is essential to understanding how species evolve resistance across a landscape of varying disease pressures.

AB Aim The similarity between parasite assemblages should decrease with increasing geographic distance between them, increasing dissimilarity in environmental conditions, and/or increasing dissimilarity of the local host fauna, depending on the dispersal abilities of the parasites and the intimacy of their associations with the host. We tested for a decay in the similarity of gamasid mite assemblages parasitic on small mammals with increasing geographic, 'environmental' and 'host faunal' (= 'host') distances.
   Location We used data on assemblages of haematophagous gamasid mites (superfamily Dermanyssoidea) parasitic on small mammals (Insectivora, Lagomorpha and Rodentia) from 26 different regions of the northern Palaearctic.
   Methods Similarity in mite assemblages was investigated at the compound community level across all regions, and at the component community level, across populations of the same host species for each of 11 common host species. Similarity between pairs of mite communities was estimated using both the Jaccard and the Sorensen indices. Environmental distance was estimated as the dissimilarity between locations in a composite measure of climatic variables, and host faunal distance was simply taken as the reciprocal of indices of similarity between the composition of host faunas in different locations. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Akaike's Information Criterion were used to select the best model of decay in similarity as a function of geographic, 'environmental' and 'host faunal' distances.
   Results Overall, despite slight differences among host species, the similarity in mite assemblages decreased with both increasing 'environmental' distance and increasing 'host faunal' distance, but was generally unaffected by geographic distance between regions. The similarity of component communities of gamasid mites among host populations was determined mainly by similarity in the physical environment, whereas that of compound communities varied mainly with host-species composition.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that the general decay in community similarity with increasing geographic distances does not apply to assemblages of gamasid mites; it is possible that they can overcome great distances by means of passive dispersal (either by phoresy or wind-borne), or more likely they occur wherever their hosts are found as a result of tight cospeciation in the past. Mite assemblages on small mammalian hosts seem to be affected mainly by local environmental conditions, and, to a much lesser extent, by the species composition of local host communities.

AB The responses of ground beetles to an urbanisation gradient (forest-suburban area-urban park) were studied in and near Soro, South Zealand, Denmark, during April-October 2004. The average number of species per trap did not differ significantly among the three urbanisation stages. The average number of forest species was significantly higher in the forest area (6.2 species/trap) than in either the suburban (4.12 spp/trap) or the urban (3.7 spp/trap) areas. Both the number of open-habitat species (1.8 spp/trap), and the generalist species (2.3 spp/trap) were highest in the urban area. The number of predaceous species was highest in the forest area (8.1 spp/trap), while the number of omnivorous species was highest in the urban area (0.9 spp/trap). Multivariate statistical procedures (NMDS, Sorensen similarity index) also confirmed that species composition changed remarkably along the forest-suburban-urban gradient. The highest number of species (S = 37) was found at the urban area, deviating from trends at other northern hemisphere sites (Canada, Finland) where the overall species richness was highest at the forest habitats. Urban green areas, including forest patches contribute to the quality of urban life and thus should be conserved. Apart from their recreational value, which is widely appreciated and enjoyed by human inhabitants, such green urban spaces provide seemingly adequate habitat for numerous species of ground beetles found in less developed forest areas some distance from the city core.

AB Aim To analyse quantitatively the extent to which several methodological, geographical and taxonomic variables affect the magnitude of the tendency for the latitudinal ranges of species to increase with latitude (the Rapoport effect).
   Location Global.
   Methods A meta-analysis of 49 published studies was used to evaluate the effect of several methodological and biological moderator variables on the magnitude of the pattern.
   Results The method used to depict the latitudinal variation in range sizes is a strong moderator variable that accounts for differences in the magnitude of the pattern. In contrast, the extent of the study or the use of areal or linear estimations of range sizes does not affect the magnitude of the pattern. The effect of geography is more consistent than the effect of taxonomy in accounting for differences in the magnitude of the pattern. The Rapoport effect is indeed strong in Eurasia and North America. Weaker or non-significant latitudinal trends are found at the global scale, and in Australia, South America and the New World. There are no significant differences in the magnitude of the pattern between different habitats, however, the overall pattern is weaker in oceans than in terrestrial regions of the world.
   Main conclusions The Rapoport effect is indeed strong in continental landmasses of the Northern Hemisphere. The magnitude of the effect is primarily affected by methodological and biogeographical factors. Ecological and spatial scale effects seem to be less important. We suggest that not all methodological approaches may be equally useful for analysing the pattern.

AB We investigate multi locus patterns of differentiation between parental populations of two swallowtail butterfly species that differ at a number of ecologically important sex-linked traits. Using a new coalescent-based approach, we show that there is significant heterogeneity in estimated divergence times among five Z-linked markers, rejecting a purely allopatric speciation model. We infer that the Z chromosome is a mosaic of regions that differ in the extent of historical gene flow, potentially due to isolating barriers that prevent the introgression of species-specific traits that result in hybrid incompatibilities. Surprisingly, a candidate region for a strong barrier to introgression, Ldh, does not show a significantly deeper divergence time than other markers on the Z chromosome. Our approach can be used to test alternative models of speciation and can potentially assign chronological order to the appearance of factors contributing to reproductive isolation between species.

AB Sustainability science is emerging as a transdisciplinary effort to come to grips with the much-needed symbiosis between human activity and the environment. While there is recognition that conventional economic growth must yield to policies that foster sustainable development, this has not yet occurred on any broad scale. Rather, there is clear evidence that the Earth's ecosystems and landscapes continue to degrade as a consequence of the cumulative impact of human activities. Taking an ecohealth approach to sustainability science provides a unique perspective on both the goals and the means to achieve sustainability. The goals should be the restoration of full functionality to the Earth's ecosystems and landscapes, as measured by the key indicators of health: resilience, organization, vitality (productivity), and the absence of ecosystem distress syndrome. The means should be the coordinated (spatially and temporally) efforts to modify human behaviors to reduce cumulative stress impacts. Achieving ecosystem health should become the cornerstone of sustainability policy-for healthy ecosystems are the essential precondition for achieving sustainable livelihoods, human health, and many other societal objectives, as reflected in the Millennium Development Goals.

AB Wildland fire is the dominant large-scale disturbance mechanism in the Alaskan boreal forest, and it strongly influences forest structure and function. In this research, patterns of burn severity in the Alaskan boreal forest are characterised using 24 fires. First, the relationship between burn severity and area burned is quantified using a linear regression. Second, the spatial correlation of burn severity as a function of topography is modelled using a variogram analysis. Finally, the relationship between vegetation type and spatial patterns of burn severity is quantified using linear models where variograms account for spatial correlation. These results show that: 1) average burn severity increases with the natural logarithm of the area of the wildfire, 2) burn severity is more variable in topographically complex landscapes than in flat landscapes, and 3) there is a significant relationship between burn severity and vegetation type in flat landscapes but not in topographically complex landscapes. These results strengthen the argument that differential flammability of vegetation exists in some boreal landscapes of Alaska. Additionally, these results suggest that through feedbacks between vegetation and burn severity, the distribution of forest vegetation through time is likely more stable in flat terrain than it is in areas with more complex topography.

TI Predicting the scenic beauty value of mapped landscape changes in a

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
ID VISIBILITY; PREFERENCE; IMPACTS
AB Planning frequently fails to include the valuation of public goods, such as scenic beauty. This can lead to negative economic impacts for a region over the longer term. Especially in mountainous regions such as the Alps in central Europe, which depend on tourist income, the change of landscape views through the development of facilities for recreation and tourism may negatively affect the tourism experience, and hence the economy. In this study we present a prototypical technique to predict preferences for views using geographic information system (GIS)-based variables. A three-dimensional GIS including the effects of slope, aspect, and distance, as well as the height of landscape features, is developed to calculate the proportion of land-cover areas that make up the view. A Web-based survey is used to gather data on scenic preferences for landscape changes in the region around Davos (Switzerland). Willingness-to-pay (WTP) responses are used to identify preferred landscapes. A forced-choice questionnaire asks participants to compare pairs of landscape photographs. Two original pictures were digitally altered to visually represent landscape change scenarios developed for the study area. The visual magnitudes of the different land-cover areas are found to be correlated with the WTP values expressed by the respondents. The relationship is used to predict changes in scenic values for another view in the region. The approach presented in this paper could be useful in regional planning to estimate the influence of view components on people's preferences.

AB One hundred seventy-two frogs (Leptodactylus chaquensis) were collected from November 2002 to November 2003, in agricultural (n=132) and nonagricultural (n=40) areas. Both sites are near the city of Corrientes, Argentina. The main goals of this study were as follows: (1) to determine the helminth parasite community in agricultural and nonagricultural habitats; (2) to analyze the relationships between helminth parasites and site of infection, frog body size, and gender; (3) to identify and examine covariation and association of helminth communities; and (4) to determine the mean richness and diversity of parasite communities. The helminth compound community of this amphibian species consisted of 24 species: 19 in agricultural habitats and 18 in nonagricultural habitats. The mean richness, mean diversity, and evenness of helminths were significantly different between the habitats (P < 0.05). The body size of the host was the important factor in determining parasite richness. Both habitats exhibited differences in community ordination. The helminth species in the 2 habitats exhibited the same interspecific relationships, although differences were observed in the intensity of infection.

AB 1. The accelerating extinction rate of plant species and its effect on ecosystem functioning is a hotly debated topic in ecological research. Most research projects concerning the relationship between species diversity and productivity have been conducted in artificial plant communities, with only a few in natural ecosystems. In this study we examined the relationship between species diversity and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) over two consecutive growth seasons (2004 and 2005) in a semi-arid steppe ecosystem of northern China, that were subjected to different land uses.
   2. Land use affected the relationship between species diversity and ANPP in this semi-arid steppe ecosystem. Exclusion of grazing without or with biomass removal by mowing increased ANPP, species richness and species diversity compared with free grazing; the effect was reflected mainly as enhanced importance of the perennial forbs functional group in terms of their relative contributions to ANPP, plant cover and plant abundance.
   3. Many mechanisms regulate the relationship between species diversity and productivity. Differential effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning greatly complicate the analysis of such relationships. On grazing-exclusion sites the relationship between ANPP and species richness can be best described as an exponential growth function (R-2 = 0.99, P < 0.001, n = 24); whereas on the free-grazing site the relationship takes the form of exponential decay (R-2 = 0.96, P < 0.001, n = 24). Our study concludes that the mode and severity of disturbance are important factors for interpreting the relationship between species diversity and productivity in semi-arid steppe ecosystems.

AB We surveyed sub-fossil chironomid assemblages in surface sediments of 73 low- to mid-elevation lakes in tropical East Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia) to develop inference models for quantitative paleosalinity reconstruction. Using a calibration data set of 67 lakes with surface-water conductivity between 34 and 68,800 mu S/cm, trial models based on partial least squares (PLS), weighted-averaging (WA), weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS), maximum likelihood (ML), and the weighted modern analogue technique (WMAT) produced jack-knifed coefficients of determination (r(2)) between 0.83 and 0.87, and root-mean-squared errors of prediction (RMSEP) between 0.27 and 0.31 log(10) conductivity units, values indicating that fossil assemblages of African Chironomidae can be valuable indicators of past salinity change. The new inference models improve on previous models, which were calibrated with presence-absence data from live collections, by the much greater information content of the calibration data set, and greater probability of finding good modern analogues for fossil assemblages. However, inferences still suffered to a greater (WA, WMAT) or lesser (WA-PLS, PLS and ML) extent from weak correlation between chironomid species distribution and salinity in a broad range of fresh waters, and apparent threshold response of African chironomid communities to salinity change near 3000 mu S/cm. To improve model sensitivity in freshwater lakes we expanded the calibration data set with 11 dilute (6-61 mu S/cm) high-elevation lakes on Mt. Kenya (Kenya) and the Ruwenzori Nits. (Uganda). This did not appreciably improve models' error statistics, in part because it introduced a secondary environmental gradient to the faunal data, probably temperature.
   To evaluate whether a chironomid-based salinity inference model calibrated in East African lakes could be meaningfully used for environmental reconstruction elsewhere on the continent, we expanded the calibration data set with 8 fresh (15-168 mu S/cm) lakes in Cameroon, West Africa, and one hypersaline desert lake in Chad. This experiment yielded poorer error statistics, primarily because the need to amalgamate East and West African sister taxa reduced overall taxonomic resolution and increased the mean tolerance range of retained taxa. However, the merged data set constrained better the salinity optimum of several freshwater taxa, and further increased the probability of finding good modern analogues.
   We then used chironomid stratigraphic data and independent proxy reconstructions from two fluctuating lakes in Kenya to compare the performance of new and previous African salinity-inference models. This analysis revealed significant differences between the various numerical techniques in reconstructed salinity trends through time, due to their different sensitivity to the presence or relative abundance of certain key taxa, combined with the above-mentioned threshold faunal response to salinity change. Simple WA and WMAT produced ecologically sensible reconstructions because their step-like change in inferred conductivity near 3000 mu S/cm mirrors the relatively rapid transitions between fresh and saline lake phases associated with climate-driven lake-level change in shallow tropical closed-basin lakes. Statistical camouflaging of this threshold faunal response in WA-PLS and ML models resulted in less trustworthy reconstructions of past salinity in lakes crossing the freshwater-saline boundary. We conclude that selection of a particular inference model should not only be based on statistical performance measures, but consider chironomid community ecology in the study region, and the amplitude of reconstructed environmental change relative to the modern environmental gradient represented in the calibration data set.

AB Indices are needed in habitat conservation and restoration to provide repeatable measures relevant to conservation goals. A monitoring and research program was established at Nachusa Grasslands in north-central Illinois (USA) to assess progress in tallgrass prairie restoration and reconstruction efforts and evaluate the effectiveness of indices used to measure community-level properties related to vegetation integrity. indices selected for comparison included standard diversity measures (e.g., Shannon-Weiner Index, Evenness, Species Richness) and indices developed specifically to estimate vegetation integrity. These latter indices included two unweighted diversity indices, the Species Richness Index and Native Richness index, and two indices weighted by characteristics of species composition, the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) and its component Mean Coefficient of Conservatism (Mean C). A coefficient of conservatism (CC) is an integer ranging from 0 to 10 assigned a priori to each taxon in a regional flora that estimates the fidelity of a species to natural areas (non-native and most ruderal species are assigned 0 or low values, respectively; species known primarily from natural areas are assigned higher values). All indices compared in this study were calculated using vegetation data collected from equal-sized sampling grids stratified across seven prairie units. The units included remnants and plantings representing a wide range of habitat quality. The FQI and Mean C explained the most variation among sites and were most effective at distinguishing recognized qualitative differences indicating they can be more informative than traditional species-diversity measures in assessing floristic integrity within community types. The FQI and Mean C are applicable to both quantitative ecological monitoring and plotless survey methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper critically reviews developments in the conceptualization and elaboration of the River Ecosystem Health (REH) concept. Analysis of literature shows there is still no consistent meaning of the central concept Ecosystem Health, resulting in models (i.e. elaborations) that have unclear and insufficient conceptual grounds. Furthermore, a diverse terminology is associated with describing REH, resulting in confusion with other concepts. However, if the concept is to have merit and longevity in the field of river research and management, unambiguous definition of the conceptual meaning and operational domain are required. Therefore a redefinition is proposed, based on identified characteristics of health and derived from considering semantic and conceptual definitions. Based on this definition, REH has merit in a broader context of river system health that considers societal functioning next to ecological functioning. Assessment of health needs integration of measures of multiple, complementary attributes and analysis in a synthesized way. An assessment framework is proposed that assesses REH top-down as well as bottom up by combining indicators of system stress responses (i.e. condition) with indicators identifying the causative stress (i.e. stressor). The scope of REH is covered by using indicators of system activity, metabolism (vigour), resilience, structure and interactions between system components (organization). The variety of stress effects that the system may endure are covered by using biotic, chemical as well as physical stressors. Besides having a unique meaning, the REH metaphor has added value to river management by being able to mobilize scientists, practitioners and publics and seeing relationships at the level of values. It places humans at the centre of the river ecosystem, while seeking to ensure the durability of the ecosystem of which they are an integral part. Optimization of the indicator set, development of aggregation and classification methodologies, and implementation of the concept within differing international frames are considered main aims for future research.

AB Parks, as one specific type of urban open space, play important roles in the conservation of urban biodiversity and provision of recreational services for local residents. As there is a lack of specific insight into park plant species composition in relation to park features, 24 sample parks within the inner city of Beijing, the capital of China, were studied by stratified random plot sampling of their tree, shrub, and herbaceous communities, respectively, in order to investigate how human activities have influenced park green cover configuration and floristic characteristics. The quantitative correlation of species richness and the park green cover indices (patch size, shape, etc.) were studied. The importance value index for plant species (trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species) of each park was calculated. The two-way indicator species analysis approach (TWINSPAN) was applied to classify the 24 parks into different groups based on their species assemblages. Two-hundred and eighty-eight species were recorded within the 24 study parks, belonging to 184 genera and 72 families dominated by Gramineae, Compositae, and Leguminosae. Among all the recorded species, 41% are exotic. The species occurrence, abundance and diversity vary significantly among different parks. Besides the positive correlation (R=0.505, P < 0.05) between herbaceous species abundance and the park green cover size, no other significant relations were found between the species abundance and other indices of park green cover configuration. Remarkably, the TWINSPAN classification resulted in a good discrimination between park functional types and the variation in their species assemblage. For the parks of similar age (development history) or landscape design, their species assemblages show more similarity. The methodology adopted and results can be employed to improve baseline information on urban plant ecology and support the setting of priorities for future park management and vegetation protection.

AB Many studies have predicted the potential impacts of climate change on species' distributions at large spatial scales, yet the role of more local-scale effects remains poorly explored. Addressing more localised impacts requires that new integrated modelling approaches are developed to address fine-scale processes including species' dispersal and local connectivity. Here we integrate four models (a continental scale bioclimatic envelope model, a regional scale bioclimate and land use suitability model, a dispersal model, and a connectivity model) in a scale-dependent hierarchical framework. The approach has been used to analyse the fine scale impacts of climate change on species' distributions within two contrasting case study regions located in East Anglia (UK) and Almeria (Spain). Eight and six species respectively were used to test our approach under three climate change scenarios. Despite the uncertainties inherent in the modelling approach, our analyses suggest two general conclusions: (i) climate change involves the development of transient conditions and fragmentation within the core of species distributions; (ii) climate change would favour the opening of gaps within the current vegetation zones, rather than a simple zonal shift of them. Dynamic and integrated conservation policies are required, that take account of the current and potential future spatial arrangement of species and their habitats, to assist species to respond to future environmental change.

AB 1. Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared among a diverse array of first-order alpine tundra streams of the Swiss Alps.
   2. A principal components analysis separated sites into three main groups: rhithral streams, rhithral lake outlets, and kryal sites including outlets and streams. Rhithral streams contained the most diverse and taxon rich assemblages, being colonised by both non-insect taxa and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Diptera.
   3. Rhithral lake outlets supported high densities of non-insect taxa such as Oligochaeta, Nemathelminthes and crustaceans. Despite low taxon richness, kryal sites had high Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera abundances. Chironomidae were most common at all sites.
   4. Collector-gatherers were dominant at all sites, whereas filter-feeders were rare. Scrapers and shredders were more common in streams than lake outlets.
   5. Water temperature and algal standing crops were higher at rhithral lake outlets than rhithral streams, perhaps providing more favourable habitat for non-insect taxa. Glacial runoff was the dominant factor influencing macroinvertebrate assemblages of kryal streams and kryal lake outlets. Alpine lakes influenced the environmental conditions of their outlets and, consequently, their macroinvertebrate assemblages unless being constrained by a glacial influence.

AB For thousands of years, fire has been the main stand-replacing disturbance in the boreal forest but is now being supplemented by logging over most of the biome's extant. Community response to such disturbances of different nature and severity has been extensively compared in plant, but rarely in animal communities. Effects of fire and logging on some groups, such as ground beetles, have been assessed but separately, in different regions and different time frames. In a single 250-km(2) spruce-dominated landscape in the province of Quebec, Canada, we sampled ground beetle assemblages from recently logged (n = 12), recently burned (n = 12) and control stands (n = 18) using pitfall traps. Our objective was to compare assemblages from recently disturbed areas of the same age and nested in the same matrix. Assemblages were not highly specific to single habitats, but diverged significantly between treatments in abundance and species dominance. Capture rates were highest in logged stands, and lowest in burned stands. Forest generalists, including Calathus ingratus Dejean and Pterostichus brevicornis (Kirby), dominated assemblages in logged stands. We suggest that the contrasting activity levels observed following these two types of disturbance and the dominance of forest generalist in logged stands may partly reflect initial mortality patterns caused by these disturbances, as fires as severe as the one sampled in this study generally result in a much higher mortality rate in soil invertebrates than logging.

AB The loss of urban green space as a result of urbanization threatens the overall biodiversity of urban areas, and prompts us to consider the importance of existing urban nature more carefully. Because urban ecological systems are in intense interaction with human-social systems, it is fruitful to create an interdisciplinary research and planning framework to ensure the maintenance of biodiversity in urban areas. For this purpose, we adapted a suitable theoretical and conceptual scheme for the setting of Finnish urban development, which provides an example of a situation where a lot of nature has so far remained inside and around urban area. The adapted scheme focuses on the land use change as a result of urban land use planning and development, and may provide a way to address the important variables and feedback mechanisms between information flowing from ecological systems and drivers from the social system. Furthermore, we outlined a more specific framework around the Finnish urban detailed planning process in order to study the interactions between these systems further. After addressing ecology-oriented questions of quantity, quality and needs of urban nature, and human-oriented drivers, such as flow and incorporation of information, knowledge, values and institutions, we identified several challenges in integrating the components of ecological and social systems. Creating common conceptual ground for different actors and disciplines, improving communication in the process, matching contradictory values and perceptions, and improving stakeholder participation would be in the best interest of nature and people of urban areas.

AB The Iberian cyprinid fauna, characterized by the presence of numerous endemic species, has suffered from significant habitat degradation. The critically endangered Squalius aradensis is restricted to small drainages of southern Portugal, habitats that typically exhibit a characteristic Mediterranean-type heterogeneous hydrological system throughout the year, including alternation of flooding events during winter and complete drought in large river sections during summer. To assess the effect of historical and recent processes on genetic diversity in S. aradensis we examined within- and among-population variability in cytochrome b and six polymorphic microsatellite loci. Estimates of genetic diversity in time and space through the combined use of traditional Phi-/F-statistics, phylogenetic trees, ordination methods and nested clade analysis indicated significant and congruent structuring among populations. Data suggest that the Arade drainage represent the evolutionary centre of the species, with subsequent allopatric fragmentation across drainages. Factors other than isolation by distance strongly affected the within-drainage genetic differentiation observed in these Mediterranean-type drainages, including recent population expansion from a bottleneck event and restricted gene flow imposed by a long-term barrier (brackish water area). Significant correlation was found between S. aradensis allelic diversity and upstream drainage area. The relevance of findings for conservation issues is discussed in relation to local intermittent hydrological conditions, the highly restricted distribution and the critically endangered status of the species.

AB Polaskia chichipe is a columnar cactus under artificial selection in central Mexico because of its edible fruits. Our study explored the effect of human manipulation on levels and distribution of genetic variation in wild, silviculturally managed and cultivated sympatric populations. Total genetic variation, estimated in nine populations with five microsatellite loci, was H-T = 0.658 +/- 0.026 SE, which was mainly distributed within populations (H-S = 0.646) with low differentiation among them (F-ST = 0.015). Fixation index (F-IS) in all populations was positive, indicating a deficit of heterozygous individuals with respect to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. When populations were pooled by management type, the highest expected heterozygosity (H-E = 0.631 +/- 0.031 SE) and the lowest fixation index (F-IS = 0.07) were observed in wild populations, followed by cultivated populations (H-E = 0.56 +/- 0.03 SE, F-IS = 0.14), whereas the lowest variation was found in silviculturally managed populations (H-E = 0.51 +/- 0.05 SE, F-IS = 0.17). Low differentiation among populations under different management types (F-ST 0.005, P < 0.04) was observed. A pattern of migration among neighbouring populations, suggested from isolation by distance (r(2) = 0.314, P < 0.01), may have contributed to homogenizing populations and counteracting the effects of artificial selection. P. chichipe, used and managed for at least 700 generations, shows morphological differentiation, changes in breeding system and seed germination patterns associated with human management, with only slight genetic differences detected by neutral markers.

AB Although there is extraordinary interest in the quantitative measurement of species diversity, published statements on the behavior of the components of species diversity are contradictory and lead to opposite conclusions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the confusion is due to two key oversights: (1) whether or not biological sampling is carried out within or between communities; and (2) determination of the statistical distribution underlying a biological community, which is crucial for the evaluation of all of the components of diversity measurement.
   The problem of sampling "within" a population or community is basically distinct from the equivalent integration of structure and diversity measurement "between" differing multispecies populations. "Within-community sampling" is defined as a set of biological samples from a statistical population that has a particular statistical distribution or a constant value for the associated parameter(s). As the number of individuals increases along with the number of species, for a log series distribution, the diversity measures of Shannon's H, log series or Fisher's alpha, and Simpson's Index 1/lambda remain constant while the evenness measures of Buzas-Gibson's E and Pielou's J decrease. For a log-normal distribution, J will remain constant while E decreases and alpha, 1/lambda, and H increase. No single measure of evenness remains constant over all statistical distributions, so if constancy as a type of independence is required, the appropriate distribution must first be determined. Each species ensemble is mathematically fixed by the applicable statistical distribution.
   In contrast, "between-community sampling" is defined as a set of biological samples from different statistical distributions and/or the same distribution with differing parametric values. If sampling is between communities and S increases while the number of individuals remains constant, then all the other measures considered here increase. The exception is the broken stick, for which E remains constant while H, J, alpha, and 1/lambda increase.
   Herein we propose and justify the use of the log-series distribution (with regression on the information decomposition equation) as a null model for determination of community structure and demonstrate that the community structure of a Miocene bed at Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, is a log series by use of this new unified methodology.

AB Organochlorine contaminants (OCs) are known to affect the immune systems of wildlife, and in this study we assessed the relationship between blood concentration of different OCs and measurements relevant to immune status and function in arctic breeding glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus). In 1997 and 2001, we counted white blood cells (heterophils and lymphocytes) from blood smears, and in 2000 and 2001 we injected two novel nonpathogenic antigens (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids) into the pectoral muscle of gulls and measured the primary antibody responses. We then related these measurements to the blood concentrations of three pesticides (hexachlorobenzene [HCB], oxychlordane, and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) and seven different polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCB 101, 99, 118, 153, 138, 180, and 170). There were significant or near significant positive relationships (0.1 > p > 0.001) between most persistent OCs and the levels of heterophils in the blood for both sexes in 1997 and for male gulls in 2001. Similarly, levels of all persistent OCs and lymphocytes were positively related (0.1 > p > 0.001) in both sexes in 1997. This suggests that OCs are causing alterations to immune systems, which may decrease their efficiency and make the birds more susceptible to parasites and diseases. In female gulls, the antibody response to the diphtheria toxoid was significant and negative for HCB (p <0.01) and weaker, but significant, for oxychlordane (p <0.05), suggesting that OCs were causing an impairment of the humoral immunity. Various OCs have been linked to negative effects in our study population, including decreased survival and reproduction, and this study suggests that such compounds also affect immune status and function.

AB 1. Interference between species from different functional groups may influence ecosystem functioning and biological diversity. This study tested whether interactions between predacious cutthroat trout and an omnivorous signal crayfish modified the crayfish's trophic and engineering effects within a detrital-based, stream benthic community.
   2. We show in a trough experiment that omnivorous crayfish through their trophic and engineering roles enhance detritus decomposition, reduce particulate organic matter (POM) accumulation, and diminish diversity in leaf packs.
   3. In crayfish troughs by day 30, leaf dry weight loss was 1.8-fold greater, whereas POM trapped in leaf packs was 80% less, than of those in controls, and the abundance, biomass and taxon richness of benthos in leaf packs were lower than those in controls. Predatory cutthroat trout did not affect those variables and did not interfere with the crayfish.
   4. Crayfish and cutthroat trout both decreased fine material sedimentation in the troughs.
   5. Thus, with no interference from cutthroat trout, the signal crayfish acted as ecosystem processors and engineers, and strongly influenced detrital processing, benthic diversity, and the accumulation of POM and fine sediments.

AB Hybridization between taxonomically similar species is an often-overlooked mechanism limiting the recovery of threatened and endangered species. We present molecular genetic data for the first time demonstrating that Canada lynx and bobcats hybridize in the wild. We verify that two microsatellite loci Lc106 and Lc110 have non-overlapping allele ranges between Canada lynx and bobcats, and that three putative lynx from Minnesota contain DNA from both bobcats and lynx. Additionally, we use a published test for the 16S rRNA region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to determine the maternal species; all hybrids had lynx mothers. Fifteen per cent (3/20) of our `putative lynx' samples were hybrids, although these data are not from a representative sampling effort. Hybridization may be an under-appreciated factor limiting the distribution and recovery of lynx. The presence of hybrids is thus a new factor in the population management of both species with potential implications for hunting and trapping of bobcats.

AB The relative contribution of sediment food ( e. g. organic matter, carbohydrates, proteins, C, N, polyunsaturated fatty acids) and environmental variables ( e. g. oxygen, pH, depth, sediment grain size, conductivity) in explaining the observed variation in benthic macroinvertebrates is investigated. Soft bottom sediments, water and benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in several water systems across The Netherlands. The variance partitioning method is used to quantify the relative contributions of food and environmental variables in structuring the benthic macroinvertebrate community structure.
   It is assumed that detritivores show a significant relationship with sediment food variables and carnivores and herbivores do not. The results of the variance partitioning method with data sets containing only detritivores, herbivores or carnivores confirm this assumption. This indicates that the variance partitioning method is a useful tool for analyzing the impact of different groups of variables in complex situations. Approximately 45% of the total variation in the macroinvertebrate community structure could be explained by variables included in the analyses. The variance partitioning method shows that sediment food variables contributed significantly to the total variation in the macroinvertebrate dataset. The relative importance of food depends on the intensity of other environmental factors and is lower on broad spatial scales than on smaller scales.
   The results of the partitioning depend on the selected variables that are included in the analyses. The method becomes problematic in case variables from different groups of variables ( e. g. one food variable and one environmental variable) have a high inflation factor and thus are collinear. The choice of the variable that is left out impacts the variance allocated to the different groups of variables.
   The variance partitioning method was able to detect the spatial scale dependent contribution of food variables in structuring macroinvertebrate communities. This spatial scale dependency can also be caused by the size, the composition, and the heterogeneity of the dataset. Performing extra analyses in which specific samples are removed from the original dataset can give insight in under- or overestimation of the impact of certain factors and offers the possibility to test the robustness of the obtained results.

AB 1. Two types of artificial neural networks procedures were used to define and predict diatom assemblage structures in Luxembourg streams using environmental data.
   2. Self-organising maps (SOM) were used to classify samples according to their diatom composition, and multilayer perceptron with a backpropagation learning algorithm (BPN) was used to predict these assemblages using environmental characteristics of each sample as input and spatial coordinates (X and Y) of the cell centres of the SOM map identified as diatom assemblages as output. Classical methods (correspondence analysis and clustering analysis) were then used to identify the relations between diatom assemblages and the SOM cell number. A canonical correspondence analysis was also used to define the relationship between these assemblages and the environmental conditions.
   3. The diatom-SOM training set resulted in 12 representative assemblages (12 clusters) having different species compositions. Comparison of observed and estimated sample positions on the SOM map were used to evaluate the performance of the BPN (correlation coefficients were 0.93 for X and 0.94 for Y). Mean square errors of 12 cells varied from 0.47 to 1.77 and the proportion of well predicted samples ranged from 37.5 to 92.9%. This study showed the high predictability of diatom assemblages using physical and chemical parameters for a small number of river types within a restricted geographical area.

AB Individual movement is a key process affecting the distribution of animals in heterogeneous landscapes. For specialist species in patchy habitat, a central issue is how dispersal distances are related to landscape structure. We compared dispersal distances for cactus bugs (Chelinidea vittiger) on two naturally fragmented landscapes (:! 4% suitable habitat) with different matrix structures (i.e., vegetation height of nonsuitable habitat between suitable patches). Using mark-release-recapture studies, we determined that most transfers between cactus patches occurred during the mating season. Dispersal distances were reduced by > 50% on the landscape that had reduced structural connectivity due to relatively high matrix structure and low patch density. An experiment with detailed movement pathways demonstrated that greater matrix structure decreased mean step lengths, reduced directionality, and thus decreased net displacement by > 60%. However, habitat edges between two matrix elements that differed substantially in resistance to movement were completely permeable. Therefore, the difference in distributions of dispersal distances between the two landscapes mainly reflected the average resistance of matrix habitat and not the level of matrix heterogeneity per se. Our study highlights the merits of combining estimates of dispersal distances with insights on mechanisms from detailed movement pathways, and emphasizes the difficulty of treating dispersal distances of species as fixed traits independent of landscape structure.

AB A phylogenetic comparative method is proposed for estimating historical effects on comparative data using the partitions that compose a cladogram, i.e., its monophyletic groups. Two basic matrices, Y and X, are defined in the context of an ordinary linear model. Y contains the comparative data measured over t taxa. X consists of an initial tree matrix that contains all the x(j) monophyletic groups (each coded separately as a binary indicator variable) of the phylogenetic tree available for those taxa. The method seeks to define the subset of groups, i.e., a reduced tree matrix, that best explains the patterns in Y. This definition is accomplished via regression or canonical ordination (depending on the dimensionality of Y) coupled with Monte Carlo permutations. It is argued here that unrestricted permutations (i.e., under an equiprobable model) are valid for testing this specific kind of groupwise hypothesis. Phylogeny is either partialled out or, more properly, incorporated into the analysis in the form of component variation. Direct extensions allow for testing ecomorphological data controlled by phylogeny in a variation partitioning approach. Currently available statistical techniques make this method applicable under most univariate/multivariate models and metrics; two-way phylogenetic effects can be estimated as well. The simplest case (univariate Y), tested with simulations, yielded acceptable type I error rates. Applications presented include examples from evolutionary ethology, ecology, and ecomorphology. Results showed that the new technique detected previously overlooked variation clearly associated with phylogeny and that many phylogenetic effects on comparative data may occur at particular groups rather than across the entire tree.

AB From 1968 to 1972, Char Lake (Resolute Bay, Cornwallis Island, Canadian High Arctic) was the site of a large-scale limnological study conducted under the auspices of the International Biological Programme. However, since that time, very little research has been done on the lake. We sampled Char Lake from 1992 to 2000 for a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables. In general, there were no major differences between our water quality data and those collected 30 years earlier, showing that Char Lake is still oligotrophic, slightly alkaline, and dilute. However, a diatom-based paleolimnological analysis revealed that a subtle, yet distinct species assemblage shift has occurred beginning around 1987. The timing of this species shift does not correspond to the deposition of atmospherically transported persistent organic pollutants into the lake (beginning in the early 1950s) or to minor disturbances within its catchment (early 1970s). Instead, these subtle diatom changes are consistent with recent climatic changes during 1988-1997 (as documented by local meteorological measurements), and are likely related to reduced summer ice cover and a longer growing season.

AB The rate of recolonization of artificially denuded substrata by benthic macroinvertebrates was investigated in 7 southeastern England streams that differed in disturbance frequency and refugium availability. Disturbance frequency and refugia were estimated from observation of substratum movements and shear stress distributions, respectively. Thus, high-refugium sites had a high proportion of low shear stress spots at high discharge, whereas low-refugium sites had a low proportion. Colonization was estimated experimentally using wide-meshed cages containing washed substratum, which remained in the stream for 2 or 7 d. Natural and recolonized benthic assemblages were ordinated, and colonization rate was estimated from Euclidean distances. Macroinvertebrate colonization rate (i.e., mobility) increased with disturbance frequency, but only where refugium availability was low. High-refugium sites had faster colonization than low-refugium sites, irrespective of disturbance regime. Higher mobility in high-refugium sites may reflect lower mortality risk from flow disturbance when the physical habitat is heterogeneous. Our study suggests that high refugium availability may reduce the effect of flow disturbance in streams.

AB In 1999, we surveyed breeding bird and plant communities along 54 streams in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan region to link bird community metrics with structural and spatial characteristics of urban riparian areas. Canonical correspondence analysis produced two explanatory axes relating to vegetation and road density. Total and non-native bird abundance was higher in narrow forests. Native bird abundance was greater in narrow forests surrounded by undeveloped lands;, native species richness and diversity were greater in less-developed areas. Native resident and short-distance-migrant abundance was higher in narrow forests, and diversity was positively associated with developed lands. Neotropical migrant abundance, richness, and diversity were greater in open-canopied areas with fewer roads. We examined spatial relationships by regressing bird variables on satellite-derived forest canopy cover, area of undeveloped lands, and street density in a series of 50-m buffers within a 500-m radius around study sites. Non-native bird abundance decreased with increasing canopy cover within 450 m, but most other relationships were strongest at smaller scales (50-100 m). Our results suggest that increasing urban canopy cover is the most valuable land management action for conserving native breeding birds. A hierarchical scheme for Neotropical migrant conservation might include increasing forest canopy within 450 m of streams to control non-native species and cowbirds; reducing street density within a 100-m radius of streams; and conserving or planting onsite native trees and shrubs.

AB Growth, survival, and breeding success of individuals in populations of wild mammals are influenced by the climatic and nutritional conditions that individuals experience during their early development. Recent findings have shown that early conditions also have consequences for subsequent survival and reproductive performance in humans. Environmental conditions which affect early development of individuals, such as the quality and quantity of nutrition received in utero and infancy, predict the onset of many chronic diseases in adulthood, affect longevity and may also influence a range of measures of reproductive performance in both food-limited and contemporary Western human populations. These associations are proposed to result from foetal programming, where a stimulus or insult during a critical period early in life may permanently affect body structure, physiology, and metabolism. Here I review studies showing how birthweight, season of birth, or exposure to prenatal starvation affect different aspects of an individual's subsequent reproductive success in humans and the growth, survival, and reproductive performance of the offspring produced. I show that early maternal and environmental conditions can have a large impact on human reproductive strategies and fitness that can span across generations. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB We studied resource quality and climatic constraints on soil respiration over a mountain birch forest-tundra ecotone in northern Swedish Lapland during 1999-2001 by means of both a field-based soil transplant experiment and a laboratory incubation experiment. Average carbon dioxide fluxes over the 2000 thaw season were 0.62 and 0.48 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1), at forest and tundra control plots, respectively. We attribute the higher respiration rate at the forest site mainly to more favourable microclimate but also to higher resource quality. Temperature-respiration relationships described using Arrhenius equations explained 37% of the variation in the tundra soil respiration and 42% for the forest soils on a season-wide basis in 2000. Q(10) values (exponential temperature-response) were generally high (except in August in the field experiment) compared to the global average (2.4) and varied over time, with increased temperature-dependency at low soil temperatures. In the laboratory, higher activation energy was found in soils incubated at higher temperatures (12 and 17 degreesC in the range 133-109 kJ mol(-1)) compared with lower temperatures (2 and 7 degreesC in the range 98-92 kJ mol(-1)) suggesting an adaptation of the decomposer community toward more psychrophilic organisms or metabolism in low-temperature environments. Soil moisture, however, could also play an important role in modifying any temperature response of soil respiration in this sub-arctic ecotone area. These mesic soils have a relatively rapid turnover time of carbon and should be compared to boreal forest and temperate woodland in carbon dynamics. We conclude that a shift from tundra to birch forest would give an initial pulse of carbon released from soil to the atmosphere as labile carbon stored in tundra soils is metabolised by decomposer organisms.

AB Within agricultural landscapes many species of birds depend on hedgerows and woodland, but few studies have examined their relative importance as habitats for breeding birds. Breeding bird communities in hedgerows and woodland in lowland England and Wales were compared in terms of species richness and similarity of species composition. The preference of individual species for hedgerows and woodland was also assessed. The data were drawn from 33 farmland and 35 woodland Common Birds Census plots for 3 years: 1990, 1993 and 1996. Woodland plots were significantly richer in species than farmland plots. Species number on farmland plots increased linearly with the cover of farm woodland and non-linearly with density of total hedgerow. Species number increased with density of non-roadside hedgerows, but not with density of roadside hedgerows. Although the farmland and woodland plots supported distinctive bird communities, there was considerable overlap between them in species composition. The similarity between the species composition on individual farms and that theoretically possible for woodland increased significantly with the cover of farm woodland, hedgerow density and the total amount of woody habitat present within the farmland plot. Canonical correspondence analysis and preference indices indicated that seven species could be regarded as hedgerow specialists: Dunnock Prunella modularis. Whitethroat Sylvia communis, Lesser Whitethroat S. curruca, Linnet Carduelis cannabina, Goldfinch C. carduelis, Greenfinch C. chloris and Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella. Species showing clear preferences for woodland were: Tawny Owl Strix aluco, Marsh Tit Parus palustris, Coal Tit P. ater, Goldcrest Regulus regulus, Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata. Treecreeper Certhia familiaris, Nuthatch Sitta europaea, Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla. The habitat needs of the hedgerow specialists show considerable variation and do not always coincide with the hedgerow structures that support the greatest numbers of bird species and highest densities of birds. Management strategies that maintain a diversity of hedgerow structures are, therefore, desirable. Hedgerow and woodland bird communities are essentially complementary and habitat creation initiatives in lowland agricultural landscapes should not be excessively weighted towards one habitat or the other.

AB We have used molecular variation in microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA to throw light on the origins of enigmatic geographical patterns, known as 'area effects', in the shell polymorphisms of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis. Our aim was to assess the relative importance of recent selection and historical events in the formation of these patterns. On the Marlborough Downs in Wiltshire, England, the 'type locality: for area effects, the frequencies of microsatellites are significantly associated with the frequencies of alleles for shell banding. A less clear association is found between microsatellites and shell colour. Mitochondrial haplotypes show no significant relationships. Although the correlated geographical patterns could be the results of random genetic drift from an initially uniform array of populations, the magnitudes of the patterns, and of the correlations between them, seem too strong to have arisen by drift since the last glaciation. Our results suggest tl-lat invasions from refugia have been the most important factors in forming area effects.

AB Microsatellites are used to unravel the fine-scale genetic structure of a hybrid zone between chromosome races Valais and Cordon of the common shrew (Sorex araneus) located in the French Alps. A total of 269 individuals collected between 1992 and 1995 was typed for seven microsatellite loci. A modified version of the classical multiple correspondence analysis is carried out. This analysis clearly shows the dichotomy between the two races. Several approaches are used to study genetic structuring. Gene flow is clearly reduced between these chromosome races and is estimated at one migrant every two generations using X-statistics and one migrant per generation using F-statistics. Hierarchical F- and R-statistics are compared and their efficiency to detect inter- and intraracial patterns of divergence is discussed. Within-race genetic structuring is significant, but remains weak. F-ST displays similar values on both sides of the hybrid zone, although no environmental barriers are found on the Cordon side, whereas the Valais side is divided by several mountain rivers. We introduce the exact G-test to microsatellite data which proved to be a powerful test to detect genetic differentiation within as well as among races. The genetic background of karyotypic hybrids was compared with the genetic background of pure parental forms using a CRT-MCA. Our results indicate that, without knowledge of the karyotypes, we would not have been able to distinguish these hybrids from karyotypically pure samples.

AB The diversity of ground-beetle communities (Coleoptera, Carabidae) was studied to assess the short-term impact of new hedges planted in an intensive agro-ecosystem. Hedges represent a new and undisturbed habitat for those polyphagous predators and may provide increased prey availability. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps in a hedge and an adjacent cultivated field during the whole activity period of these insects to assess the effect of distance from the hedge on species diversity. Fenced pitfall traps were also used to estimate absolute population densities. Several diversity indices were calculated at various sampling levels (total area, distance treatment, trap). Kendall's coefficient of rank correlation between communities at adjacent distances showed that the greatest changes in species relative abundances occurred close to the hedge. Indices of species richness, dominance concentration, equitability and Fisher's a all indicated a significant decrease in species diversity with increasing distance from the hedge. These trends are explained by two complementary factors. First, the number of species decreased significantly with distance from the centre of the hedge. Second, the various species had different spatial patterns of total capture and absolute density. Four groups of species can thus be distinguished: species restricted to the hedge, species preferring the hedge, species preferring the crop, and species unaffected by the hedge. The respective roles of small-scale abiotic changes in habitat structure and differences in prey availability are discussed.

AB Structural changes were analysed in two virgin forest stands by comparing tree data collected in 1922 and 1994. One stand was dominated by pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), while the other was a mixed pine and spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand. Between 1922 and 1994, the standing volume of living trees increased by 46% in the pine stand and by 71% in the mixed stand, while the volume of dead trees increased by 126% and 87%, respectively. The proportion of spruce increased at the expense of pine and deciduous tree species in both stands. The density of conifer seedlings fell by 90% between the two dates, and diameter distributions changed considerably as a result of changed regeneration conditions and differing mortality rates of different size classes. The data suggest that a reversed J-shaped diameter distribution of spruce could be a temporary phenomenon rather than a stable long-term characteristic. The structural changes found, which seem to be characteristic of many protected forests, appear to be due to the absence of fire disturbance. It is questionable, therefore, that the policy of fire prevention is consistent with the major aims of nature conservation programmes.

AB The Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), a key component of the marine food web of Canadian high Arctic waters, occurs at temperatures close to or below zero. We established a complete energy budget for this Arctic fish, based on laboratory measurements of consumption (C), growth (G), respiration (R), egestion (F), and excretion (U) at about 0 degrees C. An average (N = 3) energy budget for individual juvenile Arctic cod fed live Arctic zooplankton was 100C = 50G + 24R + 9SDA + 3F + 6U + 8Z, where SDA is specific dynamic action (derived from previously published studies) and Z included activity and unaccounted energy. Eight determinations of total energy budgets for fish fed to satiation accounted for 72-104% of the energy consumed. Maximum daily rations and growth rates were dependent an fish size and the energy content of prey. Although maximum daily rations were similar for small fish fed different prey, diets of Calanus copepods (high energy content) resulted in faster growth rates than diets of Themisto amphipods or capelin (Mallotus villosus) fillets. Both consumption and respiration rates were low at temperatures close to 0 degrees C. The net result was slow growth rates, although the assimilation efficiency was about 80%. Because of slow growth of individuals, the relatively high annual production of Arctic cod mainly reflects their large standing biomass.

AB This study examines the dynamics of a competition and a host-parasite model in which the interactions are determined by quantitative characters. Both models are extensions of one-dimensional difference equations that can exhibit complicated dynamics. Compared to these basic models, the phenotypic variability given by the quantitative characters reduces the size of the density fluctuations in asexual populations. With sexual reproduction, which is described by modeling the genetics of the quantitative character explicitly with many haploid loci that determine the character additively, this reduction in fitness variance is magnified. Moreover, quantitative genetics can induce simple dynamics. For example, the sexual population can have a two-cycle when the asexual system is chaotic. This paper discusses the consequences for the evolution of sex. The higher mean growth rate implied by the lower fitness variance in sexual populations is an advantage that can overcome a twofold intrinsic growth rate of asexuals. The advantage is bigger when the asexual population contains only a subset of the phenotypes present in the sexual population, which conforms with the tangled bank theory for the evolution of sex and shows that tangled bank effects also occur in host-parasite systems. The results suggest that explicitly describing the genetics of a quantitative character leads to more flexible models than the usual assumption of normal character distributions, and therefore to a better understanding of the character's impact on population dynamics.

AB 1. During the spring of 1992, fifty-two quantitative diatom samples were collected from twenty-eight rivers located in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, Japan, to study the response of the diatom assemblages to water pollution (assessed using physical and chemical data determined monthly from April 1987 to March 1992).
   2. Species composition was analysed by means of biotic indices (Pantle and Buck's saprobic index) and multivariate analyses [two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) for classification and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for ordination]. Species-abundance relationships were analysed using diversity indices (species richness, Shannon's diversity index and Pielou's evenness index) and rank-abundance patterns (rank-abundance curves).
   3. CCA revealed two major gradients. The first corresponded to organic pollution and eutrophication. The second corresponded to variables related to geographical location. Four main station groups were determined by TWINSPAN. The location of the indicator species of groups 1-3 along the CCA axis 1 is consistent with their known pollution tolerance characteristics. Indicator species for group 4 had larger scores on CCA axis 2, and are representative of brackish water environments.
   4. Species richness tended to be higher in the intermediate range of water pollution. Pielou's evenness index and Shannon's diversity index followed the same tendency but only weakly.
   5. The rank-abundance patterns of diatom assemblages were more or less constant in all stations. The curves were very similar in shape, differing only in length and gradient (directly related to species richness and evenness, respectively).
   6. The results of this study indicate that the response of diatom assemblages to environmental change can be observed in species compositional variation. Multivariate analyses and pollution indices revealed this response and are to be preferred to species diversity measures.

AB A major review of butterfly conservation was conducted from 1985 to 1987 in central southern Britain where semi-natural habitats are highly fragmented. Of the 308 sites surveyed, 67% had been protected as statutory Sites of Special Scientific Interest, but three nationally and 20 regionally important sites were not notified. Over half the sites were privately owned and about 23% were owned or managed by conservation organisations. Of the 2248 definite colonies of key species identified, 384 had become extinct, mostly over the last 40 years. Two of the 29 key species had become totally extinct on the study sites and the documented (minimum) loss rate amongst Red Data Book or Scarce species had been 37%. Moreover, the losses had been just as great on protected as on unprotected land, and for many species this trend continued in the 1980s. The main conclusion of the study is that many of Britain's rarer species are not being conserved effectively under the present system of site protection and a comprehensive conservation strategy for butterflies is needed. The results have wider implications for the conservation of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes and suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on the management of habitat fragments and the better integration of protected areas into the surrounding landscape.

AB 1. The elimination rate of radiocaesium in brown trout Salmo trutta L. was determined in the laboratory at four water temperatures (range 4.4-15.6-degrees-C). In the experiments three or four homogenous size-groups of fish (mean weights 23-496 g) were studied at each temperature.
   2. The brown trout received acute oral doses of Cs-134 and were killed at intervals for radioactivity counting. The retention versus time curves were composed of two distinct exponential components. The long-lived component was quantitatively the most important for retention of radiocaesium. Elimination rate increased with increasing water temperature and decreased with increasing body weight.
   3. The biological half-life of Cs-134 (T(b) days) was related to fresh body weight (W, g) and water temperature (t, degrees-C) by the equation: T(b) = 290 x W0.176 x e-0.106xt. The elimination rate of Cs could be predicted from weight-specific metabolic rate as given by Elliott's equations for brown trout.

AB Retention efficiencies of 0.6 to 7-mu-m diameter particles were determined for the pelagic tunicate Oikopleura vanhoeffeni by offering individuals a graded series of latex microspheres and measuring the change in volume proportion directly by microscope counts of the number of beads of each size in suspension vs in the gut. Beads the size of free-living bacteria (0.6-mu-m) were retained with a mean efficiency of 44 +/- 8 % (+/- 95 % CI), whereas 1, 3 and 7-mu-m beads were retained with mean efficiencies of 58 +/- 8 %, 88 +/- 6 % and 91 +/- 3 %, respectively. These results support our earlier ultrastructural predictions of a coarse pharyngeal filter mesh, and show that the food concentrating filter does not alone determine the size composition of the ingested ration. Retention of sub-micrometer particles (0.6 and 1-mu-m beads) was dependent on body size, with mean values of < 20 % for specimens longer than 3 mm. These retention spectra are similar to those of salps and ascidians, but show that appendicularians retain sub-micrometer particles more efficiently than do salps. We conclude that O. vanhoeffeni is capable of mediating a shunt of microbial biomass directly from bacteria, other picoplankton and small nanoflagellates to large metazoans, including known fish predators of appendicularians.

AB Global climate change is expected to further raise the frequency and severity of extreme events, such as droughts. The effects of extreme droughts on trees are difficult to disentangle given the inherent complexity of drought events (frequency, severity, duration, and timing during the growing season). Besides, drought effects might be modulated by trees' phenotypic variability, which is, in turn, affected by long-term local selective pressures and management legacies. Here we investigated the magnitude and the temporal changes of tree-level resilience (i.e., resistance, recovery, and resilience) to extreme droughts. Moreover, we assessed the tree-, site-, and drought-related factors and their interactions driving the tree-level resilience to extreme droughts. We used a tree-ring network of the widely distributed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) along a 2,800 km latitudinal gradient from southern Spain to northern Germany. We found that the resilience to extreme drought decreased in mid-elevation and low productivity sites from 1980-1999 to 2000-2011 likely due to more frequent and severe droughts in the later period. Our study showed that the impact of drought on tree-level resilience was not dependent on its latitudinal location, but rather on the type of sites trees were growing at and on their growth performances (i.e., magnitude and variability of growth) during the predrought period. We found significant interactive effects between drought duration and tree growth prior to drought, suggesting that Scots pine trees with higher magnitude and variability of growth in the long term are more vulnerable to long and severe droughts. Moreover, our results indicate that Scots pine trees that experienced more frequent droughts over the long-term were less resistant to extreme droughts. We, therefore, conclude that the physiological resilience to extreme droughts might be constrained by their growth prior to drought, and that more frequent and longer drought periods may overstrain their potential for acclimation.

AB Movement is a trait of fundamental importance in ecosystems subject to frequent disturbances, such as fire-prone ecosystems. Despite this, the role of movement in facilitating responses to fire has received little attention. Herein, we consider how animal movement interacts with fire history to shape species distributions. We consider how fire affects movement between habitat patches of differing fire histories that occur across a range of spatial and temporal scales, from daily foraging bouts to infrequent dispersal events, and annual migrations. We review animal movements in response to the immediate and abrupt impacts of fire, and the longer-term successional changes that fires set in train. We discuss how the novel threats of altered fire regimes, landscape fragmentation, and invasive species result in suboptimal movements that drive populations downwards. We then outline the types of data needed to study animal movements in relation to fire and novel threats, to hasten the integration of movement ecology and fire ecology. We conclude by outlining a research agenda for the integration of movement ecology and fire ecology by identifying key research questions that emerge from our synthesis of animal movements in fire-prone ecosystems.

AB Land subsidence caused by land use change and overexploitation of groundwater is an example of mismanagement of natural resources, yet subsidence remains difficult to predict. In this study, the relationship between land subsidence features and geo-environmental factors is investigated by comparing two machine learning algorithms (MLA): maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and genetic algorithm rule-set production (GARP) algorithms in the Kashmar Region, Iran. Land subsidence features (N = 79) were mapped using field surveys. Land use, lithology, the distance from traditional groundwater abstraction systems (Qanats), from afforestation projects, from neighboring faults, and the drawdown of groundwater level (DGL) (1991-2016) were used as predictive variables. Jackknife resampling showed that DGL, distance from afforestation projects, and distance from Qanat systems are major factors influencing land subsidence, with geology and faults being less important. The GARP algorithm outperformed the MaxEnt algorithm for all performance metrics. The performance of both models, as measured by the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC), decreased from 88.9-94.4% to 82.5-90.3% when DGL was excluded as a predictor, though the performance of GARP was still good to excellent even without DGL. MLAs produced maps of subsidence risk with acceptable accuracy, both with and without data on groundwater drawdown, suggesting that MLAs can usefully inform efforts to manage subsidence in data scarce regions, though the highest accuracy requires data on changes in groundwater level.

AB Plants operate along a continuum of stringency of regulation of plant water potential from isohydry to anisohydry. However, most metrics and proxies of plant iso/anisohydric behavior have been developed from limited sets of site-specific experiments. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that determine species' operating ranges along this continuum, independent of site and growing conditions, remains challenging. We compiled a global database to assess the global patterns of metrics and proxies of plant iso/anisohydry and then explored some of the underlying functional traits and trade-offs associated with stringency of regulation that determines where species operate along the continuum. Our results showed that arid and semi-arid biomes were associated with greater anisohydry than more mesic biomes, and angiosperms showed marginally greater anisohydry than gymnosperms. Leaf water potential at the turgor loss point (psi(tlp)) and wood density were the two most powerful proxies for ranking the degree of plant iso/anisohydry for a wide range of species and biomes. Both of these simple traits can be easily and rapidly determined, and therefore show promise for a priori mapping and understanding of the global distribution pattern of the degree of plant iso/anisohydry. Generally, the most anisohydric species had the most negative values of psi(tlp) and highest wood density, greatest resistance to embolism, lowest hydraulic capacitance and lowest leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity of their branches. Wood density in particular appeared to be central to a coordinated series of traits, trade-offs and behaviors along a continuum of iso/anisohydry. Quantification of species' operating ranges along a continuum of iso/anisohydry and identification of associated trade-offs among functional traits may hold promise for mechanistic modeling of species-specific responses to the anticipated more frequent and severe droughts under global climate change scenarios.

AB After replanting apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) on the same site severe growth suppressions, and a decline in yield and fruit quality are observed in all apple producing areas worldwide. The causes of this complex phenomenon, called apple replant disease (ARD), are only poorly understood up to now which is in part due to inconsistencies in terms and methodologies. Therefore we suggest the following definition for ARD: ARD describes a harmfully disturbed physiological and morphological reaction of apple plants to soils that faced alterations in their (micro-) biome due to the previous apple cultures. The underlying interactions likely have multiple causes that extend beyond common analytical tools in microbial ecology. They are influenced by soil properties, faunal vectors, and trophic cascades, with genotype-specific effects on plant secondary metabolism, particularly phytoalexin biosynthesis. Yet, emerging tools allow to unravel the soil and rhizosphere (micro-) biome, to characterize alterations of habitat quality, and to decipher the plant reactions. Thereby, deep insights into the reactions taking place at the root rhizosphere interface will be gained. Counteractions are suggested, taking into account that culture management should emphasize on improving soil microbial and faunal diversity as well as habitat quality rather than focus on soil disinfection.

AB Although UV/chlorine advanced oxidation process has been employed to treat contaminants, the roles of secondary radicals are generally negligible. The comprehensive evaluation of secondary radicals on contaminants degradation remains deficient. In this study, two typical neonicotinoid insecticides, imidacloprid (IMD) and thiacloprid (THIA), were degraded via UV/chlorine process. It is for the first time found that the existence of Cl (-)significantly promoted THIA degradation during UV/chlorine process, attributed to the formation of Cl-2(center dot-). In addition, the effects of pH, fulvic acid (FA), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) on the degradation of IMD and THIA were evaluated. Low pH was in favor of the degradation of IMD and THIA, while both FA and HCO3- had slight inhibition effects. Meanwhile, the degradation of IMD and THIA via UV/chlorine process was inhibited in real matrices. The existence of Br-heavily suppressed the degradation of THIA via UV/chlorine process. The initial transformation pathways of IMD and THIA involved electron transfer, H-abstraction, and then disproportionation or the methylene bridge cleavage, yielding hydroxyl and keto derivatives as well as free amine. Although the mineralization for IMD (29%) and THIA (35%) was low, the acute toxicity to Vibrio fischeri for the treated samples was lower than that for corresponding parent compounds. This study comprehensively evaluated the degradation of IMD and THIA via UV/chlorine process, highlighting Cl-2(center dot-) as an important reactive species for THIA elimination.

AB As is true of virtually every realm of the biological sciences, our understanding of speciation is increasingly informed by the genomic revolution of the past decade. Investigators can ask detailed questions relating to both the extrinsic (e.g. inter-and intra-population and ecological interactions) and intrinsic (e.g. genome content and architecture) forces that drive speciation. Technologies ranging from restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), to whole genome sequencing and assembly, to transcriptomics, to CRISPR are revolutionizing the means by which investigators can both frame and test hypotheses of lineage diversification. Our review aims to examine both extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of speciation. Genome-scale data have already served to fundamentally clarify the role of gene flow during (and after) speciation, although we predict that the differential propensity for speciation among phylogenetic lineages will be one of the most exciting frontiers for future genomic investigation. We propose that a unified theory of speciation will take into account the idiosyncratic features of genomic architecture examined in the light of each organism's biology and ecology drawn from across the full breadth of the Tree of Life.

AB Plants adopt a variety of life history strategies to succeed in the Earth's diverse environments. Using functional traits which are defined as morphological, biochemical, physiological, or phonological characteristics measurable at the individual level, plants are classified according to their species' adaptative strategies, more than their taxonomy, from fast growing plant species to slower-growing conservative species. These different strategies probably influence the input and output of carbon (C)-resources, from the assimilation of carbon by photosynthesis to its release in the rhizosphere soil via root exudation. However, while root exudation was known to mediate plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, it was not used as functional trait until recently. Here, we assess whether root exudate levels are useful plant functional traits in the classification of plant nutrient-use strategies and classical trait syndromes? For this purpose, we conducted an experiment with six grass species representing along a gradient of plant resource-use strategies, from conservative species, characterized by low biomass nitrogen (N) concentrations and a long lifespans, to exploitative species, characterized by high rates of photosynthesis and rapid rates of N acquisition. Leaf and root traits were measured for each grass and root exudate rate for each planted soil sample. Classical trait syndromes in plant ecology were found for leaf and root traits, with negative relationships observed between specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content or between specific root length and root dry matter content. However, a new root trait syndrome was also found with root exudation levels correlating with plant resource-use strategy patterns, specifically, between root exudation rate and root dry matter content. We therefore propose root exudation rate can be used as a key functional trait in plant ecology studies and plant strategy classification.

AB Empirical studies and habitat suitability modeling project significant shifts in species distributions in response to climate change. Because habitat fragmentation can impede species range shifts, wildlife corridors may have increasing importance in enhancing climate resilience for species persistence. While habitat connectivity has been studied for over four decades, the design of connectivity specifically to facilitate species movement in response to climate change is a relatively new challenge. We conducted a systematic review of 116 relevant papers from 1996-2017. Research focused on assessing the utility of habitat connectivity for climate change adaptation by species (N = 29) and modeling and mapping climate-wise connectivity for planning purposes (N = 55). Others addressed fundamental questions of connectivity related to climate adaptation (N = 31). Based on empirical data and computer simulations examining species range shifts in response to climate change at leading edges of current distributions; it is clear that large protected areas connected through linkages, and stepping stones embedded in a permeable matrix promote population persistence and facilitate range expansion. We identified 13 approaches to modeling climate-wise connectivity based on either focal species or landscape structure. When prioritizing areas for connectivity conservation, approaches include focusing on connecting areas of low climate velocity, refugia, climate analogs, or linking current to future suitable habitats. Riparian corridors should be considered in connectivity plans because of their importance as natural movement corridors, climate gradients, and refugia. Guidance is provided on selecting the best methods for connectivity design depending on the objectives, available data, and landscape context. Future research needs to evaluate the functionality of climate-wise connectivity models for facilitating range shifts and compare connectivity outcomes across modeling approaches.

AB Microbial community structure in the ozone-biofiltration systems of two drinking water and two wastewater treatment facilities was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Collectively, these datasets enabled comparisons by facility, water type (drinking water, wastewater), pre-oxidation (ozonation, chlorination), media type (anthracite, activated carbon), media depth, and backwash dynamics. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in drinking water filters, whereas Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes were differentially abundant in wastewater filters. A positive correlation was observed between media depth and relative abundance of Cyanobacteria in drinking water filters, but there was only a slight increase in one alpha diversity metric with depth in the wastewater filters. Media type had a significant effect on beta but not alpha diversity in drinking water and wastewater filters. Pre-ozonation caused a significant decrease in alpha diversity in the wastewater filters, but the effect on beta diversity was not statistically significant. An evaluation of backwash dynamics resulted in two notable observations: (1) endosymbionts such as Neochlamydia and Legionella increased in relative abundance following backwashing and (2) nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium dominated the microbial community in wastewater filters operated with infrequent backwashing. Bradyrhizobium is known to generate extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which may adversely impact biofilter performance and effluent water quality. These findings have important implications for public health and the operation and resiliency of biofiltration systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recent IPCC reports state that continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, threatening "severe, pervasive and irreversible" impacts. Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention - deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2 degrees C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5 degrees C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate "reversibility", the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.

AB Forest trees use various strategies to cope with drought stress and these strategies involve complex molecular mechanisms. Pinus halepensis Miller (Aleppo pine) is found throughout the Mediterranean basin and is one of the most drought-tolerant pine species. In order to decipher the molecular mechanisms that P. halepensis uses to withstand drought, we performed large-scale physiological and transcriptome analyses. We selected a mature tree from a semi-arid area with suboptimal growth conditions for clonal propagation through cuttings. We then used a high-throughput experimental system to continuously monitor whole-plant transpiration rates, stomatal conductance and the vapor pressure deficit. The transcriptomes of plants were examined at six physiological stages: pre-stomatal response, partial stomatal closure, minimum transpiration, post-irrigation, partial recovery and full recovery. At each stage, data from plants exposed to the drought treatment were compared with data collected from well-irrigated control plants. A drought-stressed P. halepensis transcriptome was created using paired-end RNA-seq. In total, similar to 6000 differentially expressed, non-redundant transcripts were identified between drought-treated and control trees. Cluster analysis has revealed stress-induced down-regulation of transcripts related to photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging through the ascorbic acid (AsA)-glutathione cycle, fatty acid and cell wall biosynthesis, stomatal activity, and the biosynthesis of flavonoids and terpenoids. Up-regulated processes included chlorophyll degradation, ROS-scavenging through AsA-independent thiol-mediated pathways, abscisic acid response and accumulation of heat shock proteins, thaumatin and exordium. Recovery from drought induced strong transcription of retrotransposons, especially the retrovirus-related transposon Tnt1-94. The drought-related transcriptome illustrates this species' dynamic response to drought and recovery and unravels novel mechanisms.

AB Eco-evolutionary dynamics of microbiotas at the macroscale level are largely driven by ecological variables. The diet and living environment of the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, diversify during development, providing a natural system to explore convergence, divergence, and repeatability in patterns of microbiota dynamics as a function of the host diet, phylogeny, and environment. Here, we characterized the microbiotas of 47 B. dorsalis individuals from three distinct populations by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. A significant deviation was found within the larvae, pupae, and adults of each population. Pupae were characterized by an increased bacterial taxonomic and functional diversity. Principal components analysis showed that the microbiotas of larvae, pupae, and adults clearly separated into three clusters. Acetobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae were the predominant families in larval and adult samples, and PICRUSt analysis indicated that phosphoglycerate mutases and transketolases were significantly enriched in larvae, while phosphoglycerate mutases, transketolases, and proteases were significantly enriched in adults, which may support the digestive function of the microbiotas in larvae and adults. The abundances of Intrasporangiaceae, Dermabacteraceae (mainly Brachybacterium) and Brevibacteriaceae (mainly Brevibacterium) were significantly higher in pupae, and the antibiotic transport system ATP-binding protein and antibiotic transport system permease protein pathways were significantly enriched there as well, indicating the defensive function of microbiotas in pupae. Overall, differences in the microbiotas of the larvae, pupae, and adults are likely to contribute to differences in nutrient assimilation and living environments.

AB The vaginal microbiome plays an influential role in several disease states in reproductive age women, including bacterial vaginosis (BV). While demographic characteristics are associated with differences in vaginal microbiome community structure, little is known about the influence of sexual and hygiene habits. Furthermore, associations between the vaginal microbiome and risk symptoms of bacterial vaginosis have not been fully elucidated. Using Bayesian network (BN) analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence results, demographic and extensive questionnaire data, we describe both novel and previously documented associations between habits of women and their vaginal microbiome. The BN analysis approach shows promise in uncovering complex associations between disparate data types. Our findings based on this approach support published associations between specific microbiome members (e.g., Eggerthella, Gardnerella, Dialister, Sneathia and Ruminococcaceae), the Nugent score (a BV diagnostic) and vaginal pH (a risk symptom of BV). Additionally, we found that several microbiome members were directly connected to other risk symptoms of BV (such as vaginal discharge, odor, itch, irritation, and yeast infection) including L. jensenii, Corynebacteria, and Proteobacteria. No direct connections were found between the Nugent Score and risk symptoms of BV other than pH, indicating that the Nugent Score may not be the most useful criteria for assessment of clinical BV. We also found that demographics (i.e., age, ethnicity, previous pregnancy) were associated with the presence/absence of specific vaginal microbes. The resulting BN revealed several as-yet undocumented associations between birth control usage, menstrual hygiene practices and specific microbiome members. Many of these complex relationships were not identified using common analytical methods, i.e., ordination and PERMANOVA. While these associations require confirmatory follow-up study, our findings strongly suggest that future studies of the vaginal microbiome and vaginal pathologies should include detailed surveys of participants' sanitary, sexual and birth control habits, as these can act as confounders in the relationship between the microbiome and disease. Although the BN approach is powerful in revealing complex associations within multidimensional datasets, the need in some cases to discretize the data for use in BN analysis can result in loss of information. Future research is required to alleviate such limitations in constructing BN networks. Large sample sizes are also required in order to allow for the incorporation of a large number of variables (nodes) into the BN, particularly when studying associations between metadata and the microbiome. We believe that this approach is of great value, complementing other methods, to further our understanding of complex associations characteristic of microbiome research.

AB Understanding soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is important to develop strategies to increase the SOC stock and, thereby, offset some of the increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Although the capacity of soils to store SOC in a stable form is commonly attributed to the fine (clay+fine silt) fraction, the properties of the fine fraction that determine the SOC stabilization capacity are poorly known. The aim of this study was to develop an improved model to estimate the SOC stabilization capacity of Allophanic (Andisols) and non-Allophanic topsoils (0-15cm) and, as a case study, to apply the model to predict the sequestration potential of pastoral soils across New Zealand. A quantile (90 th) regression model, based on the specific surface area and extractable aluminium (pyrophosphate) content of soils, provided the best prediction of the upper limit of fine fraction carbon (FFC) (i.e. the stabilization capacity), but with different coefficients for Allophanic and non-Allophanic soils. The carbon (C) saturation deficit was estimated as the difference between the stabilization capacity of individual soils and their current C concentration. For long-term pastures, the mean saturation deficit of Allophanic soils (20.3 mg C g(-1)) was greater than that of non-Allophanic soils (16.3 mg C g(-1)). The saturation deficit of cropped soils was 1.14-1.89 times that of pasture soils. The sequestration potential of pasture soils ranged from 10 t C ha(-1) (Ultic soils) to 42 t C ha(-1) (Melanic soils). Although meeting the estimated national soil C sequestration potential (124 Mt C) is unrealistic, improved management practices targeted to those soils with the greatest sequestration potential could contribute significantly to off-setting New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions. As the first national-scale estimate of SOC sequestration potential that encompasses both Allophanic and non-Allophanic soils, this serves as an informative case study for the international community.

AB Continuous monitoring of daily evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for allocating and managing water resources in irrigated agricultural areas in arid regions. In this study, continuous daily ET at a 90-m spatial resolution was estimated using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) by fusing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with high temporal resolution and Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) images with high spatial resolution. The spatiotemporal characteristics of these sensors were obtained using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). The performance of this approach was validated over a heterogeneous oasis-desert region covered by cropland, residential, woodland, water, Gobi desert, sandy desert, desert steppe, and wetland areas using in situ observations from automatic meteorological systems (AMS) and eddy covariance (EC) systems in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin in Northwest China. The error introduced during the data fusion process based on STARFM is within an acceptable range for predicted LST at a 90-m spatial resolution. The surface energy fluxes estimated using SEBS based on predicted remotely sensed data that combined the spatiotemporal characteristics of MODIS and ASTER agree well with the surface energy fluxes observed using EC systems for all land cover types, especially for vegetated area with MAP values range from 9% to 15%, which are less than the uncertainty (18%) of the observed lambda E in this study area. Time series of daily ET modelled from SEBS were compared to that modelled from PT-JPL (one of Satellite-based Priestley-Taylor ET model) and observations from EC systems. SEBS performed generally better than PT-JPL for vegetated area, especially irrigated cropland with bias, RMSE, and MAP values of 0.29 mm/d, 0.75 mm/d, 13% at maize site, -0.33 mm/d, 0.81 mm/d, and 14% at vegetable sites.

AB Evolutionary theory has been extended almost continually since the evolutionary synthesis (ES), but except for the much greater importance afforded genetic drift, the principal tenets of the ES have been strongly supported. Adaptations are attributable to the sorting of genetic variation by natural selection, which remains the only known cause of increase in fitness. Mutations are not adaptively directed, but as principal authors of the ES recognized, the material (structural) bases of biochemistry and development affect the variety of phenotypic variations that arise by mutation and recombination. Against this historical background, I analyse major propositions in the movement for an 'extended evolutionary synthesis'. 'Niche construction' is a new label for a wide variety of well-known phenomena, many of which have been extensively studied, but (as with every topic in evolutionary biology) some aspects may have been understudied. There is no reason to consider it a neglected 'process' of evolution. The proposition that phenotypic plasticity may engender new adaptive phenotypes that are later genetically assimilated or accommodated is theoretically plausible; it may be most likely when the new phenotype is not truly novel, but is instead a slight extension of a reaction norm already shaped by natural selection in similar environments. However, evolution in new environments often compensates for maladaptive plastic phenotypic responses. The union of population genetic theory with mechanistic understanding of developmental processes enables more complete understanding by joining ultimate and proximate causation; but the latter does not replace or invalidate the former. Newly discovered molecular phenomena have been easily accommodated in the past by elaborating orthodox evolutionary theory, and it appears that the same holds today for phenomena such as epigenetic inheritance. In several of these areas, empirical evidence is needed to evaluate enthusiastic speculation. Evolutionary theory will continue to be extended, but there is no sign that it requires emendation.

AB It has widely been acknowledged that the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is greatly affected by climate, land use intensity, and soil parameters. The objective of this study was to investigate AMF diversity in multiple agricultural soils (154 sites; 92 grasslands and 62 croplands) distributed over all agricultural regions in Switzerland and differing in a number of soil parameters (e.g., land use type and intensity, and altitude). We highlighted the main factors responsible for major AMF community shifts and documented specific distribution patterns for each AMF species. AMF spores were morphologically identified and counted for each species. In total, 17,924 spores were classified and 106 AMF species were identified. In general, AMF species richness (SR) was higher in grasslands than in croplands. In croplands, SR increased with altitude but this trend was not observed in grasslands. Some species occurred at virtually all sites, while others were rarely detected, and for others, species-specific distribution patterns were revealed. Some species were affected by land use type or intensity, or related factors like soil organic matter, soil microbial biomass and respiration or nutrient availability. Other species were more affected by soil pH and related parameters like base saturation and carbonate contents, by soil texture, or by altitude, or by a combination of two to several of all these parameters. We conclude that a high number of AMF species may serve as indicator species for specific habitats and land use. These species might deliver certain ecosystem services at their habitats and deserve further investigation about their functional diversity.

AB The goal of this study was to investigate the influences of gradually mixotrophic culture conditions on microalgal biomass and lipid production by a consortium of indigenous microalgae and bacteria present in raw municipal wastewater. Lab-scale photobioreactors containing the consortium were operated in repeated batch mode. Initial cultivation (phase I) was performed using only the municipal wastewater, then 10% and 25% of the reactor volumes were replaced with the effluent from a sewage sludge fermentation system producing volatile fatty acids (SSFV) at the beginnings of phase II and phase III, respectively. The highest biomass productivity (117.1 +/- 2.7 mg/L/d) was attained during phase II, but the lipid productivity (17.2 +/- 0.2 mg/L/d) was attained during phase III. The increase in the effluent from the SSFV influenced microalgal diversity with a preference for Chlorella sp., but bacterial diversity increased significantly during phase III.

AB Many maritime countries in Europe have implemented marine environmental monitoring programmes which include the measurement of chemical contaminants and related biological effects. How best to integrate data obtained in these two types of monitoring into meaningful assessments has been the subject of recent efforts by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Expert Groups. Work within these groups has concentrated on defining a core set of chemical and biological endpoints that can be used across maritime areas, defining confounding factors, supporting parameters and protocols for measurement. The framework comprised markers for concentrations of, exposure to and effects from, contaminants. Most importantly, assessment criteria for biological effect measurements have been set and the framework suggests how these measurements can be used in an integrated manner alongside contaminant measurements in biota, sediments and potentially water. Output from this process resulted in OSPAR Commission (www.ospar.org) guidelines that were adopted in 2012 on a trial basis for a period of 3 years. The developed assessment framework can furthermore provide a suitable approach for the assessment of Good Environmental Status (GES) for Descriptor 8 of the European Union (EU) Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).

AB BACKGROUNDThe benefits of neonicotinoid seed treatment to soybean farmers have received increased scrutiny. Rather than use data from small-plot experiments, this research uses survey data from 500 US farmers to estimate the benefit of neonicotinoid seed treatments to them. As seed treatment users, farmers are familiar with their benefits in the field and have economic incentives to only use them if they provide value.
   RESULTSOf the surveyed farmers, 51% used insecticide seed treatments, averaging 87% of their soybean area. Farmers indicated that human and environmental safety is an important consideration affecting their pest management decisions and reported aphids as the most managed and important soybean pest. Asking farmers who used seed treatments to state how much value they provided gives an estimate of $US 28.04 ha(-1) treated in 2013, net of seed treatment costs. Farmer-reported average yields provided an estimated average yield gain of 128.0 kg ha(-1) treated in 2013, or about $US 42.20 ha(-1) treated, net of seed treatment costs.
   CONCLUSIONThese estimates using different data and methods are consistent and suggest the value of insecticide seed treatments to the US soybean farmers who used them in 2013 was around $US 28-42 ha(-1) treated, net of seed treatment costs. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In recent decades, the fire regime of the Mediterranean Basin has been disturbed by various factors: climate change; forest management policies; land cover; changed landscape. Size and severity have notably increased, which in turn have increased large fires events with >500 ha burned (high severity). In spite of Mediterranean ecosystems' high resilience to fire, these changes have implied more vulnerability and reduced natural recovery with irreparable long-term negative effects. Knowledge of the response of ecosystems to increasing severity, mainly in semiarid areas, is still lacking, which is needed to rehabilitate and restore burned areas.
   Our approach assessed the resilience concept by focusing on the recovery of ecosystem functions and services, measured as changes in the composition and diversity of plant community vegetation and structure. This will be validated in the long term as a model of ecosystem response. Also, depending on the pre-fire characteristics of vegetation, fire severity and the post-fire management, this approach will lead to tools that can be applied to implement post-fire restoration efforts in order to help decision making in planning activities.
   Regarding Mediterranean ecosystems' ability to recover after wildfires, this study concludes that pre-fire communities are resilient in these fire-prone areas, but the window for natural recovery in semiarid areas Of Aleppo pine forest in SE Iberian Peninsula varied from 3 to 15 post-fire years. Fire severity was also key for effects on the ecosystem: the vegetation types of areas burned with low and medium severity recovered naturally, while those areas with a high-severity burn induced shrublands. We concluded that very strong regeneration activity exists in the short term, and that the negative effects of medium- and high-severity fire are evidenced in the mid and long term, which affect natural recovery. Adaptive forest management to rehabilitate and restore burned Mediterranean ecosystems should be implemented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Functional ecology is a subdiscipline that aims to enable a mechanistic understanding of patterns and processes from the organismic to the ecosystem level. This paper addresses some main aspects of the process-oriented current knowledge on phagotrophic, i.e. heterotrophic and mixotrophic, protists in aquatic food webs. This is not an exhaustive review; rather, we focus on conceptual issues, in particular on the numerical and functional response of these organisms. We discuss the evolution of concepts and define parameters to evaluate predator prey dynamics ranging from Lotka-Volterra to the Independent Response Model. Since protists have extremely versatile feeding modes, we explore if there are systematic differences related to their taxonomic affiliation and life strategies. We differentiate between intrinsic factors (nutritional history, acclimatisation) and extrinsic factors (temperature, food, turbulence) affecting feeding, growth, and survival of protist populations. We briefly consider intraspecific variability of some key parameters and constraints inherent in laboratory microcosm experiments. We then upscale the significance of phagotrophic protists in food webs to the ocean level. Finally, we discuss limitations of the mechanistic understanding of protist functional ecology resulting from principal unpredictability of nonlinear dynamics. We conclude by defining open questions and identifying perspectives for future research on functional ecology of aquatic phagotrophic protists. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Although marine reserves represent one of the most effective management responses to human impacts, their capacity to sustain the same diversity of species, functional roles and biomass of reef fishes as wilderness areas remains questionable, in particular in regions with deep and long-lasting human footprints. Here we show that fish functional diversity and biomass of top predators are significantly higher on coral reefs located at more than 20 h travel time from the main market compared with even the oldest (38 years old), largest (17,500 ha) and most restrictive (no entry) marine reserve in New Caledonia (South-Western Pacific). We further demonstrate that wilderness areas support unique ecological values with no equivalency as one gets closer to humans, even in large and well-managed marine reserves. Wilderness areas may therefore serve as benchmarks for management effectiveness and act as the last refuges for the most vulnerable functional roles.

AB It is widely thought that small populations should have less additive genetic variance and respond less efficiently to natural selection than large populations. Across taxa, we meta-analytically quantified the relationship between adult census population size (N) and additive genetic variance (proxy: h(2)) and found no reduction in h(2) with decreasing N; surveyed populations ranged from four to one million individuals (1735 h(2) estimates, 146 populations, 83 species). In terms of adaptation, ecological conditions may systematically differ between populations of varying N; the magnitude of selection these populations experience may therefore also differ. We thus also meta-analytically tested whether selection changes with N and found little evidence for systematic differences in the strength, direction or form of selection with N across different trait types and taxa (7344 selection estimates, 172 populations, 80 species). Collectively, our results (i) indirectly suggest that genetic drift neither overwhelms selection more in small than in large natural populations, nor weakens adaptive potential/h(2) in small populations, and (ii) imply that natural populations of varying sizes experience a variety of environmental conditions, without consistently differing habitat quality at small N. However, we caution that the data are currently insufficient to determine whether some small populations may retain adaptive potential definitively. Further study is required into (i) selection and genetic variation in completely isolated populations of known N, under-represented taxonomic groups, and nongeneralist species, (ii) adaptive potential using multidimensional approaches and (iii) the nature of selective pressures for specific traits.

AB Microbes associated with insects can confer a wide range of ecologically relevant benefits to their hosts. Since insect-associated bacteria often increase the nutritive value of their hosts' diets, the study of bacterial communities is especially interesting in species that are important agricultural pests. We investigated the composition of bacterial communities in the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens and its variability in relation to developmental stage, diet and population (field and laboratory), using bacterial tag-encoded FLX pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. In larvae, bacterial communities differed depending on the food plant on which they had been reared, although the within-group variation between biological replicates was high as well. Moreover, larvae originating froma field or laboratory population did not share any OTUs. Interestingly, Enterococcus sp. was found to be the dominant taxon in laboratoryreared larvae, but was completely absent from field larvae, indicating dramatic shifts inmicrobial community profiles upon cultivation of the moths in the laboratory. Furthermore, microbiota composition varied strongly across developmental stages in individuals of the field population, and we found no evidence for vertical transmission of bacteria from mothers to offspring. Since sample sizes in our study were small due to pooling of samples for sequencing, we cautiously conclude that the high variability in bacterial communities suggests a loose and temporary association of the identified bacteria with H. virescens.

AB Identifying the drivers shaping biological assemblages in fragmented tropical landscapes is critical for designing effective conservation strategies. It is still unclear, however, whether tropical biodiversity is more strongly affected by forest loss, by its spatial configuration or by matrix composition across different spatial scales.
   Assessing the relative influence of forest patch and landscape attributes on dung beetle assemblages in the fragmented Lacandona rainforest, Mexico.
   Using a multimodel inference approach we tested the relative impact of forest patch size and landscape forest cover (measures of forest amount at the patch and landscape scales, respectively), patch shape and isolation (forest configuration indices at the patch scale), forest fragmentation (forest configuration index at the landscape scale), and matrix composition on the diversity, abundance and biomass of dung beetles.
   Patch size, landscape forest cover and matrix composition were the best predictors of dung beetle assemblages. Species richness, beetle abundance, and biomass decreased in smaller patches surrounded by a lower percentage of forest cover, and in landscapes dominated by open-area matrices. Community evenness also increased under these conditions due to the loss of rare species.
   Forest loss at the patch and landscape levels and matrix composition show a larger impact on dung beetles than forest spatial configuration. To preserve dung beetle assemblages, and their key functional roles in the ecosystem, conservation initiatives should prioritize a reduction in deforestation and an increase in the heterogeneity of the matrix surrounding forest remnants.

AB In the current context of climate change, the study of microbial communities along altitudinal gradients is especially useful. Only few studies considered altitude and season at the same time. We characterized four forest sites located in the Italian Alps, along an altitude gradient (545-2000 m a.s.l.), to evaluate the effect of altitude in spring and autumn on soil microbial properties. Each site in each season was characterized with regard to soil temperature, physicochemical properties, microbial activities (respiration, enzymes), community level physiological profiles (CLPP), microbial abundance and community structure (PLFA). Increased levels of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrients were found at higher altitudes and in autumn, resulting in a significant increase of (soil dry-mass related) microbial activities and abundance at higher altitudes. Significant site-and season-specific effects were found for enzyme production. The significant interaction of the factors site and incubation temperature for soil microbial activities indicated differences in microbial communities and their responses to temperature among sites. CLPP revealed site-specific effects. Microbial community structure was influenced by altitudinal, seasonal and/or site-specific effects. Correlations demonstrated that altitude, and not season, was the main factor determining the changes in abiotic and biotic characteristics at the sites investigated.

AB Animal personality can be seen as behavioral polymorphism that could play a direct and active role in driving evolutionary pathways. We argue here that consistent individual differences in key personality traits affecting dispersal and other density-dependent processes have provided substantial contributions to molding biogeographic patterns. Building upon opportunities recently opened by genomics and other novel approaches, we explore the hypothesis that Pleistocene range expansions, island colonizations, and other historical biogeographic processes could have been promoted by non-random samples of behavioral types of the founder populations. We provide context and testable hypotheses, based on case studies, that could bring new implications to our understanding of the processes shaping spatial and temporal patterns of variation in animal biodiversity.

AB Identification of invasion hotspots that support multiple invasive alien species (IAS) is a prerequisite for control and management of invasion. However, till recently it remained a methodological challenge to precisely determine such invasive hotspots. We identified the hotspots of alien species invasion in India through Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) using species occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The predicted area of invasion for selected species were classified into 4 categories based on number of model agreements for a region i.e. high, medium, low and very low. About 49% of the total geographical area of India was predicted to be prone to invasion at moderate to high levels of climatic suitability. The intersection of anthropogenic biomes and ecoregions with the regions of 'high' climatic suitability was classified as hotspot of alien plant invasion. Nineteen of 47 ecoregions of India, harboured such hotspots. Most ecologically sensitive regions of India, including the 'biodiversity hotspots' and coastal regions coincide with invasion hotspots, indicating their vulnerability to alien plant invasion. Besides demonstrating the usefulness of ENM and open source data for IAS management, the present study provides a knowledge base for guiding the formulation of an effective policy and management strategy for controlling the invasive alien species.

AB Overgrazing is considered one of the key disturbance factors that results in alpine grassland degradation in Tibet. Grazing exclusion by fencing has been widely used as an approach to restore degraded grasslands in Tibet since 2004. Is the grazing exclusion management strategy effective for the vegetation restoration of degraded alpine grasslands? Three alpine grassland types were selected in Tibet to investigate the effect of grazing exclusion on plant community structure and biomass. Our results showed that species biodiversity indicators, including the Pielou evenness index, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and the Simpson dominance index, did not significantly change under grazing exclusion conditions. In contrast, the total vegetation cover, the mean vegetation height of the community, and the aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the grazing exclusion grasslands than in the free grazed grasslands. These results indicated that grazing exclusion is an effective measure for maintaining community stability and improving aboveground vegetation growth in alpine grasslands. However, the statistical analysis showed that the growing season precipitation (GSP) plays a more important role than grazing exclusion in which influence on vegetation in alpine grasslands. In addition, because the results of the present study come from short term(6-8 years) grazing exclusion, it is still uncertain whether these improvements will be continuable if grazing exclusion is continuously implemented. Therefore, the assessments of the ecological effects of the grazing exclusion management strategy on degraded alpine grasslands in Tibet still need long term continued research.

AB Global climate change is causing shifts in phenology across multiple species. We use a geographically and temporally extensive data set of butterfly abundance across the state of Ohio to ask whether phenological change can be predicted from climatological data. Our focus is on growing degree days (GDD), a commonly used measure of thermal accumulation, as the mechanistic link between climate change and species phenology. We used simple calculations of median absolute error associated with GDD and an alternative predictor of phenology, ordinal date, for both first emergence and peak abundance of 13 butterfly species. We show that GDD acts as a better predictor than date for first emergence in nearly all species, and for peak abundance in more than half of all species, especially univoltine species. Species with less ecological flexibility, in particular those with greater dietary specialization, had greater predictability with GDD. The new method we develop for predicting phenology using GDD offers a simple yet effective way to predict species' responses to climate change.

AB Water use efficiency (WUE) reflects the coupling of carbon and water cycles. Analyzing the spatial variability of WUE can improve our understanding on the interaction between carbon and water cycles at a large scale, which also provides a basis for improving the regional carbon budget assessment. Based on,China's eddy covariance measurements, we examined the spatial variation of China's WUE and its affecting factors. WUE showed a decreasing trend with the increasing altitude, which was the result of ecosystem type distribution resulting from the climatic gradient. After fully considering the vertical variation of WUE, we found that not only mean annual air temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and mean leaf area index (MLAI) but also mean annual total photosynthesis active radiation (MAR) affected the spatial variation of WUE. With the increasing MAT, MAP, and MLAI, WUE increased significantly but the increasing MAR decreased WUE. The spatial variation of WUE could be directly depicted by MLAI and altitude, the equation including which explained 65% of the spatial variation of WUE. The effects of MAT and MAP on the spatial variation of WUE may be achieved through altering MLAI, while the mechanism underlying the effect of MAR on the spatial variation of WUE was still unclear, which should be the subject of future investigations. This study reveals the vertical variation of WUE and provides a new approach to generate the spatial variation in WUE, which will benefit the regional carbon budget assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The essential functional roles performed by animal species are lost when they become locally extinct, and ecosystems are critically threatened by this decline in functional diversity. Theory that links function, diversity, and ecosystem stability exists but fails to assess function loss that occurs in species with persistent populations. The entire functional role of a species, or a critical component of it, can be lost following large population declines (functional extinction), following population increase, or after behavioural adaptations to changes in the population, community, habitat, or climate. Here, we provide a framework that identifies the scenarios under which 'cryptic' function loss can occur in persistent populations. Cryptic function loss is potentially widespread and critically threatens ecosystem stability across the globe.

AB Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) frequently consume milkweed in and near agroecosystems and consequently may be exposed to pesticides like neonicotinoids. We conducted a dose response study to determine lethal and sublethal doses of clothianidin using a 36-h exposure scenario. We then quantified clothianidin levels found in milkweed leaves adjacent to maize fields. Toxicity assays revealed LC10, LC50, and LC90 values of 7.72, 15.63, and 30.70 ppb, respectively. Sublethal effects (larval size) were observed at 1 ppb. Contaminated milkweed plants had an average of 1.14 +/- 0.10 ppb clothianidin, with a maximum of 4 ppb in a single plant. This research suggests that clothianidin could function as a stressor to monarch populations.

AB Understanding patterns of species diversity at different spatial scales is important for adapting management and conservation efforts. We have therefore studied wild bee and wasp (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) diversity structure in forest landscapes and evaluated the importance of conservation management at the local and landscape levels. Surveys were conducted at 32 clearcuts in eight landscapes in a managed boreal forest region. We assessed the influence of local habitat and landscape composition on species richness patterns and the effect of prescribed burning and landscape affinity on species composition for all bees and wasps as well as ecological and functional groups. The relative contribution of alpha and beta diversity on the regional level was assessed by diversity partitioning and the beta diversity between landscapes further partitioned into components of species turnover and nestedness. Bee and wasp species richness increased with high flower richness and clearcut size, and species composition differed between burned and unburned sites. Thus, flower-rich early-successional sites in boreal forest landscapes are important habitats for wild bees and wasps. To support this fauna, openness should be maintained for extended periods by delaying or avoiding tree plantation at flower-rich spots on clearcuts. Beta diversity between landscapes accounted for the greatest proportion of the total regional gamma diversity, and over 70% of this diversity was due to species turnover. This implies that in order to maintain regional diversity, conservation efforts should be spatially dispersed, i.e. applied to every landscape of a few hundred square kilometers and adapted to the local species assemblages.

AB 1. New logical and analytical frameworks for studying functional traits have led to major advances in plant and freshwater ecology at local and global scales. The ecological and taxonomic diversity of terrestrial adult beetles (Coleoptera) means that functional trait approaches should have considerable power to illuminate the function not only of these animals but also of the ecosystems in which they occur. 2. Even though the functional trait concept is not new in ecology, it is still plagued with inconsistencies in methodology and terminology. Plant-based studies have shown that an integrated and relatively consistent functional trait approach facilitates comparisons between studies, and allows the full utility and predictive capacity of trait-based approaches to be realised. 3. This review outlines a logical framework for adult beetle functional trait studies using uniform terminology and methodology similar to those used by plant ecologists. Beetle life-history and ecomorphological trait studies are synthesised and it is shown that a combination of both is analogous to the functional trait approach. A general functional trait list for beetles and potential functional links is outlined, as are potential analysis approaches. A consistent functional trait approach, coupled with advances in molecular techniques, has the capability to provide deeper insights into beetle community assembly and how beetles impact ecosystems and will enable worldwide comparisons and predictions to be made.

AB The demographic and phylogeographic histories of species provide insight into the processes responsible for generating biological diversity, and genomic datasets are now permitting the estimation of species histories with unprecedented accuracy. We used a genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset generated using a RAD-Seq method to investigate the historical demography and phylogeography of a widespread lowland Neotropical bird (Xenops minutus). As expected, we found that prominent landscape features that act as dispersal barriers, such as Amazonian rivers and the Andes Mountains, are associated with the deepest phylogeographic breaks, and also that isolation by distance is limited in areas between these barriers. In addition, we inferred positive population growth for most populations and detected evidence of historical gene flow between populations that are now physically isolated. Although we were able to reconstruct the history of Xenops minutus with unprecedented resolution, we had difficulty conclusively relating this history to the landscape events implicated in many Neotropical diversification hypotheses. We suggest that even if many traditional diversification hypotheses remain untestable, investigations using genomic datasets will provide greater resolution of species histories in the Neotropics and elsewhere.

AB The species-flocks of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes Victoria, Malawi and Tanganyika constitute the most diverse extant adaptive radiations in vertebrates. Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of the lakes, harbors the morphologically and genetically most diverse assemblage of cichlids and contains the highest number of endemic cichlid genera of all African lakes. Based on morphological grounds, the Tanganyikan cichlid species have been grouped into 12-16 distinct lineages, so-called tribes. While the monophyly of most of the tribes is well established, the phylogenetic relationships among the tribes remain largely elusive. Here, we present a new tribal level phylogenetic hypothesis for the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika that is based on the so far largest set of nuclear markers and a total alignment length of close to 18 kb. Using next-generation amplicon sequencing with the 454 pyrosequencing technology, we compiled a dataset consisting of 42 nuclear loci in 45 East African cichlid species, which we subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses. We analyzed the entire concatenated dataset and each marker individually, and performed a Bayesian concordance analysis and gene tree discordance tests. Overall, we find strong support for a position of the Oreochromini, Boulengerochromini, Bathybatini and Trematocarini outside of a clade combining the substrate spawning Lamprologini and the mouthbrooding tribes of the 'H-lineage', which are both strongly supported to be monophyletic. The Eretmodini are firmly placed within the 'H-lineage', as sister-group to the most species-rich tribe of cichlids, the Haplochromini. The phylogenetic relationships at the base of the 'H-lineage' received less support, which is likely due to high speciation rates in the early phase of the radiation. Discordance among gene trees and marker sets further suggests the occurrence of past hybridization and/or incomplete lineage sorting in the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Rapid and invasive urbanization has been associated with depletion of natural resources (vegetation and water resources), which in turn deteriorates the landscape structure and conditions in the local environment. Rapid increase in population due to the migration from rural areas is one of the critical issues of the urban growth. Urbanisation in India is drastically changing the land cover and often resulting in the sprawl. The sprawl regions often lack basic amenities such as treated water supply, sanitation, etc. This necessitates regular monitoring and understanding of the rate of urban development in order to ensure the sustenance of natural resources. Urban sprawl is the extent of urbanization which leads to the development of urban forms with the destruction of ecology and natural landforms. The rate of change of land use and extent of urban sprawl can be efficiently visualized and modelled with the help of geo-informatics. The knowledge of urban area, especially the growth magnitude, shape geometry, and spatial pattern is essential to understand the growth and characteristics of urbanization process. Urban pattern, shape and growth can be quantified using spatial metrics. This communication quantifies the urbanisation and associated growth pattern in Delhi. Spatial data of four decades were analysed to understand land over and land use dynamics. Further the region was divided into 4 zones and into circles of 1 km incrementing radius to understand and quantify the local spatial changes. Results of the landscape metrics indicate that the urban center was highly aggregated and the outskirts and the buffer regions were in the verge of aggregating urban patches. Shannon's Entropy index clearly depicted the outgrowth of sprawl areas in different zones of Delhi. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Benthos plays a significant role as substrate, refuge from predation and food for a wide variety of fish and invertebrates of all life stages and should therefore be considered in the ecosystem approach (EA) to management. Epibenthos from trawl catches, used in annual assessments of commercial fish stocks, was identified and measured on-board. The 2011 dataset present the baseline mapping for monitoring and included 354 taxa (218 to species level) analysed with multivariate statistical methods. This revealed four main megafaunal regions: southwestern (SW), banks/slopes in southeast and west (SEW), northwestern (NW), and northeastern (NE) which were significantly related to depth, temperature, salinity, and number of ice-days. The SW region was dominated by filter-feeders (sponges) in the inflow area of warm Atlantic water while the deeper trenches had a detritivorous fauna (echinoderms). In the SEW region, predators (sea stars, anemones and snow crabs) prevailed together with filtrating species (sea cucumber and bivalves) within a mosaic of banks and slopes. Plankton-feeding brittlestars were common in the NW and NE region, but with increasing snow crab population in NE. Climate change, potentially expanding trawling activity, and increasing snow and king crab populations might all have impacts on the benthos. Benthos should therefore be a part of an integrated assessment of a changing sea, and national agencies might consider adding benthic taxonomic expertise on-board scientific research vessels to identify the invertebrate "by-catch" as part of routine trawl surveys.

AB The Arctic is experiencing rapid vegetation changes, such as shrub and tree line expansion, due to climate warming, as well as increased wetland variability due to hydrological changes associated with permafrost thawing. These changes are of global concern because changes in vegetation may increase tundra soil biogeochemical processes that would significantly enhance atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Predicting the latter will at least partly depend on knowing the structure, functional activities, and distributions of soil microbes among the vegetation types across Arctic landscapes. Here we investigated the bacterial and microeukaryotic community structures in soils from the four principal low Arctic tundra vegetation types: wet sedge, birch hummock, tall birch, and dry heath. Sequencing of rRNA gene fragments indicated that the wet sedge and tall birch communities differed significantly from each other and from those associated with the other two dominant vegetation types. Distinct microbial communities were associated with soil pH, ammonium concentration, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, and moisture content. In soils with similar moisture contents and pHs (excluding wet sedge), bacterial, fungal, and total eukaryotic communities were correlated with the ammonium concentration, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content, and C/N ratio. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, Faith's phylogenetic diversity, and the Shannon species-level index (H') were generally lower in the tall birch soil than in soil from the other vegetation types, with pH being strongly correlated with bacterial richness and Faith's phylogenetic diversity. Together, these results suggest that Arctic soil feedback responses to climate change will be vegetation specific not just because of distinctive substrates and environmental characteristics but also, potentially, because of inherent differences in microbial community structure.

AB The use of neonicotinoids as an insecticide group in Ghana has been quite significant particularly in cocoa production. The high usage has been mainly as a result of a government policy of free insecticide spraying on cocoa farms, in an effort to curb declining yields caused by pests and diseases and to prevent the use of unapproved or banned insecticides on cocoa farms. However the scale of cocoa farming, the frequency and intensity of usage coupled with the mode of application may result in large physical volumes of insecticides in the environment. This makes the knowledge of the concentration and fate of neonicotinoids in the environment extremely important. The present study was aimed at assessing the levels of five major neonicotinoids in soils from cocoa farmlands in Ghana. Extraction and cleanup of analytes were performed by use of a method based on the original QuEChERS procedure after optimizing salts, sorbents and instrumental conditions. Analyte extraction with NaCl and MgSO4 in acidified acetonitrile followed by cleanup with primary secondary amine (PSA) presented the optimum conditions for extraction. Quantification was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI). Validation of the procedure showed average recoveries ranging from 72.0 to 104.8% for all analytes at all fortification levels with relative standard deviation (RSD) <= 15.0. Limits of quantitation were < 10 mu g kg(-1) for all neonicotinoids studied. The results obtained from the analysis of 52 samples from cocoa farms revealed imidacloprid as the predominant neonicotinoid with concentrations ranging from 43 to 251.4 mu g kg(-1) in > 50% of samples analyzed.

AB In the last decades, there has been a considerable increase in literature concerning ecological studies employing bait traps to capture butterflies. The growing interest in this kind of studies has given rise to a demanding group of young students and researchers looking for information and standardized protocols. Due to such growing interest in bait trap studies, this review aims to discuss (i) the basic aspects of the main technique of collection and sampling methods, and (ii) alternative solutions of different bait trap surveys in the Neotropics. Common mistakes that could undermine the quality and comparability of obtained data are also discussed.

AB Altitudinal gradients offer a good opportunity to study organisms' adaptations to clinal environmental variables. Regarding altitude, the most influential variables on organisms are temperature and ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation, the first decreasing and the second increasing with altitude. Both variables affect ectotherms' biology, as ectotherms depend on environmental temperature for thermoregulation, frequently being heliotherms. Here, we studied dorsal coloration in the lizard Psammodromus algirus (Linnaeus, 1758) along a wide altitudinal gradient (2200 m) in Sierra Nevada (south-east Spain). We hypothesize that the skin will be darker with altitude, i.e. in environments with lower temperatures and higher UV radiation intensity. Results show that individual dorsal colorations became darker at high altitude. We propose two non-mutually exclusive explanations for this result: (1) darker dorsal surface would favour faster warming at high altitudes, where temperature is lower, and (2) darker dorsal surface would protect against UV radiation, stronger at high altitudes. We found significant relationships between both temperature and UV radiation and population dorsal darkness, giving mixed support for the two explanations. Moreover, dorsal hue was positively correlated with substrate hue, suggesting that hue evolved to maximize crypsis. Our study therefore suggests that geographical variation in dorsal coloration in this lizard is adaptive, and darkness coloration might have evolved in response to adverse conditions (low temperature and high UV radiation) at high altitudes.

AB Citizen science is promoted as a simple and cost-effective alternative to traditional approaches for the monitoring of populations of marine megafauna. However, the reliability of datasets collected by these initiatives often remains poorly quantified. We compared datasets of shark counts collected by professional dive guides with acoustic telemetry data from tagged sharks collected at the same coral reef sites over a period of five years. There was a strong correlation between the number of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) observed by dive guides and the telemetry data at both daily and monthly intervals, suggesting that variation in relative abundance of sharks was detectable in datasets collected by dive guides in a similar manner to data derived from telemetry at these time scales. There was no correlation between the number or mean depth of sharks recorded by telemetry and the presence of tourist divers, suggesting that the behaviour of sharks was not affected by the presence of divers during our study. Data recorded by dive guides showed that current strength and temperature were important drivers of the relative abundance of sharks at monitored sites. Our study validates the use of datasets of shark abundance collected by professional dive guides in frequently-visited dive sites in Palau, and supports the participation of experienced recreational divers as contributors to long-term monitoring programs of shark populations.

AB Plant communities on Mount Segrila on the Tibetan Plateau show distinct changes at different altitudes, but little information is available on belowground communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Root samples of two co-occurring species, Pennisetum centrasiaticum and Kobresia sp., growing in open grasslands at eight altitudes (3,446-4,556 m) were analyzed for diversity of AMF by PCR, cloning, and sequencing. Dominant plants were well colonized by AMF even at higher altitudes where spore density in rhizospheres decreased dramatically. A total of 29 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of AMF were detected, and some novel sequence types were found. Acaulosporaceae and Glomeraceae were the dominant families. There was no significant difference in OTU richness along elevational gradients in Kobresia sp., but OTU richness in P. centrasiaticum was higher at intermediate elevations. Elevation, host plant species, and soil variables (pH, soil organic matter, and available P and N) were found to have significant effects on the overall AMF community across all elevations. Fungal community composition differed significantly between the two plant species at each elevation, and the similarity was generally higher at the intermediate elevations. No significant difference in compositional similarity was observed for Kobresia sp. with increasing elevation, but the dissimilarity increased significantly for P. centrasiaticum. These results suggest that host identity is an important determinant for the structure of the AMF communities along the elevational gradients in high altitude environments.

AB The measurement of cortisol in hair is becoming important in studying the role of stress in the life history, health and ecology of wild mammals. The hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is generally believed to be a reliable indicator of long-term stress that can reflect frequent or prolonged activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis over weeks to months through passive diffusion from the blood supply to the follicular cells that produce the hair. Diffusion of cortisol from tissues surrounding the follicle and glandular secretions (sebum and sweat) that coat the growing hair may also affect the HCC, but the extent of these effects is thought to be minimal. In this study, we report on a range of factors that are associated with, and possibly influence, cortisol concentrations in the hair of free-ranging brown bears (Ursus arctos). Through two levels of analyses that differed in sample sizes and availability of predictor variables, we identified the presence or absence of capture, restraint and handling, as well as different methods of capture, as significant factors that appeared to influence HCC in a time frame that was too short (minutes to hours) to be explained by passive diffusion from the blood supply alone. Furthermore, our results suggest that HCC was altered after hair growth had ceased and blood supply to the hair follicle was terminated. However, we also confirmed that HCC was inversely associated with brown bear body condition and was, therefore, responsive to diminished food availability/ quality and possibly other long-term stressors that affect body condition. Collectively, our findings emphasize the importance of further elucidating the mechanisms of cortisol accumulation in hair and the influence of long-and short-term stressors on these mechanisms.

AB One of the most dramatic ways humans can affect soil properties is through the performance of military activities. Warfare-induced disturbances to soil are basically of three types - physical, chemical, and biological - and are aimed at causing direct problems to enemies or, more often, are indirect, undesired ramifications. Physical disturbances to soil include sealing due to building of defensive infrastructures, excavation of trenches or tunnels, compaction by traffic of machinery and troops, or cratering by bombs. Chemical disturbances consist of the input of pollutants such as oil, heavy metals, nitroaromatic explosives, organophosphorus nerve agents, dioxins from herbicides, or radioactive elements. Biological disturbances occur as unintentional consequences of the impact on the physical and chemical properties of soil or the deliberate introduction of microorganisms lethal to higher animals and humans such as botulin or anthrax. Soil represents a secure niche where such pathogens can perpetuate their virulence for decades.
   Soil morphology, composition, and biology can be profoundly modified by warfare activities in either wartime or peacetime (e.g. at test-firing facilities), and complete recovery of some characteristics can require years or even centuries. A few soil functions can be definitively compromised, if appropriate reclaiming techniques are not carried out. Such techniques often are extremely expensive, as in the case of contamination by dioxins or radionuclides, and remediation can even impel the complete removal of the polluted soil and its substitution with soil material from elsewhere. Taking into account how much of the pedosphere is currently and was in the past involved in warfare, warfare is actually a major means by which humans play a recognized role as a soil forming factor, as well as the parent material, topography, time, climate, and organisms not endowed with the power of reason. The variegated impact of warfare on the soil environment is reviewed here. 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Invasions have increased the size of regional species pools, but are typically assumed to reduce native diversity. However, global-scale tests of this assumption have been elusive because of the focus on exotic species richness, rather than relative abundance. This is problematic because low invader richness can indicate invasion resistance by the native community or, alternatively, dominance by a single exotic species. Here, we used a globally replicated study to quantify relationships between exotic richness and abundance in grass-dominated ecosystems in 13 countries on six continents, ranging from salt marshes to alpine tundra. We tested effects of human land use, native community diversity, herbivore pressure, and nutrient limitation on exotic plant dominance. Despite its widespread use, exotic richness was a poor proxy for exotic dominance at low exotic richness, because sites that contained few exotic species ranged from relatively pristine (low exotic richness and cover) to almost completely exotic-dominated ones (low exotic richness but high exotic cover). Both exotic cover and richness were predicted by native plant diversity (native grass richness) and land use (distance to cultivation). Although climate was important for predicting both exotic cover and richness, climatic factors predicting cover (precipitation variability) differed from those predicting richness (maximum temperature and mean temperature in the wettest quarter). Herbivory and nutrient limitation did not predict exotic richness or cover. Exotic dominance was greatest in areas with low native grass richness at the site- or regional-scale. Although this could reflect native grass displacement, a lack of biotic resistance is a more likely explanation, given that grasses comprise the most aggressive invaders. These findings underscore the need to move beyond richness as a surrogate for the extent of invasion, because this metric confounds monodominance with invasion resistance. Monitoring species' relative abundance will more rapidly advance our understanding of invasions.

AB AimUnderstanding the relationships between species turnover, environmental features and the geographic distance between sites can provide important insights into the processes driving species diversity. This is particularly relevant where the effective distance between sites may be a function of the habitat or topographic features of the landscape and the means of dispersal of the organism. River networks, in particular in human-modified landscapes, are a striking example of such a situation. Here, we use data for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms across an urban river network to examine patterns of species turnover and to determine whether these patterns differ between different taxonomic groups.
   LocationSheffield area, UK.
   MethodsAquatic (macroinvertebrates, diatoms) and terrestrial (birds, plants, butterflies) organisms were surveyed at 41 sites across an urban river network. We assessed the relationship between turnover and three alternative geographic distance measures (Euclidean, network and flow distance), whilst also taking into account the environmental distance between sites, using Mantel and partial Mantel tests.
   ResultsTurnover of all taxonomic groups apart from butterflies was significantly correlated with at least one measure of geographic distance. The aquatic taxonomic groups showed the strongest correlations with the geographic distance measures, and in particular with network distance. Terrestrial taxa were more closely associated with environmental than any of the geographic distance measures, although network distance remained significant for birds and some plant groups after removing the effect of environmental distance. Water-dispersed and neophyte plant groups were significantly related to network and flow distance.
   Main conclusionsThe results suggest that aquatic communities are strongly influenced by spatial processes occurring within the river network. Terrestrial taxa have a more complex relationship with distance, with different components of these communities displaying different responses. Nevertheless, it is clear that connectivity along the river corridor is important for both aquatic and terrestrial communities.

AB AimIn order to investigate the relative importance of ecological (habitat specialization) and biogeographical (speciation, geographical dispersal limitation) processes as causes of non-random spatial distribution of tree species in the mountain forests of Malesia, we analysed the elevational change in the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of tree assemblages in different biogeographical subregions.
   LocationMalesia (Borneo, Java, Sulawesi and the Philippines).
   MethodsTree inventory data of 12 old-growth forests from a wide elevational range (650-3080m a.s.l.) were taxonomically harmonized and standardized (50 random draws of 245 individuals each per plot), and the phylogeny of 204 genera was resolved and scaled to its evolutionary origin. The taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities were calculated using effective generic measures, and the diversity patterns analysed by regression, ordination and classification.
   ResultsThe primary factor determining the diversity patterns of the tree assemblages was elevation, whereas the influence of region was surprisingly low. This results in common elevational patterns in taxonomic and phylogenetic community structure across western and central Malesia. The major clades of the contemporary mountain forest trees must therefore have evolved before the formation of the Malay Archipelago in its present form (sympatric speciation). Taxonomic richness and phylogenetic diversity exhibited opposite trends with elevation. Generic richness decreased linearly with elevation; the phylogenetic structure of high-elevation forests revealed overdispersion, indicating convergent trait evolution towards higher elevations, whereas the submontane and colline assemblages showed clustering with a considerable number of confamilials. The upper montane forests of Borneo and Sulawesi were characterized by the dominance of Southern Hemisphere conifers, which differentiated them from lower-elevation communities.
   Main conclusionsOur results indicate that ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical processes (environmental filtering, sympatry and long-distance dispersal) have shaped the contemporary community structure of Malesian mountain forests. Wallace's Line may represent a significant barrier between the lowland tree floras of Borneo and Sulawesi, but this is not true for those at higher elevations. The uniqueness of high-elevation forests in terms of their high phylogenetic diversity and of their unusual structure calls for a high priority in conservation programmes.

AB Optimal migration theory suggests specific scaling relationships between body size and migration speed for individual birds based on the minimization of time, energy, and risk. Here we test if the quantitative predictions originating from this theory can be detected when migration decisions are integrated across individuals. We estimated population-level migration trajectories and daily migration speeds for the combined period 2007-2011 using the eBird data set. We considered 102 North American bird species that use flapping or powered flight during migration. Many species, especially in eastern North America, had looped migration trajectories that traced a clockwise path with an eastward shift during autumn migration. Population-level migration speeds decelerated rapidly going into the breeding season, and accelerated more slowly during the transition to autumn migration. In accordance with time minimization predictions, spring migration speeds were faster than autumn migration speeds. In agreement with optimality predictions, migration speeds of powered flyers scaled negatively with body mass similarly during spring and autumn migration. Powered fliers with longer migration journeys also had faster migration speeds, a relationship that was more pronounced during spring migration. Our findings indicate that powered fliers employed a migration strategy that, when examined at the population level, was in compliance with optimality predictions. These results suggest that the integration of migration decisions across individuals does result in population-level patterns that agree with theoretical expectations developed at the individual level, indicating a role for optimal migration theory in describing the mechanisms underlying broadscale patterns of avian migration for species that use powered flight.

AB Our guiding presupposition in this study was that socioscientific issues (SSI) instruction, given the humanistic features that comprise this type of instruction, could play a role as a vehicle for cultivating character and values as global citizens. Our main objective was to observe how and to what extent SSI instruction might contribute to this. In order to achieve this aim, we implemented a SSI program on genetic modification technology for 132 ninth-grade students over 3-4 weeks and identified its educational effects using a mixed method approach. Data sources included student responses to questionnaire items that measure the students' character and values, records of student discussions, and semi-structured interviews with the students and their teachers. Results indicated that the students became more sensitive to moral and ethical aspects of scientific and technological development and compassionate to diverse people who are either alienated by the benefits of advanced technology or who are vulnerable to the dangers of its unintended effects. In addition, the students felt more responsible for the future resolution of the genetic SSI. However, the students struggled to demonstrate willingness and efficacy to participate within broader communities that entailed action toward SSI resolution.

AB Predicted changes in soil water availability regimes with climate and land-use change will impact the community of functionally important soil organisms, such as macro-detritivores. Identifying and quantifying the functional traits that underlie interspecific differences in desiccation resistance will enhance our ability to predict both macro-detritivore community responses to changing water regimes and the consequences of the associated species shifts for organic matter turnover. Using path analysis, we tested (1) how interspecific differences in desiccation resistance among 22 northwestern European terrestrial isopod species could be explained by three underlying traits measured under standard laboratory conditions, namely, body ventral surface area, water loss rate and fatal water loss; (2) whether these relationships were robust to contrasting experimental conditions and to the phylogenetic relatedness effects being excluded; (3) whether desiccation resistance and hypothesized underlying traits could explain species distribution patterns in relation to site water availability. Water loss rate and (secondarily) fatal water loss together explained 90 % of the interspecific variation in desiccation resistance. Our path model indicated that body surface area affects desiccation resistance only indirectly via changes in water loss rate. Our results also show that soil moisture determines isopod species distributions by filtering them according to traits underpinning desiccation resistance. These findings reveal that it is possible to use functional traits measured under standard conditions to predict soil biota responses to water availability in the field over broad spatial scales. Taken together, our results demonstrate an increasing need to generate mechanistic models to predict the effect of global changes on functionally important organisms.

AB The relative use of new photosynthate compared to stored carbon (C) for the production and maintenance of fine roots, and the rate of C turnover in heterogeneous fine-root populations, are poorly understood. We followed the relaxation of a 13C tracer in fine roots in a Liquidambar styraciflua plantation at the conclusion of a free-air CO2 enrichment experiment. Goals included quantifying the relative fractions of new photosynthate vs stored C used in root growth and root respiration, as well as the turnover rate of fine-root C fixed during [CO2] fumigation. New fine-root growth was largely from recent photosynthate, while nearly one-quarter of respired C was from a storage pool. Changes in the isotopic composition of the fine-root population over two full growing seasons indicated heterogeneous C pools; <10% of root C had a residence time <3months, while a majority of root C had a residence time >2yr. Compared to a one-pool model, a two-pool model for C turnover in fine roots (with 5 and 0.37yr-1 turnover times) doubles the fine-root contribution to forest NPP (9-13%) and supports the 50% root-to-soil transfer rate often used in models.

AB Geographical parthenogenesis describes the enigmatic phenomenon that asexual organisms have larger distribution areas than their sexual relatives, especially in previously glaciated areas. Classical models suggest temporary advantages to asexuality in colonization scenarios because of uniparental reproduction and clonality. We analyzed population genetic structure and self-fertility of the plant species Ranunculus kuepferi on 59 populations from the whole distribution area (European Alps, Apennines and Corsica). Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and five microsatellite loci revealed individual genotypes for all populations and mostly insignificant differences between diploid sexuals and tetraploid apomicts in all measures of genetic diversity. Low frequencies of private AFLP fragments/simple sequence repeat alleles, and character incompatibility analyses suggest that facultative recombination explains best the unexpectedly high genotypic diversity of apomicts. STRUCTURE analyses using AFLPs revealed a higher number of partitions and a stronger geographical subdivision for diploids than for tetraploids, which contradicts expectations of standard gene flow models, but indicates a reduction of genetic structure in asexuals. Apomictic populations exhibited high admixture near the sexual area, but appeared rather uniform in remote areas. Bagging experiments and analyses of pollen tube growth confirmed self-fertility for pollen-dependent apomicts, but self-sterility for diploid sexuals. Facultative apomixis combines advantages of both modes of reproduction: uniparental reproduction allows for rapid colonization of remote areas, whereas facultative sexuality and polyploidy maintains genetic diversity within apomictic populations. The density dependence of outcrossing limits range expansions of sexual populations.

AB Background: Adaptive radiation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is dramatic, highly replicated, and predictable.
   Goals: Test hypotheses that divergent phenotypes of freshwater threespine stickleback evolve at the same rate as in other species and that derived freshwater and ancestral oceanic (i.e. marine or anadromous) phenotypes are genetically additive. Update a model for contemporary evolution and adaptive radiation based on new genetic and genomic findings.
   Methods: Summarize published information on contemporary evolution of threespine stickleback and compare published stickleback rates of evolution to those of other species. Analyse F1 hybrid and pure crosses to estimate the coefficient of genetic dominance of phenotypes that differ between oceanic and freshwater populations. Review published information on the genetics and genomics of stickleback phenotypes.
   Results: Threespine stickleback populations that experience large environmental changes may evolve measurably for multiple traits within ten generations. Rare freshwater-adapted alleles have been recycled from freshwater to oceanic populations by introgression and increase to high frequencies when oceanic stickleback colonize fresh water. These freshwater-adapted alleles tend to be partially recessive, to produce adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and to be linked within several genomic regions, which facilitates their retention in oceanic populations and the evolutionary response to directional selection after invasion of fresh water.
   Conclusion: The metapopulation structure and great age of the threespine stickleback have produced a genomic architecture and abundant allelic variation that are conducive to predictable contemporary adaptive radiation involving numerous genes and phenotypic traits.

AB Hamilton and Zuk proposed that females choose mates based on ornaments whose expression is dependent on their genetically based resistance to parasites. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays an important role in pathogen recognition and is a good candidate for testing the relationships between immune genes and both ornament expression and parasite resistance. We tested the hypothesis that female common yellowthroats prefer to mate with more ornamented males, because it is a signal of their MHC-based resistance to parasites and likelihood of survival. In this species, females prefer males that have larger black facial masks as extrapair mates. Using pyrosequencing, we found that mask size was positively related to the number of different MHC class II alleles, as predicted if greater variation at the MHC allows for the recognition of a greater variety of pathogens. Furthermore, males with more MHC class II alleles had greater apparent survival, and resistance to malaria infection was associated with the presence of a particular MHC class II allele. Thus, extrapair mating may provide female warblers with immunity genes that are related to parasite resistance, survival, and the expression of a male ornament, consistent with good genes models of sexual selection.

AB A hybrid zone is a region where interbreeding occurs between two or more genetically distinct populations. Recent studies have shown that mammalian hybrid zones occur in nature more frequently than previously thought. I summarize the history of research on mammalian hybrid zones, highlighting contributions that demonstrate genetic, behavioural and environmental mechanisms responsible for spatial distribution of genotypes, maintenance or elimination of reproductive barriers and evolutionary outcomes of hybridization. The role of hybridization in mammalian evolution, adaptation and diversification is demonstrated by the existence of hybrid swarms (e.g. caribou) and species genesis via homoploid hybridization (e.g. primates, bats). Mammalian hybrid zones are ideal settings in which to investigate genetic mechanisms that influence mate preferences as well as other questions regarding sexual selection. Many evolutionary processes and mechanisms associated with sexual selection have been well demonstrated in primate, rodent and seal hybrid zones by combining behavioural and genetic, and environmental techniques. Investigations of interbreeding chromosomal races of mouse Mus musculus and shrew Sorex araneus provide insight into the role of chromosome rearrangements in the speciation process. The genomes of some mammals that hybridize in nature are fully sequenced, and rapid progress is being made towards understanding genetic underpinnings of phenotypes governing reproductive isolation. Future studies of mammalian hybrid zones will incorporate genomic techniques with increasing frequency and taxonomic representation. Such techniques may include examination of gene expression patterns using microarrays or large-scale analysis of introgression using markers from multiple genetic systems (e.g. mitochondria, sex chromosomes). As methods improve, researchers will be better positioned to advise managers and policy makers about the potential outcomes of hybridization. This may be increasingly important as previously isolated forms come into contact as a result of global climate change.

AB Drought impacts on forests, including widespread die-off, are likely to increase with future climate change, although the physiological responses of trees to lethal drought are poorly understood. In particular, in situ examinations of carbon starvation and its interactions with and effects on infestation and hydraulic vulnerability are largely lacking. In this study, we conducted a controlled, in situ, repeated defoliation experiment to induce carbon stress in isolated trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) ramets. We monitored leaf morphology, leaves per branch, and multitissue carbohydrate concentrations during canopy defoliation. We examined the subsequent effects of defoliation and defoliation-induced carbon stress on vulnerability to insect/fungus infestation and hydraulic vulnerability the following year. Defoliated ramets flushed multiple canopies, which coincided with moderate drawdown of nonstructural carbohydrate reserves. Infestation frequency greatly increased and hydraulic conductivity decreased 1 year after defoliation. Despite incomplete carbohydrate drawdown from defoliation and relatively rapid carbohydrate recovery, suggesting considerable carbohydrate reserves in aspen, defoliation-induced carbon stress held significant consequences for vulnerability to mortality agents and hydraulic performance. Our results indicate that multiyear consequences of drought via feedbacks are likely important for understanding forests' responses to drought and climate change over the coming decades.

AB Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the families Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae have a mutualistic-symbiotic association with enteric gamma-Proteobacteria (Steinernema-Xenorhabdus and Heterorhabditis-Photorhabdus), which confer high virulence against insects. EPNs have been studied intensively because of their role as a natural mortality factor for soil-dwelling arthropods and their potential as biological control agents for belowground insect pests. For many decades, research on EPNs focused on the taxonomy, phylogeny, biogeography, genetics, physiology, biochemistry and ecology, as well as commercial production and application technologies. More recently, EPNs and their bacterial symbionts are being viewed as a model system for advancing research in other disciplines such as soil ecology, symbiosis and evolutionary biology. Integration of existing information, particularly the accumulating information on their biology, into increasingly detailed population models is critical to improving our ability to exploit and manage EPNs as a biological control agent and to understand ecological processes in a changing world. Here, we summarize some recent advances in phylogeny, systematics, biogeography, community ecology and population dynamics models of EPNs, and describe how this research is advancing frontiers in ecology.

AB Here we report a novel clade of secondary endosymbionts associated with insects and other arthropods. Seed bugs of the genus Nysius (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) harbor the primary gammaproteobacterial symbiont Schneideria nysicola within a pair of bacteriomes in the abdomen. Our survey of Nysius species for their facultative bacterial associates consistently yielded a novel type of alphaproteobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence in addition to those of Wolbachia. Diagnostic PCR survey of 343 individuals representing 24 populations of four Nysius species revealed overall detection rates of the alphaproteobacteria at 77.6% in Nysius plebeius, 87.7% in Nysius sp. 1, 81.0% in Nysius sp. 2, and 100% in Nysius expressus. Further survey of diverse stinkbugs representing 24 families, 191 species, and 582 individuals detected the alphaproteobacteria from an additional 12 species representing six families. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the alphaproteobacteria from the stinkbugs form a distinct and coherent monophyletic group in the order Rickettsiales together with several uncharacterized endosymbionts from fleas and ticks. The alphaproteobacterial symbiont clade was allied to bacterial clades such as the endosymbionts of acanthamoebae, the endosymbionts of cnidarians, and Midichloria spp., the mitochondrion-associated endosymbionts of ticks. In situ hybridization and electron microscopy identified small filamentous bacterial cells in various tissues of N. plebeius, including the bacteriome and ovary. The concentrated localization of the symbiont cells at the anterior pole of oocytes indicated its vertical transmission route through host insect generations. The designation "Candidatus Lariskella arthropodarum" is proposed for the endosymbiont clade.

AB Elphidium macellum is a benthic foraminifer commonly found in the Patagonian fjords. To test whether its highly variable morphotypes are ecophenotypes or different genotypes, we analysed 70 sequences of the SSU rRNA gene from 25 specimens. Unexpectedly, we identified 11 distinct ribotypes, with up to 5 ribotypes co-occurring within the same specimen. The ribotypes differ by varying blocks of sequence located at the end of stem-loop motifs in the three expansion segments specific to foraminifera. These changes, distinct from typical SNPs and indels, directly affect the structure of the expansion segments. Their mosaic distribution suggests that ribotypes originated by recombination of two or more clusters of ribosomal genes. We propose that this expansion segment polymorphism (ESP) could originate from hybridization of morphologically different populations of Patagonian Elphidium. We speculate that the complex geological history of Patagonia enhanced divergence of coastal foraminiferal species and contributed to increasing genetic and morphological variation.

AB Empirical evidence has shown that stressful conditions experienced during development may exert long-term negative effects on life-history traits. Although it has been suggested that oxidative stress has long-term effects, little is known about delayed consequences of oxidative stress experienced early in life in fitness-related traits. Here, we tested whether oxidative stress during development has long-term effects on a life-history trait directly related to fitness in three colonies of European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis. Our results revealed that recruitment probability decreased with oxidative damage during the nestling period; oxidative damage, in turn, was related to the level of antioxidant capacity. Our results suggest a link between oxidative stress during development and survival to adulthood, a key element of population dynamics.

AB A key aspect for understanding species distributions is how they respond to habitat factors at different spatial scales. In this study we used a dataset mapping 33,000 large/hollow oaks, habitat for a guild of saproxylic beetles specialised on oaks at an extent of 10,000 km(2). A total of 16 oak-dependent saproxylic species, out of 35, showed a clear relationship with substrate density at scales ranging from 52 m to >= 5200 m. The characteristic scale of response for species richness of oak specialist species was 2284 m. At this scale, there was a tendency for richness to plateau at about 0.15 oaks ha(-1), in which case about 250 hollow or large (circumference 310 cm) oaks would be needed in an area of 1600 ha to ensure a rich saproxylic oak fauna.
   The main general conclusions were: (i) a multi-scale approach is especially valuable to identify the characteristic scale of response; and that assuming a joint, single scale for all species may result in very poor decision support. (ii) The variation in species' responses to substrate density at different scales means that habitat loss and fragmentation as well as management and restoration may have very different effects upon different species. (iii) Some species respond both to local and landscape scales, indicating that species occurrences in fragmented oak landscapes are affected both by short-term dynamics of the beetles and long term dynamics of the oak substrate. (iv) Maps, useful as decision support, can be constructed based on resource availability (in our case oak density) and characteristic scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Managing complex landscape mosaics in areas dominated by poverty often requires addressing conflicting objectives and managing trade-offs, such as that between maintaining/enhancing ecological functions and improving livelihoods. Laos, like many other developing countries dependent on agriculture and natural resources for the subsistence of a mostly rural population, has used land use planning (LUP) as a core policy instrument to achieve sustainable development. However, previous reviews of LUP implementation showed large discrepancies between policies and practices and between the intended goals and actual outcomes. There is a need for increased participation, improved integration of scales, harmonization of superimposed plans, and enhanced coordination between implementing agencies and other stakeholders. Consequently, former normative approaches to LUP have been gradually replaced (at least on paper) by a new paradigm. Participatory land use planning (PLUP) has recently become a central element of donor-supported programs in developing countries. However, despite the good intentions of PLUP principles, implementation remains entangled with confused practical issues that compromise effective participation. As an alternative to complex, technologically sophisticated LUP models that local stakeholders cannot use or replicate, a communication platform supporting negotiations among multiple stakeholder groups was tested in a village cluster in Luang Prabang Province in northern Laos. This innovative approach, based on a combination of role-playing games, participatory 3D modeling, GIS, and socioeconomic and environmental impact assessment, allows stakeholders to collectively explore the consequences of land use decisions and choose between alternative future landscapes.

AB One of the most general patterns in sexual selection is stronger selection on mating activity in males than in females. This asymmetry is thought to result from the higher energetic cost of producing one female compared to one male gamete (anisogamy). However, most studies focused on gonochoric species with strong sexual dimorphism, in which males and females are necessarily under different selection regimes. The question remains whether anisogamy alone would suffice to produce such differences. In simultaneous hermaphrodites one can compare sexual selection on the male and female functions in the absence of sexual dimorphism. Here we quantify sexual selection in the hermaphroditic freshwater snail Physa acuta under laboratory conditions. We combine exhaustive behavioral records of mating activity in mating groups and molecular paternity assignment to measure the mating success and reproductive success of 120 individuals. Our results validate the prediction of stronger selection to gain mating partners in the male than in the female function. Moreover, we did not detect cross-sex effects on fitness, or correlations between male and female production of offspring over the course of our experiment. We conclude that with respect to sexual selection P. acuta is comparable to gonochorists, confirming that anisogamy is a sufficient explanation for the differences in sexual selection regimes between sexes.

AB Few studies have described the genetic diversity within and between populations of polyploid plant species despite the general acceptance of the importance of polyploidy in plant diversification and speciation. The genus Atriplex has a complex evolutionary history in Australia that has included polyploidy and hybridization among perennial forms. The octoploid, dioecious species Atriplex nummularia is proposed to have evolved from an octoploid ancestor in the coastal semi-arid fringe of south-western Australia, and to have spread east and diversified into taxa which occupy edaphically different habitats. Despite interest in the diversification of the genus, and the ecological and economic importance of A. nummularia, there are no descriptions of the genetic structure of the species. Nuclear microsatellite markers and principal coordinate analysis, analysis of molecular variance, Bayesian and phenetic analyses were used to investigate the diversity and taxonomic relationships of two common subspecies of A. nummularia. Genetic diversity was high overall (A = 509, A' = 42.4, Ho = 0.824, H' = 2.8), but values were significantly lower in the western subspecies, A. nummularia ssp. spathulata. As in other outbreeding, perennial species, most of the genetic diversity was within populations (FST = 0.125). Clear divergence of subspecies was evident in principal coordinate analysis, neighbor-joining and Bayesian clustering analyses and the differentiation of populations was very low within subspecies (FSC = 0.048). These findings support the taxonomic separation of the two subspecies. Clustering patterns based on Bayesian analyses suggested that the polyploid subspecies of A. nummularia have multiple origins.

AB 1. Abundance indices generated by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) have been influential in informing our understanding of environmental change and highlighting UK conservation priorities. Here, we critically evaluate the standard Pollard Walk methodology employed by the UKBMS.
   2. We consider the systematic sampling biases among different butterfly species and biotopes using distance sampling. We collected over 5000 observations on 17 species using distance sampling at 13 study sites in England and Wales. We fitted detection functions to explore variation in detectability among species and sites.
   3. Our results suggest that around one-third of individual butterflies in the Pollard Walk box were missed. However, detectability varies markedly among species and sites. We provide the first species-specific estimates of detectability for converting Pollard Walk data into population densities. A few species show no drop off in detectability and most require only a modest correction factor, but for the least detectable species, we estimate that 3/4 of individuals are not recorded.
   4. Much of the variation among sites is explained by substantially higher detectability among sites in England than inWales, which had different recorders. Biological traits have only limited explanatory power in distinguishing detectable vs undetectable species.
   5. The variation in detectability is small compared with the variation in true abundance, such that population density estimates from the Pollard Walk are highly correlated with those derived from distance sampling.
   6. These results are used to evaluate the robustness of the Pollard Walk for comparisons of abundance across species, across sites and over time. UKBMS data provide a good reflection of relative abundance for most species and of large-scale trends in abundance. We also consider the practicalities of applying distance sampling to butterfly monitoring in general. Distance sampling is a valuable tool for quantifying bias and imprecision and has a role in surveying species of conservation concern, but is not viable as a wholesale replacement for simpler methods for large-scale monitoring of multispecies butterfly communities by volunteer recorders.

AB In this study we examined the importance of seasonal changes in habitat features and aquatic macroinvertebrate responses in temporary and perennial streams from two different catchments in the Western Mediterranean region in Spain. Macroinvertebrate sampling was spatially intensive to account for the relative frequency of meso- (i.e., riffles and pools) and micro-habitats (i.e., different mineral and organic-based substrata) at each site. Samples were collected at two distinctly different phases of the hydrograph: (1) during the flowing period, when pool-riffle sequences were well-established, and (2) during the dry phase, when only isolated pools were expected to occur in the temporary streams. During the dry season, both a reduction in the available total habitat and in microhabitat diversity in all sites studied was observed. As a result, taxon richness decreased in all streams, but more dramatically at temporary stream sites and particularly so in the infrequently remaining discontinuous riffles. Macroinvertebrate assemblages differed among catchments (i.e., geographical identity) and sites (perennial vs. temporary). Invertebrate differences were also strong within and among meso- and micro-habitats, particularly mineral and organic microhabitat patches, and differences were due to both loss of taxa from some habitats and some taxa exhibiting certain habitat affinities.

AB Plant litter diversity effects on decomposition rates are frequently reported, but with a strong bias towards temperate ecosystems. Altered decomposition and nutrient recycling with changing litter diversity may be particularly important in tree species-rich tropical rainforests on nutrient-poor soils. Using 28 different mixtures of leaf litter from 16 Amazonian rainforest tree species, we tested the hypothesis that litter mixture effects on decomposition increase with increasing functional litter diversity. Litter mixtures and all single litter species were exposed in the field for 9 months using custom-made microcosms with soil fauna access. In order to test the hypothesis that the long-term presence of tree species contributing to the litter mixtures increases mixture effects on decomposition, microcosms were installed in a plantation at sites including the respective tree species composition and in a nearby natural forest where these tree species are absent. We found that mixture decomposition deviated from predictions based on single species, with predominantly synergistic effects. Functional litter diversity, defined as either richness, evenness, or divergence based on a wide range of chemical traits, did not explain the observed litter mixture effects. However, synergistic effects in litter mixtures increased with the long-term presence of tree species contributing to these mixtures as the home field advantage hypothesis assumes. Our data suggest that complementarity effects on mixed litter decomposition may emerge through long-term interactions between aboveground and belowground biota.

AB Variation of vegetation coverage and canopy height may reflect the complex spatial heterogeneity of nutrient storage and supply capacity, soil moisture, and surface hydrology in the karst terrains suffering from severe land degradation. To assess the patterns of nutrient limitation under different vegetation covers in the subtropical karst ecosystems from Guizhou province, southwestern China, topsoil and leaf samples of dominant tree species were collected in forest stand (FO), shrub stand (SH) and shrub-grass stand (SG), respectively. Nutrient concentrations of both soil and leaf were determined, and ratios of N to P and vegetation nutrient reuse capacity (VNR) calculated as well as vegetation coverage, vegetation canopy height and tree density measured across the three stands. Mean leaf N/P ratio was lowest (16.1 +/- A 1.4) in FO and highest (33.5 +/- A 3.2) in SG. Vegetation nutrient reuse increased with the decline in N and P availability in soils for these three stands. VNR of N and P ranged from 8.5 to 25.2 mg N g(-1) and from 0.4 to 1.1 mg P g(-1), respectively, and appeared lowest in SG (10.4 mg N g(-1) and 0.5 P mg g(-1) on average, respectively) and highest in FO (22.4 mg N g(-1) and 0.9 mg P g(-1) on average, respectively). Although there was no substantial difference in phosphorus reuse efficiencies between plant species and vegetation stands, concentrations of N and P of senesced leaves (SLs) were, respectively, found in positive correlation with the concentrations of mature leaves. The variation of VNR with elements indicated that P is cycled within vegetation much more efficiently than N across the stands. This study demonstrated that the karst vegetations were generally at P-limited or N- and P- co-limited stresses and that N/P ratio could be an effective indictor for nutrient limitation in the karst ecosystems at vegetation community level rather than at tree species level. It is proposed that phosphorus reuse by mature leaves could be an adaptation strategy by the dominant species to the low P availability in the karst soil.

AB Tagus estuary is one of the largest estuaries of Western Europe. With the aim of unravelling the drivers of primary production in this shallow and turbid nutrient replete estuary, we tested the hypothesis that light availability is a major factor controlling phytoplankton production. Environmental parameters, phytoplankton biomass, community composition, and photosynthetic parameters were monitored at two sites in the estuary during a complete annual cycle. Despite the fact that nutrient concentrations were always above growth-limiting values, Chl a concentrations were relatively low throughout the study period. High water column turbidity, due to riverine inputs, promoted a rapid attenuation of light and created a compressed profile with optimal photosynthetic conditions. Therefore, the phytoplankton community, dominated by small cells, such as diatoms and cryptophycean flagellates, displayed highly photosynthetic efficiency and low light-saturated photosynthetic rates as a photo-acclimation response to low light conditions year-round. Primary production rate was unimodal, peaking in the summer months. In such estuarine system, gross primary production could thus be predicted by an existing robust empirical model based on pigment standing crop (Chl a), surface irradiance (E (0)) and optical depth (Z (eup)). Compared to other shallow estuaries, the Tagus can be classified as a low- to moderately productive estuary, being the turbidity-induced low light conditions the principal factor limiting phytoplankton growth.

AB We compared the Atlantic and Mediterranean beach and foredune habitats of European interest, focusing on floristic, structural and ecological features. We selected two representative sites of Atlantic (The Netherlands) and Mediterranean (Italy) coastal dunes. From a georeferenced vegetation database, samples of: (a) annual vegetation on drift lines (European Union habitat type 1210), (b) embryonic shifting dunes (2110), and (c) shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria (2120), were selected. Floristic representativity and comparability of plot sizes were considered. For each habitat, the frequency and the fidelity of the species, the life form frequency spectra and Ellenberg ecological indicator values were assessed. We found a consistent floristic differentiation between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean coastal dune habitats and only a small set of shared species. The Italian and the Dutch annual vegetation of drift lines (1210) register a high structural similarity that strongly declines landwards. Floristic composition, life forms and Ellenberg indicator values show higher similarities among different foredune habitats of the same site than between homologous habitats of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. The results confirm the current description and distribution of the habitat of European interest annual vegetation of drift lines (1210). On the other hand, the floristic, structural and ecological differences between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean embryonic shifting dunes (2110) and shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria (2120) point at an inconsistency of the existing description of those habitats of European interest and highlight the need of adding in the Directive specific types that describe them in the Mediterranean basin. We suggest the introduction of two new habitat types named "Dunes along the Mediterranean shoreline with Ammophila arenaria" (new code 2280) and "Mediterranean embryonic dunes" (new code 2290) within the existing class "Sea dunes of the Mediterranean coast" (class 22 of the Annex I Habitats Directive 92/43/CEE).

AB Fecundity is a primary component of fitness. Theory predicts that the evolution of fecundity through increased brood size results from fecundity selection favouring larger female size to accommodate more offspring and to store more energy. This is expected to generate asymmetric selection on body size between the sexes, ultimately driving evolution of female-biased sexual size dimorphism. Additionally, it has been predicted that the intensity of fecundity selection increases when the opportunities for reproduction are reduced by the limiting thermal effects of increasing latitude-elevation (i.e. decreasing environmental temperatures) on the length of the reproductive season. This later factor would be particularly strong among ectotherms, where reproduction is heavily temperature-dependent. However, this integrative perspective on reproductive evolution by fecundity selection has rarely been investigated. Here, we employ a comparative approach to investigate these predictions in Liolaemus, a prominent lizard radiation. As expected, Liolaemus reproductive output (i.e. offspring number per reproductive episode) increases predictably with increasing female size. However, contrary to predictions, we found that increased fecundity does not translate into female-biased SSD, and that combined latitude-elevation does not impose a detectable effect on fecundity. Finally, our allometric analyses reveal that SSD scales with body size, which supports the occurrence of Rensch's rule in these lizards. We discuss the evolutionary implications of our results, and the assumptions of the investigated hypotheses.

AB Studies of heritable colour polymorphisms allow investigators to track the genetic dynamics of natural populations. By comparing polymorphic populations over large geographic areas and across generations, issues about both morph stability and evolutionary dynamics can be addressed, increasing our understanding of the potential mechanisms maintaining genetic polymorphisms. In the present study, we investigated population morph frequencies in a sex-limited heritable colour polymorphic damselfly (Ischnura elegans, Vander Linden), with three discrete female morphs. We compared the frequencies of these three female morphs in 120 different populations from ten European countries at differing latitudes and longitudes. There were pronounced differences in morph frequencies both across the entire European biogeographic range, as well as at a smaller scale within regions. We also found considerable between-population variation at the local scale within regions, particularly at the edges of the range of this species. We discuss these findings in the context of recent models of adaptive population divergence along the range of a species. This polymorphism is thus highly dynamic, with stable morph frequencies at the core of the species range but fluctuating morph dynamics at the range limits. We finish with a discussion of how local interactions and climatic factors can be expected to have a strong influence on the biogeographic patterns in this species and other sexually selected polymorphisms.

AB Individual quality has been measured as a variety of different traits and in several different contexts. However, the implications of such measurements in terms of overall fitness are less straightforward than has generally been appreciated. Here we outline some key issues in this regard that have yet to be addressed. Specifically, we consider the importance of both variation in selection on individual and multivariate suites of traits, and of context-specific plasticity in allocation strategies. We argue that an explicit life-history perspective is crucial for understanding variation in quality, as both the strength and direction of selection and an individual's response to it can vary within a breeding season. Hence, 'quality' is not a static characteristic that can be measured by taking longitudinal measures of single traits across a population, but rather a dynamic, multivariate suite of traits that is dependent not only on the selective context, but also on the nature and intensity of selection operating at any given time. We highlight these points by considering recent research on selection and plasticity.

ID ECOLOGICAL DATA; BIODIVERSITY; BIOLOGY
AB We review technical and sociological issues facing the Life Sciences as they transform into more data-centric disciplines - the "Big New Biology". Three major challenges are: 1) lack of comprehensive standards; 2) lack of incentives for individual scientists to share data; 3) lack of appropriate infrastructure and support. Technological advances with standards, bandwidth, distributed computing, exemplar successes, and a strong presence in the emerging world of Linked Open Data are sufficient to conclude that technical issues will be overcome in the foreseeable future. While motivated to have a shared open infrastructure and data pool, and pressured by funding agencies in move in this direction, the sociological issues determine progress. Major sociological issues include our lack of understanding of the heterogeneous data cultures within Life Sciences, and the impediments to progress include a lack of incentives to build appropriate infrastructures into projects and institutions or to encourage scientists to make data openly available.

AB Selection imposed through sperm competition is commonly thought to promote the evolution of longer sperm, since sperm length is assumed to be positively associated with sperm swimming velocity. Yet, the basis for this assumption remains controversial, and there is surprisingly little intraspecific evidence demonstrating such a link between sperm form and function. Here, we show that sperm length and velocity are highly correlated in the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma, but importantly we report that failure to account for within-male variation in these sperm traits can obscure this relationship. These findings, in conjunction with the mounting evidence for extremely high levels of intraspecific variance in sperm traits, suggest that a functional link between sperm morphology and velocity may be more prevalent than what current evidence suggests. Our findings also suggest that selection for faster swimming sperm may promote the evolution of longer sperm, thereby supporting recent findings from macroevolutionary studies.

AB 1. Although direct contributions of soil invertebrates to carbon turnover are modest, they have a disproportionally large indirect impact through their control over the activity of microbial decomposers. Shifts in soil invertebrate species distribution might have a substantial effect on the decomposition process because their functional role depends on the species' vertical position in soils. Gradients in microclimate and substrate quality and structure largely determine the vertical position of soil invertebrates. Because of the possible impact of climate change on soil invertebrate distribution, and consequently on decomposition, it is important to know the relative contributions of microclimate and substrate quality to the vertical distribution patterns of soil invertebrates.
   2. We studied this for springtails (Collembola) as a keystone group in cool and cold biomes, by turning peat cores in a subarctic blanket bog upside down, thereby reversing the substrate quality gradient and leaving temperature and moisture gradients intact.
   3. Two opposing groups of springtail species could be distinguished with respect to their abundance responses along the vertical gradient: (i) species that remain associated with the stratum they were originally found in ('stayers') and (ii) species that re-establish the original stratification pattern, by remigration either to the top or deeper layers, irrespective of any substrate quality change ('movers'). Within the 'mover' response pattern, the direction of their migration in response to microclimate changes seemed to coincide with their ecomorphological traits.
   4. Our results not only demonstrate that springtail species differ in their responses to changes in climate or substrate quality; they also suggest that interspecific faunal trait variation may provide a useful tool to predict animal responses to climatic changes.

AB The intimate interdependence of human health and the ecosystems in which we are embedded is now a commonplace observation. For much of the history of public health, this was not so obvious. After over a century of focus on diseases, their biologic causes and the correction of exposures (clean water and air) and facilitation of responses (immunizations and nutrition), public health discourse shifted to embrace the concept of determinants of health as extending to social, economic and environmental realms. This moved the discourse and science of public health into an unprecedented level of complexity just as public concern about the environment heightened. To address multifactorial, dynamic impacts on health, a new paradigm was needed which would overcome the separation of humans and ecosystems. Ecosystem approaches to health arose in the 1990s from a rich background of intellectual ferment as Canada wrestled with diverse problems ranging from Great Lakes contamination to zoonotic diseases. Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) played a lead role in supporting an international community of scientists and scholars who advanced ecosystem approaches to health. These collective efforts have enabled a shift to a research paradigm that embraces transdisciplinarity, social justice, gender equity, multi-stakeholder participation and sustainability.

AB Predicting species distributions is increasingly important in conservation biology and, in the context of contemporary climate change, can be particularly informative for populations at the periphery of the range. Peripheral populations can exhibit unique patterns of habitat use in response to marginal conditions and can provide colonists adapted to novel or extreme environments. We conducted surveys for American pikas (Ochotona princeps) during 2007-2009 in 144 sites in Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, Idaho. This species appears vulnerable to global climate change, and Craters of the Moon is an extensive area of low-elevation lava habitat situated on an interior edge of the species' range. We found pikas to be readily detectable when both direct and indirect sign were used. An estimate of detection probability from a subset of 72 sites that were visited twice was 0.92. We detected pikas in 31% of survey sites overall but only at sites above 1,605 m. We used logistic regression to model the distribution of pikas as a function of elevation, substrate, and vegetation cover. Pikas were most likely to occur on structurally complex pahoehoe lava flows above 1,600 m. The odds of pika occurrence on pahoehoe lava was >10 times that of aa lava flows and increased by 2 times for each SD increase in elevation. Pikas were also more likely to occur on lava flow sites with higher structural complexity and forb cover. An area of pahoehoe lava encompassing >250 km(2) in the northern portion of Craters of the Moon contained 91% of pika detections and all predicted site-occurrence probabilities >0.38, an optimal cutoff value determined by examining model receiver operating characteristic curves. Craters of the Moon may provide long-term refugia for the species, given the extent of lava habitat there. However, the importance of elevation in our models suggests that accelerated climate change could erode suitable pika habitat in the park. Most research on pikas has relied on censuses or nonrandom convenience surveys, but we demonstrate an efficient probabilistic sampling approach that has broad application for pika monitoring and research.

AB In terrestrial ecosystems, the amount and availability of water is one of the key factors affecting the net primary productivity and other biological processes of the system. At the SMEAR-II station, we have monitored the water balance of two adjacent micro-catchments since 1997. In this study, we report the long-term measurements of precipitation, throughfall, snow depth, soil water content, runoff and evapotranspiration and the annual water balances based on these measurements and discuss the uncertainties related to different measurements. The proportion of throughfall, evapotranspiration and runoff was 67%, 43% and 32% of the annual precipitation, respectively. The measured amounts of evapotranspiration and runoff were so small that the aim of closing the water balance of the studied system was not fully reached. The largest uncertainties are related to the evapotranspiration measurements and the determination of the actual surface area of the catchments used in the calculation of the runoff.

AB Agri-environment schemes are the main policy instruments for reversing declines in farmland biodiversity, but there is scope for improvement. Within an intensive agricultural landscape, a mark-release-recapture experiment was used to investigate the relative effects on the number of adults of 23 moth species of two landscape features (wide field margins and hedgerow trees) that may feature within agri-environment schemes. Species belonged to either the grass/herb- or shrub/tree-feeders' guild. Margin width did not affect the number of individuals, in either guild. Numbers of shrub/tree-feeding individuals were higher at sites with hedgerow trees, but not so for this guild's two most mobile species, nor for the grass/herb-feeders, which were 30% more mobile. The results show that hedgerow trees increase adult moth numbers because they are shelter-providing resources in typically exposed agricultural landscapes, rather than due to being larval food resources. Hedgerow tree retention and establishment options should be part of efficient general agri-environment schemes, while grassy wide field margins may not always deliver gains, at least not when implemented at the field-scale.

ID GENOME; MODEL
AB The genus Ciona, a widely distributed group of solitary ascidians, has long been an important model in embryology and developmental biology. Ciona has also recently attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists because of the remarkably high levels of heterozygosity found within single individuals. Surprisingly, genealogical relationships in Ciona have received little attention. Here, we expand our knowledge of relationships among the members of the Ciona genus and estimate levels of polymorphism in natural populations.
   Previous studies have documented the outgroup status of Ciona savignyi among the shallow-water Ciona and revealed the existence of two distinct forms (Types A and B) of the widespread Ciona intestinalis. Here, using gene genealogies of six nuclear gene loci, we show Types A and B to be well-supported monophyletic groups. In spite of their morphological similarity, Type A vs. Type B divergences range from 0.035 to 0.124. In contrast, the morphologically distinct Ciona roulei is embedded within Type B in all genealogies, and a new species, Ciona sp., appears to be associated with Type B/C. roulei to the exclusion of Type A. Levels of polymorphism in natural populations are similar to levels reported in other organisms that are considered to be highly polymorphic. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Current methods of assessing climate-induced shifts of species distributions rarely account for species interactions and usually ignore potential differences in response times of interacting taxa to climate change. Here, we used species-richness data from 1005 breeding bird and 1417 woody plant species in Kenya and employed model-averaged coefficients from regression models and median climatic forecasts assembled across 15 climate-change scenarios to predict bird species richness under climate change. Forecasts assuming an instantaneous response of woody plants and birds to climate change suggested increases in future bird species richness across most of Kenya whereas forecasts assuming strongly lagged woody plant responses to climate change indicated a reversed trend, i.e. reduced bird species richness. Uncertainties in predictions of future bird species richness were geographically structured, mainly owing to uncertainties in projected precipitation changes. We conclude that assessments of future species responses to climate change are very sensitive to current uncertainties in regional climate-change projections, and to the inclusion or not of time-lagged interacting taxa. We expect even stronger effects for more specialized plant-animal associations. Given the slow response time of woody plant distributions to climate change, current estimates of future biodiversity of many animal taxa may be both biased and too optimistic.

AB Vegetation fires profoundly alter the C cycle of terrestrial ecosystems, notably through the potential formation of highly stable pyrogenic structures. Fire-induced changes in the structure of organic matter (OM) have been studied mainly under controlled laboratory conditions. The objective of this work was to characterise changes in OM chemistry occurring in the litter layer of a scrub-oak ecosystem subjected to a prescribed fire. Maximum temperatures reached during the fire were monitored with thermo-sensitive paint. Litter samples collected before and after the fire were subjected to size fractionation, each size fraction being divided on the basis of visual observation into burnt and unburnt components, i.e. black and brown, respectively. All fractions were analysed for C and N contents and stable carbon isotopic composition. Shifts in the composition of >2 mm fraction components were evaluated using solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
   The effects of charring were evaluated through comparisons of black vs. brown post-fire litter in >370 degrees C plots. Comparison of bulk pre- vs. post-fire litter proved unreliable because of the complicating effect of fresh litter fall during the fire event. Charring significantly increased the litter C content by 115-142 mg g(-1) and significantly decreased the delta C-13 value by an average of 0.8 parts per thousand. The NMR and DSC analyses indicated that O-alkyl compounds were preferentially lost vs. aryl and alkyl compounds. This suggests a preferential loss of cellulose components and a relative preservation of lignin and lipids. However, the charred litter samples had a low degree of condensation vs. a graphitic-like model. The findings suggest that leaf-derived charcoal produced during natural vegetation fires does not contribute much to the highly stable fraction of pyrogenic OM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
ID SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; GENETIC INTERACTIONS; YEAST; INTERACTOME; SIZE
AB Background: Many high-throughput genomic experiments, such as Synthetic Genetic Array and yeast two-hybrid, use colony growth on solid media as a screen metric. These experiments routinely generate over 100,000 data points, making data analysis a time consuming and painstaking process. Here we describe ScreenMill, a new software suite that automates image analysis and simplifies data review and analysis for high-throughput biological experiments.
   Results: The ScreenMill, software suite includes three software tools or "engines": an open source Colony Measurement Engine (CM Engine) to quantitate colony growth data from plate images, a web-based Data Review Engine (DR Engine) to validate and analyze quantitative screen data, and a web-based Statistics Visualization Engine (SV Engine) to visualize screen data with statistical information overlaid. The methods and software described here can be applied to any screen in which growth is measured by colony size. In addition, the DR Engine and SV Engine can be used to visualize and analyze other types of quantitative high-throughput data.
   Conclusions: ScreenMill automates quantification, analysis and visualization of high-throughput screen data. The algorithms implemented in ScreenMill are transparent allowing users to be confident about the results ScreenMill produces. Taken together, the tools of ScreenMill offer biologists a simple and flexible way of analyzing their data, without requiring programming skills.

AB Polyploidy presents a challenge to those wishing to delimit the species within a group and reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among these taxa. A clear understanding of the tree-like relationships among the diploid species can provide a framework upon which to reconstruct the reticulate events that gave rise to the polyploid lineages. In this study we apply this "diploids-first" strategy to the fern genus Astrolepis (Pteridaceae). Diploids are identified using the number of spores per sporangium and spore size. Analyses of plastid and low-copy nuclear sequence data provide well-supported estimates of phylogenetic relationships, including strong evidence for two morphologically distinctive diploid lineages not recognized in recent treatments. One of these corresponds to the type of Notholaena deltoidea, a species that has not been recognized in any modern treatment of Astrolepis. This species is resurrected here as the new combination Astrolepis deltoidea. The second novel lineage is that of a diploid initially hypothesized to exist by molecular and morphological characteristics of several established Astrolepis allopolyploids. This previously missing diploid species is described here as Astrolepis obscura.

AB Phenotypically diverse Lake Malawi cichlids exhibit similar genomes. The extensive sharing of genetic polymorphism among forms has both intrigued and frustrated biologists trying to understand the nature of diversity in this and other rapidly evolving systems. Shared polymorphism might result from hybridization and/or the retention of ancestrally polymorphic alleles. To examine these alternatives, we used new genomic tools to characterize genetic differentiation in widespread, geographically structured populations of Labeotropheus fuelleborni and Metriaclima zebra. These phenotypically distinct species share mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes and show greater mtDNA differentiation among localities than between species. However, Bayesian analysis of nuclear single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data revealed two distinct genetic clusters corresponding perfectly to morphologically diagnosed L. fuelleborni and M. zebra. This result is a function of the resolving power of the multi-locus dataset, not a conflict between nuclear and mitochondrial partitions. Locus-by-locus analysis showed that mtDNA differentiation between species (F-CT) was nearly identical to the median single-locus SNP F-CT. Finally, we asked whether there is evidence for gene flow at sites of co-occurrence. We used simulations to generate a null distribution for the level of differentiation between co-occurring populations of L. fuelleborni and M. zebra expected if there was no hybridization. The null hypothesis was rejected for the SNP data; populations that co-occur at rock reef sites were slightly more similar than expected by chance, suggesting recent gene flow. The coupling of numerous independent markers with extensive geographic sampling and simulations utilized here provides a framework for assessing the prevalence of gene flow in recently diverged species.

AB Combined action from over-harvesting and recent mass mortality events potentially linked to ongoing climate changes has led to new concerns for the conservation of shallow populations (5-60 m) of Corallium rubrum, an octocorallian that is mainly found in the Mediterranean Sea. The present study was designed to analyse population structure and relationships at different spatial scales (from 10s of meters to 100s of kilometres) with a focus on dispersal pattern. We also performed the first analysis of the distribution of genetic diversity using a comparative approach between regional-clusters and samples. Forty populations dwelling in four distinct regions between 14 and 60 m in depth were genotyped using 10 microsatellites. Our main results indicate (i) a generalized pair-sample differentiation combined with a weak structure between regional-clusters; (ii) the occurrence of isolation by distance at the global scale, but also within two of the three analysed regional-clusters; (iii) a high level of genetic diversity over the surveyed area with a heterogeneous distribution from regional-cluster to sample levels. The evolutionary consequences of these results are discussed and their management implications are provided.

AB In ecology, strategy schemes based on propositions about the selection of plant attributes are common, but quantification of such schemes in relation to nutrient and water supply is lacking. Through structural equation modeling, we tested whether plant strategies related to nutrient and water/oxygen supply are reflected in a coordination of traits in natural communities. Structural equation models, based on accepted ecological concepts, were tested with measured plant traits of 105 different species across 50 sites in mesic to wet plant communities in the Netherlands. For each site, nutrient and water supply were measured and modeled. Hypothesized multivariate strategy models only partly reflected current theoretical schemes. Alternative models were consistent, showing that lack of consistency of the original models was because of (i) strong correlations among traits that supposedly belong to different strategy components; (ii) poor understanding of mechanisms determining the covariation of plant maximum height, leaf size, and stem density; and (iii) lack of integrative and long-term measures of nutrient supply needed to predict coordinated plant trait responses. Our main conclusion is that a combination of trade-offs (partly) across different plant organs and diverging effects of resource supply ultimately determines the coordination of plant traits needed to "make a living."

AB Improved access to multibeam sonar and underwater video technology is enabling scientists to use spatially-explicit, predictive modelling to improve our understanding of marine ecosystems. With the growing number of modelling approaches available, knowledge of the relative performance of different models in the marine environment is required. Habitat suitability of 5 demersal fish taxa in Discovery Bay, south-east Australia, were modelled using 10 presence-only algorithms: BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, ENFA (distance geometric mean [GM], distance harmonic mean [HM], median [M], area-adjusted median [Ma], median + extremum [Me], area-adjusted median + extremum [Mae] and minimum distance [Min]), and MAXENT. Model performance was assessed using kappa and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic. The influence of spatial range (area of occupancy) and environmental niches (marginality and tolerance) on modelling performance were also tested. MAXENT generally performed best, followed by ENFA-GM and -HM, DOMAIN, BIOCLIM, ENFA-M, -Min, -Ma, -Mae and -Me algorithms. Fish with clearly definable niches (i.e. high marginality) were most accurately modelled. Generally, Euclidean distance to nearest reef, HSI-b (backscatter), rugosity and maximum curvature were the most important variables in determining suitable habitat for the 5 demersal fish taxa investigated. This comparative study encourages ongoing use of presence-only approaches, particularly MAXENT, in modelling suitable habitat for demersal marine fishes.

AB Questions
   How do population structure and recruitment characteristics of Betula saplings beyond the treeline vary among climatic regions, and what is the potential for development into tree-sized individuals with interacting grazing pressure?
   Location
   Scandes Mountains.
   Methods
   Sapling characteristics of Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa, their topographic position above the treeline, growth habitat and evidence of recent grazing was investigated in three areas with a long continuous grazing history, along a latitudinal gradient (62-69 degrees N).
   Results
   Saplings were common up to 100 m above the treeline in all areas. The northern areas were characterised by small (< 30 cm) and young (mean 14 years old) saplings in exposed micro-topographic locations unfavourable to long-term survival. In the southern area, broad height (2-183 cm) and age (4-95 years; mean 32 years) distributions were found in sheltered locations. Age declined with altitude in all areas. Sapling growth rate varied within and between areas, and the age x height interaction was significant only in the southern area. Growth rates decreased from south to north and indicated a considerable time required to reach tree size under prevailing conditions.
   Conclusions
   Regional differences can be attributed to climatic differences, however, interacting biotic and abiotic factors such as micro-topography, climate and herbivory, mutually affect the characteristics of birch saplings. In view of the long time needed to reach tree size, the generally expected evident and fast treeline advance in response to climate warming may not be a likely short-term scenario. The sapling pool in the southern region possesses strongest potential for treeline advance.

AB We provide a cross-taxon and historical analysis of what makes tropical forest species vulnerable to extinction. Several traits have been important for species survival in the recent and distant geological past, including seed dormancy and vegetative growth in plants, small body size in mammals, and vagility in insects. For major past catastrophes, such as the five mass extinction events, large range size and vagility or dispersal were key to species survival. Traits that make some species more vulnerable to extinction are consistent across time scales. Terrestrial organisms, particularly animals, are more extinction prone than marine organisms. Plants that persist through dramatic changes often reproduce vegetatively and possess mechanisms of die back. Synergistic interactions between current anthropogenic threats, such as logging, fire, hunting, pests and diseases, and climate change are frequent. Rising temperatures threaten all organisms, perhaps particularly tropical organisms adapted to small temperature ranges and isolated by distance from suitable future climates. Mutualist species and trophic specialists may also be more threatened because of such range-shift gaps. Phylogenetically specialized groups may be collectively more prone to extinction than generalists. Characterization of tropical forest species' vulnerability to anthropogenic change is constrained by complex interactions among threats and by both taxonomic and ecological impediments, including gross undersampling of biotas and poor understanding of the spatial patterns of taxa at all scales.

AB Parasitism is a common cause of host mortality, but little is known about the ecological factors affecting parasite virulence (the rate of mortality among infected hosts). We reviewed 117 field estimates of parasite-induced nestling mortality in birds, showing that there was significant consistency in mortality among host and parasite taxa. Virulence increased towards the tropics in analyses of both species-specific data and phylogenetic analyses. We found evidence of greater parasite prevalence being associated with reduced virulence. Furthermore, bird species breeding in open nest sites suffered from greater parasite-induced mortality than hole-nesting species. By contrast, parasite specialization and generation time of parasites relative to that of hosts explained little variation in virulence. Likewise, there were little or no significant effects of host genetic variability, host sociality, host migration, host insular distribution or host survival on parasite virulence. These findings suggest that parasite-induced nestling mortality in birds is mainly determined by geographical location and to a smaller extent nest site and prevalence.

AB Forest microclimate plays an integral role in ecosystem processes, yet a predictive understanding of its spatial and temporal variability in heterogeneous landscapes is largely lacking. In this study, we used regression kriging (RK) to analyze the degree to which physiographic versus ecological variables influence spatio-temporal variation in understory microclimate conditions. We monitored understory temperature in 200 forest plots within a 274 km(2) environmentally heterogeneous region in northern California (0.55 obs/km(2)). For each plot location, we measured four physiographic influences (elevation, coastal proximity, potential solar radiation, topographic wetness index) and three ecological drivers (forest patch size, proximity to forest edge, tree abundance). Temperature observations were aggregated to three time scales (hourly, daily, and monthly) to examine temporal variability in microclimate dynamics and its effect on spatial prediction. The obtained prediction models included both physiographic and vegetative effects, although the relative importance of individual effects varied greatly between the different models. Across time scales, elevation and coastal proximity had the most consistent physiographic effects on temperature, followed by the vegetative effects of forest patch size and distance to forest edge. RK captured significantly more landscape-scale variability in understory temperature than a regression-only approach with considerably better model performance at hourly and daily time scales than at a monthly scale. Using varied sampling density scenarios our results also suggest that predictive accuracy drops considerably at densities less than 0.34 obs/km(2). This research illustrates how geospatial and statistical modeling can be used to distinguish physiographic versus ecological effects on microclimate dynamics and elucidates the spatial and temporal scales that these processes operate.

AB Mitochondrial markers are still often used alone to identify evolutionary units, despite widespread evidence for processes such as incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization that may blur past population history. The combination of mitochondrial DNA data with other sources of information (morphology, nuclear genes) is a powerful tool to reveal when and why mitochondrial markers are potentially misleading. In this study, we evaluate the performance of mtDNA markers to unravel the evolutionary history of Spanish lizards from the Podarcis hispanicus species complex. We first uncover several cases of discordance between morphological and mitochondrial data in delimitation of taxa. To assess the origin of these discordances, we analysed the same populations using several independent nuclear loci. Both morphological and nuclear markers identified the same three evolutionary units in the region, while mitochondrial data revealed four deeply divergent lineages. We suggest here that the most likely scenario to explain this discordance is ancient mitochondrial introgression originating from a fourth evolutionary unit presently absent from the study area. Notably, this resulted in a complete replacement of the original lineage in a large part of the distribution of one of the taxa investigated. We discuss the potential evolutionary scenarios leading to this complete mitochondrial replacement and suggest why the previous studies have failed to recover the correct history of this species complex.

AB The species distribution models (SDMs) are useful tools for investigating rare and endangered species as well as the environmental variables affecting them. In this paper, we propose the application of SDMs to assess the extinction-risk of plant species in relation to the spread of greenhouses in a Mediterranean landscape, where habitat depletion is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. For this purpose, presence records of the model species (Linaria nigricans, a endemic and threatened species) and the greenhouses, a dataset of environmental variables, and different only presence-based modelling algorithms (Bioclim, Domain, GARP, MaxEnt and ENFA) were used to build SDMs for L. nigricans as well as for greenhouses. To evaluate the models a modified approach of the area-under-curve ROC was applied. Combining the most accurate models, we generated an extinction-risk model of L. nigricans populations, which enabled us to assess the sustainability of the most threatened populations. Our results show that is possible to model greenhouses spreading as a "biological invasion". The procedure explained and used in this work is quite novel, and offers an objective spatial criterion intended for the management of natural resources and for the conservation of the biodiversity in areas threatened by habitat depletion processes as particular as greenhouses expansion.

AB Polymerase chain reaction techniques were developed and applied to identify DNA from > 40 species of prey contained in fecal (scat) soft-part matrix collected at terrestrial sites used by Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in British Columbia and the eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Sixty percent more fish and cephalopod prey were identified by morphological analyses of hard parts compared with DNA analysis of soft parts (hard parts identified higher relative proportions of Ammodytes sp., Cottidae, and certain Gadidae). DNA identified 213 prey occurrences, of which 75 (35%) were undetected by hard parts (mainly Salmonidae, Pleuronectidae, Elasmobranchii, and Cephalopoda), and thereby increased species occurrences by 22% overall and species richness in 44% of cases (when comparing 110 scats that amplified prey DNA). Prey composition was identical within only 20% of scats. Overall, diet composition derived from both identification techniques combined did not differ significantly from hard-part identification alone, suggesting that past scat-based diet studies have not missed major dietary components. However, significant differences in relative diet contributions across scats (as identified using the two techniques separately) reflect passage rate differences between hard and soft digesta material and highlight certain hypothesized limitations in conventional morphological-based methods (e. g., differences in resistance to digestion, hard part regurgitation, partial and secondary prey consumption), as well as potential technical issues (e. g., resolution of primer efficiency and sensitivity and scat subsampling protocols). DNA analysis of salmon occurrence (from scat soft-part matrix and 238 archived salmon hard parts) provided species-level taxonomic resolution that could not be obtained by morphological identification and showed that Steller sea lions were primarily consuming pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon. Notably, DNA from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that likely originated from a distant fish farm was also detected in two scats from one site in the eastern Aleutian Islands. Overall, molecular techniques are valuable for identifying prey in the fecal remains of marine predators. Combining DNA and hard-part identification will effectively alleviate certain predicted biases and will ultimately enhance measures of diet richness, fisheries interactions (especially salmon-related ones), and the ecological role of pinnipeds and other marine predators, to the benefit of marine wildlife conservationists and fisheries managers.

AB Social status is an important phenotypic trait that determines fitness-relevant parameters. In many mammalian societies, offspring acquire a social position at adulthood similar to that held by their mother ("rank inheritance") and thus obtain fitness benefits associated with this status. Mothers may influence the rank of their offspring at adulthood in at least three distinct ways. Firstly, the direct genetic inheritance of maternal traits that influence resource holding potential might predispose offspring to obtain a rank similar to that held by their mother. Secondly, the prenatal maternal environment might influence offspring rank if fetal exposure to maternal androgens is related to maternal status and affects offspring competitiveness. Thirdly, maternal behavioral support, a component of the postnatal maternal environment, may help offspring dominate individuals subordinate to their mother, thereby assisting offspring to acquire a rank similar to that of their mother. Here, we simultaneously test predictions derived from these three potential maternal effects on offspring rank acquisition at adulthood, using cases of offspring adoption in the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta. We demonstrate that the rank of adopted offspring at adulthood was similar to that of their surrogate mother and that the competitive ability of offspring at adulthood was best explained by postnatal maternal behavioral support.

AB Avian eggs contain maternal androgens that may adjust offspring development to environmental conditions. We review evidence and functional explanations for the relationship between androgen concentrations in avian eggs and male attractiveness. Experimental studies in captive birds show generally positive relationships, but results from correlational and experimental field studies are less consistent, perhaps because they lack a within-female design to control for confounding between-female variation. We analyzed the effect of male attractiveness on yolk levels of maternal androgens in a wild bird, using a correlational and experimental approach with a within-female design. We manipulated the sexually selected UV coloration of the crown feathers of male blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) after their female had laid the second egg and measured the subsequent effect on androgen concentrations (testosterone and androstenedione) in the fifth, seventh, and ninth eggs relative to that in the second egg. Levels of testosterone, but not androstenedione, in eggs 5 and 7 were higher for control (attractive) than for UV-reduced (unattractive) males. This effect disappeared in the ninth egg, coinciding with the recovery of UV coloration after manipulation. This suggests that females are capable of rapid adjustments of testosterone deposition in response to changes in their mate's ornamental plumage. However, androgen concentrations in the second egg and pretreatment male crown coloration were not correlated. Possibly, the combination of relatively small variation in UV coloration before treatment and the influence of unknown confounding variables in the correlative approach resulted in insufficient statistical power to detect such a correlation.

AB Most studies investigating the relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning lasted only a few years. These studies generally showed a positive relationship between diversity and productivity that strengthened with time. This pattern suggests the experimental communities have not yet reached maturity, which raises the question whether a positive relationship between diversity and productivity will remain if communities approach equilibrium conditions. Here, we analyze eight years of data from a plant diversity experiment without legumes. A positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity arose in the second year and increased until the fifth year. This relationship persisted throughout the remainder of the experiment, but the slope of the relationship remained constant at approximately 50 g/m(2)/log(2)[richness]. The positive relationship between diversity and productivity was caused by strong complementarity effects, which initially increased but remained constant after the fourth year of the experiment. Our results show a positive relationship between diversity and productivity is a long-term phenomenon, driven by complementary interactions.

AB Changes in stream chemistry were studied for 4 years following large wildfires that burned in Glacier National Park during the summer of 2003. Burned and unburned drainages were monitored from December 2003 through August 2007 for streamflow, major constituents, nutrients, and suspended sediment following the fires. Stream-water nitrate concentrations showed the greatest response to fire, increasing up to tenfold above those in the unburned drainage just prior to the first post-fire snowmelt season. concentrations in winter base flow remained elevated during the entire study period, whereas concentrations during the growing season return to background levels after tow snowmelt seasons. Annual export of total nitrogen from the burned drainage ranged from 1.53 to 3.23 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared with 1.01 to 1.39 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) from the unburned drainage and exceeded atomspheric inputs for the first two post-fire water years. Fire appeared to have minimal long-term effects on other nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and major constituents with the exception of sulfate and chloride, which showed increased concentrations for 2 years following the fire. There was little evidence that fire affected suspended-sediment concentrations in the burned drainage. Sediment yields in subalpine streams may be less affected by fire than in lower elevation streams because of the slow release rate of water during spring snowmelt.

AB The immune system is comprised of numerous components that interact with one another to give rise to phenotypic behaviors that are sometimes unexpected. Agent-based modeling (ABM) and cellular automata (CA) belong to a class of discrete mathematical approaches in which autonomous entities detect local information and act overtime according to logical rules. The power of this approach lies in the emergence of behavior that arises from interactions between agents, which would otherwise be impossible to know a priori. Recent work exploring the immune system with ABM and CA has revealed novel insights into immunological processes. Here, we summarize these applications to immunology and, particularly, how ABM can help formulate hypotheses that might drive further experimental investigations of disease mechanisms.

AB Nitrogen variations at different spatial scales and integrated across functional groups were addressed for lowland tropical forests in the Brazilian Amazon as follows: (1) how does N availability vary across the region over different spatial scales (regional x landscape scale); ( 2) how are these variations in N availability integrated across plant functional groups ( legume 9 non-legume trees). Leaf N, P, and Ca concentrations as well the leaf N isotope ratios (delta N-15) from a large set of legume and non-legume tree species were measured. Legumes had higher foliar N/Ca ratios than non-legumes, consistent with the high energetic costs in plant growth associated with higher foliar P/Ca ratios found in legumes than in non-legumes. At the regional level, foliar delta N-15 decreased with increasing rainfall. At the landscape level, N availability was higher in the forests on clayey soils on the plateau than in forests on sandier soils. The isotope as well as the non-isotope data relationships here documented, explain to a large extent the variation in delta N-15 signatures across gradients of rainfall and soil. Although at the regional level, the precipitation regime is a major determinant of differences in N availability, at the landscape level, under the same precipitation regime, soil type seems to be a major factor influencing the availability of N in the Brazilian Amazon forest.

AB Boreal forests contain significant quantities of soil carbon that may be oxidized to CO2 given future increases in climate warming and wildfire behavior. At the ecosystem scale, decomposition and heterotrophic respiration are strongly controlled by temperature and moisture, but we questioned whether changes in microbial biomass, activity, or community structure induced by fire might also affect these processes. We particularly wanted to understand whether postfire reductions in microbial biomass could affect rates of decomposition. Additionally, we compared the short-term effects of wildfire to the long-term effects of climate warming and permafrost decline. We compared soil microbial communities between control and recently burned soils that were located in areas with and without permafrost near Delta Junction, AK. In addition to soil physical variables, we quantified changes in microbial biomass, fungal biomass, fungal community composition, and C cycling processes (phenol oxidase enzyme activity, lignin decomposition, and microbial respiration). Five years following fire, organic surface horizons had lower microbial biomass, fungal biomass, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations compared with control soils. Reductions in soil fungi were associated with reductions in phenol oxidase activity and lignin decomposition. Effects of wildfire on microbial biomass and activity in the mineral soil were minor. Microbial community composition was affected by wildfire, but the effect was greater in nonpermafrost soils. Although the presence of permafrost increased soil moisture contents, effects on microbial biomass and activity were limited to mineral soils that showed lower fungal biomass but higher activity compared with soils without permafrost. Fungal abundance and moisture were strong predictors of phenol oxidase enzyme activity in soil. Phenol oxidase enzyme activity, in turn, was linearly related to both C-13 lignin decomposition and microbial respiration in incubation studies. Taken together, these results indicate that reductions in fungal biomass in postfire soils and lower soil moisture in nonpermafrost soils reduced the potential of soil heterotrophs to decompose soil carbon. Although in the field increased rates of microbial respiration can be observed in postfire soils due to warmer soil conditions, reductions in fungal biomass and activity may limit rates of decomposition.

AB To develop tools for modeling diazotrophic growth in the open ocean, we determined the maximum growth rate and carbon content for three diazotrophic cyanobacteria commonly observed at Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment) in the subtropical North Pacific: filamentous nonheterocyst-forming Trichodesmium and unicellular Groups A and B. Growth-irradiance responses of Trichodesmium erythraeum Ehrenb. strain IMS101 and Crocosphaera watsonii J. Waterbury strain WH8501 were measured in the laboratory. No significant differences were detected between their fitted parameters (+/- CI) for maximum growth rate (0.51 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.49 +/- 0.17 d(-1)), half-light saturation (73 +/- 29 vs. 66 +/- 37 mu mol quanta . m(-2) . s(-1)), and photoinhibition (0 and 0.00043 +/- 0.00087 [mu mol quanta . m(-2) . s(-1)](-1)). Maximum growth rates and carbon contents of Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera cultures conformed to published allometric relationships, demonstrating that these relationships apply to oceanic diazotrophic microorganisms. This agreement promoted the use of allometric models to approximate unknown parameters of maximum growth rate (0.77 d(-1)) and carbon content (480 fg C . mu m(-3)) for the uncultivated, unicellular Group A cyanobacteria. The size of Group A was characterized from samples from the North Pacific Ocean using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and real-time quantitative PCR techniques. Knowledge of growth and carbon content properties of these organisms facilitates the incorporation of different types of cyanobacteria in modeling efforts aimed at assessing the relative importance of filamentous and unicellular diazotrophs to carbon and nitrogen cycling in the open ocean.

AB The origins of the aerodynamic techniques now widely used at sites around the world to measure continuous biosphere-atmosphere exchange of carbon and energy are briefly reviewed. A survey of the current state of this approach concludes that the technique often fails when standard analysis routines are applied to data from single towers in complex flows. In the daytime, problems are signaled by failure to close the surface energy balance because turbulent energy fluxes are routinely underestimated. Complex flows are more prevalent at night when they lead to failure to measure all the respired CO2. At such times, the aerodynamic methodology is commonly supplemented by biological models. A set of papers from a workshop on "Flux Measurements in Difficult Conditions'' held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in January 2006 are introduced next. Two papers review the causes and magnitude of these flow-based problems. Four papers describe intensive field experiments that detail the mechanisms that cause problematic complex flows. These experiments show, inter alia, that the technique of replacing nighttime eddy flux measurements by biological models can also be systematically biased. Finally, two model studies are used both to illustrate the physics behind these complex flows and to motivate an approach to systematic correction of single-tower results.

ID MODELING HABITAT-SUITABILITY; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; SELECTION; GIS
AB We propose a new statistical framework for the exploratory analysis of the ecological niche, the "General niche-environment system factor analysis" (GNESFA). The data required for this analysis are (i) a table giving the values of the environmental variables in each environment unit (EU, e.g., the patches of habitat on a vector map), (ii) a set of weights measuring the availability of the EUs to the species (e.g., the proportion of the study area covered by a given patch), and (iii) a set of utilization weights describing the use of the EUs by the focal species (e.g., the proportion of detections of the species in each patch). Each row of the table corresponds to a point in the multidimensional space defined by the environmental variables, and each point is associated with two weights. The GNESFA searches the directions in this space where the two weight distributions differ the most, choosing one distribution as the reference, and the other one as the focus. The choice of the utilization as the reference corresponds to the MADIFA (Mahalanobis distances factor analysis), which identifies the directions on which the available EUs are in average the furthest from the optimum of the niche, allowing habitat suitability modelling. The choice of the availability as the reference corresponds to the FANTER (Factor analysis of the niche, taking the environment as the reference), which identifies the directions on which the niche is the furthest from the average environment (marginality) and those on which the niche is the narrowest compared with the environment (specialization). The commonly used ENFA (Ecological niche factor analysis) is at the middle point between the MADIFA and the FANTER, considering both distributions as the reference and the focus simultaneously. When used concurrently, these three analyses allow an extensive exploration of the system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A number of the deeper divergences in the placental mammal tree are still inconclusively resolved despite extensive phylogenomic analyses. A recent analysis of 200 kbp of protein coding sequences yielded only limited support for the relationships among Laurasiatheria (cow, dog, bat and shrew), probably because the divergences occurred only within a few million years from each other. It is generally expected that increasing the amount of data and improving the taxon sampling enhance the resolution of narrow divergences. Therefore these and other difficult splits were examined by phylogenomic analysis of the hitherto largest sequence alignment. The increasingly complete genome data of placental mammals also allowed developing a novel and stringent data search method.
   Results: The rigorous data handling, recursive BLAST, successfully removed the sequences from gene families, including those from well-known families hemoglobin, olfactory, myosin and HOX genes, thus avoiding alignment of possibly paralogous sequences. The current phylogenomic analysis of 3,012 genes (2,844,615 nucleotides) from a total of 22 species yielded statistically significant support for most relationships. While some major clades were confirmed using genomic sequence data, the placement of the treeshrew, bat and the relationship between Boreoeutheria, Xenarthra and Afrotheria remained problematic to resolve despite the size of the alignment. Phylogenomic analysis of divergence times dated the basal placental mammal splits at 95-100 million years ago. Many of the following divergences occurred only a few (2-4) million years later. Relationships with narrow divergence time intervals received unexpectedly limited support even from the phylogenomic analyses.
   Conclusion: The narrow temporal window within which some placental divergences took place suggests that inconsistencies and limited resolution of the mammalian tree may have their natural explanation in speciation processes such as lineage sorting, introgression from species hybridization or hybrid speciation. These processes obscure phylogenetic analysis, making some parts of the tree difficult to resolve even with genome data.

AB Shipping has contributed strongly to biological invasions in coastal ecosystems, transferring species in ballast tanks and on exposed underwater surfaces (hulls). A long history exists that documents biota associated with ships' hulls, including some recent analyses of modern ships, but relatively little is known about the associated risks of invasion. In general, the likelihood of invasion is expected to increase with increasing propagule supply, which suggests that high-density transfers on hulls may pose a relatively high invasion risk. Obsolete vessels are expected to be at an extreme end of the spectrum for biofouling, since they sit at anchorage for long periods and are towed at relatively slow speeds when moved, but this remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we quantified the biofouling communities of two obsolete vessels, one stationary for one decade and the other for two decades, before and after their final transit from California to Texas. Pre-departure biofouling surveys across both vessels detected 22 species of macroinvertebrates. The biomass was dominated by the introduced bryozoan Conopeum chesapeakensis, which occurred in 98% of samples and created a three-dimensional structure (2-5 cm thick). Mobile species, inhabiting the vertical biofouling matrix, were more numerous than sessile ones. Interestingly, the non-native Asian clam Corbula amurensis, not previously associated with hull fouling assemblages, was recorded in 9% of samples. During the 43-day voyage, organisms encountered salinity variation that ranged between zero (Panama Canal) and at least 37 parts per thousand (Brownsville, Texas) and temperatures that varied between 9.9 degrees C and 31.6 degrees C. Upon arrival in Texas, we measured an expected decrease in biofouling extent across both vessels but also a surprising increase in species richness (57 species were recorded), with small compositional differences between ships that did not exist prior to departure. Several species were recorded alive upon arrival, including non-natives that are not known to be established in Texas waters. The physiological tolerance and associated risk of colonization have not yet been evaluated for these organisms, or for the broader species pool associated with a standing fleet (n > 200 ships) that may undergo similar movements. Nonetheless, a compelling case exists for vector management based on organism flux alone, to reduce the risk of coastwise and inter-oceanic invasions.

AB The prevalence of patchy structures in vegetation is a common feature in semi-arid ecosystems. Although the effect of patches on seed density is widely known, we still lack information on how patch features affect seed bank density and composition. Our aim was to answer two basic questions: (1) How do seed bank density and composition vary within and outside patch aboveground physical limits? and (2) Do patch characteristics affect soil seed bank density and composition? We sampled 50 shrub patches in a semi-arid gypsum system in Central Spain, measuring patch size, composition and structure, and seed bank at three locations per shrub (centre, edge and outside). We calculated the effect of interior patch location, patch composition and structure on seed density and composition. Patches acted both as seed sources, increasing seed density in neighbouring areas and as seed sinks by trapping seeds from bare areas. Patch structure (erect perennial cover) had the greatest effect on seed bank density, whereas patch size and microslope had the greatest influence on bare area density. Patch structure, composition and interior location explained the variation in seed bank composition. Patch effect extends to the surrounding bare matrix creating a seed bank gradient in density and composition. This effect is modulated by patch structure and composition and affects seed bank composition. Our results suggest that the spatial structure of gypsum community seed banks may act as a mechanism for a spatial storage effect contributing to the maintenance of high levels of diversity in semi-arid environments.

AB 1. In systems where marine mammals are perceived to compete with fisheries, the priorities of conservationists and wildlife managers can come into conflict. Resolution of these conflicts requires quantitative information on the intensity of competition, i.e. the expected reduction in resource acquisition by one competitor as a result of a given increase in resource acquisition by the other.
   2. The intensity of competition will depend on the extent to which marine mammals and fisheries overlap in space and time with their shared resource, and the way in which individual competitors' preferences for particular prey or target species vary in response to variations in the population composition of these prey and the abundance of other components of the system.
   3. We use two examples of marine mammals, Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in Alaska and grey seals Halichoerus grypus in the UK, to illustrate these points and to challenge some intuitive notions about the nature of marine mammal-fisheries interactions.
   4. We conclude that the four main sources of ecological complexity (spatial heterogeneity, individual variation, multi-species interactions and long-term dynamics) can have a substantial effect on scientific predictions of the likely outcome of different management actions.
   5. We argue that a pragmatic approach, which considers the effect of ecological complexity while avoiding the indiscriminate addition of detail to mathematical models of competition, is the best way to provide scientific advice on issues that require urgent action.

AB Sperm competition is a powerful selective force driving the evolution of sperm shape and function. Recent findings suggest that sperm cooperation is a potential evolutionary response to sperm competition. Sperm cooperation may enhance the performance of the ejaculate increasing a male's chance to outcompete rival males in competition for fertilisation. Whether and how sperm cooperation may evolve is the focal point of this review. The relative importance of haploid and diploid gene expression for the evolution of sperm cooperation and the potential conflict of interest between (i) haploid sperm and diploid male and (ii) among sibling sperm, since sibling sperm only share an average of 50% of their genes in a diploid organism, are discussed. Furthermore, sperm cooperation is defined and the literature for empirical evidence of sperm cooperation is reviewed in light of the author's definitions.

AB Over the past two decades geographers have developed an increasingly sophisticated technology termed a geographic information system (GIS). A GIS has the ability to store, map and analyse spatial data. The powerful analytical capabilities of a GIS could serve to enhance our understanding of the spatial component of the evolutionary process. In particular, phylogeographers, hybrid zone and speciation researchers could benefit enormously from incorporating this sophisticated technology from the discipline of geography, as they have done so readily from other disciplines (e.g. genetics). Indeed, an increasing number of researchers in these fields are beginning to include GIS analyses into their research programmes. Some of this integration has taken the form of analysing the spatial relationship between populations and hybrid zones. Several other researchers have also begun to incorporate GIS into their work through the use of GIS-based niche models. These models estimate a multidimensional niche for a species using known geo-referenced populations and digital climate maps. Here, I review the recent integration of GIS and GIS-based predictive niche models into the above evolutionary sub-disciplines. I also describe evolutionary analyses that could be further enhanced through the implementation of GIS.

AB The colonization of novel habitats involves complex interactions between founder events, selection, and ongoing migration, and can lead to diverse evolutionary outcomes from local extinction to adaptation to speciation. Although there have been several studies of the demography of colonization of remote habitats, less is known about the demographic consequences of colonization of novel habitats within a continuous species range. Populations of the Eastern Fence Lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, are continuously distributed across two dramatic transitions in substrate color in southern New Mexico and have undergone rapid adaptation following colonization of these novel environments. Blanched forms inhabit the gypsum sand dunes of White Sands and melanic forms are found on the black basalt rocks of the Carrizozo lava flow. Each of these habitats formed within the last 10,000 years, allowing comparison of genetic signatures of population history for two independent colonizations from the same source population. We present evidence on phenotypic variation in lizard color, environmental variation in substrate color, and sequence variation for mitochondrial DNA and 19 independent nuclear loci. To confirm the influence of natural selection and gene flow in this system, we show that phenotypic variation is best explained by environmental variation and that neutral genetic variation is related to distance between populations, not partitioned by habitat. The historical demography of colonization was inferred using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework that incorporates known geological information and allows for ongoing migration with the source population. The inferences differed somewhat between mtDNA and nuclear markers, but overall provided strong evidence of historical size reductions in both white sand and black lava populations at the time of colonization. Populations in both novel habitats appear to have undergone partial but incomplete recovery from the initial bottleneck. Both ABC analyses and measures of mtDNA sequence diversity also suggested that population reductions were more severe in the black lava compared to the white sands habitat. Differences observed between habitats may be explained by differences in colonization time, habitat geometry, and strength or response to natural selection for substrate matching. Finally, effective population size reductions in this system appear to be more dramatic when colonization is accompanied by a change in selection regime. Our analyses are consistent with a demographic cost of adaptation to novel environments and show that it is possible to infer aspects of the historical demography of local adaptation even in the presence of ongoing gene flow.

AB The young successional stages of boreal forests are an important habitat for many saproxylic species. These habitats are formed by disturbances such as forest fires and they are characterized by large volumes of dead wood and sun-exposed conditions. Today, young successional stages of natural origin are very rare in Fennoscandia and there is need for restoration. We constructed a large-scale field experiment in which we studied the effects of two restoration practices on beetle diversity: controlled burning and partial harvesting with creating different volumes of dead wood. We sampled beetles with flight-intercept traps recording a total of 56,031 individuals and 755 species. The species richness and abundance of both saproxylic and non-saproxylic beetles were increased by burning and harvesting but the volume of dead wood created on harvested sites had no short-term effect on species richness or abundance. Rare species, especially saproxylic ones, preferred burned sites and a similar trend was observed among red-listed and pyrophilous species. Burning and harvesting also resulted in different species assemblages and there were some additional differences according to the volume of dead wood. We conclude that fire can be successfully used in restoration of managed boreal forests to increase species diversity and to facilitate the recovery of declined species. However, long-term monitoring is needed to clarify the effects of the restoration practices, in particular those of creating dead wood without using fire.

AB The potential impact of climate change on Dracaena cinnabari, a spectacular relict of the Mio-Pliocene Laurasian subtropical forest in Socotra (Yemen), was analysed. Current distribution, abundance and vertical structure of D. cinnabari populations were assessed with 74 plots in nine remnant areas. A deterministic regression tree analysis model was used to examine environmental variables related to the current species distribution. Using this model, a current potential map and a predicted potential map for the 2080 climatic scenario were generated. D. cinnabari has an altitudinal range from 323 to 1483 m a.s.l., with a mean annual temperature of 19.8-28.6 degrees C and an annual precipitation of 207-569 mm. The current distribution and abundance of D. cinnabari is correlated to three factors: moisture index (i.e. the ratio between the annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration), mean annual temperature and slope. According to this model, D. cinnabari occupies only 5 % of its current potential habitat. This potential habitat is expected to be reduced with 45% by 2080 because of a predicted increased aridity. Only two out of the nine remnant areas should be considered as potential refugia. The boundaries of the strictly protected Skund Nature Sanctuary, where no (road) infrastructure is allowed, should be extended to include both areas. The construction of new roads leading towards these areas, thereby increasing permanent settlements and grazing pressure, should also be discouraged. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the existence of coordinated sets of seedling traits adapted to contrasting establishment conditions, we examined evolutionary convergence in seedling traits for 299 French Guianan woody plant species and the stress response in a shadehouse of species representing seed size gradients within five major cotyledon morphology types. The French Guianan woody plant community has larger seeds than other tropical forest communities and the largest proportion of hypogeal cotyledon type (59.2%) reported for tropical forests. Yet the community includes many species with intermediate size seeds that produce seedlings with different cotyledonal morphologies. A split-plot factorial design with two light levels (0.8% and 16.1% PAR) and four damage treatments (control, seed damage, leaf damage, stem damage) was used in the shadehouse experiment. Although larger-seeded species had higher survival and slower growth, these patterns were better explained by cotyledon type than by seed mass. Even larger-seeded species with foliar cotyledons grew faster than species with reserve-type cotyledons, and survival after stem grazing was five times higher in seedlings with hypogeal cotyledons than with epigeal cotyledons. Thus, to predict seedling performance using seed size, seedling morphology must also be considered.

AB Objective management of grazing livestock production systems needs monitoring of forage production at the managerial unit level. Our objectives were to develop a system that routinely estimates forage above-ground net primary production (ANPP) at the spatial and temporal resolution required by farmers in the Pampas of Argentina, and to facilitate adoption of the system by end users as a managerial support tool. Our approach was based on the radiation use efficiency (RUE) logic, which proposes that ANPP is determined by the amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (APAR), and the efficiency with which that energy is transformed in above-ground dry matter (radiation use efficiency, RUE). APAR is the product of incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the fraction absorbed by the canopy (WAR). We estimated WAR as a non-linear function of MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). RUE was empirically estimated for the two principal forage resources of the region, yielding the following relations: ANPP = 0.6 x APAR + 12, (R-2 = 0.86; p < 0.001; n = 18) for the upland sown pastures, and ANPP = 0.27 x APAR + 26, (R-2 = 0.74; p < 0.001; n = 18) for the lowland naturalized pastures, with ANPP in g/m(2)/60 days and APAR in MJ/m(2)/60 days. The models were able to predict independent ANPP values with acceptable accuracy. Computational procedures were automated and run in a Relational Data Base Manager System that stored and managed all the information. The system is currently monitoring 212,794 ha in 83 farms and provides monthly ANPP values for the previous month and a history of the last 6 years. The data so generated show ANPP differences between the two major forage resources, considerable variability of a given month's ANPP among years and paddocks, and contrasting among-farm differences in the efficiency of conversion of ANPP and forage supplements into beef production. The system was well accepted by end users who utilize it mainly for making near real time decisions according to last month ANPP, and explaining results of previous production cycles by incorporating ANPP as an explicative variable. However, there were differences among farmers in the degree of utilization, apparently related to the advisor's attitude toward this new technology. Our results indicate that (1) forage production of large extensions can be monthly monitored at the paddock level by a small laboratory with capabilities ill geographic information systems, and (2) advisors and farmers apply this information to their managerial decisions.

AB Supportive breeding is an important tool in conservation management, but its long-term genetic consequences are not well understood. Among the factors that could affect the genetics of the offspring is sperm competition as a consequence of mixed-milt fertilizations - which is still a common practice in many hatcheries. Here, we measured and combined the relevant factors to predict the genetic consequences of various kinds of hatchery-induced sperm competition. We drew a random sample of male Coregonus zugensis (an Alpine whitefish) from a hatchery program and quantified their in vitro sperm potency by integrating sperm velocity during the first minute after activation, and their in vitro milt potency by multiplying sperm potency with milt volume and sperm cell density. We found that not controlling for sperm density and/or milt volume would, at a constant population size, decrease the variance effective number of male breeders N-em by around 40-50%. This loss would decrease with increasing population growth rates. Partial multifactorial breeding and the separate rearing of in total 799 batches of eggs revealed that neither sperm nor milt potency was significantly linked to egg survival. Sperm and milt potency was also not significantly correlated to other potential quality measures such as breeding tubercles or condition factor. However, sperm potency was correlated to male age and milt potency to male growth rate. Our findings suggest that hatchery-induced sperm competition not only increases the loss of genetic variation but may also induce artificial selection, depending on the fertilization protocol. By not equalizing milt volume in multi-male fertilization hatchery managers lose relatively more genetic variation and give fast-growing males a reproductive advantage, while equalizing milt volume reduces the loss of genetic variation and favors younger males who may have fast sperm to compensate for their subdominance at the spawning place.

AB Projections of global change predict both increases of the surface temperature and decreases of biodiversity, but studies on the combined impact of both on terrestrial ecosystems are lacking. We assessed the impact of these two global changes on above- and below-ground productivity of grassland communities. Experimental ecosystems containing one, three or nine grassland species were grown in 12 sunlit, climate-controlled chambers in Wilrijk, Belgium. Half of these chambers were exposed to ambient air temperatures, while the other half were warmed by 3 degrees C. Equal amounts of water were added to heated and unheated communities, so that any increases in evapotranspiration due to warmer conditions would result in a drier soil. Warming led to a decreased productivity of both above-ground plant parts (-18%) and roots (-23%), which coincided with a significantly lower soil water content. Complementarity in resource use and/or facilitation slightly enhanced above-ground productivity in multi-species communities, regardless of the induced warming. Interactive effects between temperature treatment and species richness level were found below-ground, however, where warming nullified the positive effect of richness on root productivity. Future warmer conditions could further increase losses of productivity associated with declining species numbers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tree thinning and harvesting produces large amounts of slash material which are typically disposed of by burning, often resulting in severe soil heating. We measured soil chemical properties and microbial community structure and function over time to determine effects of slash pile burning in a ponderosa pine forest soil. Real time data were collected for soil temperature, heat flux, and soil moisture contents in one of two slash piles burned in April 2004. During the burn, soil temperatures reached 300 degrees C beneath the pile center and 175 degrees C beneath the pile edge. Slash pile burning increased soil pH, extractable N and P, and decreased total C levels within the first 15 cm of soil. Burning reduced soil bacterial biovolumes within the first 15 cm of soil and fungal biovolumes within the first 5 cm of soil. One month after the burn, soil microbial communities under the pile center were enriched in Gram-positive bacterial fatty acid markers compared to communities from under the pile edge and control (nonburned) soil. Fifteen months later, soil chemical properties had not returned to background levels, and microbial community structure in fire-affected soil, regardless of pile location, was distinct from communities of control soil. In fire-affected soil, concentrations of fungal fatty acid biomarkers were low and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomarkers were absent, regardless of pile location. Slash pile burning also reduced fungal and bacterial respiration and resulted in large fluctuations in microbial potential N mineralization and immobilization activities. By altering soil properties important to soil conservation and plant reestablishment, slash pile burning negatively impacts forest ecosystems at localized scales. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The intra- and inter-season complexity of bird migration has received limited attention in climatic change research. Our phenological analysis of 22 species collected in Chicago, USA, (1979-2002) evaluates the relationship between multi-scalar climate variables and differences (1) in arrival timing between sexes, (2) in arrival distributions among species, and (3) between spring and fall migration. The early migratory period for earliest arriving species (i.e., short-distance migrants) and earliest arriving individuals of a species (i.e., males) most frequently correlate with climate variables. Compared to long-distance migrant species, four times as many short-distance migrants correlate with spring temperature, while 8 of 11 (73%) of long-distance migrant species' arrival is correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). While migratory phenology has been correlated with NAO in Europe, we believe that this is the first documentation of a significant association in North America. Geographically proximate conditions apparently influence migratory timing for short-distance migrants while continental-scale climate (e.g., NAO) seemingly influences the phenology of Neotropical migrants. The preponderance of climate correlations is with the early migratory period, not the median of arrival, suggesting that early spring conditions constrain the onset or rate of migration for some species. The seasonal arrival distribution provides considerable information about migratory passage beyond what is apparent from statistical analyses of phenology. A relationship between climate and fall phenology is not detected at this location. Analysis of the within-season complexity of migration, including multiple metrics of arrival, is essential to detect species' responses to changing climate as well as evaluate the underlying biological mechanisms.

AB Allocation tradeoffs with the immune system can enforce honesty on sexual signals that act as indicators of individual quality. Such tradeoffs can be brought about by (1) the dual action of testosterone, which stimulates sexual signals but also suppresses immune functions, and/or (2) competition for carotenoids, which can be deposited as ornamental pigments or used as antioxidants in support of immune functions. Recent studies((1-3)) integrate these two mechanisms by showing that testosterone treatment in male birds upregulates circulating lipoproteins, plasma carriers for carotenoids, and increases bio-availability of carotenoids, which enhances carotenoid-based sexual coloration and immune responsiveness.

AB Southern elephant seals are important apex predators in a highly variable and unpredictable marine environment. In the presence of resource limitation, foraging behaviours evolve to reduce intra-specific competition increasing a species' overall probability of successful foraging. We examined the diet of 141 (aged 1-3 years) juvenile southern elephant seals to test the hypotheses that differences between ages, sexes and seasons in diet structure occur. We described prey species composition for common squid and fish species and the mean size of cephalopod prey items for these age groups. Three cephalopod species dominated the stomach samples, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Histioteuthis eltaninae and Slosarczykovia circumantarcticus. We found age-related differences in both species composition and size of larger prey species that probably relate to ontogenetic changes in diving ability and haul-out behaviour and prey availability. These changes in foraging behaviour and diet are hypothesised to reduce intra-specific food competition concomitant with the increase in foraging niche of growing juveniles.

AB We studied the composition and richness of local tadpole assemblages in several streams at a forest site in southeastern Brazil. We initially focused on species distributions within streams, comparing the relative availability of microhabitats with the relative use of each microhabitat type by tadpoles of different species, in order to assess the existence of preference patterns. Then we assessed the role of features assumed to influence species distributions among streams, which may influence breeding site selection by adult frogs and, consequently, tadpole distribution. These features were stream size, tadpole predator abundance, structure of marginal vegetation, and microhabitat availability for tadpoles. We looked for gradients of species richness along gradients of the variables noticed to influence tadpole assemblage composition. Tadpoles of all species showed selectivity in microhabitat use. Species distribution among streams was influenced mostly by number of potential tadpole predators present, stream volume, arboreal vegetation cover at stream margins, and tadpole microhabitat diversity, though only the first two variables accounted for gradients in species richness. Even though smaller streams tend to shelter more anuran species than larger ones at sites in southeastern Brazil, we recommend the conservation of streams of a range of sizes and structural features, since anuran assemblages associated with streams vane in species composition along gradients in these characteristics.

AB Aim To determine the relationship between the distribution of climate, climatic heterogeneity and pteridophyte species richness gradients in Australia, using an approach that does not assume potential relationships are spatially invariant and allows for scale effects (extent of analysis) to be explicitly examined.
   Location Australia, extending from 10 degrees S to 43 degrees S and 112 degrees E to 153 degrees E.
   Method Species richness within 50 x 50 km grid cells was determined using point distribution data. Climatic surfaces representing the distribution and availability of water and energy at 1 km and 5 km cell resolutions were obtained. Climate at the 50 km resolution of analysis was represented by their mean and standard deviation in that area. Relationships were assessed using geographically weighted linear regression at a range of spatial bandwidths to investigate scale effects.
   Results The parameters and the predictive strength of all models varied across space at all extents of analysis. Overall, climatic variables representing water availability were more highly correlated to pteridophyte richness gradients in Australia than those representing energy. Their variance in cells further increased the strength of the relationships in topographically heterogeneous regions. Relationships with water were strong across all extents of analysis, particularly in the tropical and subtropical parts of the continent. Water availability explained less of the variation in richness at higher latitudes.
   Main conclusions This study brings into question the ability of aspatial and single-extent models, searching for a unified explanation of macro-scaled patterns in gradients of diversity, to adequately represent reality. It showed that, across Australia, there is a positive relationship between pteridophyte species richness and water availability but the strength and nature of the relationship varies spatially with scale in a highly complex manner. The spatial variance, or actual complexity, in these relationships could not have been demonstrated had a traditional aspatial global regression approach been used. Regional scale variation in relationships may be at least as important as more general relationships for a true understanding of the distribution of broad-scale diversity.

AB Net ecosystem production (NEP) was estimated over a 10.9 x 10(4) km(2) forested region in western Oregon USA for 2 yr (2002-2003) using a combination of remote sensing, distributed meteorological data, and a carbon cycle model (CFLUX). High spatial resolution satellite data (Landsat, 30 m) provided information on land cover and the disturbance regime. Coarser resolution satellite imagery (MODIS, 1 km) provided estimates of vegetation absorption of photosynthetically active radiation. A spatially distributed (1 km) daily time step meteorology was generated for model input by interpolation of meteorological station data. The model employed a light use efficiency approach for photosynthesis. It was run over a 1 km grid. This approach captured spatial patterns in NEP associated with climatic gradients, ecoregional differences in NEP generated by different management histories, temporal variation in NEP associated with interannual variation in climate and changes in NEP associated with recovery from disturbances such as the large forest fire in southern Oregon in 2002. Regional NEP averaged 174 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in 2002 and 142 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in 2003. A diagnostic modelling approach of this type can provide independent estimates of regional NEP for comparison with results of inversion or boundary layer budget approaches.

AB Background: The impact of global climate change on plant distribution, speciation and extinction is of current concern. Examining species climatic preferences via bioclimatic niche modelling is a key tool to study this impact. There is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and phylogenetic diversification. A next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective. We present such a study using Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae), a group which demonstrates morphological and phenological adaptations to its seasonal Mediterranean-type climate. How will the predicted climate change affect future distribution of this popular genus of garden plants?
   Results: We demonstrate phylogenetic structure for some climatic characteristics, and show that most Cyclamen have distinct climatic niches, with the exception of several wide-ranging, geographically expansive, species. We reconstruct climate preferences for hypothetical ancestral Cyclamen. The ancestral Cyclamen lineage has a preference for the seasonal Mediterranean climate characteristic of dry summers and wet winters. Future bioclimatic niches, based on BIOCLIM and Maxent models, are examined with reference to a future climate scenario for the 2050s. Over the next 50 years we predict a northward shift in the area of climatic suitability, with many areas of current distribution becoming climatically unsuitable. The area of climatic suitability for every Cyclamen species is predicted to decrease. For many species, there may be no areas with a suitable climate regardless of dispersal ability, these species are considered to be at high risk of extinction. This risk is examined from a phylogenetic perspective.
   Conclusion: Examining bioclimatic niches from a phylogenetic perspective permits novel interpretations of these models. In particular, reconstruction of ancestral niches can provide testable hypothesis about the historical development of lineages. In the future we can expect a northwards shift in climatic suitability for the genus Cyclamen. If this proves to be the case then dispersal is the best chance of survival, which seems highly unlikely for ant-dispersed Cyclamen. Human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges offers hope and could provide the only means of dispersal to potentially suitable future environments. Even without human intervention the phylogenetic perspective demonstrates that major lineages could survive climate change even if many species are lost.

AB We examined the relative roles of contemporary (species interactions) and historical factors (phylogeny) in structuring a lizard assemblage (14 species) from one of the last remaining large expanses of undisturbed Cerrado in Brazil. Niche breadth for microhabitat was low for all species in the assemblage, and microhabitat niche overlaps varied from none to almost complete and appeared associated with phylogenetic similarity. Mean microhabitat and diet overlaps among lizard species did not differ statistically from random, based on a pseudocommunity analysis, indicating a negligible role of contemporary factors in assemblage structure. Prey overlaps were highest within Gymnophthalmidae and Teiidae. A cluster analysis of principal component scores of morphometric variables revealed groups corresponding to lizard families, suggesting a strong association between morphology and phylogeny. Similarities among closely related species in microhabitat use, diel activity, and diet breadth, based on cladogram inspection, suggested that phylogeny might affect assemblage structure. However, a Canonical Phylogenetic Ordination (CPO) analysis revealed no significant phylogenetic effects on lizard microhabitat use or diet composition. We suggest that under-representation of species in major clades (low taxon sampling) renders it difficult to detect potential historical and ecological effects on assemblage structure.

AB The Himalayan region of northern India depends on monsoon rains, together with snow and glacial melt, to supply life-sustaining water to one of the world's most densely populated areas. Here we provide high-resolution pollen and diatom evidence from a peat deposit in the Pinder Valley that shows a synchronous and abrupt ecosystem turnover toward a wetter state in the last two centuries that exceeded changes recorded over the last three millennia. Contrary to expectations, there was no relationship between recent proxy changes and summer monsoon precipitation. Strong relationships, however, were found with winter climate data. We link this recent unprecedented wetness to marked warming at higher elevations resulting in increased seasonal runoff and associated climatic feedbacks in this snow and ice-melt dominated region. In contrast to the expected desiccation and decomposition of most peat systems with warming, this site has instead become the wettest in its ca. 3500-year history.

AB Life- history traits in wild populations are often regarded as being subject to directional selection, and the existence of substantial variation and microevolutionary stasis of these characters is therefore a problem in need of explanation. Avian clutch size is an archetypal life- history trait in this context, and many studies have sought to test explanations for stasis in clutch size. Surprisingly, there are many fewer studies that used long- term data to ask how selection acts on clutch size, particularly in a multivariate framework. In this article, we report selection, inheritance, and evolution of clutch size over 25 years in a colony of mute swans using a multivariate quantitative genetic framework to control for correlations with breeding time. We show that clutch size is influenced by both additive genetic and permanent environmental effects and that selection acts on clutch size in combination with breeding time. Natural selection on clutch size is strongly directional, favoring larger clutches, and we observe an increase in clutch size of 0.35 standard deviations, consistent with the expected response based on selection and inheritance of clutch size. We hypothesize that these changes result from recent relaxation of food constraints and predation risks experienced by this colony.

AB The environmental physiology of three speciesof Collembola: Cryptopygus cisantarcticus, Isotoma klovstadi (Isotomidae) and Friesea grisea (Neanuridae) was investigated from November 2002 to February 2003 at Cape Hallett, North Victoria Land, Antarctica. All three species were freeze avoiding, and while supercooling points were variable on seasonal and daily scales in I klovstadi and C. cisantarcticus, they remained largely static in F. grisea. LT50 (temperature where 50% of animals are killed by cold) was -13.6, -19.1 and -19.8 degrees C for C. cisantarcticus, I klovstadi and F. grisea, respectively. Upper lethal temperature was 34, 34 and 38 degrees C for C cisantarcticus, I. klovstadi and F. grisea. Critical thermal minimum onset (the temperature where individuals entered chill coma) was ca. -7, -12 and -8 degrees C for C. cisantarcticus, I. klovstadi and F. grisea, and 25% of I klovstadi individuals froze without entering chill coma. Critical thermal maximum (the onset of spasms at high temperature) was 30, 33 and 34 degrees C for C cisantarcticus, I. klovstadi and F. grisea. Haemolymph osmolality was approximately 720 mOsm for C cisantareticus and 680 mOsm for I. klovstadi, and both species showed a moderate degree of thermal hysteresis, which persisted through the season. Desiccation resistance was measured as survival above silica gel, and the species survived in the rank order of C cisantareticus << I. klovstadi = F grisea. Desiccation resulted in an increase in haemolymph osmolality in I. klovstadi, and water was quickly regained by desiccation-stressed individuals that had access to liquid water, but not by individuals placed in high humidity, indicating that this species is unable to absorb atmospheric water vapour. SDS-PAGE did not suggest any strong patterns in protein synthesis either seasonally or in response to temperature or desiccation stress. Microclimate temperatures were measured at sites representative of collection sites for the three species. Microclimate temperatures were highly variable on a diurnal and weekly scale (the latter relating to weather patterns), but showed little overall variation across the summer season. Potentially lethal high and low temperatures were recorded at several sites, and it is suggested that these temperature extremes account for the observed restriction of the less-tolerant C cisantareticus at Cape Hallett. Together, these data significantly increase the current knowledge of the environmental physiology of Antarctic Collembola. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biological invasions have commonly occurred, and to a lesser degree continue to do so, without human assistance. It is, however, a combination of the rate and magnitude, as well as the distances and agency involved, that separates human-driven invasion processes from self-perpetuated colonization events. Exotic species are a pervasive and major component of human-induced global change. Decisions to manage invasive species will require judgements to be communicated from scientists to policy makers, because scientists may often be the only ones in the position to make them.

AB This review examines a large marine continental shelf ecosystem (the Eastern Scotian Shelf of Canada (ESS)), that has undergone dramatic hysteresis-like changes in the recent past, using a pragmatic approach that combines empirical, reductionist and holistic methods based on the integrated analysis of 55 primary and secondary biotic, abiotic, and human variables over a 43-year period. The integrated analysis reveals that the ESS ecosystem has changed states, i.e., a,regime shift' from a community dominated by large-bodied demersal fish to one dominated by small dernersal and pelagic fish species and benthic macroinvertebrates. A dynamic interplay between ocean physics, biology and exploitation presents a more realistic casual scenario than any single component hypothesis such as fishing pressure alone. The forces contributing to the stability of the alternate state include both top-down processes involving strong trophic interactions initiated at the apex predator level and bottom-up processes involving energy flow and nutrient cycling that have fundamentally altered the matter and energy flow patterns in the ESS ecosystem. It is suggested that the ESS has been literally 'devolving' when viewed from the perspective of the theory of ecological succession. Further, higher-order variables are identified as early warning indicators, sensitive to the underlying structural and functional changes that occurred on the ESS ecosystem. They have been determined for an adjacent system where systemic changes have not yet been observed and predict a potential collapse within a decade.
   Integrated assessment of ecosystems is a great challenge and their management requires comprehension of ecological systems. Description alone is not sufficient to allow comprehension, especially if 'information overload' (the disconnect between system description and system comprehension) is to be avoided and meaningful insights and strategies are to emerge. Reductionistic analysis involves the dissection and identification of key processes or feedback mechanisms likely to be operative in an ecological system. However, value cannot be ascertained from variations in processes, as a directionality of time does not exist in such a perspective. In fact, the approach has accelerated the information overload experienced by all stakeholders. Holistic approaches are being increasingly used to aid in the valuation of ecological systems as the directionality of time is made explicit in this perspective. It is suggested that integrated assessment requires not only the integration of descriptive information, but also the integration of our perception of ecological systems as being both a whole and a part.

AB Aim To document patterns in diversity, altitudinal range and body size of freshwater fishes along an elevational gradient in the Yangtze River basin.
   Location The Yangtze River basin, China.
   Methods We used published data to compile the distribution, altitudinal range and body size of freshwater fishes. Correlation, regression, clustering and graphical analyses were used to explore patterns in diversity, altitudinal range and body size of freshwater fishes in 100-m elevation zones from 0 to 5200 m.
   Results Species richness patterns across the elevational gradient for total, non-endemic and endemic fishes were different. The ratio of endemics to total richness peaked at mid elevation. Land area on a 500-m interval scale explained a significant amount of the variation in species richness. Species density displayed two peaks at mid-elevation zones. The cluster analysis revealed five distinct assemblages across the elevation gradient. The relationship between elevational range size and the midpoint of the elevational range revealed a triangular distribution. The frequency distribution of log maximum standard length data displayed an atypical right-skewed pattern. Intermediate body sizes occurred across the greatest range of elevation while small and large body sizes possessed only small elevational amplitudes. The size-elevation relationship between the two major families revealed a very strong pattern of body size constraint among the Cobitidae with no corresponding elevational constraint and a lot of body size and elevational diversification among the Cyprinidae.
   Main conclusion The data failed to support either Rapoport's rule or Bergmann's rule.

AB Opportunistic parasite species, capable of exploiting several different host species, do not achieve the same abundance on all these hosts. Parasites achieve maximum abundance on their principal host species, and lower abundances on their auxiliary host species. Taxonomic relatedness between the principal and auxiliary host species may determine what abundance a parasite can achieve on its auxiliary hosts, as relatedness should reflect similarities among host species in ecological, physiological and/or immunological characters. We tested this hypothesis with fleas (Siphonaptera) parasitic on small Holarctic mammals. We determined whether the abundance of a flea in its auxiliary hosts decreases with increasing taxonomic distance of these hosts from the principal host. Using data on 106 flea species from 23 regions, for a total of 194 flea-locality combinations, we found consistent support for this relationship, both within and across regions, and even after controlling for the potentially confounding effect of flea phylogeny. These results are most likely explained by a decrease in the efficiency of the parasite's evasive mechanisms against the host's behavioural and immune defences with increasing taxonomic distance from the principal host. Our findings suggest that host switching over evolutionary time may be severely constrained by the coupling of parasite success with the relatedness between new hosts and the original host.

AB Female birds incorporate in the yolks of their eggs significant concentrations of a number of different androgens. Yolk androgen has been shown to positively affect several fitness components at the embryo, nestling and juvenile stages. Previous experiments have shown that females lay eggs with higher androgen concentrations when they are paired with highly ornamented males. This pattern suggests that yolk androgens are costly to females. In this study, we experimentally manipulated adult female condition in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata by modifying the level of developmental stress they suffered as nestlings. This was achieved by cross-fostering nestlings to broods of varying brood size. Subsequently, we measured the yolk testosterone contents of the female offspring that resulted from the experimental manipulation. As predicted, females deposited decreasing concentrations of testosterone with increasing brood sizes experienced as nestlings: testosterone concentration (mean +/- S.E.M.) of eggs laid by females from small broods, 20.66 +/- 2.08 pg mg(-1); medium broods, 15.32 +/- 1.94 pg mg(-1); and large broods, 14.51 +/- 1.66 pg mg(-1). Additionally, testosterone concentration decreased with laying order, and varied with clutch size in a complex way. Differences in egg testosterone between females exposed to different brood sizes are in line with previous findings in showing that early developmental stress can affect adult reproductive performance, although our study did not detect an effect in other breeding parameters, such as latency to breed or clutch size. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a cost associated with yolk testosterone. However, it is still unclear what the nature of this cost may be, and whether it is paid by females, offspring, or both.

AB Theoretical models of the accumulation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) are studied, and in particular, the framework introduced by Orr (1995) and a verbal model introduced by Kondrashov et al. (2002). These models embody very different assumptions about the relationship between the substitution process underlying evolutionary divergence and the formation of incompatibilities. These differences have implications for our ability to make inferences about the divergence from patterns in the relevant data. With this in mind, the models are investigated for their ability to account for three patterns evident in this data: (1) the asymmetrical nature of incompatibilities under reciprocal introgression; (2) the finding that multiple concurrent introgressions may be necessary for an incompatibility to form: and (3) the finding that the probability of obtaining an incompatibility by introgressing a single amino acid remains roughly constant over a wide range of genetic distances. None of the models available in the literature can account for all of the empirical patterns. However, modified versions of the models can do so. Ways of discriminating between the different models are then discussed.

AB This is the first study using flow cytometry to characterize the population dynamics of freshwater autotrophic picoplankton (APP) over a full seasonal cycle, the goal of which was to accurately quantify and qualify the natural APP populations in relation to major environmental parameters. In particular, we wanted to test current assumptions about the seasonal succession of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picoplankton cells, including the relationship between solitary picocyanobacteria and microcolonies. Using flow cytometry, we were able to efficiently characterize the abundances of 4 lake APP assemblages in Lake Mondsee, including that of a solitary picocyanobacterial population exhibiting high "side scatter" values. Such cells were not readily enumerated by epi-fluorescence microscopy. Unlike Lakes Constance and Maggiore, we found no evidence of a spring peak in solitary picocyanobacteria - we propose that the lack of a spring peak in Lake Mondsee was due to weak stratification in March-April and relatively deep vertical mixing. Since summer declines in the abundance of solitary picocyanobacteria were associated with extended periods of reduced light availability, it is likely that such declines were in part due to low relative growth rates, Finally, we argue that the formation of microcolonies by picocyanobacteria is unlikely to be a strategy for more efficient nutrient recycling (e.g. Stockner & Antia 1986). Rather, we suggest that microcolonies reach high concentrations in surface and near-surface waters due to the production of a photosynthate-rich mucilage resulting from active photosynthesis during periods of severe nutrient deficiency.

AB We report the successional trends of the major life-forms (graminoids and forbs) in natural grasslands of Uruguay over a 9-yr period after the removal of domestic herbivores. For the whole community, species richness and diversity decreased over the successional period. In graminoids we observed clear temporal trajectories in floristic composition; the rate of floristic change decreased with time and was associated with a shift in plant traits. The exclusion of large herbivores promoted erect and tall grasses with narrow leaves and greater seed length, vegetative growth constrained to the cool season and increased frequency of annual species. Forbs did not show a clear temporal trend in species composition, but there was, nevertheless, a plot-specific species turnover of this functional group that was reflected in their attributes. Species spreading by means of rhizomes, with vegetative growth restricted to the warm season. Species with larger seeds increased under grazing exclusion, as did annual and nitrogen-fixing forbs. The floristic changes induced by cattle exclusion occurred early in the succession. This early high rate of change has practical implications for management and conservation programs of the natural grasslands of Uruguay. Additionally, the shift in plant traits may be helpful in devising simple indicators of grazing impact.

AB 1. Improved nutrition may cause an increase in body size in animals, while increased ambient temperature may result in a decrease in body size, as expected from Bergmann's rule. In Israel, during the last 50 years both food availability for animals commensal with humans and ambient temperature have increased.
   2. Using museum data, temporal changes in body size of five species of carnivorous mammals commensal with humans were examined.
   3. An increase in body length was found in four species, and appears to be related to improved nutrition owing to a substantial increase in the amount of garbage and agricultural crops available to commensal mammals that has occurred since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.
   4.The larger species were more affected than the smaller ones, apparently because of their higher position in the feeding hierarchy or because of having larger home ranges.
   5. The increases are convergent with the increase in human body height observed during the past two centuries.
   6. These changes illustrate the fast rate of animal response to changing environmental conditions.

AB We examined attributes of growth, reproduction, morphology and diet of a population of pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus introduced into a cool-water pond (Cottesmore) in southern England, and compared them with available data on warm-water European populations. Morphologically, Cottesmore pumpkinseed appear to have a more streamlined body than the two southerly populations for which data are available, but this may be due to the small body size of the Cottesmore population. Ontogenetically, 11 morphological characters grew isometrically, 12 allometrically, and 3 split-isometrically (i.e. a significant shift in proportional growth rate); however, the split 'break points' (between 49 and 60 mm SL) do not appear to correspond with any change in resource use or in biological process. Juvenile and age-specific growth were the lowest reported of any European population, and mean GSI was also low. Growth rate was highest in May and June, with condition highest in June, and with peak GSI in June and July. Mean age at maturity in the Cottesmore population was the highest reported in Europe. Dietary overlap was high amongst most age classes, and there was evidence of cannibalism in the population. Late maturity of the Cottesmore population was probably the result of relatively low temperatures during the growing season, slow growth, poor condition at age 3 (due to limited food resources), and intensive egg predation by high numbers of juveniles, giving a fitness advantage to late-maturing females.

AB Woody linear features of farmlands have received much attention as pools of diversity in European countries, but they have, in comparison, been little considered in eastern North American ecological studies. Here, we evaluate the relative contribution of environmental conditions, history of management practices within hedgerows, and adjacent land-use on herb and shrub species distribution in woody hedgerows of agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec, Canada. We pay particular attention to the distribution of forest herbs and weed species and identify the main factors that explain their presence. We also evaluate the amount of spatial structuring in the species data and explanatory variables.
   Our results show significant differences in species composition related to the unique influence of all sets of factors considered. Adjacent land-use (from intensive crop to fallow land) remains the best predictor of overall species distribution, followed by environmental conditions and history of management practices. The probability of finding forest herbs in hedgerows increases as intensity of adjacent agricultural practices (from intensive crop to fallow land) decreases. Potential weed species, on the other hand, are more likely to be found within narrow hedgerows adjacent to the more intensively managed fields. We discuss the results in terms of the interactions between the different determinants of plant diversity in hedgerows and demonstrate the necessity to distinguish between multiple structuring factors to devise proper conservation strategies. Such strategies will have to take into account. the ecological as well as the agricultural exploitation context in which linear features are found to be effective. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Aim Animal assemblages in fragmented landscapes are likely to be determined by contemporary (e.g. patch size, biotic interactions) and historical (e.g. change in patch area) characteristics of patches and their positioning in the landscape (e.g. connectivity). We considered the influence of habitat structure, landscape context, history and an aggressive, native bird species [the Noisy Miner Manorina melanocephala (Latham 1801)] on three characteristics of woodland-dependent bird assemblages in a fragmented, eucalypt-forest landscape. The response variables were: (1) species richness (SR), (2) sums-of-densities (i.e. total number of individual birds), and (3) occurrence of rare species [through a rare-species index (RSI)].
   Location Box-ironbark, eucalypt forests of central Victoria, Australia (broadly bounded by: 36-37degrees S, 142-146degrees E).
   Methods There were replicates of four size-classes of fragments (10, 20, 40, 80 ha) and replicates of the same size-classes set within large blocks of extant forest. This design allowed us to distinguish between area-specific and fragmentation effects by comparing same-sized fragments and reference areas to establish fragmentation-specific impacts.
   Results Species richness was less than expected in smaller fragments and this was apparently because of current fragment area, density of the Noisy Miner and habitat quality. The RSI exhibited similar dependencies, while sums-of-densities appeared to be related to the number and quality of wooded linkages to fragments. The historical variable was forested-area change of each fragment between 1963 and 1996, and was found to have no relationship to any of the response variables.
   Main conclusions The lack of historical influence suggested that the avifaunas of the fragments are unlikely to be `relaxing' from isolation effects through local extinctions, but are more likely to be dominated by dynamic recolonization and abandonment both seasonally and among years. The dependence of sums-of-densities on the linkage variable appeared to be largely because of the responses of two species, the Red Wattlebird Anthochaera curunculata (Shaw, 1790) and the Yellow-tufted Honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops (Latham, 1801). These species are among the three most common in the large forest blocks, but are much rarer in fragments. The connectedness effect suggests that these species may depend upon linkages to occupy fragments that are only moderately distant from large forested areas within this region.

AB Although much attention has been recently directed to sexual selection arising after insemination from sexual promiscuity, little is known about the mechanisms determining reproductive success after insemination, and the way these mechanisms interact with each other and with selective mechanisms occurring before insemination: mate choice and mate acquisition. Here, we briefly review the findings of an on-going study investigating the mechanisms generating variation in reproductive success at both a pre- and a post-insemination stage in the domestic fowl. Female preference consistently favours socially dominant males before and after insemination. However, although social status mediates the number of sperm that a male inseminates into a female, dominant males may inseminate sperm of lower fertilising quality than their subordinates. We argue that mitochondrial genes may contribute to determine sperm quality, and speculate that the maternal control of mitochondrial genes may prevent sexual selection from operating on males, thus explaining both the lack of a positive correlation between social dominance and sperm quality and the maintenance of variation in male quality in the fowl.

AB Natural habitats vary in the degree to which they are invaded by exotic species, but it is unclear whether they differ in the mechanisms underlying the spatial spread of a given exotic species. To compare the dynamics of invasion in highly invaded nonserpentine oak woodlands and less-invaded serpentine habitats, we used an historical "experiment" consisting of the introduction of several normative species for post-mining revegetation, supplemented by a pot experiment and a factorial field experiment.
   Three species showed significant declines in abundance on transects from revegetated zones into natural habitats, indicating that these species had spread into the natural habitats from revegetated zones. Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium hirtum were found up to 95 m into oak woodland, 35 m into serpentine meadows, and 0-25 m into serpentine seeps and chaparral, while Elytrigia pontica was found up to 45 m into serpentine seeps. The pot experiment showed that this pattern of distribution for Dactylis was not caused or limited by variation in soil properties. The field experiment showed that Dactylis invasion in both oak woodland and serpentine meadow habitats was limited by disturbance and seed supply. Dactylis success was negatively correlated with species richness in oak woodlands, but positively correlated with richness in serpentine meadows, suggesting that the relationships between diversity, invasion, and underlying habitat suitability differed between these habitats.
   Our results show that in harsh serpentine soils, the spread of recently introduced exotic species is slower than in more fertile and more invaded oak woodlands. However, disturbance and propagule addition are equally important in promoting the spread of invaders in both environments.

AB A divergence in sieve size protocols for washing samples has arisen among shallow- and deep-sea benthic biologists, which now affects comparability across the 2 environments. This has come about as a result of a perception of smaller body size among deep-sea benthic organisms. Two box-core samples from similar to1900 m depth were examined to see how different sieve size affects estimation of biomass, abundance and diversity of macrofauna in the deep sea. Expressed as cumulative retentions, the coarsest sieve (1 mm mesh) retained 94 % of the biomass retained in the finest sieve (0.25 mm), confirming the expectation that rarer, large-sized individuals contribute most to biomass of macrobenthos. There were small increases when progressively finer sieves were used, but the rate of increase declined markedly from 0.425 to 0.25 mm mesh. Numbers of individual organisms increased through the series, with a marked increase from 0.5 to 0.425 mm. mesh; numbers of species did not increase as rapidly, but showed a similarly high rate between 0.5 and 0.425 mm mesh. The proportions of the total biomass in coarser sieves, and the total number of specimens retained by the finest sieve were rather similar to those shown in previous studies of inshore and continental shelf benthos. However, the retention of deep-sea species by the 0.5 mm. sieve (86 %) was about the same as the percentage of inshore species retained by the 1.0 mm sieve (at this sieve size only 54 % of deep-sea species were retained). Although the finer sieves in both shallow- and deep-sea samples include many postlarval stages, this differing response for species must reflect smaller size of some adult macrobenthos in the deep sea. The effect on diversity depended on index used, with Shannon's index increasing down to the 0.5 mm mesh, but showing a variable response in the finer sieves. This probably mostly reflects increased retention of small-sized juveniles of species already retained, causing increasing unevenness in species abundances with smaller sieve size, rather than addition of small-sized species not previously retained in coarser sieves. Expected numbers of species calculated by rarefaction seems much less affected, with the degree of overlap of rarefaction curves reflecting relative similarity in distribution of species abundances, Degree of overestimation (of expected number of species against number of individuals along the curve) is greatest for the 1 mm mesh, even if the end-points of the curve show decreasing disparity, from 1 to 0.25 mm mesh, in total retention of species as well as individuals, It is argued that, as would apply in shallow water, the great dependence of evenness on sieve size makes shifts in distribution of species abundances caused by disturbance more difficult to detect against the baseline, unless a sufficiently small sieve has been used. When sieve retention was separately considered for the major taxonomic groups of macrobenthos (Polychaeta, Peracarida, Mollusca), differing patterns in relation to sieve size were found in terms of abundance and species. No single group can therefore serve as a reliable proxy for the total macrobenthic assemblage.

AB Tree mortality and its causes and spatial pattern were examined along four transects (width 40 m, length 2550-3960 m), with a total length of 12 190 m and area of 48.8 ha, in a Pinus sylvestris L, dominated, boreal forest landscape. Tree mortality was determined within a time window of 3 years by identifying those trees dbh greater than or equal to 10 cm) along the transects that fitted into one of the three categories: 1) current mortality: trees that had died during the year of survey (1998), 2) recent mortality: trees that had died during the year (1997) before the survey year, and 3) predicted mortality: trees that were expected to die during the year (1999) following the survey year. Long-term tree mortality was studied on 10 plots (20m x 100m) by dating 87 dead trees using dendrochronological methods. The mean current mortality was 1.4 m(3)ha(-1) (3.7 trees ha(-1)). Both the recent and predicted mortalities were also 1.4 m(3) ha(-1). Mortality was, on the average, higher on peatlands than on mineral soils, The highest mortality was found within an area recently flooded by beavers. Over half of the examined trees (52%) were judged to die without any visible signs of an external abiotic cause. At the landscape scale, tree mortality was continuous although somewhat aggregated in space. Of the 66 dated standing dead Pinus trees, 23 (35%) had died during the 19th century and two during the 18th century, demonstrating that dead Pinus can remain standing for long periods of time before falling. Our results show that autogenic mortality of individual trees or small groups of trees was the predominant mode of disturbance in this Pinus dominated landscape.

AB We explore the relationships between environmental factors and vegetative and reproductive phenology in nine dominant perennial plant species in a semi-arid ecosystem in central Mexico. In spite of the highly seasonal environment at the study site, and a relatively long dry period. at least one species was always in some phase of growth or reproduction for the duration of the study (April 1996-June 1998). Two patterns in leafing were observed. Some shrub species maintained their leaves during the entire year, whereas others lost their leaves during the dry season. The cacti Neobuxbaumia tetetzo and Cephalocereus columna-trajani showed slow growth, however they produced areoles throughout the study. Echinocactus platyacanthus ceased areolar production during the driest period of the study. Throughout the both years, the dispersion of flowering and fruiting peaks among all the species studied were random. However, these species formed four distinct groups based on reproductive phenology and life form. (1) Shrubs with a general root system (0-1 m depth), Mimosa luisana and Caesalpinia melanadenia, and the succulent nanophanerophyte with shallow roots, E. platyacanthus, flowered and fruited during the rainy season; (2) Phreatophytic shrubs, Prosopis laevigata and Cercidium praecox, and succulent mesophanerophytes with shallow roots, N. tetetzo and C. columna-trajani, flowered and fruited before the rainy season; (3) Castela tortuosa, a shrub with general root system, was the only species to flower and fruit all year long, (4) The semisucculent shrub with general root system, Ipomoea arborescens, flowered and fruited after the rainy season. These phenological patterns were correlated principally with soil moisture, maximum temperature, and to a lesser degree, relative humidity and photoperiod. Our results support the hypothesis that the coexistence of these species in and zones is due to differences in resource utilization, (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB Broad-scale anthropogenic disturbances that reduce the density of epifauna and homogenise surficial sediments can have important consequences for seafloor biodiversity. We investigated the habitat structure and macrofaunal diversity of relatively simple soft-sediment habitats over a number of spatial scales (cm to km) to identify the role of habitat structure in influencing macrobenthic diversity and to assess the validity of using habitat structure as a surrogate measure for biodiversity. We sampled 10 locations with differences in habitat structure using a sampling design that nested macrobenthic core samples within videoed transects of the seafloor. This allowed us to determine relationships between observable habitat structure and macrobenthic diversity at a number of spatial scales. We characterised elements of habitat structure based on direct counts of surficial sediment characteristics and the presence of other immobile features, many of which were biogenic in origin. We also used multivariate measures (the relative multivariate dispersion, the mean and range of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity along the transects) to characterise habitat structure at the transect scale. We developed regression models based on measures of habitat structure that explained 74 to 86% of the variance in macrobenthic diversity. This result suggests that removal of habitat structure in relatively low-structure soft-sediment systems will significantly decrease their biodiversity, and consequently that of the wider marine ecosystem.

AB Apparent competition (i.e., a mutually negative indirect interaction between prey species through shared predation) arises when predator abundance or foraging effort increases with total, prey availability. We review and formalize several patch-use models from which we derive predictions for how the degree of coupling (from the predators' perspective) between nesting guilds (defined as species nesting within a vegetation stratum) affects the outcome of shared predation. We then determine which model best applies to nest predation on woodland songbirds and artificial nests by a natural population of raccoons. Using artificial nests, we showed that increasing the density of nests placed either in shrubs or on the ground increased overall predation (i.e., proportion of nests) on both types. We also tested for apparent competition between American robin and wood thrush, two coexisting woodland songbirds that commonly nest within the shrub stratum. Nest predation increased for wood thrushes but not robins as the combined density of robin and thrush nests within two individual substrate types, Lonicera and Rhamnus, increased. Thus, we documented apparent competition both within and among nesting guilds. We discuss the possible relevance of this interaction in determining species diversity, particularly in the light of increasing generalist nest predators through anthropogenically driven changes in human-altered landscapes.

AB First, we formulate some questions posed by the procedure recently proposed by Borcard et al. (1992) and Borcard and Legendre (1994) to partition the ecological variation of a community into different portions related to spatial and environmental descriptors. Working separately on the two steps of this procedure - linear modelling and ordinations on modelled tables - allows us to propose different solutions to these questions. These solutions, which use little-known properties of a linear regression model with two additive factors and no interaction, are also adapted to the case of mixed factors (qualitative and quantitative). These properties are presented in the framework of canonical correlation analysis. In particular, they allow us to propose an alternative to partial regression, which avoids confounding. A detailed illustration is presented.

AB Species diversity, population structure, abundance and dispersion patterns of all woody plants greater than or equal to 10 cm gbh were inventoried in two 1-ha plots of tropical dry evergreen (sacred grove or temple) forests at Kuzhanthaikuppam (KK) and Thirumanikkuzhi (TM) on the Coromandel coast of south India. Site KK is a stunted forest (average tree height ca 6 m) and TM a tall forest (average tree height ca 10 m). A total of 54 species (in 47 genera and 31 families) were recorded. Species richness and stand density were 42 and 38 species and 1367 and 974 individuals ha(-1) respectively for the sites KK and TM. About 50 % of the total species were common to both the sites. Site TM is twofold more voluminous (basal area 29.48 m(2) ha(-1)) than KK (basal area 15.44 m(2) ha(-1)). Nearly one third of the individuals are multi-stemmed in the low-statured site KK whereas one fourth of the tree density is multi-stemmed in TM. Species abundance pattern varied between the two sites. The abundance of three species in KK and two species in TM is pronounced. Memecylon umbellatum, the most abundant species contributing to one third of total stand density in KK, is least represented in TM. Species richness, density and diversity indices decreased with increasing girth threshold. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 and 1-ha scales. Population structure for girth frequency is an expanding one for both the sites, except for basal area distribution in KK. Variations in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts. In the light of habitat uniqueness, species richness and sacred grove status, the need for conservation is emphasized.

AB Background matching might lower the risk of seeds being eaten by seed predators that search visually. In aviary experiments, we analyzed the selection of different-colored seeds by ground-feeding finches (Fringilla coelebs and F. montifringilla) against four naturally occurring forest soil substrates. The substrates were fresh burn (black), 6-year-old burn (brown), mineral soil (pale yellow) and Pleurozium schreberi feather moss (green). We used color-sorted seeds of Pinus sylvestris, a species with a large natural variation in seed color, ranging from pale yellow to black. Although seeds were scattered on the substrates at a density of only 91 seeds m(-2), birds removed seeds effectively. Both bird species found more pale than dark seeds on the fresh burn substrate. F. montifringilla also recovered more pale than dark seeds on the old burn, and more dark than pale seeds on mineral soil. In moss, the birds found very few seeds compared to the other substrates, and there was no color discrimination. P. sylvestris is frequently regenerating after fire, suggesting that dark seeds would be favored under selection from visually searching predators. Fire-adapted conifers with serotinous cones, e.g., Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia, which spread their seeds primarily on freshly burnt surfaces, produce uniformly black or dark brown seeds. However, regeneration of the non-serotinous P. sylvestris is often extended for several years after a fire, during which substrate color and structure change. This may have helped to maintain variation in seed color. When regeneration of a plant species occurs on a substrate of uniform color, we believe that selection by visually searching seed predators will result in the evolution of cryptic seed color.

AB This paper presents the results of a bumblebee mark-reobservation study conducted in a fragmented agricultural landscape, where bumblebee resources (forage, and probably also nest sites) exist mainly on scattered remnants of semi-natural habitat. The results show that reobservations of bumblebees marked while foraging were numerous and in general at short distances (less than 50 m) from where they were marked. In contrast, when bumblebees were marked at the nest, the numbers of reobservations were very low, even though monitoring of nest traffic showed the nest to be very active during reobservation walks. The results indicate that bumblebees do not necessarily forage close to their nest, and that caution is needed if foraging area and nest location are based solely on the observation of foragers.

AB The landscape structure of forests subjected to wildfires fluctuates through time as a result of the episodic nature of these disturbances and long-term variation in the climatic conditions that influence the fire regime, These landscape dynamics influence a variety of important ecosystem processes. Before European settlement, landscape dynamics in Pacific Northwest forests were driven primarily by the patterns of wildfire, and an understanding of these dynamics can provide a unique frame of reference for evaluating current forest management policies and alternatives for the future, Tree-ring data and historical records of forest cutting were used to quantify the range of landscape conditions that existed on two large watersheds (4000 ha and 11600 ha) between the late 1400s and 1990, A rule-based simulation model was used to generate landscape patterns that would result from five alternative future forest management scenarios, Our results demonstrate that conditions on these two watersheds in 1990 are outside the range of conditions that existed during most of the reconstructed pre-settlement era. Continued use of short (50 to 100 year) timber rotation lengths would push these watersheds even farther outside of this range, The use of much longer rotation lengths (200 + years) could bring these watersheds back to within or very near this range of pre-settlement conditions.

AB We studied floristic and diversity patterns and their environmental controls in two landscapes of contrasting topography in the Patagonian steppe. The analyses were focused on the effects of water availability gradients and landscape configuration on plant species distribution and coexistence.
   Floristic variation was investigated using Correspondence Analysis. The relationship between floristic and environmental variation was analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis and correlation tests. We explored diversity patterns by relating spatial distance to floristic dissimilarities. The floristic gradient was determined by shrub and grass species and was related to precipitation in the flat area, and to precipitation, elevation and potential radiation in the mountain area. Site species richness increased with water availability in both areas. Mean site species richness and species turnover in space was higher in the mountain than in the flat area. Landscape species richness and floristic gradients were more concentrated in the mountain than in the flat area. In contrast to shrubs and grasses, forb species distributions were uncoordinated and probably independent of any environmental gradient. Our results suggest(1) that landscape configuration affects species composition and diversity through its direct effect on abiotic environmental heterogeneity, and (2) that the environmental controls of the community composition vary depending on the plant functional type considered.

AB The importance of rice fields for breeding herons was assessed during comparative studies of their foraging ecology (densities of foraging adults, prey abundance, feeding success, chick diets) in the five major regions of rice cultivation in Europe: northwest Italy, the Po Delta in northwest Italy, the Rhone Delta in France, the Axios Delta in Greece, and the Ebro Delta in Spain. Rice fields offered better conditions to foraging herons than natural habitats in northwestern and northeastern Italy where the number of feeding herons, food intake rates, and prey abundance in rice fields were higher. The proportion of the food resources obtained by herons from the agricultural habitats, rice fields and small irrigation canals was estimated using two independent methods. Six heron species acquired more than half of their food from rice fields in all the regions except the Rhone Delta where agricultural habitats offered less prey. The conclude that rice fields are the main foraging habitat for herons breeding in Mediterranean Europe, and we urge authorities to consider the special importance of rice field management to the conservation of Mediterranean herons.

AB A density index of every diurnal raptor species (Falconiformes) was obtained on 101 400 ha sample plots distributed among eight natural habitats and five manmade habitats arranged along gradients of increasing forest degradation and fragmentation. The most significant structural parameter affecting species distribution was the tall canopy forest cover. Species richness, diversity and density all decreased with this mature forest cover index. Individual species and overall community densities decreased along the deforestation gradient but the species richness was partly maintained by species turnover. Six groups of species were identified according to their natural habitat preferences. Their distribution along the deforestation gradient was correlated with their natural habitat selection pattern. Thus the community composition of each vegetation or landscape type was predictable. Fifty-six percent of the regional assemblage of species had their optimal density in the primary forest. A third of them were interior forest species highly sensitive to forest disturbance and opening. The other two-thirds were upper canopy, gap or edge species more tolerant to forest fragmentation. The last twenty-one species were associated with various coastal habitats, from dense forest patches to mangrove and savanna. Again, one third of them were strictly restricted to their specialized habitats while the last two-thirds colonized human-altered habitats and progressively replaced primary forest species with increasing deforestation. The maintenance of large areas of every natural habitat was essential for the conservation of (1) the whole population of a third of the total raptor diversity and (2) optimal and presumably potential source populations of most other species surviving in human-modified habitats.

AB Habitat fragmentation has been postulated as a cause of lower nest success in many species of birds, potentially due to creation of additional edges. In this study we tested the hypothesis that predation on artificial waterfowl nests was influenced by habitat edges. Data from dense nesting cover supported the ecological trap hypothesis, while predation risk was not related to distance (0-150 m) from habitat edge in idle pasture or delayed hay fields. Nest survival was heterogeneous within the 4-week sampling period with nests exhibiting increased survival with time of exposure. Nest survival also differed among habitat types. Daily survival rate was highest in dense nesting cover and delayed hay, while idle pasture and rights-of-way exhibited similar but lower nest success. These results suggest that agricultural practices have profound effects on waterfowl nesting success in upland environments. Nest survival was higher in spring than in summer in one out of three years. In all years and habitats, significantly more mammals than birds depredated waterfowl nests. The relative importance of the two classes of predators was similar among delayed hay, dense nesting cover and rights-of-ways, but differed from idle pasture where avian predation was higher.

AB Comparative demographic studies of terrestrial vertebrates have included few samples of species from tropical forests. We analyzed 9 yr of mark-recapture data and estimated demographic parameters for 25 species of birds inhabiting lowland forests in. central Panama. These species were all songbirds (Order Passeriformes) ranging in mass from 7 to 57 g. Using Jolly-Seber stochastic models for open populations, we estimated annual survival rate, population size, and recruitment between sampling periods for each species. We then explored relationships between these parameters and attributes such as body size, phylogenetic affiliation, foraging guild, and social behavior. Larger birds had comparatively long life-spans and low recruitment, but body size was not associated with population size. After adjusting for effects of body size, we found no association between phylogenetic affiliation and any demographic trait. Ecological attributes, especially foraging guild, were more clearly associated with interspecific variation in all demographic traits. Ant-followers had comparatively long life-spans, but species that participate in flocks did not live longer than solitary species. The allometric associations we observed were consistent with those demonstrated in other studies of vertebrates; thus, these relationships appear to be robust. Our finding that ecological factors were more influential than phylogenetic affiliation contrasts with comparative studies of temperate-zone birds and suggests that the relative importance of environmental vs. historical factors varies geographically.

AB Potential competitors that eat each other can engender patterns of spatial segregation similar to those produced by competition, and distinguishable only by field manipulation. This paper reports the results of a perturbation experiment to test the factors responsible for small-scale discontinuities in the distribution of a common insectivore. Populations of hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were monitored following their introductions into an area where they had been absent, and into a neighbouring area where they were known to persist. The two sites had a similar availability of preferred habitat, and the growth rates of introduced hedgehogs were similar. The density of badgers (Meles meles), larger members of the same guild, appears to produce differences in mortality and dispersal, which returned the populations close to their original levels within 2 months of the transplant.

AB Diets of chicks of the Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa, Redshank Tringa totanus, Ruff Philomachus pugnax, and Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus were studied by faecal analysis. Lapwing chicks feed on surface dwelling organisms, and exploit fauna living inside cow-dung pats. Black-tailed Godwit chicks hunt for more mobile prey species, higher in the vegetation. Redshank and Ruff take intermediate positions. Oystercatcher chicks are fed on tipulid larvae and earthworms. To obtain information on food availability, macrofauna was sampled. In May, the number of arthropods in grassland rapidly increases. In June, arthropod abundance may temporarily decrease. Chicks show retarded growth from mid-May onwards, before prey abundance peaks. A hypothesis is proposed that from the energetic point of view, chicks cannot grow up on arthropod fauna alone, but have to switch to earthworms, which may become progressively difficult to obtain later in the season.

AB Biochar amendment has been proposed to be as a promising means to improve soil properties and enhance plant productivity in different types of soils. However, biochar application in the improvement of plant productivity in saline-alkali soils has received less attention. In the present study, we carried out a pot experiment in greenhouse to evaluate the effect of biochar amendment on the growth of Miscanthus lutarioriparius, a promising bioenergy crop, in a coastal saline-alkali soil during a 92-day growth period. The biochar was added at 0, 1.0%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, and 10.0% (w/w) levels in a random block design with three replicates. The results showed that biochar applications at 2.0% and 2.5% levels significantly promoted Miscanthus growth by ameliorating the physicochemical and biological properties of the saline-alkali soil. The soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), available phosphorus (Olsen-P), and concentrations of potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions were significantly increased, while soil pH, bulk density, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), sodium (Na+) ion, and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) contents were substantially reduced. In addition, the soil bacterial community structure and diversity were substantially shifted after the biochar amendment, which in turn affected soil N and P cycling and improved soil physicochemical properties. Meanwhile, biochar application considerably mitigated the salinity stress to Miscanthus plants by activating anti-oxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), therefore enhancing the scavenging capability of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Together, our results indicated that biochar amendment effectively promoted Miscanthus growth by ameliorating soil physical, chemical and biological properties, and alleviated salt stress injuries to plants in a coastal saline-alkali soil.

AB Signals of local adaptation have been found in many plants and animals, highlighting the heterogeneity in the distribution of adaptive genetic variation throughout species ranges. In the coming decades, global climate change is expected to induce shifts in the selective pressures that shape this adaptive variation. These changes in selective pressures will likely result in varying degrees of local climate maladaptation and spatial reshuffling of the underlying distributions of adaptive alleles. There is a growing interest in using population genomic data to help predict future disruptions to locally adaptive gene-environment associations. One motivation behind such work is to better understand how the effects of changing climate on populations' short-term fitness could vary spatially across species ranges. Here we review the current use of genomic data to predict the disruption of local adaptation across current and future climates. After assessing goals and motivations underlying the approach, we review the main steps and associated statistical methods currently in use and explore our current understanding of the limits and future potential of using genomics to predict climate change (mal)adaptation.

AB Prehistoric human activities were likely influenced by cyclic monsoon climate changes in East Asia. Here we report a decadal-resolution Holocene pollen record from an annually-laminated Maar Lake in Northeast China, a proxy of monsoon climate, together with a compilation of 627 radiocarbon dates from archeological sites in Northeast China which is a proxy of human activity. The results reveal synchronous similar to 500-year quasi-periodic changes over the last 8000 years. The warm-humid/cold-dry phases of monsoon cycles correspond closely to the intensification/weakening of human activity and the flourishing/decline of prehistoric cultures. Six prosperous phases of prehistoric cultures, with one exception, correspond approximately to warm-humid phases caused by a strengthened monsoon. This similar to 500-year cyclicity in the monsoon and thus environmental change triggered the development of prehistoric cultures in Northeast China. The cyclicity is apparently linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, against the background of long-term Holocene climatic evolution. These findings reveal a pronounced relationship between prehistoric human activity and cyclical climate change.

AB Metazoans exist only with a continuous and rich supply of chemical energy from oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. The oxidative phosphorylation machinery that mediates energy conservation is encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and hence the products of these two genomes must interact closely to achieve coordinated function of core respiratory processes. It follows that selection for efficient respiration will lead to selection for compatible combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear genotypes, and this should facilitate coadaptation between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (mitonuclear coadaptation). Herein, we outline the modes by which mitochondrial and nuclear genomes may coevolve within natural populations, and we discuss the implications of mitonuclear coadaptation for diverse fields of study in the biological sciences. We identify five themes in the study of mitonuclear interactions that provide a roadmap for both ecological and biomedical studies seeking to measure the contribution of intergenomic coadaptation to the evolution of natural populations. We also explore the wider implications of the fitness consequences of mitonuclear interactions, focusing on central debates within the fields of ecology and biomedicine.

AB Aposematic theory has historically predicted that predators should select for warning signals to converge on a single form, as a result of frequency-dependent learning. However, widespread variation in warning signals is observed across closely related species, populations and, most problematically for evolutionary biologists, among individuals in the same population. Recent research has yielded an increased awareness of this diversity, challenging the paradigm of signal monomorphy in aposematic animals. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis of these disparate lines of investigation, identifying within them three broad classes of explanation for variation in aposematic warning signals: genetic mechanisms, differences among predators and predator behaviour, and alternative selection pressures upon the signal. The mechanisms producing warning coloration are also important. Detailed studies of the genetic basis of warning signals in some species, most notably Heliconius butterflies, are beginning to shed light on the genetic architecture facilitating or limiting key processes such as the evolution and maintenance of polymorphisms, hybridisation, and speciation. Work on predator behaviour is changing our perception of the predator community as a single homogenous selective agent, emphasising the dynamic nature of predator-prey interactions. Predator variability in a range of factors (e.g. perceptual abilities, tolerance to chemical defences, and individual motivation), suggests that the role of predators is more complicated than previously appreciated. With complex selection regimes at work, polytypisms and polymorphisms may even occur in Mullerian mimicry systems. Meanwhile, phenotypes are often multifunctional, and thus subject to additional biotic and abiotic selection pressures. Some of these selective pressures, primarily sexual selection and thermoregulation, have received considerable attention, while others, such as disease risk and parental effects, offer promising avenues to explore. As well as reviewing the existing evidence from both empirical studies and theoretical modelling, we highlight hypotheses that could benefit from further investigation in aposematic species. Finally by collating known instances of variation in warning signals, we provide a valuable resource for understanding the taxonomic spread of diversity in aposematic signalling and with which to direct future research. A greater appreciation of the extent of variation in aposematic species, and of the selective pressures and constraints which contribute to this once-paradoxical phenomenon, yields a new perspective for the field of aposematic signalling.

AB Urban green infrastructure (UGI) planning is a new approach to planning that aims to develop multifunctional networks of green and blue spaces designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services, and thereby, to improve quality-of-life in cities. However, moving current practice in urban green space planning towards the UGI planning approach will require higher quality information about a wider array of ecosystem services than currently measured and more spatially detailed social valuation methods. This paper explores the added value of public participation GIS (PPGIS), a relatively new type of survey for obtaining social values, as a tool for UGI planning. We do this by surveying real-life assessment tools for CES used in the case study city of Berlin and comparing the results of these with those of a PPGIS survey conducted in the city. The discussion centers on application of PPGIS results for UGI planning, focusing on their potential for enhancing multifunctionality at different spatial scales. At the site-level, the tool can help target conflict and less valued areas for redesign and management, as well as identifying particularly loved park features for protection. At the districtand city-level, we found potential for improving representativeness and accuracy of expert-based assessments, identifying coldspots and difficult-to-map functions, correcting deficits and increasing understanding of functional synergies. Outside of enhancing multifunctionality assessment, PPGIS may also support implementation of other defining principles of UGI planning, such as connectivity of green spaces, integrating urban green infrastructure with other infrastructure and ensuring collaborative, socially-inclusive planning processes.

AB There is an urgent need to develop agricultural methods that balance water supply and demand while at the same time improve resilience to climate variability. A promising instrument to address this need is biochar - a charcoal made from pyrolyzed organic material. However, it is often unclear how, if at all, biochar improves soil water availability, plant water consumption rates and crop yields. To address this question, we synthesized literature-derived observational data and evaluated the effects of biochar on evapotranspiration using a minimal soil water balance model. Results from the model were interpreted in the Budyko framework to assess how climatic conditions mediate the impacts of biochar on water fluxes. Our analysis of literature-derived observational data showed that while biochar addition generally increases the soil water holding capacity, it can have variable impacts on soil water retention relative to control conditions. Our modelling demonstrated that biochar increases long-term evapotranspiration rates, and therefore plant water availability, by increasing soil water retention capacity - especially in water-limited regions. Biochar amendments generally increased crop yields (75% of the compiled studies) and, in several cases (35% of the compiled studies), biochar amendments simultaneously increased crop yield and water use efficiencies. Hence, while biochar amendments are promising, the potential for variable impact highlights the need for targeted research on how biochar affects the soil-plant-water cycle. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 11 requires its 193 signatory parties to incorporate social equity into protected area (PA) management by 2020. However, there is limited evidence of progress toward this commitment. We surveyed PA managers, staff, and community representatives involved in the management of 225 PAs worldwide to gather information against 10 equity criteria, including the distribution of benefits and burdens, recognition of rights, diversity of cultural and knowledge systems, and processes of participation in decision-making. Our results show that more than half of the respondents indicated that there are still significant challenges to be addressed in achieving equitably managed PAs, particularly in ensuring effective participation in decision-making, transparent procedures, access to justice in conflicting situations, and the recognition of the rights and diversity of local people. Our findings are a first and fundamental contribution toward a global assessment of equitable management in PAs to report on Aichi Target 11 in 2020 and help define the next set of PA targets from 2020-2030.

AB Theoretical and empirical studies have suggested that climate and soils are the main drivers of biodiversity, stand structure and aboveground biomass in natural forests. Yet, the direct effects of climate and soils on aboveground biomass versus the indirect effects mediated by species diversity and stand structural complexity remain unclear in forest ecosystems across large-scale ecological gradients. Here, we hypothesized that (1) climate and soils would influence aboveground biomass through strong indirect effects; (2) stand structural complexity rather than species diversity would strongly mediate the response of aboveground biomass to climate and soils; and (3) species diversity and stand structural complexity would promote each other under the niche differentiation and facilitation effects, and that stand structural complexity would have positive effects on aboveground biomass across large-scale ecological gradients. To test these hypotheses, we quantified climatic water availability, soil total exchangeable bases, species diversity, stand structural complexity including tree DBH (diameter at breast height) diversity and height diversity, and aboveground biomass across 907 plots in tropical forests of Hainan Island, Southern China. We tested 126 structural equation models to examine the direct and indirect effects of climate and soils on aboveground biomass via species diversity and stand structural complexity. Climatic water availability and soil fertility did not affect aboveground biomass directly but did affect indirectly via increasing stand structural complexity rather than species diversity. Species diversity and stand structural complexity promoted each other, and both increased with increasing climatic water availability. Stand structural complexity increased aboveground biomass directly, whereas species diversity increased it indirectly via increasing stand structural complexity. The total effects of climatic water availability, soil fertility, stand structural complexity and species diversity on aboveground biomass were significantly positive. This study shows that climatic water availability exerts a strong direct effect on stand structural complexity, indicating that any decrease in climatic water availability (i.e. increasing atmospheric drought) may directly diminish stand structural complexity and hence indirectly reduce aboveground biomass and carbon storage. This study suggests that maintaining high stand structural complexity can enhance aboveground biomass under favourable climate and soils while maintaining the benefits of species diversity on stand structural complexity for better ecosystem services such as carbon storage.

AB Adaptive immune recognition is mediated by antigen receptors on B and T cells generated by somatic recombination during lineage development. The high level of diversity resulting from this process posed technical limitations that previously limited the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune recognition. Advances over the last ten years have produced data and approaches allowing insights into how T cells develop, evolutionary signatures of recombination and selection, and the features of T cell receptors that mediate epitope-specific binding and T cell activation. The size and complexity of these data have necessitated the generation of novel computational and analytical approaches, which are transforming how T cell immunology is conducted. Here we review the development and application of novel biological, theoretical, and computational methods for understanding T cell recognition and discuss the potential for improved models of receptor: antigen interactions.

ID VEGETATION HEALTH
AB Nearly, a quarter of the world's population does not have enough food for normal living and nearly 1 billion people become hungry every year. One of the reasons for undernourishment and hunger is drought, which reduces agricultural production leading to food insecurity situation. In half of the years of the twenty-first century, drought was the main cause of shortage in world grain production compared to its consumption, creating problem with food security. In November 2017, a new generation of NOAA operational satellite, JPSS-1, with VIIRS instrument on board was launched. Regarding land cover monitoring, the system was designed to advance drought detection, and improve prediction of grain loss using the highest resolution vegetation health (VH) method. The VIIRS-based VH will detect drought early, monitor accurately at 0.5km(2) resolution, provide drought intensity, duration and predict agricultural loss 2 months ahead of crop harvest. Such early estimates will predict food security situation. Examples in this article prove high accuracy of vegetation health assessment, drought-triggered crop stress and the resulting grain production loss. These applications provide 2-4 months of advanced predictions of global food insecurity and early assessments of food assistance for the countries in need.

   DYNAMICS
AB Predicting the fate of tropical forests under a changing climate requires understanding species responses to climatic variability and extremes. Seedlings may be particularly vulnerable to climatic stress given low stored resources and undeveloped roots; they also portend the potential effects of climate change on future forest composition. Here we use data for ca. 50,000 tropical seedlings representing 25 woody species to assess (i) the effects of interannual variation in rainfall and solar radiation between 2007 and 2016 on seedling survival over 9 years in a subtropical forest; and (ii) how spatial heterogeneity in three environmental factors-soil moisture, understory light, and conspecific neighborhood density-modulate these responses. Community-wide seedling survival was not sensitive to interannual rainfall variability but interspecific variation in these responses was large, overwhelming the average community response. In contrast, community-wide responses to solar radiation were predominantly positive. Spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture and conspecific density were the predominant and most consistent drivers of seedling survival, with the majority of species exhibiting greater survival at low conspecific densities and positive or nonlinear responses to soil moisture. This environmental heterogeneity modulated impacts of rainfall and solar radiation. Negative conspecific effects were amplified during rainy years and at dry sites, whereas the positive effects of radiation on survival were more pronounced for seedlings existing at high understory light levels. These results demonstrate that environmental heterogeneity is not only the main driver of seedling survival in this forest but also plays a central role in buffering or exacerbating impacts of climate fluctuations on forest regeneration. Since seedlings represent a key bottleneck in the demographic cycle of trees, efforts to predict the long-term effects of a changing climate on tropical forests must take into account this environmental heterogeneity and how its effects on regeneration dynamics play out in long-term stand dynamics.

AB A frequent question in invasion ecology is whether the traits of alien plant species differ from natives. This question is increasingly addressed at the plant community scale to assess the role trait differences play in community assembly. Nevertheless, there remains considerable debate as to the value of native vs. alien trait comparisons. Recommendations are made to address seven conceptual and methodological limitations in current approaches used to assess trait differences between native and alien plants: account for spatial scale dependence, make an informed choice of traits, evaluate multiple trait dimensions, incorporate intraspecific trait variation, use appropriate null models, examine environmental gradients, and assess temporal variation in trait spectra. Tackling these limitations will dramatically improve the value of native vs. alien trait comparisons. Traits should be selected based on expectations of abiotic and/or biotic constraints. Phylogenetic distances can provide valuable insights but are no substitute for the measurement of individual traits when contrasting alien and native species. An ideal set of traits would include one or more leaf, stem, seed and root traits as well as flowering phenology and plant height at maturity. Comparisons of intraspecific trait variation among native and alien species within the same plant community are rare but could improve predictions of interspecific competition and the response of communities to plant invasions. The full plant community should be examined rather than selected species subsets and comparisons between native and alien species traits are better undertaken at a neighbourhood scale. The frequency distribution of alien and native species traits may change over time through competitive exclusion as well as contemporary evolution. Repeated surveys of species abundances and traits are required to understand the consequences of trait differences between aliens and natives for plant community assembly. Analyses of the role of species traits in plant invasions need to quantify differences in a priori identified traits within communities along suitable environmental gradients and test hypothetical trait patterns against appropriate null expectations. The infrequent application of such approaches may explain the limited generalisations regarding the role of trait differences between native and alien species in the invasion of plant communities.

AB This study aims to quantify the landscape spatio-temporal dynamics including Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes occurred in a typical Mediterranean ecosystem of high ecological and cultural significance in central Greece covering a period of 9years (2001-2009). Herein, we examined the synergistic operation among Hyperion hyperspectral satellite imagery with Support Vector Machines, the FRAGSTATS((R)) landscape spatial analysis programme and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for this purpose. The change analysis showed that notable changes reported in the experimental region during the studied period, particularly for certain LULC classes. The analysis of accuracy indices suggested that all the three classification techniques are performing satisfactorily with overall accuracy of 86.62, 91.67 and 89.26% in years 2001, 2004 and 2009, respectively. Results evidenced the requirement for taking measures to conserve this forest-dominated natural ecosystem from human-induced pressures and/or natural hazards occurred in the area. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind, demonstrating the Hyperion capability in quantifying LULC changes with landscape metrics using FRAGSTATS((R)) programme and PCA for understanding the land surface fragmentation characteristics and their changes. The suggested approach is robust and flexible enough to be expanded further to other regions. Findings of this research can be of special importance in the context of the launch of spaceborne hyperspectral sensors that are already planned to be placed in orbit as the NASA's HyspIRI sensor and EnMAP.

AB This article examines the use of economic analysis to inform bioinvasion management, with particular focus on forest resources. Economics is key for understanding invasion processes, impacts, and decision-making. Biological invasions are driven by and affect economic activities at multiple scales and stages of an invasion. Bioeconomic modeling seeks to inform how resources can be optimally allocated across invasion management activities-including prevention, surveillance programs for early detection and management, and controlling invasion populations and spread-to minimize the long-term costs and damages. Economic analysis facilitates understanding of decisions by public and private decision-makers, gaps between these, and the design of policies to achieve socially desirable outcomes. Private decision-makers may undercontrol invasions relative to socially optimal levels, because they generally account for their own costs and benefits of control but less often for broader ecosystem impacts or future spread across the landscape. Economic analysis considers approaches for increasing private invasion management and evaluates feedbacks between ecological and economic systems that can affect policy outcomes. Future research should continue evaluation and design of control strategies across the biosecurity continuum and across species to enhance cost-effectiveness, better incorporate uncertainty into policy design, increase focus on incentives and behavioral tools to influence private behaviors that affect invasion spread, and incorporate invasive species consideration within broader systems-focused science. In addition, challenges in valuing biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts and the costs and effectiveness of control measures are key data gaps. Greater collaboration between decision-makers and researchers will facilitate development and communication of usable economic research.

AB Maternal stress can prenatally influence offspring phenotypes and there are an increasing number of ecological studies that are bringing to bear biomedical findings to natural systems. This is resulting in a shift from the perspective that maternal stress is unanimously costly, to one in which maternal stress may be beneficial to offspring. However, this adaptive perspective is in its infancy with much progress to still be made in understanding the role of maternal stress in natural systems. Our aim is to emphasize the importance of the ecological and evolutionary context within which adaptive hypotheses of maternal stress can be evaluated. We present five primary research areas where we think future research can make substantial progress: (1) understanding maternal and offspring control mechanisms that modulate exposure between maternal stress and subsequent offspring phenotype response; (2) understanding the dynamic nature of the interaction between mothers and their environment; (3) integrating offspring phenotypic responses and measuring both maternal and offspring fitness outcomes under real-life (either free-living or semi-natural) conditions; (4) empirically testing these fitness outcomes across relevant spatial and temporal environmental contexts (both pre- and postnatal environments); (5) examining the role of maternal stress effects in human-altered environments-i.e., do they limit or enhance fitness. To make progress, it is critical to understand the role of maternal stress in an ecological context and to do that, we must integrate across physiology, behavior, genetics, and evolution.

AB Background: The merging of two diverged genomes can result in hybrid offspring that phenotypically differ greatly from both parents. In plants, interspecific hybridization plays important roles in evolution and speciation. In addition, many agricultural and horticultural species are derived from interspecific hybridization. However, the detailed mechanisms responsible for non-additive phenotypic novelty in hybrids remain elusive.
   Results: In an interspecific hybrid between Arabidopsis thaliana and A. lyrata, the vast majority of genes that become upregulated or downregulated relative to the parents originate from A. thaliana. Among all differentially expressed A. thaliana genes, the majority is downregulated in the hybrid. To understand why parental origin affects gene expression in this system, we compare chromatin packing patterns and epigenomic landscapes in the hybrid and parents. We find that the chromatin of A. thaliana, but not that of A. lyrata, becomes more compact in the hybrid. Parental patterns of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 deposition are mostly unaltered in the hybrid, with the exception of higher CHH DNA methylation in transposon-rich regions. However, A. thaliana genes enriched for the H3K27me3 mark are particularly likely to differ in expression between the hybrid and parent.
   Conclusions: It has long been suspected that genome-scale properties cause the differential responses of genes from one or the other parent to hybridization. Our work links global chromatin compactness and H3K27me3 histone modification to global differences in gene expression in an interspecific Arabidopsis hybrid.

AB Recent studies found major conflicts between traditional taxonomy and genetic differentiation of grass snakes and identified previously unknown secondary contact zones. Until now, little is known about gene flow across these contact zones. Using two mitochondrial markers and 13 microsatellite loci, we examined two contact zones. One, largely corresponding to the Rhine region, involves the western subspecies Natrix natrix helvetica and the eastern subspecies N. n. natrix, whereas in the other, more easterly, contact zone two lineages meet that are currently identified with N. n. natrix and N. n. persa. This second contact zone runs across Central Europe to the southern Balkans. Our analyses reveal that the western contact zone is narrow, with parapatrically distributed mitochondrial lineages and limited, largely unidirectional nuclear gene flow. In contrast, the eastern contact zone is very wide, with massive nuclear admixture and broadly overlapping mitochondrial lineages. In combination with additional lines of evidence (morphology, phylogeny, divergence times), we conclude that these differences reflect different stages in the speciation process and that Natrix helvetica should be regarded as a distinct species. We suggest a nomenclatural framework for presently recognized grass snake taxa and highlight the need for reconciling the conflicts between genetics and taxonomy.

AB In birds, accumulating energy is far slower than spending energy during flight. During migration, birds spend, therefore, most of the time at stopover refueling energy used during the previous flight. This elucidates why current energy stores and actual rate of accumulating energy are likely crucial factors influencing bird's decision when to resume migration in addition to other intrinsic (sex, age) and extrinsic (predation, weather) factors modulating the decision within the innate migration program. After first summarizing how energy stores and stopover durations are generally determined, we critically review that high-energy stores and low rates of accumulating energy were significantly related to high departure probabilities in several bird groups. There are, however, also many studies showing no effect at all. Recent radio-tracking studies highlighted that migrants leave a site either to resume migration or to search for a better stopover location, so-called "landscape movements". Erroneously treating such movements as departures increases the likelihood of type II errors which might mistakenly suggest no effect of either trait on departure. Furthermore, we propose that energy loss during the previous migratory flight in relation to bird's current energy stores and migration strategy significantly affects its urge to refuel and hence its departure decision.

AB 1. Demography and conservation status of many wild organisms are increasingly shaped by interactions with humans. This is particularly the case for large, wide-ranging carnivores.
   2. Using 206 mortality records (1999-2012) of lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we calculated mortality rates for each source of anthropogenic mortality, modelled risk of anthropogenic mortality across the landscape accounting for time lions spent in different parts of the landscape, and assessed whether subsets of the population were more at risk.
   3. Anthropogenic activities caused 88% of male and 67% of female mortalities; male mortality being dominated by trophy hunting while the sources for female mortality were more varied (bycatch snaring, retaliatory killing, hunting).
   4. Landscapes of anthropogenic mortality risk revealed that communal subsistence farming areas, characterized by high risk (due to retaliatory killing) but avoided by lions, are population sinks. Trophy hunting areas and areas within protected areas bordering communal farmland, where bushmeat snaring is prevalent, form 'ecological traps' (or 'attractive sinks').
   5. Lions avoided risky areas, suggesting they may make behavioural decisions based on perceptions of risk. Experienced adults used risky areas less and incorporated lower proportions of them in their home ranges than young individuals, suggesting that the latter may either be naive or forced into peripheral habitats.
   6. Synthesis and applications. This paper contributes to an understanding of how large carnivore populations are affected by anthropogenic mortality across the conservation landscape. This is critical to designing focussed, appropriate and cost-effective conservation management strategies. Agricultural areas are intuitively identified by conservationists as being risky for carnivores due to retaliatory killing, with threats largely mitigated against by improving livestock protection. However, parts of protected areas may also form less easily identified 'attractive sinks' for carnivores. In particular, trophy hunting areas adjacent to national parks need careful management to avoid damaging effects of overhunting. Law enforcement is needed to reduce the effects of bushmeat poaching on predators and other wildlife in protected areas. To be most effective, resource-limited antipoaching activities should prioritize wildlife-rich areas close to human settlement as these tend to be hot spots for bushmeat poaching.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides have come under increasing scrutiny for their impact on non-target organisms, especially pollinators. The current scientific literature is mainly focused on the impact of these insecticides on pollinators and some aquatic insects, leaving a knowledge gap concerning soil invertebrates. This study aimed at filling this gap, by determining the toxicity of imidacloprid and thiacloprid to five species of soil invertebrates: earthworms (Eisenia andrei), enchytraeids (Enchytraeus crypticus), Collembola (Folsomia candida), oribatid mites (Oppia nitens) and isopods (Porcellio scaber). Tests focused on survival and reproduction or growth, after 3-5 weeks exposure in natural LUFA 2.2 standard soil. Imidacloprid was more toxic than thiacloprid for all species tested. F. candida and E. andrei were the most sensitive species, with LC(50)s of 0.20-0.62 and 0.77 mg/kg dry soil for imidacloprid and 2.7-3.9 and 7.1 mg/kg dry soil for thiacloprid. EC(50)s for effects on the reproduction of F. candida and E. andrei were 0.097-0.30 and 0.39 mg/kg dry soil for imidacloprid and 1.7-2.4 and 0.44 mg/kg dry soil for thiacloprid. The least sensitive species were O. nitens and P. scaber. Enchytraeids were a factor of 5-40 less sensitive than the taxonomically related earthworm, depending on the endpoint considered. Although not all the species showed high sensitivity to the neonicotinoids tested, these results raise awareness about the effects these insecticides can have on non-target soil invertebrates.

AB Historical trajectories of tree species during the late Quaternary have been well reconstructed through genetic and palaeobotanical studies. However, many congeneric tree species are interfertile, and the timing and contribution of introgression to species divergence during their evolutionary history remains largely unknown.
   We quantified past and current gene flow events between four morphologically divergent oak species (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Q. pyrenaica, Q. pubescens), by two independent inference methods: diffusion approximation to the joint frequency spectrum (partial derivative a partial derivative i) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). For each pair of species, alternative scenarios of speciation allowing gene flow over different timescales were evaluated.
   Analyses of 3524 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) randomly distributed in the genome, showed that these species evolved in complete isolation for most of their history, but recently came into secondary contact, probably facilitated by the most recent period of postglacial warming.
   We demonstrated that: there was sufficient genetic differentiation before secondary contact for the accumulation of barriers to gene flow; and current European white oak genomes are a mosaic of genes that have crossed species boundaries and genes impermeable to gene flow.

AB To explain diversity in forests, niche theory must show how multiple plant species coexist while competing for the same resources. Although successional processes are widespread in forests, theoretical work has suggested that differentiation in successional strategy allows only a few species stably to coexist, including only a single shade tolerant. However, this conclusion is based on current niche models, which encode a very simplified view of plant communities, suggesting that the potential for niche differentiation has remained unexplored. Here, we show how extending successional niche models to include features common to all vegetation-height-structured competition for light under a prevailing disturbance regime and two trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function-enhances the diversity of species that can be maintained, including a diversity of shade tolerants. We identify two distinct axes of potential niche differentiation, corresponding to the traits leaf mass per unit leaf area and height at maturation. The first axis allows for coexistence of different shade tolerances and the second axis for coexistence among species with the same shade tolerance. Addition of this second axis leads to communities with a high diversity of shade tolerants. Niche differentiation along the second axis also generates regions of trait space wherein fitness is almost equalized, an outcome we term "evolutionarily emergent near-neutrality." For different environmental conditions, our model predicts diverse vegetation types and trait mixtures, akin to observations. These results indicate that the outcomes of successional niche differentiation are richer than previously thought and potentially account for mixtures of traits and species observed in forests worldwide.

AB Predation is an interaction during which an organism kills and feeds on another organism. Past and current interest in studying predation in terrestrial habitats has yielded a number of methods to assess invertebrate predation events in terrestrial ecosystems. We provide a decision tree to select appropriate methods for individual studies. For each method, we then present a short introduction, key examples for applications, advantages and disadvantages, and an outlook to future refinements. Video and, to a lesser extent, live observations are recommended in studies that address behavioral aspects of predator-prey interactions or focus on per capita predation rates. Cage studies are only appropriate for small predator species, but often suffer from a bias via cage effects. The use of prey baits or analyses of prey remains are cheaper than other methods and have the potential to provide per capita predation estimates. These advantages often come at the cost of low taxonomic specificity. Molecular methods provide reliable estimates at a fine level of taxonomic resolution and are free of observer bias for predator species of any size. However, the current PCR-based methods lack the ability to estimate predation rates for individual predators and are more expensive than other methods. Molecular and stable isotope analyses are best suited to address systems that include a range of predator and prey species. Our review of methods strongly suggests that while in many cases individual methods are sufficient to study specific questions, combinations of methods hold a high potential to provide more holistic insights into predation events. This review presents an overview of methods to researchers that are new to the field or to particular aspects of predation ecology and provides recommendations toward the subset of suitable methods to identify the prey of invertebrate predators in terrestrial field research.

AB Fire is a key factor impacting soil hydrology in many Mediterranean catchments. Soil water repellency (SWR) can stimulate land degradation processes by reducing the affinity of soil and water thereby triggering a reduction in soil fertility and increasing soil and water losses. The effects of two consequent fires (1989 and 2005) on SWR were assessed in the Carmel Mountains, Israel. Fire history, plant recovery and post-fire management (14 treatments) were investigated as determining factors in a time dependent system. In total 210 locations were investigated 9 times from October 2011 to February 2012, which totals 1890 water drop penetration tests that were performed. During each visit to the field (9 times) a soil moisture content was measured for each treatment. SWR was highest in the >50 years unburnt plots, where soil under Pinus halepensis is most hydrophobic. In the most disturbed soils (twice burnt), many sites have a low to absent SWR even if the soil is very dry. The dynamics and fluctuations in SWR differ in magnitude under different plant species. The areas treated with CC (chipping of charred trees) showed a much higher SWR than areas left untreated. From these insights, a conceptual model of the reaction. of SWR on multiple fires was developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The interplay of ecology and evolution has been a rich area of research for decades. A surge of interest in this area was catalyzed by the observation that evolution by natural selection can operate at the same contemporary timescales as ecological dynamics. Specifically, recent eco-evolutionary research focuses on how rapid adaptation influences ecology, and vice versa. Evolution by non adaptive forces also occurs quickly, with ecological consequences, but understanding the full scope of ecology-evolution (eco-evo) interactions requires explicitly addressing population-level processes - genetic and demographic. We show the strong ecological effects of non-adaptive evolutionary forces and, more broadly, the value of population-level research for gaining a mechanistic understanding of eco-evo interactions. The breadth of eco-evolutionary research should expand to incorporate the breadth of evolution itself.

AB The highly invasive spotted wing Drosophila Drosophila suzukii is a key pest of soft fruit and berries in Europe and North America, and development of control techniques is an urgent research challenge. Drosophila suzukii is widely associated with the yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum. Yeasts are symbionts of drosophilid flies and communicate with insects through volatile metabolites for spore dispersal. Accordingly, yeasts and behaviour-modifying chemicals produced by yeasts are prospective tools for environmentally sound insect management. We first bioassayed flight attraction, feeding and oviposition of D.suzukii females in response to H.uvarum yeast and blueberries, which are a preferred host fruit. We then investigated the combined effect of yeast and insecticide on adult female oviposition behaviour and mortality towards the development of a yeast-based control method. Following mating, attraction of female flies to blueberry and yeast odour cues was strongly enhanced. Yeast feeding significantly increased in mated females, while yeast did not increase oviposition on blueberries. This observation suggests that mated flies become attracted to yeast for feeding and to fruit for egg laying. A combined feeding-oviposition assay demonstrated different roles and interference between yeast and fruit stimuli: during the day after mating, females laid fewer eggs when yeast was available. The post-mating yeast-feeding response is an opportunity for the development of an attract-and-kill technique for population control of D.suzukii. Exposing flies to a blend of yeast and insecticide reduced oviposition and greatly enhanced adult fly mortality compared with an insecticide treatment alone.Synthesis and applications. Mated females are the key life stage for Drosophila suzukii population control. Egg-laying females perforate fruit skin and fungal infestations ensue, even when eggs and larvae are killed off by insecticide sprays. Behaviour-modifying chemicals, including yeast metabolites, enable environmentally safe insect management via manipulation of olfactory-mediated reproductive behaviour. Our results highlight that yeast and yeast semiochemicals hold potential for D.suzukii management and that response modulation to olfactory stimuli following mating is a vital element for the development of D.suzukii control methods. Yeast feeding is enhanced in mated D.suzukii females, and this change in post-mating behaviour can be exploited by an attract-and-kill strategy, combining a fly-associated yeast with an insecticide. Furthermore, using the D.suzukii yeast mutualist, H.uvarum, may reduce non-target effects and increase species specificity, which further contributes to the development of an efficient and safe control method.

AB Understanding how ecological and evolutionary processes interdependently structure biosphere dynamics is a major challenge in the era of worldwide ecosystem degradation. However, our knowledge of 'eco-evolutionary feedbacks' depends largely on findings from simple systems representing limited spatial scales and involving few species. Here we review recent conceptual developments for the understanding of multispecies coevolutionary processes and then discuss how new lines of concepts and methods will accelerate the integration of ecology and evolutionary biology. To build a research workflow for integrating insights into spatiotemporal dynamics of species-rich systems, we focus on the roles of 'metacommunity hub' species, whose population size and/or genetic dynamics potentially control landscape- or regional-scale phenomena. As large amounts of network data are becoming available with high-throughput sequencing of various host-symbiont, prey-predator, and symbiont-symbiont interactions, we suggest it is now possible to develop bases for the integrated understanding and management of species-rich ecosystems.

AB Many democratic governments recognize a duty to conserve environmental resources, including wild animals, as a public trust for current and future citizens. These public trust principles have informed two centuries of U.S.A. Supreme Court decisions and environmental laws worldwide. Nevertheless numerous populations of large-bodied, mammalian carnivores (predators) were eradicated in the 20th century. Environmental movements and strict legal protections have fostered predator recoveries across the U.S.A. and Europe since the 1970s. Now subnational jurisdictions are regaining management authority from central governments for their predator subpopulations. Will the history of local eradication repeat or will these jurisdictions adopt public trust thinking and their obligation to broad public interests over narrower ones? We review the role of public trust principles in the restoration and preservation of controversial species. In so doing we argue for the essential roles of scientists from many disciplines concerned with biological diversity and its conservation. We look beyond species endangerment to future generations' interests in sustainability, particularly non-consumptive uses. Although our conclusions apply to all wild organisms, we focus on predators because of the particular challenges they pose for government trustees, trust managers, and society. Gray wolves Canis lupus L. deserve particular attention, because detailed information and abundant policy debates across regions have exposed four important challenges for preserving predators in the face of interest group hostility. One challenge is uncertainty and varied interpretations about public trustees' responsibilities for wildlife, which have created a mosaic of policies across jurisdictions. We explore how such mosaics have merits and drawbacks for biodiversity. The other three challenges to conserving wildlife as public trust assets are illuminated by the biology of predators and the interacting behavioural ecologies of humans and predators. The scientific community has not reached consensus on sustainable levels of human-caused mortality for many predator populations. This challenge includes both genuine conceptual uncertainty and exploitation of scientific debate for political gain. Second, human intolerance for predators exposes value conflicts about preferences for some wildlife over others and balancing majority rule with the protection of minorities in a democracy. We examine how differences between traditional assumptions and scientific studies of interactions between people and predators impede evidence-based policy. Even if the prior challenges can be overcome, well-reasoned policy on wild animals faces a greater challenge than other environmental assets because animals and humans change behaviour in response to each other in the short term. These coupled, dynamic responses exacerbate clashes between uses that deplete wildlife and uses that enhance or preserve wildlife. Viewed in this way, environmental assets demand sophisticated, careful accounting by disinterested trustees who can both understand the multidisciplinary scientific measurements of relative costs and benefits among competing uses, and justly balance the needs of all beneficiaries including future generations. Without public trust principles, future trustees will seldom prevail against narrow, powerful, and undemocratic interests. Without conservation informed by public trust thinking predator populations will face repeated cycles of eradication and recovery.
   Our conclusions have implications for the many subfields of the biological sciences that address environmental trust assets from the atmosphere to aquifers.

AB Synthetic fertilizers and raw or composted livestock manure are typical nitrogen (N) sources in intensive cropping and livestock-farming systems. The distinct N isotope ratios (N-15/N-14 expressed as delta N-15) of the N sources make it possible to use the delta N-15 of soil, plant and groundwater samples to trace the N derived from the two N sources in the agricultural landscape. However, N isotope fractionation during N cycling may hamper the usefulness of the delta N-15 technique for tracing N. This paper reviews the changes in the delta N-15 of soil, plant and groundwater samples in the agricultural landscape as affected by synthetic fertilizer and raw or composted manure applications with consideration of the effect of N source and N fractionation during N cycling on variations in SIN. First, this review summarizes the fundamental N isotope fractionation theory with an emphasis on the critical role of nitrifitation in changing delta N-15 through N loss. Second, the differences in the delta N-15 of synthetic fertilizer and raw or composted manure are discussed with an emphasis on mechanisms that increase delta N-15 in raw or composted manure. Third, the effects of synthetic fertilizer and raw or composted manure applications on the variations of delta N-15 in soil, plant and groundwater samples across different scales of experiments from laboratory to watershed are discussed. We conclude that in spite of N isotope fractionation, the feasibility of the delta N-15 technique in tracing N originated from synthetic fertilizer and raw or composted manure in soil, plant and groundwater in the agricultural landscape can be strengthened when site-specific information on the delta N-15 of N sources as well as the dominant N processes is available.

AB Climatic warming is a primary driver of change in ecosystems worldwide. Here, we synthesize responses of species richness and evenness from 187 experimental warming studies in a quantitative meta-analysis. We asked 1) whether effects of warming on diversity were detectable and consistent across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, 2) if effects on diversity correlated with intensity, duration, and experimental unit size of temperature change manipulations, and 3) whether these experimental effects on diversity interacted with ecosystem types. Using multilevel mixed linear models and model averaging, we also tested the relative importance of variables that described uncontrolled environmental variation and attributes of experimental units. Overall, experimental warming reduced richness across ecosystems (mean log-response ratio = -0.091, 95% bootstrapped CI: -0.13, -0.05) representing an 8.9% decline relative to ambient temperature treatments. Richness did not change in response to warming in freshwater systems, but was more strongly negative in terrestrial (-11.8%) and marine (-10.5%) experiments. In contrast, warming impacts on evenness were neutral overall and in aquatic systems, but weakly negative on land (7.6%). Intensity and duration of experimental warming did not explain variation in diversity responses, but negative effects on richness were stronger in smaller experimental units, particularly in marine systems. Model-averaged parameter estimation confirmed these main effects while accounting for variation in latitude, ambient temperature at the sites of manipulations, venue (field versus lab), community trophic type, and whether experiments were open or closed to colonization. These analyses synthesize extensive experimental evidence showing declines in local richness with increased temperature, particularly in terrestrial and marine communities. However, the more variable effects of warming on evenness were better explained by the random effect of site identity, suggesting that effects on species' relative abundances were contingent on local species composition.

AB Questions: Mechanisms of community assembly are increasingly explored by combining community and species trait data with null models. By investigating if the traits of co-existing species are more similar (trait convergence) or more dissimilar (trait divergence) than expected by chance, these tests relate observed patterns to different co-existence mechanisms. Do null models accurately detect trait convergence and divergence? Are different null models equally good at detecting these two opposing patterns? How important are the species pool and other constraints that are considered by different null models?
   Methods: We applied ten common randomizations to communities that were simulated in a process-based model.
   Results: Null models good at detecting biotic processes differed from those null models that revealed abiotic processes. In particular, limiting similarity (detected through divergence) was better detected by randomizations that release the link between species abundance and trait values, whereas environmental filtering (detected through convergence of an environmental response trait) was identified by randomizations that keep this link. In general, using species abundance data provided better results than using presence-absence data, particularly within given limited environmental conditions. Weaker competitor exclusion (detected through convergence of a competition-related trait) was only detected when no environmental filtering was acting on the simulated assembly, which points to difficulties in disentangling biotic and abiotic convergence in natural communities, especially when data are randomized across habitats.
   Conclusions: Overall the results manifest the importance of the pool of species over which randomizations are applied; in particular whether randomizations are conducted across or within given habitats. Taken together, our findings show that different null models must be combined and applied to a carefully chosen pool of species and species abundance data to ensure that co-existence mechanisms can be properly assessed. We utilize the results to (1) discuss how different constraints implied in the different null models affect the outcomes of our tests, and (2) provide some basic recommendations on how to choose null models, given the data available and questions being asked.

AB Hydropower plants are an important source of renewable energy. In the near future, high-head storage hydropower plants will gain further importance as a key element of large-scale electricity production systems. However, these power plants can cause hydropeaking which is characterized by intense unnatural discharge fluctuations in downstream river reaches. Consequences on environmental conditions in these sections are diverse and include changes to the hydrology, hydraulics and sediment regime on very short time scales. These altered conditions affect river ecosystems and biota, for instance due to drift and stranding of fishes and invertebrates. Several structural and operational measures exist to mitigate hydropeaking and the adverse effects on ecosystems, but estimating and predicting their ecological benefit remains challenging. We developed a conceptual framework to support the ecological evaluation of hydropeaking mitigation measures based on current mitigation projects in Switzerland and the scientific literature. We refined this framework with an international panel of hydropeaking experts. The framework is based on a set of indicators, which covers all hydrological phases of hydropeaking and the most important affected abiotic and biotic processes. Effects of mitigation measures on these indicators can be predicted quantitatively using prediction tools such as discharge scenarios and numerical habitat models. Our framework allows a comparison of hydropeaking effects among alternative mitigation measures, to the pre-mitigation situation, and to reference river sections. We further identified key issues that should be addressed to increase the efficiency of current and future projects. They include the spatial and temporal context of mitigation projects, the interactions of river morphology with hydropeaking effects, and the role of appropriate monitoring to evaluate the success of mitigation projects.

AB Technological innovations have led to exciting fast-moving developments in science. Today, we are living in a technology-driven era of biological discovery. Consequently, tracking technologies have facilitated dramatic advances in the fundamental understanding of ecology and animal behaviour. Major technological improvements, such as the development of GPS dataloggers, geolocators and other bio-logging technologies, provide a volume of data that were hitherto unconceivable. Hence we can claim that ornithology has entered the era of big data. In this paper, which is particularly addressed to undergraduate students and starting researchers in the emerging field of movement ecology, I summarise the current state of the art of individual-based tracking methods for birds as well as the most important challenges that, as a personal user, I consider we should address in future. To this end, I first provide a brief overview of individual tracking systems for birds. I then discuss current challenges for tracking birds with remote telemetry, including technological challenges (i.e., tag miniaturisation, incorporation of more bio-logging sensors, better efficiency in data archiving and data processing), as well as scientific challenges (i.e., development of new computational tools, investigation of spatial and temporal autocorrelation of data, improvement in environmental data annotation processes, the need for novel behavioural segmentation algorithms, the change from two to three, and even four, dimensions in the scale of analysis, and the inclusion of animal interactions). I also highlight future prospects of this research field including a set of scientific questions that have been answered by means of telemetry technologies or are expected to be answered in the future. Finally, I discuss some ethical aspects of bird tracking, putting special emphases on getting the most out of data and enhancing a culture of multidisciplinary collaboration among research groups.

AB Accurately quantifying cropland gross primary production (GPP) is of great importance to monitor cropland status and carbon budgets. Satellite-based light-use efficiency (LUE) models and process-based terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) have been widely used to quantify cropland GPP at different scales in past decades. However, model estimates of GPP are still subject to large uncertainties, especially for croplands. More recently, space-borne solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has shown the ability to monitor photosynthesis from space, providing new insights into actual photosynthesis monitoring. In this study, we examined the potential of SIF data to describe maize phenology and evaluated three GPP modeling approaches (space-borne SIF retrievals, a LUE-based vegetation photosynthesis model [VPM], and a process-based soil canopy observation of photochemistry and energy flux [SCOPE] model constrained by SIF) at a maize (Zea mays L.) site in Mead, Nebraska, USA. The result shows that SIF captured the seasonal variations (particularly during the early and late growing season) of tower-derived GPP (GPP_EC) much better than did satellite-based vegetation indices (enhanced vegetation index [EVI] and land surface water index [LSWI]). Consequently, SIF was strongly correlated with GPP_EC than were EVI and LSWI. Evaluation of GPP estimates against GPP_EC during the growing season demonstrated that all three modeling approaches provided reasonable estimates of maize GPP, with Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) of 0.97, 0.94, and 0.93 for the SCOPE, VPM, and SIF models, respectively. The SCOPE model provided the best simulation of maize GPP when SIF observations were incorporated through optimizing the key parameter of maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax). Our results illustrate the potential of SIF data to offer an additional way to investigate the seasonality of photosynthetic activity, to constrain process-based models for improving GPP estimates, and to reasonably estimate GPP by integrating SIF and GPP_EC data without dependency on climate inputs and satellite-based vegetation indices.

   EVOLUTIONARY; COMPUTATION; HISTORIES; MODEL
AB The multispecies coalescent (MSC) is a statistical framework that models how gene genealogies grow within the branches of a species tree. The field of computational phylogenetics has witnessed an explosion in the development of methods for species tree inference under MSC, owing mainly to the accumulating evidence of incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenomic analyses. However, the evolutionary history of a set of genomes, or species, could be reticulate due to the occurrence of evolutionary processes such as hybridization or horizontal gene transfer. We report on a novel method for Bayesian inference of genome and species phylogenies under the multispecies network coalescent (MSNC). This framework models gene evolution within the branches of a phylogenetic network, thus incorporating reticulate evolutionary processes, such as hybridization, in addition to incomplete lineage sorting. As phylogenetic networks with different numbers of reticulation events correspond to points of different dimensions in the space of models, we devise a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) technique for sampling the posterior distribution of phylogenetic networks under MSNC. We implemented the methods in the publicly available, open-source software package PhyloNet and studied their performance on simulated and biological data. The work extends the reach of Bayesian inference to phylogenetic networks and enables new evolutionary analyses that account for reticulation.

AB All organisms live in temporally fluctuating environments. Theory predicts that the evolution of deterministic maternal effects (i.e., anticipatory maternal effects or transgenerational phenotypic plasticity) underlies adaptation to environments that fluctuate in a predictably alternating fashion over maternal-offspring generations. In contrast, randomizing maternal effects (i.e., diversifying and conservative bet-hedging), are expected to evolve in response to unpredictably fluctuating environments. Although maternal effects are common, evidence for their adaptive significance is equivocal since they can easily evolve as a correlated response to maternal selection and may or may not increase the future fitness of offspring. Using the hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we here show that the experimental evolution of maternal glycogen provisioning underlies adaptation to a fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching environment by increasing embryo survival under anoxia. In strictly alternating environments, we found that hermaphrodites evolved the ability to increase embryo glycogen provisioning when they experienced normoxia and to decrease embryo glycogen provisioning when they experienced anoxia. At odds with existing theory, however, populations facing irregularly fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching environments failed to evolve randomizing maternal effects. Instead, adaptation in these populations may have occurred through the evolution of fitness effects that percolate over multiple generations, as they maintained considerably high expected growth rates during experimental evolution despite evolving reduced fecundity and reduced embryo survival under one or two generations of anoxia. We develop theoretical models that explain why adaptation to a wide range of patterns of environmental fluctuations hinges on the existence of deterministic maternal effects, and that such deterministic maternal effects are more likely to contribute to adaptation than randomizing maternal effects.

AB Intraspecies differences are fundamental to natural selection, yet individual differences in cognition in free-living populations have received little attention. Proactive and reactive coping styles describe individual differences in personality and related stress physiology; however, the coping style model can be extended to include predictions regarding measures of cognition. We compared two measures of personality (neophobia and exploratory behaviour) included in the coping style model to cognitive performance on colour-based associative and reversal learning tests in adult Florida scrub-jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens. Also, as exogenous glucocorticoid treatment can affect cognitive performance, we examined whether an individual's naturally occurring physiological phenotype, reflected by corticosterone measures obtained during development and at the time of the learning tests, covaried with learning performance. Performance on associative and reversal learning tests were inversely related. Scrub-jays with low levels of corticosterone as 11-day-old nestlings performed better on an associative learning test as adults, and there was a marginally nonsignificant trend for nestlings with high levels of corticosterone to perform better on a reversal learning test. There was also a marginally nonsignificant trend for neophobic birds to perform better on reversal learning tests. There were no relationships either between adult stress-induced corticosterone levels and learning, or between exploratory behaviour and learning. Our findings provide evidence that variation in sensitivity to environmental conditions, as reflected by an individual's coping style, underlie the specific strategy by which individuals perform cognitive tasks (i.e. cognitive style). Florida scrub-jays experience a trade-off in performance between types of learning that covary with early corticosterone exposure. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Heterogeneous genomic divergence between populations may reflect selection, but should also be seen in conjunction with gene flow and drift, particularly population bottlenecks. Marine and freshwater three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) populations often exhibit different lateral armour plate morphs. Moreover, strikingly parallel genomic footprints across different marine-freshwater population pairs are interpreted as parallel evolution and gene reuse. Nevertheless, in some geographic regions like the North Sea and Baltic Sea, different patterns are observed. Freshwater populations in coastal regions are often dominated by marine morphs, suggesting that gene flow overwhelms selection, and genomic parallelism may also be less pronounced. We used RAD sequencing for analysing 28888 SNPs in two marine and seven freshwater populations in Denmark, Europe. Freshwater populations represented a variety of environments: river populations accessible to gene flow from marine sticklebacks and large and small isolated lakes with and without fish predators. Sticklebacks in an accessible river environment showed minimal morphological and genomewide divergence from marine populations, supporting the hypothesis of gene flow overriding selection. Allele frequency spectra suggested bottlenecks in all freshwater populations, and particularly two small lake populations. However, genomic footprints ascribed to selection could nevertheless be identified. No genomic regions were consistent freshwater-marine outliers, and parallelism was much lower than in other comparable studies. Two genomic regions previously described to be under divergent selection in freshwater and marine populations were outliers between different freshwater populations. We ascribe these patterns to stronger environmental heterogeneity among freshwater populations in our study as compared to most other studies, although the demographic history involving bottlenecks should also be considered in the interpretation of results.

AB We applied logistic regression and Random Forest to evaluate drivers of fire occurrence on a provincial scale. Potential driving factors were divided into two groups according to scale of influence: 'climate factors', which operate on a regional scale, and 'local factors', which includes infrastructure, vegetation, topographic and socioeconomic data. The groups of factors were analysed separately and then significant factors from both groups were analysed together. Both models identified significant driving factors, which were ranked in terms of relative importance. Results show that climate factors are the main drivers of fire occurrence in the forests of Fujian, China. Particularly, sunshine hours, relative humidity (fire seasonal and daily), precipitation (fire season) and temperature (fire seasonal and daily) were seen to play a crucial role in fire ignition. Of the local factors, elevation, distance to railway and per capita GDP were found to be most significant. Random Forest demonstrated a higher predictive ability than logistic regression across all groups of factors (climate, local, and climate and local combined). Maps of the likelihood of fire occurrence in Fujian illustrate that the high fire-risk zones are distributed across administrative divisions; consequently, fire management strategies should be devised based on fire-risk zones, rather than on separate administrative divisions.

AB Biological monitoring has a long history in freshwaters, where much of the pioneering work in this field was developed over a 100 years ago-but few of the traditional monitoring tools provide the global perspective on biodiversity loss and its consequences for ecosystem functioning that are now needed. Rather than forcing existing monitoring paradigms to respond to questions they were never originally designed to address, we need to take a step back and assess the prospects for novel approaches that could be developed and adopted in the future. To resolve some of the issues with indicators currently used to inform policymakers, we highlight new biological monitoring tools that are being used, or could be developed in the near future, which (1) consider less-studied taxonomic groups, (2) are standardised across regions to allow global comparisons, and (3) measure change over multiple time points. The new tools we suggest make use of some of the key technological and logistical advances seen in recent years-including remote sensing, molecular tools, and local-to-global citizen science networks. We recommend that these new indicators should be considered in future assessments of freshwater ecosystem health and contribute to the evidence base for global to regional (and national) assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services: for example, within the emerging framework of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.

AB Anthropogenic noise affects the behavior of a variety of animal taxa around the world. In many taxa, minimum frequencies of acoustic signals increase with ambient noise levels, and males and females respond less strongly to these adjusted signals. Lower response may be due to higher minimum frequencies or to the associated decrease in frequency bandwidth. There is a performance challenge to producing notes rapidly at a wide bandwidth, and any reduction in bandwidth necessarily reduces the performance value. This measure of vocal performance is a trait under sexual selection in many taxa. We investigated the relationship between anthropogenic noise amplitude and male white-crowned sparrow vocal performance in San Francisco, CA. Males on louder territories produced songs at higher minimum frequencies but also with reduced bandwidth and lower vocal performance. These results suggest that behavioral adjustments to anthropogenic noise reduce vocal performance of songs. We conducted playback experiments to test if lower responses to urban songs are due to higher minimum frequencies or to narrower bandwidths. Males responded more strongly to normal than to reduced bandwidth songs, but equally to high-and low-pass filtered songs. Our results therefore suggest that reduced bandwidth and performance-not higher minimum frequency-could be the reason that urban birds are less responsive to songs adjusted for anthropogenic noise. Ultimately, the lower vocal performance of birds on territories with high levels of anthropogenic noise could result in fewer mating opportunities and more challenges in defending their territory.

AB The family Orchidaceae is not only one of the most diverse families of flowering plants, but also one of the most endangered plant taxa. Therefore, understanding how its species richness varies along geographical and environmental gradients is essential for conservation efforts. However, such knowledge is rarely available, especially on a large scale. We used a database extracted from herbarium records to investigate the relationships between orchid species richness and elevation, and to examine how elevational diversity in Yunnan Province, China, might be explained by mid-domain effect (MDE), species-area relationship (SAR), water-energy dynamics (WED), Rapoport's Rule, and climatic variables. This particular location was selected because it is one of the primary centers of distribution for orchids. We recorded 691 species that span 127 genera and account for 88.59% of all confirmed orchid species in Yunnan. Species richness, estimated at 200-m intervals along a slope, was closely correlated with elevation, peaking at 1395 to 1723 m. The elevational pattern of orchid richness was considerably shaped by MDE, SAR, WED, and climate. Among those four predictors, climate was the strongest while MDE was the weakest for predicting the elevational pattern of orchid richness. Species richness showed parabolic responses to mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP), with maximum richness values recorded at 13.7 to 17.7 degrees C for MAT and 1237 to 1414 mm for MAP. Rapoport's Rule also helped to explain the elevational pattern of species richness in Yunnan, but those influences were not entirely uniform across all methods. These results suggested that the elevational pattern of orchid species richness in Yunnan is collectively shaped by several mechanisms related to geometric constraints, size of the land area, and environments. Because of the dominant role of climate in determining orchid richness, our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the potential effects of climate change on orchid diversity, and the development of conservation strategies for orchids.

AB Research on the physiological causes of senescence aim to identify common physiological mechanisms that explain age-related declines in fitness across taxonomic groups. Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences found on the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Past research indicates that telomere attrition is strongly correlated with inter-specific rates of aging, though these studies cannot distinguish whether telomere attrition is a cause or consequence of the aging process. We extend previous research on this topic by incorporating recent studies to test the hypothesis that telomeres shorten more slowly with age in slow-aging animals than in fast-aging ones. We assembled all studies that have quantified cross-sectional (i.e. between-individual) telomere rates of change (TROC) over the lifespans of wild animals. This included 22 estimates reflecting absolute TROC (TROCabs, bp/yr, primarily measured using the terminal restriction fragment length method), and 10 estimates reflecting relative TROC (TROCrel, relative telomere length/yr, measured using qPCR), from five classes (Aves, Mammalia, Bivalvia, Reptilia, and Actinopterygii). In 14 bird species, we correlated between-individual (i.e. cross-sectional) TROCabs estimates with both maximum lifespan and a phylogenetically-corrected principle component axis (pcPC1) that reflected the slow-fast axis of life-history variation. Bird species characterized by faster life-histories and shorter maximum lifespans had faster TROCabs. In nine studies, both between individual and within-individual TROC estimates were available (n = 8 for TROCabs, n = 1 for TROCrel). Within-individual TROC estimates were generally greater than between-individual TROC estimates, which is indicative of selective disappearance of individuals with shorter telomeres. However, the difference between within-and between-individual TROC estimates was only significant in two out of nine studies. The relationship between within-individual TROCabs and maximum lifespan did not differ from the relationship of between individual TROCabs and maximum lifespan. Overall, our results provide additional support for the hypothesis that TROC is correlated with inter-specific rates of aging and complement the intra-specific research that also find relationships between telomere attrition and components of fitness.

AB 1. Although local variation in territorial predator density is often correlated with habitat quality, the causal mechanism underlying this frequently observed association is poorly understood and could stem from facultative adjustment in either group size or territory size. To test between these alternative hypotheses, we used a novel statistical framework to construct a winter population-level utilization distribution for wolves (Canis lupus) in northern Ontario, which we then linked to a suite of environmental variables to determine factors influencing wolf space use. Next, we compared habitat quality metrics emerging from this analysis as well as an independent measure of prey abundance, with pack size and territory size to investigate which hypothesis was most supported by the data. We show that wolf space use patterns were concentrated near deciduous, mixed deciduous/coniferous and disturbed forest stands favoured by moose (Alces alces), the predominant prey species in the diet of wolves in northern Ontario, and in proximity to linear corridors, including shorelines and road networks remaining from commercial forestry activities. We then demonstrate that landscape metrics of wolf habitat quality - projected wolf use, probability of moose occupancy and proportion of preferred land cover classes - were inversely related to territory size but unrelated to pack size. These results suggest that wolves in boreal ecosystems alter territory size, but not pack size, in response to local variation in habitat quality. This could be an adaptive strategy to balance trade-offs between territorial defence costs and energetic gains due to resource acquisition. That pack size was not responsive to habitat quality suggests that variation in group size is influenced by other factors such as intraspecific competition between wolf packs.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are crucial for vegetation regeneration because they play an important role in plant establishment and growth. We investigated the relationships among AM fungal diversity, plant diversity, and soil properties during vegetation restoration in degraded karst ecosystems. Pyrosequencing approach was used to determine the genetic diversity and composition of AM fungal communities in four typical ecosystems of vegetation restoration (tussock (TK), shrub (SB), secondary forest (SF), and primary forest (PF)) in a karst region of southwest China. The diversity, richness, and evenness of plant species were evaluated through field surveys. Basic soil properties were measured. Plant species diversity and soil nutrient contents increased with vegetation restoration from tussock to primary forest, but the diversity of AM fungi followed the order of shrub approximate to secondary forest approximate to primary forest < tussock. The composition of AM fungi and plant communities differed significantly between ecosystems (p < 0.05). The richness of AM fungi was negatively correlated with both the plant diversity (the indices of plant Shannon-Wiener, evenness and richness) and soil properties (soil available phosphorus (AP), soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH) (p < 0.05). Redundancy analysis showed that the AM fungal communities closely linked to plant richness, soil organic carbon, soil available phosphorus and pH. These results suggest that the diversity and composition of AM fungi in karst region are influenced by plant communities and soil nutrient conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here we show that verrucomicrobial community structure and abundance are extremely sensitive to changes in chemical factors linked to soil fertility. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprint and real-time quantitative PCR assay were used to analyze changes in verrucomicrobial communities associated with contrasting soil nutrient conditions in tropical regions. In case study Model I ("Slash-and-burn deforestation") the verrucomicrobial community structures revealed disparate patterns in nutrient-enriched soils after slash-and-burn deforestation and natural nutrient-poor soils under an adjacent primary forest in the Amazonia (R = 0.819, P = 0.002). The relative proportion of Verrucomicrobia declined in response to increased soil fertility after slash-and-burn deforestation, accounting on average, for 4 and 2 % of the total bacterial signal, in natural nutrient-poor forest soils and nutrient-enriched deforested soils, respectively. In case study Model II ("Management practices for sugarcane") disparate patterns were revealed in sugarcane rhizosphere sampled on optimal and deficient soil fertility for sugarcane (R = 0.786, P = 0.002). Verrucomicrobial community abundance in sugarcane rhizosphere was negatively correlated with soil fertility, accounting for 2 and 5 % of the total bacterial signal, under optimal and deficient soil fertility conditions for sugarcane, respectively. In nutrient-enriched soils, verrucomicrobial community structures were related to soil factors linked to soil fertility, such as total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sum of bases, i.e., the sum of calcium, magnesium and potassium contents. We conclude that community structure and abundance represent important ecological aspects in soil verrucomicrobial communities for tracking the changes in chemical factors linked to soil fertility under tropical environmental conditions.

AB Genetic incompatibilities are an important component of reproductive isolation. Although theoretical studies have addressed their evolution, little is known about their maintenance when challenged by potentially high migration rates in secondary contact. Although theory predicts that recombination can erode barriers, many empirical systems have been found to retain species-specific differences despite substantial gene flow. By simulating whole genomes in individuals of hybridizing species, we find that the genetic architecture of two contrasting models of epistatic hybrid incompatibilities and the context of hybridization can substantially affect species integrity and genomic heterogeneity. In line with theory, our results show that intergenomic incompatibilities break down rapidly by recombination, but can maintain genome-wide differentiation under very limited conditions. By contrast, intragenomic interactions that arise from genetic pathways can maintain species-specific differences even with high migration rates and gene flow, whereas introgression at large parts of the genome can simultaneously remain extensive, consistent with empirical observations. We discuss the importance of intragenomic interactions in speciation and consider how this form of epistatic fitness variation is implicated and supported by other theoretical and empirical studies. We further address the relevance of replicates and knowledge of context when investigating the genomics of speciation.

AB AimThe aim of this study was to test the role of environmental factors and spatially autocorrelated processes, such as historical fragmentation and dispersal limitation, in driving floristic variation across seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) in eastern South America.
   LocationSDTFs extending from the Caatinga phytogeographical domain of north-eastern Brazil to the Chaco phytogeographical domain of northern Argentina, an area referred to as the Dry Diagonal.
   MethodsWe compiled a database of 282 inventories of woody vegetation in SDTFs from across the Dry Diagonal and combined this with data for 14 environmental variables. We assessed the relative contribution of spatially autocorrelated processes and environmental factors to the floristic turnover among SDTFs across the Dry Diagonal using variation partitioning methods. In addition, we used multivariate analyses to determine which environmental factors were most important in explaining the turnover.
   ResultsWe found that the environmental factors measured (temperature, precipitation and edaphic conditions) explained 21.3% of the variation in species composition, with 14.1% of this occurring independently of spatial autocorrelation. A spatially structured fraction of 4.2% could not be accounted for by the environmental factors measured. The main axis of compositional variation was significantly correlated with a north-south gradient in temperature regime. At the extreme south of the Dry Diagonal, a cold temperature regime, in which frost occurred, appeared to underlie floristic similarities between chaco woodlands and southern SDTFs.
   Main conclusionsEnvironmental variables, particularly those related to temperature regime, seem to be the most significant factors affecting variation in species composition of SDTFs. Thus historical fragmentation and isolation alone cannot explain the turnover in species composition within SDTFs, as is often assumed. Compositional and environmental heterogeneity needs to be taken into account both to understand the past distribution of SDTFs and to manage and conserve this key tropical biome.

It contains findings from empirical studies, comprising six interviews, a pilot study, a questionnaire survey in Hong Kong, and 15 interviews in Australia. Six activity groups (i.e.,precondition, project data identification, stakeholder estimation, decision making, action and evaluation, and sustainable support) and a total of 18 activities within these groups and their interrelations formulate the main body of the framework. The proposed framework was validated by five real-life projects, the results of which confirm the applicability of the proposed framework. This study serves as a reference for project-management teams to systematically manage stakeholders in construction projects.

AB Climate change is projected to impact on biodiversity conservation and the effectiveness of the existing protected area network in biologically rich Yunnan Province of southwestern China. A statistically derived bioclimatic stratification is used to analyze projected bioclimatic conditions across Yunnan by the year 2050. The multi-model approach is based on an ensemble of CIMP5 Earth System Models, down-scaled to a set of 1 km(2) resolution climate projections (n = 63), covering four representative concentration pathways (RCP). Nine bioclimatic zones, composed of 33 strata, are currently found within Yunnan. By 2050, the mean elevation of these zones is projected to shift upwards by an average of 269 m, with large increases in area of the warmer zones, and decreases in the colder, higher elevation zones. Temperate and alpine areas of high biodiversity value are at risk. Displacement in the geographic distribution of bioclimatic conditions is likely to have substantial impact across all bioclimatic zones, vegetation types, and habitats currently found in Yunnan. On average, across all RCPs, 45% of the total combined area of the protected area network will shift to a completely different zone, with 83% shifting to a different strata. The great majority of protected area will experience substantially changed, spatially shifted, and novel bioclimatic conditions by 2050. The spatial displacement and upwards shifting of bioclimatic conditions indicates a prolonged period of significant ecological perturbation, which will have a major impact upon the conservation effectiveness of the established protected area network, and other conservation efforts across Yunnan.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Most biologists recognize the "species phenomenon" as a real pattern in nature: Biodiversity is characterized by discontinuities between recognizable groups classified as species. Many conservation laws focus on preventing species extinction. However, species are not fixed. Discontinuities evolve gradually and sometimes disappear. Exactly how to define particular species is not always obvious. Hybridization between taxonomic species reminds us that species classification is not a perfect representation of nature. Classification is a model that is very useful, but not adequate in all cases. Conservationists often confront questions about how to apply species-based laws when hybridization confounds classification. Development of sophisticated techniques and nuanced interpretation of data in the basic study of species and speciation has exposed the need for deeper education in genetics and evolution for applied conservationists and decision makers. Here we offer a brief perspective on hybridization and the species problem in conservation. Our intended audience is conservation practitioners and decision-makers more than geneticists and evolutionary biologists. We wish to emphasize that the goals and premises of legislative classification are not identical to those of scientific classification. Sometimes legal classification is required when the best available science indicates that discrete classification is not an adequate model for the case. Establishing legal status and level of protection for hybrids and hybrid populations means choosing from a range of scientifically valid alternatives. Although we should not abandon species-based approaches to conservation, we must recognize their limitations and work to clarify the roles of science and values in ethical and legal decisions

TI Perspectives of "Conflict" at the Wildlife-Agriculture Boundary: 10
   Years On
SO HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE
LA English
DT Article
DE human-wildlife interaction; conflict mitigation; crop raiding;
   human-wildlife conflict; conservation
AB Previously I argued that prioritizing farmers' concerns, priorities, and understandings of human-wildlife interactions was central to developing effective human-wildlife conflict (HWC) mitigation, presupposing that HWC is about the costs of coexisting with wildlife. Further experience and the wider literature suggest this is not always true. Identifying and addressing underlying and unresolved tensions among different stake-holder groups is increasingly recognized as key to managing HWCs. However, terms like "HWC" or "crop-raiding" obscure the nature of, and appropriate responses to, such "conflicts." Additionally, we should recognize how culturally constructed, symbolic meanings of animals feed into discourse around "conflicts" and conservation. Competing constructions of animals reflect different agendas, perspectives, and values, which all contribute to "conflicts" around wildlife.

AB Background and Aims Since ancient times in the Americas, maize, bean and squash have been grown together in a polyculture known as the 'three sisters'. This polyculture and its maize/bean variant have greater yield than component monocultures on a land-equivalent basis. This study shows that below-ground niche complementarity may contribute to this yield advantage.
   Methods Monocultures and polycultures of maize, bean and squash were grown in two seasons in field plots differing in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability. Root growth patterns of individual crops and entire polycultures were determined using a modified DNA-based technique to discriminate roots of different species.
   Key Results The maize/bean/squash and maize/bean polycultures had greater yield and biomass production on a land-equivalent basis than the monocultures. Increased biomass production was largely caused by a complementarity effect rather than a selection effect. The differences in root crown architecture and vertical root distribution among the components of the 'three sisters' suggest that these species have different, possibly complementary, nutrient foraging strategies. Maize foraged relatively shallower, common bean explored the vertical soil profile more equally, while the root placement of squash depended on Pavailability. The density of lateral root branching was significantly greater for all species in the polycultures than in the monocultures.
   Conclusions It is concluded that species differences in root foraging strategies increase total soil exploration, with consequent positive effects on the growth and yield of these ancient polycultures.

AB Competing water demands for household consumption as well as the production of food, energy, and other uses pose challenges for water supply and sustainable development in many parts of the world. Designing creative strategies and learning processes for sustainable water governance is thus of prime importance. While this need is uncontested, suitable approaches still have to be found. In this article we present and evaluate a conceptual approach to scenario building aimed at transdisciplinary learning for sustainable water governance. The approach combines normative, explorative, and participatory scenario elements. This combination allows for adequate consideration of stakeholders' and scientists' systems, target, and transformation knowledge. Application of the approach in the MontanAqua project in the Swiss Alps confirmed its high potential for co-producing new knowledge and establishing a meaningful and deliberative dialogue between all actors involved. The iterative and combined approach ensured that stakeholders' knowledge was adequately captured, fed into scientific analysis, and brought back to stakeholders in several cycles, thereby facilitating learning and co-production of new knowledge relevant for both stakeholders and scientists. However, the approach also revealed a number of constraints, including the enormous flexibility required of stakeholders and scientists in order for them to truly engage in the co-production of new knowledge. Overall, the study showed that shifts from strategic to communicative action are possible in an environment of mutual trust. This ultimately depends on creating conditions of interaction that place scientists' and stakeholders' knowledge on an equal footing.

AB Humans and human infrastructure are known to alter the relationship between predators and prey, typically by directly or indirectly shielding one of the species from the other. In addition to these overt changes to animals' behavior, observers may have more subtle impacts on animals' foraging decisions. However, the anthropogenic alteration of risk-taking behavior has rarely been acknowledged or quantified, particularly in behavioral ecological studies reliant on habituated animals. We tested the magnitude of the "human shield effect" experimentally on 2 groups of samango monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarcus, at a site with high natural predator density and no human hunting pressure. In general, giving-up densities-the density of food remaining in a patch when a forager leaves-were greatest at ground level (0.1 m) relative to 3 tree canopy levels (2.5, 5, and 7.5 m), highlighting a strong vertical axis of fear. When human followers were present, however, giving-up densities were reduced at all 4 heights; furthermore, for 1 group, the vertical axis disappeared in the presence of observers. Our results suggest that human observers lower monkeys' perceived risk of terrestrial predators and, thereby, affect their foraging decisions at or near ground level. These results have significant implications for future studies of responses to predation risk based on habituation and observational methods.

AB Anurans are a highly diverse group in the Atlantic Forest hotspot (AF), yet distribution patterns and species richness gradients are not randomly distributed throughout the biome. Thus, we explore how anuran species are distributed in this complex and biodiverse hotspot, and hypothesize that this group can be distinguished by different cohesive regions. We used range maps of 497 species to obtain a presence/ absence data grid, resolved to 50x50 km grain size, which was submitted to k-means clustering with v-fold cross-validation to determine the biogeographic regions. We also explored the extent to which current environmental variables, topography, and floristic structure of the AF are expected to identify the cluster patterns recognized by the k-means clustering. The biogeographic patterns found for amphibians are broadly congruent with ecoregions identified in the AF, but their edges, and sometimes the whole extent of some clusters, present much less resolved pattern compared to previous classification. We also identified that climate, topography, and vegetation structure of the AF explained a high percentage of variance of the cluster patterns identified, but the magnitude of the regression coefficients shifted regarding their importance in explaining the variance for each cluster. Specifically, we propose that the anuran fauna of the AF can be split into four biogeographic regions: a) less diverse and widely-ranged species that predominantly occur in the inland semideciduous forests; b) northern small-ranged species that presumably evolved within the Pleistocene forest refugia; c) highly diverse and small-ranged species from the southeastern Brazilian mountain chain and its adjacent semideciduous forest; and d) southern species from the Araucaria forest. Finally, the high congruence among the cluster patterns and previous eco-regions identified for the AF suggests that preserving the underlying habitat structure helps to preserve the historical and ecological signals that underlie the geographic distribution of AF anurans.

AB Evaluation of host-parasitoid associations can be tenuous using conventional methods. Molecular techniques are well placed to identify trophic links and resolve host-parasitoid associations. Establishment of the highly invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), outside Asia has prompted interest in the use of egg parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) as biological control agents. However, little is known regarding their host ranges. To address this, a DNA barcoding approach was taken wherein general PCR primers for Scelionidae and Pentatomidae were developed to amplify and sequence >500-bp products within the DNA barcoding region of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene that would permit the identification of key players in this association. Amplification of DNA from Pentatomidae and Scelionidae was consistent across a broad range of taxa within these families, and permitted the detection of Scelionidae eggs within H. halys 1 h following oviposition. In laboratory assays, amplification and sequencing of DNA from empty, parasitized eggs was successful for both host (100% success) and parasitoid (50% success). When applied to field-collected, empty egg masses, the primers permitted host identification in 50-100% of the eggs analysed, and yielded species-level identifications. Parasitoid identification success ranged from 33 to 67% among field-collected eggs, with genus-level identification for most specimens. The inability to obtain species-level identities for these individuals is due to the lack of coverage of this taxonomic group in public DNA sequence databases; this situation is likely to improve as more species are sequenced and recorded in these databases. These primers were able to detect and identify both pentatomid host and scelionid parasitoid in a hyperparasitized egg mass, thereby clarifying trophic links otherwise unresolved by conventional methodology.

AB Background: Cycas simplicipinna (T. Smitinand) K. Hill. (Cycadaceae) is an endangered species in China. There were seven populations and 118 individuals that we could collect were genotyped in this study. Here, we assessed the genetic diversity, genetic structure and demographic history of this species.
   Results: Analyses of data of DNA sequences (two maternally inherited intergenic spacers of chloroplast, cpDNA and one biparentally inherited internal transcribed spacer region ITS4-ITS5, nrDNA) and sixteen microsatellite loci (SSR) were conducted in the species. Of the 118 samples, 86 individuals from the seven populations were used for DNA sequencing and 115 individuals from six populations were used for the microsatellite study. We found high genetic diversity at the species level, low genetic diversity within each of the seven populations and high genetic differentiation among the populations. There was a clear genetic structure within populations of C. simplicipinna. A demographic history inferred from DNA sequencing data indicates that C. simplicipinna experienced a recent population contraction without retreating to a common refugium during the last glacial period. The results derived from SSR data also showed that C. simplicipinna underwent past effective population contraction, likely during the Pleistocene.
   Conclusions: Some genetic features of C. simplicipinna such as having high genetic differentiation among the populations, a clear genetic structure and a recent population contraction could provide guidelines for protecting this endangered species from extinction. Furthermore, the genetic features with population dynamics of the species in our study would help provide insights and guidelines for protecting other endangered species effectively.

AB Tree growth limitation at treeline has mainly been studied in terms of carbon limitation while effects and mechanisms of potential nitrogen (N) limitation are barely known, especially in the southern hemisphere. We investigated how soil abiotic properties and microbial community structure and composition change from lower to upper sites within three vegetation belts (Nothofagus betuloides and N. pumilio forests, and alpine vegetation) across an elevation gradient (from 0 to 650 m a.s.l.) in Cordillera Darwin, southern Patagonia. Increasing elevation was associated with a decrease in soil N-NH4+ availability within the N. pumilio and the alpine vegetation belt. Within the alpine vegetation belt, a concurrent increase in the soil C:N ratio was associated with a shift from bacterial-dominated in lower alpine sites to fungal-dominated microbial communities in upper alpine sites. Lower forested belts (N. betuloides, N. pumilio) exhibited more complex patterns both in terms of soil properties and microbial communities. Overall, our results concur with recent findings from high-latitude and altitude ecosystems showing decreased nutrient availability with elevation, leading to fungal-dominated microbial communities. We suggest that growth limitation at treeline may result, in addition to proximal climatic parameters, from a competition between trees and soil microbial communities for limited soil inorganic N. At higher elevation, soil microbial communities could have comparably greater capacities to uptake soil N than trees, and the shift towards a fungal-dominated community would favour N immobilization over N mineralization. Though evidences of altered nutrient dynamics in tree and alpine plant tissue with increasing altitude remain needed, we contend that the measured residual low amount of inorganic N available for trees in the soil could participate to the establishment limitation. Finally, our results suggest that responses of soil microbial communities to elevation could be influenced by functional properties of forest communities for instance through variations in litter quality.

AB Pest species distribution modelling was designed to extrapolate risks in the biosecurity sector in order to protect agricultural crops against the spread of both endemic and introduced pest species. The need to identify sources of biological control agents for importation added to this demand. Independently, biogeographers mapped species distributions to interpolate their niche requirements. Recently the threat of climate change caused an explosion in demand for guidance on likely shifts in potential distributions of species. The different technology platforms in the two sectors resulted in divergence in their approaches to mapping actual and potential species distributions under rapidly changing environmental scenarios. Much of the contemporary discussion of species mapping ignores the lessons from the history of pest species distribution modelling. This has major implications for modelling of the non- equilibrium distributions of all species that occur with rapid climate change. The current review is intended to remind researchers of historical findings and their significance for current mapping of all species. I argue that the dream of automating species mapping for multiple species is an illusion. More modest goals and use of other approaches are necessary to protect biodiversity under current and future climates. Pest risk mapping tools have greater prospects of success because they are generic in nature and so able to be used both to interpolate and to extrapolate from field observations of any species based on climatic variables. In addition invasive species are less numerous and usually better understood, while the risk assessments are applied on regional scales in which climate is the dominant variable.

AB Previous research has shown that fires burn certain land cover types disproportionally to their abundance. We used quantile regression to study land cover proneness to fire as a function of fire size, under the hypothesis that they are inversely related, for all land cover types. Using five years of fire perimeters, we estimated conditional quantile functions for lower (avoidance) and upper (preference) quantiles of fire selectivity for five land cover types - annual crops, evergreen oak woodlands, eucalypt forests, pine forests and shrublands. The slope of significant regression quantiles describes the rate of change in fire selectivity (avoidance or preference) as a function of fire size. We used Monte-Carlo methods to randomly permutate fires in order to obtain a distribution of fire selectivity due to chance. This distribution was used to test the null hypotheses that 1) mean fire selectivity does not differ from that obtained by randomly relocating observed fire perimeters; 2) that land cover proneness to fire does not vary with fire size. Our results show that land cover proneness to fire is higher for shrublands and pine forests than for annual crops and evergreen oak woodlands. As fire size increases, selectivity decreases for all land cover types tested. Moreover, the rate of change in selectivity with fire size is higher for preference than for avoidance. Comparison between observed and randomized data led us to reject both null hypotheses tested (alpha = 0.05) and to conclude it is very unlikely the observed values of fire selectivity and change in selectivity with fire size are due to chance.

AB This study investigated the extent to which the plasticity of a generalist, opportunistic species allows individuals to shift their feeding ecology and foraging niche, throughout the annual cycle, and between 2 years of contrasting diet and oceanographic conditions during the breeding season. The spatio-temporal variations in the foraging niche of an overpopulated gull species-the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis population at Berlenga Island (Portugal)-were assessed using blood (plasma and cells) and different feathers for stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) from 52 breeding adults in 2 consecutive years (2011 and 2012). In addition, GPS loggers were deployed on 11 individuals (and removed after several foraging trips) to infer the foraging behaviour of this species during the incubation period. Results suggest inter-annual differences in the feeding ecology and foraging behaviour of birds during the breeding season that were associated with the availability of food resources around the colony. Despite the high feeding plasticity and opportunistic behaviour of yellow-legged gulls, individual birds exhibited short-and long-term consistency in their feeding ecology, with exception of the period between winter and pre-laying. Our results support the hypothesis that individual feeding preferences throughout most of the annual cycle are an intrinsic characteristic of this population, and potentially of related opportunistic and generalist species.

AB Streambed colmation by fine sediment, e.g. the deposition, accumulation and storage of fines in the substrate, is known to have severe effects on invertebrate assemblages in both the benthic and hyporheic zones but the changes in biological attributes of invertebrate assemblages related to colmation have never been considered simultaneously for these two zones. We studied the effects of colmation on the invertebrate assemblages of three rivers, testing a priori hypotheses on the biological attributes that should be more selected in communities subjected to different levels of colmation in both zones. Only the proportion of organisms with high fecundity increased and the proportion of small-sized organisms decreased along the colmation gradient in both zones simultaneously. As expected, a higher number of traits were significantly modified with colmation in the benthic vs. hyporheic assemblages. Most of the biological attributes impaired were different in the two zones. In the benthic zone, colmation mainly selected particular physiological or trophic characteristics of species and features related to their resistance or resilience capacities. In contrast, the morphological attributes of species were much more impaired by colmation in the hyporheic zone than in the benthic zone. In clogged benthic habitats, traits seemed to be more impaired by an increase in physico-chemical constraints (e.g. the reduction of oxygen availability) and a reduction of potential exchanges (including exchanges of food resources) due to a decline in stream bed conductivity. The morphological attributes of the hyporheic species were probably more influenced by changes in interstitial space characteristics. A potential indicator of the effects of colmation on river health may be based on the functional traits of benthic communities because they (i) satisfy the WFD recommendations, (ii) respond consistently along a colmation gradient and (iii) are comparable among assemblages even across ecoregions that differ in their taxonomic composition.

AB We studied how the landscape structure (percentage cover and diversity of surrounding habitats) affects different components of species diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) of vascular plants in semi-natural grasslands in the Slovak Republic. We analyzed all grasslands combined as well as four main types delimited according to their position along a moisture gradient (xerophilous, sub-xerophilous, mesophilous and wet grasslands). We used grassland records stored in the Slovak Vegetation Database. The geographically stratified dataset included 3795 plots with 1221 species of vascular plants. Along with the total number of species in the vegetation plots, we considered the numbers of target grassland species, forest species, archaeophytes, neophytes and species with high fidelity to non-natural habitats. The landscape parameters based on CORINE land cover maps and the National Grassland Inventory, were calculated for plot neighbourhoods of 4 km(2). Spatially constrained rarefaction curves were constructed to examine how different diversity components behave with changing structure of the surrounding landscape. Our study revealed that alpha diversity was affected by both percentage cover and diversity of different habitats in the plot neighbourhood. It increased with increasing proportion or diversity of different natural and semi-natural habitats and decreased with increasing proportion or diversity of non-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. Beta and gamma diversities showed opposite pattern to that of alpha diversity for most analyzed factors. Alpha diversity in sub-xerophilous and mesophilous grasslands was more susceptible to changes in landscape structure than alpha diversity in xerophilous or wet grasslands. Regression trees and linear or quadratic regression models revealed that in xerophilous or wet grasslands, high alpha diversity was best predicted by a high proportion of ecologically valuable grasslands in the surroundings. In sub-xerophilous and mesophilous grasslands, the best predictor was proportion of natural and semi-natural habitats followed by the proportion of non-natural habitats. The detected pattern regarding alpha, beta and gamma diversity calculated for grassland target species did not differ from the pattern for the whole species assemblage. However, the surrounding landscape affected the number, proportion and cover of species typical of forest or non-natural habitats (including alien species) in the plots. We explain the results by the interplay of two main mechanisms: species pool and spatial mass effects. In our study, the effect of species pool on alpha diversity was stronger than the spatial mass effect. Based on differences indicated in the responses of various grassland types to the surrounding landscape structure, we suggest adoption of community type specific conservation measures (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The link between biodiversity and grassland productivity remains a central puzzle for both theoretical and applied ecologists. Little is known about the response of functional diversity (FD, i.e. the extent of trait differences between organisms in a given community) to increased grassland productivity following fertilization. Species diversity is often used as a surrogate for FD but evidence shows that FD is often independent from species diversity.
   We conducted a three-year (2004-2006) experiment in a Tibetan alpine grassland to examine the effect of fertilization on FD and SD, and its relationship with productivity. We measured specific leaf area, plant height and seed size for 32 species in control, low- and high-fertilization treatments over three years, and quantified three components of FD: functional richness (FRic), functional evenness (FEve) and functional divergence using Rao's index (FDrao).
   While SD decreased rapidly, as expected, both FRic and FDrao increased significantly with fertilization. Neither species evenness nor FEve was affected by fertilization. Aboveground biomass was not significantly correlated with SD, but it was significantly positively correlated with both FRic and FDrao, with the strongest correlations found in 2006 for FRic and in 2005 for FDrao.
   The results showed that FD and SD have opposite responses to short-term fertilization. The increased FD suggests enhanced niche differentiation between species remaining after fertilization, which caused species loss. This study highlights the importance of examining FD in assessing fertilization-induced biodiversity loss and its impacts on ecosystem functioning in grasslands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB AimSpecies distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to forecast climate change impacts. These models, however, are subject to important assumptions and limitations. By integrating two independent but complementary methods, ensemble SDMs and statistical phylogeography, we addressed key assumptions and created robust assessments of climate change impacts on species distributions while improving the conservation value of these projections.
   LocationNorth American cordillera.
   MethodsThis approach was demonstrated using the arctic-alpine plant Rhodiola integrifolia (Crassulaceae). SDMs were fitted to current and past climates using eight models, two thresholds and one to three climate data sets. These projections were combined to create a map of stable climate (refugia) since the Last Interglacial (124,000kya). Five biogeographic hypotheses were developed based on the configuration of refugia and tested using statistical phylogeography. Projection of SDMs into the future was contingent on agreement across approaches; future projections (to 2085) used five climate data sets and two greenhouse gas scenarios.
   ResultsA multiple-refugia hypothesis was supported by both methods, confirming the assumption of niche conservatism in R.integrifolia and justifying the projection of SDMs onto future climates. Future projections showed substantial loss of climatically suitable habitat. Southern populations had the greatest losses, although the biogeographic scale of modelling may overpredict extinction risks in areas of topographic complexity. Past and future SDMs were assessed for novel values of climate variables; areas of novel climate were flagged as having higher uncertainty.
   Main conclusionsIntegrating molecular approaches with spatial analyses of species distributions under global change has great potential to improve conservation decision-making. Molecular tools can support and improve current methods for understanding the vulnerability of species to climate change and provide additional data upon which to base conservation decisions, such as prioritizing the conservation of areas of high genetic diversity to build evolutionary resiliency within populations.

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices that exploit microorganisms as "biocatalysts" to recover energy from organic matter in the form of electricity. MFCs have been explored as possible energy neutral wastewater treatment systems; however, fundamental knowledge is still required about how MFC-associated microbial communities are affected by different operational conditions and can be optimized for accelerated wastewater treatment rates. In this study, we explored how electricity-generating microbial biofilms were established at MFC anodes and responded to three different operational conditions during wastewater treatment: 1) MFC operation using a 750 Omega external resistor (0.3 mA current production); 2) set-potential (SP) operation with the anode electrode potentiostatically controlled to +100 mV vs SHE (4.0 mA current production); and 3) open circuit (OC) operation (zero current generation). For all reactors, primary clarifier effluent collected from a municipal wastewater plant was used as the sole carbon and microbial source. Batch operation demonstrated nearly complete organic matter consumption after a residence time of 8-12 days for the MFC condition, 4-6 days for the SP condition, and 15-20 days for the OC condition. These results indicate that higher current generation accelerates organic matter degradation during MFC wastewater treatment. The microbial community analysis was conducted for the three reactors using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Although the inoculated wastewater was dominated by members of Epsilonproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes species, the electricity-generating biofilms in MFC and SP reactors were dominated by Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Within Deltaproteobacteria, phylotypes classified to family Desulfobulbaceae and Geobacteraceae increased significantly under the SP condition with higher current generation; however those phylotypes were not found in the OC reactor. These analyses suggest that species related to family Desulfobulbaceae and Geobacteraceae are correlated with the electricity generation in the biofilm and may be key players for optimizing wastewater treatment rates and energy recovery in applied MFC systems.

AB Changes in habitat extent as well as landscape and habitat structure are often caused by human pressure within protected areas and at their boundaries, with consequences for biodiversity and species distributions. Thus quantitative spatial information on landscape mosaic arrangements is essential, for monitoring for nature conservation, as also specified by frameworks such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the European Union's Habitat Directive. While measuring habitat extent is a relatively straightforward task, approaches for measuring habitat fragmentation are debated. This research aims to delineate a framework that enables the integration of different approaches to select a set of site- and scale-specific indices and synthetic descriptors and develop a comprehensive quantitative assessment of variations in human impact on the landscape, through assessment of habitat spatial patterns, which can be used as a baseline for monitoring. This framework is based on the use of established methodologies and free software, and can thus be widely applied across sites. For each landscape and observation scale, the framework permits the identification of the most relevant indices, and appropriate parameters for their computation. We illustrate the use of this framework through a case study in a protected area in Italy, to indicate that integrated information from multiple approaches can provide a more complete understanding of landscape and habitat spatial pattern, especially related to locations experiencing disturbance and pressure. First, identification of a parsimonious set of traditional LPIs for a specific landscape and spatial scale provides insights on the relation between landscape heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation. These can be used for both change assessment and ranking of different sections of the study area according to a fragmentation gradient in relation to matrix quality. Second, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), provides a pixel based structural characterisation of the landscape. Third, compositional characterisation of the landscape at the pixel level is provided by landscape mosaic analysis. These three approaches provide quantitative assessments through indices which can be used singly or in combination to derive three synthetic descriptors for a comprehensive quantitative baseline representation of landscape structure that can be used for monitoring: the first descriptor, landscape diversity profiling, based on the output of landscape mosaic analysis, at the landscape level, complements the evaluation which at the pixel level can be obtained by more complex modelling; the second descriptor, obtained combining of the outputs of MSPA and the landscape mosaic analysis, informs on the local structural pattern gradient across the landscape space; the third descriptor, derived from the integration of selected LPIs and those derived from MSPA into a discontinuities detection procedure, allows for the identification of "critical points" of transitions in management where threats to biodiversity and ecosystems integrity may be likely. The framework developed has significant potential to capture information on major landscape structural features, identify problematic areas of increased fragmentation that can be used to prioritise research, monitoring and intervention, and provide early warning signals for immediate response to pressures increasing habitat fragmentation, with the goal of facilitating more effective management.

AB A major aim of invasion ecology is to identify characteristics of successful invaders. However, most plant groups studied in detail (e. g. pines and acacias) have a high percentage of invasive taxa. Here we examine the global introduction history and invasion ecology of Proteaceae-a large plant family with many taxa that have been widely disseminated by humans, but with few known invaders. To do this we compiled a global list of species and used boosted regression tree models to assess which factors are important in determining the status of a species (not introduced, introduced, naturalized or invasive). At least 402 of 1674 known species (24%) have been moved by humans out of their native ranges, 58 species (14%) have become naturalized but not invasive, and 8 species (2%) are invasive. The probability of naturalization was greatest for species with large native ranges, low susceptibility to Phytophthora root-rot fungus, large mammal-dispersed seeds, and with the capacity to resprout. The probability of naturalized species becoming invasive was greatest for species with large native ranges, those used as barrier plants, tall species, species with small seeds, and serotinous species. The traits driving invasiveness of Proteaceae were similar to those for acacias and pines. However, while some traits showed a consistent influence at introduction, naturalization and invasion, others appear to be influential at one stage only, and some have contrasting effects at different stages. Trait-based analyses therefore need to consider different invasion stages separately. On their own, these observations provide little predictive power for risk assessment, but when the causative mechanisms are understood (e. g. Phytophthora susceptibility) they provide valuable insights. As such there is considerable value in seeking the correlates and mechanisms underlying invasions for particular taxonomic or functional groups.

AB Understanding and analysis of drivers of land-use and -cover change (LUCC) is a requisite to reduce and manage impacts and consequences of LUCC. The aim of the present study is to analyze drivers of LUCC in Southern Mexico and to see how these are used by different conceptual and methodological approaches for generating transition potential maps and how this influences the effectiveness to produce reliable LUCC models. Spatial factors were tested for their relation to main LUCC processes, and their importance as drivers for the periods 1993-2002 and 2002-2007 was evaluated by hierarchical partitioning analysis and logistic regression models. Tested variables included environmental and biophysical variables, location measures of infrastructure and of existing land use, fragmentation, and demographic and social variables. The most important factors show a marked persistence over time: deforestation is mainly driven by the distance of existing land uses; degradation and regeneration by the distance of existing disturbed forests. Nevertheless, the overall number of important factors decreases slightly for the second period. These drivers were used to produce transition potential maps calibrated with the 1993-2002 data by two different approaches: (1) weights of evidence (WoE) to represent the probabilities of dominant change processes, namely deforestation, forest degradation, and forest regeneration for temperate and tropical forests and (2) logistic RM that show the suitability regarding the different land-use and -cover (LUC) classes. Validation of the transition potential maps with the 2002-2007 data indicates a low precision with large differences between LUCC processes and methods. Areas of change evaluated by difference in potential showed that WoE produce transition potential maps that are more accurate for predicting LUCC than those produced with RM. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) statistics show that transition potential models based on RM do usually better predict areas of no change, but the difference is rather small. The poor performance of maps based on RM could be attributed to their too general representation of suitability for certain LUC classes when the goal is modeling complex LUCC and the LUC classes participate in several transitions. The application of a multimodel approach enables to better understand the relations of drivers to LUCC and the evaluation of model calibration based on spatial explanatory factors. This improved understanding of the capacity of LUCC models to produce accurate predictions is important for making better informed policy assessments and management recommendations to reduce deforestation.

AB The contribution of sexual selection to diversification remains poorly understood after decades of research. This may be in part because studies have focused predominantly on the strength of sexual selection, which offers an incomplete view of selection regimes. By contrast, students of natural selection focus on environmental differences that help compare selection regimes across populations. To ask how this disparity in focus may affect the conclusions of evolutionary research, we relate the amount of diversification in mating displays to quantitative descriptions of the strength and the amount of divergence in mate preferences across a diverse set of case studies of mate choice. We find that display diversification is better explained by preference divergence rather than preference strength; the effect of the latter is more subtle, and is best revealed as an interaction with the former. Our findings cast the action of sexual selection (and selection in general) in a novel light: the strength of selection influences the rate of evolution, and how divergent selection is determines how much diversification can occur. Adopting this view will enhance tests of the relative role of natural and sexual selection in processes such as speciation.

AB Large variation in tree root architecture and morphology has been reported for temperate forest communities. However, it is not clear whether this variation represents adaptation of species to specific soil properties, alternative resource acquisition strategies among co-occurring species, or canalized traits without a strong impact on the success of individuals in different environments. Here, our goal was to test these alternative hypotheses and quantify how community-aggregated and intraspecific root trait variations are explained by biotic versus abiotic mechanisms in a temperate deciduous forest. We conducted our study in an Acer-Fagus-dominated forest in north-east Ohio, USA. Using molecular barcoding techniques, we identified 738 root systems belonging to 14 tree species. We measured seven functional root traits related to root architecture and morphology at the species and community-aggregated levels. Although we found significant relationships between soil resource gradients and root trait distributions, intrinsic differences between coexisting species were more important than soil factors in explaining the distribution of root traits in the community. Additionally, root trait variation at the species level was also influenced by the presence of other species within cores. Community-aggregated variation was more influenced by the combination of species present than soil properties in each sample, suggesting that biotic interactions play an important role in controlling community root trait distribution. Synthesis. We propose that root trait differentiation between coexisting species is the result of inherent differences between species and plasticity-mediated responses to neighbours. Hence, the large variation in root traits reported in temperate forest seems to reflect alternative evolutionary pathways that allow individuals to exploit distinct niches in relatively close proximity.

AB A central goal in ecology is to understand the factors affecting the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of microorganisms and the underlying processes causing differences in community structure and composition. However, little is known in this respect for photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs), algae that are now recognised as major players in marine CO2 fixation. Here, we analysed dot blot hybridisation and cloning-sequencing data, using the plastid-encoded 16S rRNA gene, from seven research cruises that encompassed all four ocean biomes. We provide insights into global abundance, alpha- and beta-diversity distribution and the environmental factors shaping PPE community structure and composition. At the class level, the most commonly encountered PPEs were Prymnesiophyceae and Chrysophyceae. These taxa displayed complementary distribution patterns, with peak abundances of Prymnesiophyceae and Chrysophyceae in waters of high (25: 1) or low (12: 1) nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) ratio, respectively. Significant differences in phylogenetic composition of PPEs were demonstrated for higher taxonomic levels between ocean basins, using Unifrac analyses of clone library sequence data. Differences in composition were generally greater between basins (interbasins) than within a basin (intrabasin). These differences were primarily linked to taxonomic variation in the composition of Prymnesiophyceae and Prasinophyceae whereas Chrysophyceae were phylogenetically similar in all libraries. These data provide better knowledge of PPE community structure across the world ocean and are crucial in assessing their evolution and contribution to CO2 fixation, especially in the context of global climate change.

AB Understanding how and why plant communities vary across space has long been a goal of ecology, yet parsing the relative importance of different influences has remained a challenge. Species-specific models are not generalizable, whereas broad plant functional type models lack important detail. Here we consider plant trait patterns at the local scale and ask whether plant chemical traits are more closely linked to environmental gradients or to changes in species composition. We used the visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectrometer of the Carnegie Airborne Observatory to develop maps of four plant chemical traits-leaf nitrogen per mass, leaf carbon per mass, leaf water concentration, and canopy water content-across a diverse Mediterranean-type ecosystem (Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, CA). For all four traits, plant community alone was the strongest predictor of trait variation (explaining 46-61% of the heterogeneity), whereas environmental gradients accounted for just one fourth of the variation in the traits. This result emphasizes the critical role that species composition plays in mediating nutrient and carbon cycling within and among different communities. Environmental filtering and limits to similarity can act strongly, simultaneously, in a spatially heterogeneous environment, but the local-scale environmental gradients alone cannot account for the variation across this landscape.

AB The distribution of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) can reflect continental environmental changes. Recently, the distribution of branched GDGTs (bGDGTs) has been proposed as a novel tool for paleoelevation reconstructions. Here we report the variation in TEX86 (tetraether index of 86 carbon atoms) of isoprenoidal GDGTs (iGDGTs) and MBT (methylation of branched tetraether index) of bGDGTs along an altitudinal transect on Mt. Xiangpi, NE Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Both TEX86 and MBT values of surface soils showed significant linear decreases with altitude (TEX86: R-2 = 0.65; n = 50; MBT: R-2 = 0.69; n = 24). We suggest that the apparent relationships between the two indices and altitude may be related to temperature. Our preliminary investigation suggests that the TEX86 index can potentially be applied as a paleoelevation indicator in addition to the MBT index on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB Aquatic ecosystems are amongst the most heavily altered ecosystems and exhibit a disproportional loss of biodiversity. Numerous stressors, such as nutrient enrichment, contaminant pollution, sedimentation and alterations in stream hydrology and habitat structure, account for these losses. Understanding these forces is of utmost importance to prevent riverine ecosystems from further deterioration and to provide helpful insights for restoration practices. In the present study, we analyse the response of biological indicators to a large number of environmental factors. For this, benthic invertebrate assemblages from 83 sites in Germany were described based on 25 metrics from four different metric types. The condition of the sites was described using 27 environmental factors; 13 for water quality, 4 for land use in the catchment and 10 for local scale habitat structure. The relative importance of single environmental predictors or predictor combinations for benthic invertebrate assemblages was analysed with single and multiple linear regression models. The results for the latter models were statistically supported via a bootstrap approach. The models revealed the importance of water quality and catchment-scale land use in explaining benthic invertebrate assemblages; in particular, chloride, oxygen, total organic carbon and the amounts of artificial surfaces and arable land were the most important predictors. Models including solely structural variables such as plan form, bank structures and substrate diversity had lower goodness of fit values than those for other variables. Regarding the four different assemblage metric types, functional metrics had on average lower goodness of fit values than composition/abundance, richness/diversity and sensitivity/tolerance metrics. Among the richness/diversity metrics, however, the model results for the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson diversity indices and evenness were poor. Our results show that catchment-related factors and water quality were of overriding importance in shaping biodiversity patterns and causing species loss. In contrast, structural degradation at a local scale was not the most significant stressor.This finding might explain why structural restoration at a reach scale often yields a low benefit-cost ratio and may be considered to represent inappropriate investment prioritisation.

AB The size of an organism matters for its metabolic, growth, mortality, and other vital rates. Scale-free community size spectra (i.e., size distributions regardless of species) are routinely observed in natural ecosystems and are the product of intra-and interspecies regulation of the relative abundance of organisms of different sizes. Intra-and interspecies distributions of body sizes are thus major determinants of ecosystems' structure and function. We show experimentally that single-species mass distributions of unicellular eukaryotes covering different phyla exhibit both characteristic sizes and universal features over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. Remarkably, we find that the mean size of a species is sufficient to characterize its size distribution fully and that the latter has a universal form across all species. We show that an analytical physiological model accounts for the observed universality, which can be synthesized in a log-normal form for the intraspecies size distributions. We also propose how ecological and physiological processes should interact to produce scale-invariant community size spectra and discuss the implications of our results on allometric scaling laws involving body mass.

AB Aim Recent vegetation changes in mountain areas are often explained by climate warming. However, effects of land-use changes, such as recolonization of abandoned pastures by forest, are difficult to separate from those of climate change. Even within forest belts, changes in stand structure due to forest management and stand maturation could confound the climate signal. Here, we evaluate the direction and rate of plant species elevation shifts in mountain forests, considering the role of stand dynamics. Location Forests in the plains and mountains of Southeast France. Methods We compared floristic data from the French National Forest Inventory collected in the 1980s and 1990s. They provided a large-scale (30 985 plots) and representative sample of vegetation between 0 and 2500 m a.s.l. Species response curves along the elevation and exposure gradients were fitted with a logistic regression model. In order to assess the effect of changes in successional stages of the forest stands, we compared plant species shifts in the whole set of stands with those solely in closed stands. Results A total of 62 species shifted downward, whereas 113 shifted upward, resulting in a significant upward mean shift of 17.9 m. Upward shifting species were preferentially woody and heliophilous, suggesting a role for forest closure and maturation in the observed changes. Excluding all open forest stages from analyses, the upward trend became weaker (-3.0 m) and was not significant. Forests of the study area have undergone closure and maturation, more strongly at lower altitudes than at higher ones, producing an apparent shift of species. Conclusions In the mountain relief of Southeast France, changes in the successional stages of stands appear as the main cause of the apparent upslope movement of forest species. Since a similar trend of forest maturation exists in large areas throughout Europe, forest dynamics should be better taken into account among the causes of vegetation changes before inferring any climate change effect.

AB Predicting the potential range of invasive species is essential for risk assessment, monitoring, and management, and it can also inform us about a species' overall potential invasiveness. However, modeling the distribution of invasive species that have not reached their equilibrium distribution can be problematic for many predictive approaches. We apply the modeling approach of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) that is effective with incomplete, presence-only datasets to predict the distribution of the invasive island apple snail, Pomacea insularum. This freshwater snail is native to South America and has been spreading in the USA over the last decade from its initial introductions in Texas and Florida. It has now been documented throughout eight southeastern states. The snail's extensive consumption of aquatic vegetation and ability to accumulate and transmit algal toxins through the food web heighten concerns about its spread. Our model shows that under current climate conditions the snail should remain mostly confined to the coastal plain of the southeastern USA where it is limited by minimum temperature in the coldest month and precipitation in the warmest quarter. Furthermore, low pH waters (pH<5.5) are detrimental to the snail's survival and persistence. Of particular note are low-pH blackwater swamps, especially Okefenokee Swamp in southern Georgia (with a pH below 4 in many areas), which are predicted to preclude the snail's establishment even though many of these areas are well matched climatically. Our results elucidate the factors that affect the regional distribution of P. insularum, while simultaneously presenting a spatial basis for the prediction of its future spread. Furthermore, the model for this species exemplifies that combining climatic and habitat variables is a powerful way to model distributions of invasive species.

AB Silviculture focuses on establishing forest stand conditions that improve the stand increment. Knowledge about the efficiency of an individual tree is essential to be able to establish stand structures that increase tree resource use efficiency and stand level production. Efficiency is often expressed as stem growth per unit leaf area (leaf area efficiency), or per unit of light absorbed (light use efficiency). We tested the hypotheses that: (I) volume increment relates more closely with crown light absorption than leaf area, since one unit of leaf area can receive different amounts of light due to competition with neighboring trees and self-shading, (2) dominant trees use light more efficiently than suppressed trees and (3) thinning increases the efficiency of light use by residual trees, partially accounting for commonly observed increases in post-thinning growth. We investigated eight even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) stands at Barnkopf, Austria, spanning three age classes (mature, immature and pole-stage) and two thinning regimes (thinned and unthinned). Individual leaf area was calculated with allometric equations and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation was estimated for each tree using the three-dimensional crown model MAESTRA. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation was only a slightly better predictor of volume increment than leaf area. Light use efficiency increased with increasing tree size in all stands, supporting the second hypothesis. At a given tree size, trees from the unthinned plots were more efficient, however, due to generally larger tree sizes in the thinned stands, an average tree from the thinned treatment was superior (not congruent in all plots, thus only partly supporting the third hypothesis).

AB Background: Regardless of the growing interest in detecting population structures in malarial parasites, there have been limited discussions on how to use this concept in control programmes. In such context, the effects of the parasite population structures will depend on interventions' spatial or temporal scales. This investigation explores the problem of identifying genetic markers, in this case microsatellites, to unveil Plasmodium genetic structures that could affect decisions in the context of elimination. The study was performed in a low-transmission area, which offers a good proxy to better understand problems associated with surveillance at the final stages of malaria elimination.
   Methods: Plasmodium vivax samples collected in Tumeremo, Venezuela, between March 2003 and November 2004 were analysed. Since Plasmodium falciparum also circulates in many low endemic areas, P. falciparum samples from the same locality and time period were included for comparison. Plasmodium vivax samples were assayed for an original set of 25 microsatellites and P. falciparum samples were assayed for 12 microsatellites.
   Results: Not all microsatellite loci assayed offered reliable local data. A complex temporal-cluster dynamics is found in both P. vivax and P. falciparum. Such dynamics affect the numbers and the type of microsatellites required for identifying individual parasites or parasite clusters when performing cross-sectional studies. The minimum number of microsatellites required to differentiate circulating P. vivax clusters differs from the minimum number of hyper-variable microsatellites required to distinguish individuals within these clusters. Regardless the extended number of microsatellites used in P. vivax, it was not possible to separate all individual infections.
   Conclusions: Molecular surveillance has great potential; however, it requires preliminary local studies in order to properly interpret the emerging patterns in the context of elimination. Clonal expansions and clusters turnovers need to be taken into account when using molecular markers. Those affect the number and type of microsatellite markers, as well as, the expected genetic patterns in the context of operational investigations. By considering the local dynamics, elimination programmes could cost-effectively use molecular markers. However, population level studies need to consider the local limitations of a given set of loci in terms of providing epidemiologically relevant information.

AB There is a long tradition of river monitoring using taxonomy-based metrics to assess environmental quality in Europe via benthic macroinvertebrate communities. A promising alternative is the use of their species life-history traits. Both methods (taxonomy-based and trait-based), however, have relied on the time-consuming identification of taxa. River biotopes, (i.e. 1-100 m(2) 'habitats' with associated species assemblages), have long been seen as a useful and meaningful way of linking the ecology of macroinvertebrates and river hydro-morphology and can be used to assess hydro-morphological degradation in rivers. However, between-river taxonomic differences, especially at large spatial scale, had prevented a general test of this concept until now. The species trait approach may overcome this obstacle across broad geographical areas, using biotopes as the hydro-morphological units which have characteristic species trait assemblages. We collected macroinvertebrate data from discrete 512 patches, comprising 13 river biotopes, from seven rivers in England and Wales. The aim was to test whether river biotopes were better predictors of macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition (genera, families, orders) in rivers, independently of the phylogenetic effects and catchment scale characteristics (i.e. hydrology, geography and land cover). We also tested whether species richness and diversity were better related to biotopes than to rivers. River biotopes explained 40% of the variance in macroinvertebrate trait profiles across the rivers, largely independently of catchment characteristics. There was a strong phylogenetic signature, however. River biotopes were better at predicting macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition across rivers, whatever the taxonomic resolution. River biotopes were better than river identity at explaining the variability in taxonomic richness and diversity (40% and <= 10%, respectively). Detailed trait-biotope associations agreed with independent a priori predictions relating trait categories to near river bed flows. Hence, species traits provided a much needed mechanistic understanding and predictive ability across a broad geographical area. We show that integration of the multiple biological trait approach with river biotopes at the interface between ecology and hydro-morphology provides a wealth of new information and potential applications for river science and management.

AB Wolves (Canis lupus) belong to 3 genetically distinct subpopulations despite the absence of topographic barriers limiting dispersal. Based on data on wolf diets from 13 localities and wolf kill remains from a national-scale census, we investigated regional variation in wolf diet in relation to species structure of ungulate communities and spatial genetic differentiation of wolf populations. We also tested if various sources of data on wolf prey (scats and kills) and availability of ungulates (game inventory and harvest) yielded comparable results on prey selection. The main prey of wolves was red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). The proportion of main prey in wolf diets increased with prey availability in the community, yet wolves selected red deer, preyed on roe deer proportionally to their relative abundance, and avoided wild boar. Large prey was recorded among kills more often than small prey. Despite similar species structure of ungulate communities throughout Poland, there were significant regional differences in wolf diet, which corresponded to the genetic structure of populations. In northeastern Poland, wolves frequently hunted red deer, roe deer, wild boar, beavers (Castor fiber), and moose (Alces alces). In eastern Poland, roe deer dominated kills. In southeastern Poland, wolves were strongly specialized on red deer. We propose that prey and habitat specialization of wolves, rather than geographic distance or topographic barriers to dispersal, are responsible for the observed ecological divergence of wolf populations, as reflected in their diet composition.

AB Consistent behavioral variation within and between individuals is ubiquitous in all working dog populations. Most working dog programs have recognized this fact, and have subsequently attempted to quantify behavior through the use of standardized tests. Standardized tests may employ several measurement methods, but two common ones are behavioral ratings and subjective ratings. The former is characterized by a rating for a behavior (e.g., reaction to a noise) usually based on a single observation or test; the latter is characterized by a rating for a trait (e.g., confidence) that is based across multiple observations of behavior. The main difference between the two rating methods is the level of aggregation, or intuition, that is required by the human observer. Measurement theory predicts that ratings based on multiple observations (i.e., subjective ratings) should be more reliable because measurement error is reduced. However, subjective ratings, by definition, may be susceptible to observer bias, in which case ratings based on fewer, but better-defined observations (i.e., behavioral ratings) could result in greater reliability. In either case, the ultimate criterion of most working dog programs is the predictive validity of measured behaviors in standardized tests. To the best of our knowledge, the relative predictive validity of subjective and behavioral ratings has yet to be tested within the same working dog population. Here we analyzed behavioral test results along with training outcomes from a large sample (similar to 400) of German shepherd dogs, aged 15-18 months, all bred at the Swedish Armed Forces breeding kennel. Behaviors observed in the test were measured using 25 behavioral and 13 subjective ratings. Data reduction and confirmatory techniques identified five underlying dimensions in behavioral ratings (confidence, physical engagement, social engagement, aggression, and environmental sureness) and three in subjective ratings (engagement, confidence, and aggression). Both ratings methods correctly classified a high percentage of dogs that did/did not complete training (70.3-78.3%). However, only minor differences in predictive validity were observed between the two measurement methods (1.7-6.6%). Engagement and confidence, irrespective of measurement method, were the strongest predictors of training completion, but the two ratings methods identified different aspects of engagement and confidence that may be important to training outcomes in this and other working dog programs. Taken together, our results suggest that in some cases, the use of subjective versus behavioral ratings may be inconsequential from the standpoint of prediction to training criterion. Further empirical verification is needed, along with improvements in the explicit definition and measurement of 'success' in this and other working dog programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The decline of biodiversity is one of the major current global issues. Still, there is a widespread lack of information about the spatial distribution of individual species and biodiversity as a whole. Remote sensing techniques are increasingly used for biodiversity monitoring and especially the combination of LiDAR and hyperspectral data is expected to deliver valuable information. In this study spatial patterns of vascular plant community composition and alpha-diversity of a temperate montane forest in Germany were analysed for different forest strata. The predictive power of LiDAR (LiD) and hyperspectral (MNF) datasets alone and combined (MNF+LiD) was compared using random forest regression in a ten-fold cross-validation scheme that included feature selection and model tuning. The final models were used for spatial predictions. Species richness could be predicted with varying accuracy (R-2 = 0.2 6 to 0.55) depending on the forest layer. In contrast, community composition of the different layers, obtained by multivariate ordination, could in part be modelled with high accuracies for the first ordination axis (R-2 = 0.39 to 0.78), but poor accuracies for the second axis (R-2 <= 0.3). LiDAR variables were the best predictors for total species richness across all forest layers (R-LiD(2) = 0.3, R-MNF(2) = 0.08, R-MNF+LiD(2) = 0.2), while for community composition across all forest layers both hyperspectral and LiDAR predictors achieved similar performances (R-LiD(2) = 0.75, R-MNF(2) = 0.76, R-MNF+LiD(2) = 0.7 8). The improvement in R-2 was small (<= 0.07)-if any-when using both LiDAR and hyperspectral data as compared to using only the best single predictor set. This study shows the high potential of LiDAR and hyperspectral data for plant biodiversity modelling, but also calls for a critical evaluation of the added value of combining both with respect to acquisition costs.

AB Spatial analyses are indispensable analytical tools in biogeography and macroecology. In a recent Guest Editorial, Hawkins (Journal of Biogeography, 2012, 39, 19) raised several issues related to spatial analyses. While we concur with some points, we here clarify those confounding (1) spatial trends and spatial autocorrelation, and (2) spatial autocorrelation in the response variable and in the residuals. We argue that recognizing spatial autocorrelation in statistical modelling is not only a crucial step in model diagnostics, but that disregarding it is essentially wrong.

AB This paper examines the state of knowledge about the effects of prescribed burning on surface runoff and erosion at point to catchment scales in forests and shrublands. Fires can increase surface runoff and erosion by removing vegetation, changing soil hydrologic properties and providing a readily erodible layer of sediment and ash. Catchment-scale studies in prescribed-burnt areas usually report minimal impacts from the burn. However, measurements at smaller spatial scales suggest that large changes to hydrologic properties and processes do occur, and a debris-flow example from Australia demonstrates that large catchment-scale impacts are possible. It appears that existing catchment-scale studies in prescribed burns do not capture these large events as the sample size (i.e. number of studies) is too small relative to the infrequency of such events. Furthermore, numerous knowledge gaps across all spatial scales limit understanding of the processes contributing to post-prescribed burn runoff and erosion. Understanding the influence of fire regime characteristics on post-fire runoff and erosion is particularly important in the context of prescribed burning, as fire regimes can be manipulated to reduce erosion and water-quality impacts. Therefore, two directions for future research are recommended: (1) process-based studies to understand the factors controlling surface runoff and erosion, particularly in relation to aspects of the fire regime; and (2) landscape-scale surveys to quantify large erosion events.

   BIOASSESSMENT; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; DIFFERENTIATION
AB Spatial variation in extinction and colonization is expected to influence community composition over time. In stream fish communities, local species richness (alpha diversity) and species turnover (beta diversity) are thought to be regulated by high extinction rates in headwater streams and high colonization rates in downstream areas. We evaluated the spatiotemporal structure of fish communities in streams originally surveyed by Burton and Odum 1945 (Ecology 26: 182194) in Virginia, USA and explored the effects of species traits on extinction and colonization dynamics. We documented dramatic changes in fish community structure at both the site and stream scales. Of the 34 fish species observed, 20 (59%) were present in both time periods, but 11 (32%) colonized the study area and three (9%) were extirpated over time. Within streams, alpha diversity increased in two of three streams but beta diversity decreased dramatically in all streams due to fish community homogenization caused by colonization of common species and extirpation of rare species. Among streams, however, fish communities differentiated over time. Regression trees indicated that reproductive life-history traits such as spawning mound construction, associations with mound-building species, and high fecundity were important predictors of species persistence or colonization. Conversely, native fishes not associated with mound-building exhibited the highest rates of extirpation from streams. Our results demonstrate that stream fish colonization and extinction dynamics exhibit hierarchical spatial structure and suggest that mound-building fishes serve as keystone species for colonization of headwater streams.

AB Knowledge of oil-induced impacts from the literature and experts were used to develop a Bayesian network to evaluate the biological consequences of an oil accident in the low-saline Gulf of Finland (GOF). Analysis was carried out for selected groups of organisms. Subnetworks were divided into subgroups according to a predicted response to oil exposure. Two scenario analyses are presented: the most probable and the worst-case accident.
   The impact of the most probable accident in the GOF is rather small. In most of the groups studied oil-induced long-term effects are evaluated to be minor at least from the perspective of the whole GOF. After the worst-case accident negative effects are more likely. The model predicts that the most vulnerable groups are auks and ducks. Amphipods, gulls and to a lesser extend littoral fishes and seals may show delayed recovery after an accident. Also annual plant species may be susceptible to oil-induced (C) disturbances. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last decade, cryptic speciation has been discovered in an increasing number of taxa. Species complexes are useful models for the understanding of speciation processes. Motivated by the discovery of brooding specimens in the common Atlanto-Mediterranean broadcast spawning brittle star, Ophioderma longicauda, a recent study revealed the occurrence of divergent mitochondrial lineages. We analysed 218 specimens from 23 locations spread over the geographic range of the species with partial Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences. A subset of this sample was also surveyed with the internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA cluster (nuclear ITS-1). Our study revealed six highly divergent mitochondrial lineages, and the ITS-1 data confirmed that they most likely represent a species complex. Geographic ranges, abundances and genetic structures are contrasted among the putative cryptic species. Lineages in which brooding specimens have been found form a monophyletic group and are restricted to the Eastern Mediterranean basin, an oligotrophic zone. A phylogeny-trait association analysis revealed a phylogenetic signal for low 'chlorophyll a' values (our proxy for oligotrophy). An ecological shift related to the hyper oligotrophy of the Eastern Mediterranean region is therefore likely to have played a role in the evolution of brooding. This study revealed that a complex mixture of vicariance, population expansion, adaptive divergence and possibly high local diversification rates resulting from brooding has shaped the evolution of this species complex. The dating analysis showed that these events probably occurred in the Pleistocene epoch.

AB A positive effect of (meta)population density on emigration has been predicted by many theoretical models and confirmed empirically in various organisms. However, in butterflies, the most popular species for dispersal studies, the evidence for its existence has so far been equivocal, with negative relationships between density and emigration being reported more frequently. We analysed dispersal in sympatric metapopulations of two Maculinea butterflies, intensively surveyed with mark-release-recapture methods for 7 years. Dispersal parameters, derived using the virtual migration model, were assessed against butterfly densities, which fluctuated strongly over the study period. Emigration was positively correlated with density, and this effect was particularly strong at densities above carrying capacity, when emigration increased up to threefold in females and twofold in males compared with the normal levels. In turn, density had little impact on other dispersal parameters analysed. Our findings provide good evidence for positive density-dependence of emigration in butterflies. Emigrating at high densities is particularly beneficial for females, because it gives them a chance to lay part of their egg-load in less crowded patches, where offspring survival is higher due to lower intraspecific competition. Even though the rise in emigration becomes considerable at densities exceeding carrying capacity, i.e. relatively infrequently, it still has serious implications for many ecological phenomena, such as species range expansions, gene flow, and metapopulation persistence. Consequently, instead of treating emigration as a fixed trait, it is worth allowing for its density-dependence in applications such as population viability analyses, genetic models or metapopulation models.

AB The Mediterranean bath sponge Spongia officinalis is an iconic species with high socioeconomic value and precarious future owing to unregulated harvesting, mortality incidents and lack of established knowledge regarding its ecology. This study aims to assess genetic diversity and population structure of the species at different geographical scales throughout its distribution. For this purpose, 11 locations in the Eastern Mediterranean (Aegean Sea), Western Mediterranean (Provence coast) and the Strait of Gibraltar were sampled; specimens were analysed using partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences, along with a set of eight microsatellite loci. According to our results (i) no genetic differentiation exists among the acknowledged Mediterranean morphotypes, and hence, S. officinalis can be viewed as a single, morphologically variable species; (ii) a notable divergence was recorded in the Gibraltar region, indicating the possible existence of a cryptic species; (iii) restriction to gene flow was evidenced between the Aegean Sea and Provence giving two well-defined regional clusters, thus suggesting the existence of a phylogeographic break between the two systems; (iv) low levels of genetic structure, not correlated to geographical distance, were observed inside geographical sectors, implying mechanisms (natural or anthropogenic) that enhance dispersal and gene flow have promoted population connectivity; (v) the genetic diversity of S. officinalis is maintained high in most studied locations despite pressure from harvesting and the influence of devastating epidemics. These findings provide a basis towards the effective conservation and management of the species.

AB Individuals with reduced body mass resulting from early nutritional stress often compensate for this later in growth. This compensatory growth can be beneficial as individuals adjust their body mass to the level of individuals that grew up under better conditions. Yet, compensatory growth can also result in costs that are paid later in life. In zebra finches raised under different nutritional conditions, we tested whether compensatory growth affects subsequent adult exploratory behaviour, a proxy for an avian personality trait. We tested their exploratory behaviour in a spatial test to find hidden food on 2 consecutive days. The behavioural measures of exploration correlated with each other across time showing a high individual behavioural consistency. Early nutritional treatment itself did not affect exploration and feeding. Yet, birds with higher previous compensatory growth were less active and approached the food with different latencies from birds with lower compensatory growth. Life history decisions on whether to compensate for a bad start or stay small thus result in elementary differences in behaviour, such as exploratory behaviour, with potential fitness consequences, depending on payoffs of explorative strategies in different environmental conditions.

AB The functional response is a critical link between consumer and resource dynamics, describing how a consumer's feeding rate varies with prey density. Functional response models often assume homogenous prey size and size-independent feeding rates. However, variation in prey size due to ontogeny and competition is ubiquitous, and predation rates are often size dependent. Thus, functional responses that ignore prey size may not effectively predict predation rates through ontogeny or in heterogeneous populations. Here, we use short-term response-surface experiments and statistical modeling to develop and test prey size-dependent functional responses for water bugs and dragonfly larvae feeding on red-eyed treefrog tadpoles. We then extend these models through simulations to predict mortality through time for growing prey. Both conventional and size-dependent functional response models predicted average overall mortality in short-term mixed-cohort experiments, but only the size-dependent models accurately captured how mortality was spread across sizes. As a result, simulations that extrapolated these results through prey ontogeny showed that differences in size-specific mortality are compounded as prey grow, causing predictions from conventional and size-dependent functional response models to diverge dramatically through time. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating prey size when modeling consumer-prey dynamics in size-structured, growing prey populations.

AB Participatory approaches are often suggested to increase sustainability and adaptability of conservation programs because they are assumed to build capacity of participants to learn and manage projects. This article compares participatory projects with different styles of management to determine whether increasing the extent or quality of engagement of participants affects the degree to which they learn. The results show that: (1) Participants in all projects learnt something, but the extent of learning was overall highest for projects with greatest engagement; (2) The length of time participants were involved in a project did not influence how much they learned; and (3) a range of factors relating to engagement influenced learning outcomes. The results suggest that if capacity building is a desired outcome of participation, then it pays to invest in high levels of engagement right from the outset. More research to help understand the processes involved in enhancing learning is required.

AB Habitat loss threatens large mammals worldwide, and their survival will depend on habitat in human-dominated landscapes. Conservation planners thus face the challenge to identify areas of least conflict with land use, yet broadscale species distribution models rarely incorporate real landscape patterns nor do they identify potential conservation conflicts. An excellent example of such conservation challenges is provided by European bison (Bison bonasus). Almost extinct by the early 20th century, bison can only survive in the wild if large metapopulations are established, but it is unclear where new herds can be reintroduced. Using European bison as an example we conducted a continental-scale habitat assessment based on real landscape patterns. Our specific aims here were to (1) map European bison habitat throughout the species' former range, (2) examine whether broadscale habitat suitability factors differ from previously reported fine-scale factors, and (3) assess where suitable habitat occurs in areas with low potential for conflict with land use. We assessed habitat suitability using herd range maps for all 36 free-ranging European bison herds as habitat use data. Habitat suitability maps were compared with maps of land cover, livestock density, agricultural constraints, and protected areas to assess potential conservation conflicts. Our models had high goodness of fit (AUC 0.941), and we found abundant potential bison habitat. European bison prefer mosaic-type landscapes, with a preference for broad-leaved and mixed forests. European bison metapopulations do not appear to be limited by habitat availability. However, most potential habitat occurred outside protected areas and has substantial potential for conservation conflicts. The most promising areas for establishing large bison metapopulations all occur in Eastern Europe (i.e., the Carpathians, the Belarus-Ukraine borderlands, and several regions in European Russia). The future of European bison and that of other large mammals in the wild thus clearly lies in Eastern Europe, because habitat there is most abundant and least fragmented, and because the potential for conflict with land use is lower. More generally we suggest that broadscale habitat assessments that incorporate land use can be powerful tools for conservation planning and will be key if large herbivore and carnivore conservation is to succeed in a human-dominated world.

AB In coupled social-ecological systems, the same driving forces can result in combined social and environmental health inequities, hazards, and impacts. Policies that decrease social inequities and improve social cohesion, however, also have the potential to improve health outcomes and to minimize and offset the drivers of ecosystem change. Actions that address both biophysical and social environments have the potential to create a "double dividend" that improves human health, while also promoting sustainable development. One promising approach to managing the complex, reciprocal interactions among ecosystems, society, and health is the integration of the ecohealth approach (which holds that human health and well-being are both dependent on ecosystems and are important outcomes of ecosystem management) with watershed-based water resources management. Using key management concepts such as resilience, such approaches can help reduce vulnerability to natural hazards, maintain ecological flows of water and the provision of other ecological services, and promote long-term sustainability of coupled human and natural systems. Priorities for understanding and realizing health benefits of watershed management include (i) addressing poverty and reducing inequities, (ii) promoting resilience (for health) in watersheds, and (iii) applying watersheds as a context for intersectoral management tools and policy integration. Examples of work linking health and watershed management demonstrate that not only is appreciation of complex systems important, but an effective approach is participatory and transdisciplinary and gives attention to equity and historical context.

AB Few well-dated, quantitative Holocene temperature reconstructions exist from high-altitude sites in the Central Eastern Alps. Here, we present a chironomid-based quantitative reconstruction of mean July air temperatures (T-July) throughout the Holocene for a remote high-mountain lake, Schwarzsee ob Solden, situated above the treeline at 2796 m a.s.l. in the Austrian Alps. Applying a chironomid-temperature inference model developed from lakes of the Alpine region to a high-resolution chironomid record from the lake provides evidence for early Holocene (ca 10000-8600 cal yr BP) T-July of up to 8.5 degrees C i.e. >4 degrees C above the modern (1977-2006) mean July temperature. The reconstruction reveals the so-called '8.2-ka cold event' centered at ca 8250-8000 cal yr BP with temperatures ca 3 degrees C below the early-Holocene thermal maximum. Rather warm (ca 6 degrees C) and productive conditions prevailed during ca 7900-4500 cal yr BP. The chironomid record suggests a climate transition between ca 5200 and 4500 cal yr BP to cooler T-July. A distinct cooling trend is evident from ca 4500 until ca 2500 cal yr BP. Thereafter, the study site experienced its coldest conditions (around 4 degrees C or less) throughout the rest of the Holocene, with the exception of the warming trend during the late 20th century. Beside other factors, the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation seems to be the major driving force for the long-term trends in T-July at high altitudes in the Eastern Alps. Due to the extreme location of the lake and the limited temperature range represented by the applied calibration data set, the chironomid-based temperature reconstruction fails to track phases of the late-Holocene climatic history with T-July cooler than 4 degrees C. Further chironomid-based palaeoclimate model and down-core studies are required to address this problem, provide more realistic T-July estimates from undisturbed high-altitude lakes in the Alps, and extract a reliable regional temperature signal.

AB There is a growing recognition of the need to incorporate multiple values in environmental management plans. While biological and, increasingly, economic values are considered in the design of management strategies, community or stakeholder values are not often taken into account. We mapped stakeholders' values for marine ecosystems and assessed their preferences for the location and type of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the coast of Wales (UK). Stakeholders were chosen to represent a comprehensive range of interests in the marine environment. Fourteen different types of value were identified by stakeholders. The spatial distribution of the different values attached to the marine environment was ascertained; this revealed the existence of areas where multiple values overlapped. Results indicated that areas perceived as ecologically important also possessed high heritage and leisure values. When locating MPAs, stakeholders balanced conservation needs with societal demands by protecting areas identified as ecologically important while avoiding those areas where restrictions could have a considerable impact on society. Data suggested a preference for MPAs that permitted a range of adequately regulated anthropogenic activities. The distribution of stakeholders' values and the identification of areas of multiple value help managers to understand the potential consequences of particular management strategies, and allow them to be aware of the location of areas where greater consideration is required when designing management plans, as multiple interests may overlap. Thus, mapping stakeholders' values in the marine environment provides a useful tool for identifying areas better suited for specific management regulations and for the development of comprehensive marine spatial plans, as these require the understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of the different ecosystem components including both ecological and human elements.

AB Self-fertilization is hypothesized to be an evolutionary dead end because reversion to outcrossing can rarely happen, and selfing lineages are thought to rapidly become extinct because of limited potential for adaptation and/or accumulation of deleterious mutations. We tested these two assumptions by combining morphological characters and molecular-evolution analyses in a tribe of hermaphroditic grasses (Triticeae). First, we determined the mating system of the 19 studied species. Then, we sequenced 27 protein-coding loci and compared base composition and substitution patterns between selfers and outcrossers. We found that the evolution of the mating system is best described by a model including outcrossing-to-selfing transitions only. At the molecular level, we showed that regions of low recombination exhibit signatures of relaxed selection. However, we did not detect any evidence of accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions in selfers compared to outcrossers. Additionally, we tested for the potential deleterious effects of GC-biased gene conversion in outcrossing species. We found that recombination and not the mating system affected substitution patterns and base composition. We suggest that, in Triticeae, although recombination patterns have remained stable, selfing lineages are of recent origin and inbreeding may have persisted for insufficient time for differences between the two mating systems to evolve.

AB Theory predicts that hybrid fitness should decrease as population divergence increases. This suggests that the effects of human-induced hybridization might be adequately predicted from the known divergence among parental populations. We tested this prediction by quantifying trait differentiation between multigenerational crosses of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and divergent wild populations from the Northwest Atlantic; the former escape repeatedly into the wild, while the latter are severely depleted. Under common environmental conditions and at the spatiotemporal scale considered (340 km, 12 000 years of divergence), substantial cross differentiation had a largely additive genetic basis at behavioral, life history, and morphological traits. Wild backcrossing did not completely restore hybrid trait distributions to presumably more optimal wild states. Consistent with theory, the degree to which hybrids deviated in absolute terms from their parental populations increased with increasing parental divergence (i.e., the collective environmental and life history differentiation, genetic divergence, and geographic distance between parents). Nevertheless, while these differences were predictable, their implications for risk assessment were not: wild populations that were equally divergent from farmed salmon in the total amount of divergence differed in the specific traits at which this divergence occurred. Combined with ecological data on the rate of farmed escapes and wild population trends, we thus suggest that the greatest utility of hybridization data for risk assessment may be through their incorporation into demographic modeling of the short- and long-term consequences to wild population persistence. In this regard, our work demonstrates that detailed hybridization data are essential to account for life-stage-specific changes in phenotype or fitness within divergent but interrelated groups of wild populations. The approach employed here will be relevant to risk assessments in a range of wild species where hybridization with domesticated relatives is a concern, especially where the conservation status of the wild species may preclude direct fitness comparisons in the wild.

AB Multitrophic interactions play key roles in the origin and maintenance of species diversity, and the study of these interactions has contributed to important theoretical advances in ecology and evolutionary biology. Nevertheless, most biodiversity inventories focus on static species lists, and prominent theories of diversity still ignore trophic interactions. The lack of a simple interaction metric that is analogous to species richness is one reason why diversity of interactions is not examined as a response or predictor variable in diversity studies. Using plant-herbivore-enemy trophic chains as an example, we develop a simple metric of diversity in which richness, diversity indices (e.g., Simpson's 1/D), and rarefaction diversity are calculated with links as the basic unit rather than species. Interactions include all two-link (herbivore-plant and enemy-herbivore) and three-link (enemy-herbivore-plant) chains found in a study unit. This metric is different from other indices, such as traditional diversity measures, connectivity and interaction diversity in food-web studies, and the diversity of interaction index in behavioral studies, and it is easier to compute. Using this approach to studying diversity provides novel insight into debates about neutrality and correlations between diversity, stability, productivity, and ecosystem services.

AB Habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and habitat degradation are the greatest threats to mammals in Europe and the rest of the world. Despite the fact that extensive literature exists, no comprehensive review or synthesis is available to date and this may slow down scientific progress and hamper conservation efforts.
   The goal of this study is to understand if and in what direction progress has been made in the study of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on the spatial distribution of European terrestrial mammals. Firstly, we carry out a general synthesis which is structured around 11 key points. The aim of this point-by-point analysis is to identify trends, knowledge gaps and any significant bias in the available literature, and to highlight strengths and shortfalls of the different approaches which have to date been applied. Secondly, we follow a species-specific systematic approach: for each species, we synthesise key results.
   Our results show how substantial progress has been hampered for several reasons including: a large predominance of small-scale field studies of short duration, and a generalised lack of control of: (i) confounding variables; (ii) spatial autocorrelation; and (iii) false absences. Also, despite the relatively high number of studies, few were theoretical studies and even fewer were meta-analyses. The lack of meta-analyses is likely to be due to the small amount of crucial details included in the publications, such as model parameters or information on the landscape context (such as the amount of residual forest cover).
   We synthesise the main results for 14 species. The level of progress is highly variable: for some species, such as the red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, a series of long-term, large-scale process-oriented studies has allowed an in-depth understanding of its ecology in fragmented landscapes. On the other hand, with other species such as the bank vole Myodes glareolus, despite a relatively large number of field studies, little progress has been made.

AB Vulnerability of 100 European butterfly species to climate change was assessed using 13 different criteria and data on species distributions, climate, land cover and topography from 1,608 grid squares 30' x 60' in size, and species characteristics increasing the susceptibility to climate change. Four bioclimatic model-based criteria were developed for each species by comparing the present-day distribution and climatic suitability of the occupied grid cells with projected distribution and suitability in the future using the HadCM3-A2 climate scenario for 2051-2080. The proportions of disadvantageous land cover types (bare areas, water, snow and ice, artificial surfaces) and cultivated and managed land in the occupied grid squares and their surroundings were measured to indicate the amount of unfavourable land cover and dispersal barriers for butterflies, and topographical heterogeneity to indicate the availability of potential climatic refugia. Vulnerability was also assessed based on species dispersal ability, geographical localization and habitat specialization. Northern European species appeared to be amongst the most vulnerable European butterflies. However, there is much species-to-species variation, and species appear to be threatened due to different combinations of critical characteristics. Inclusion of additional criteria, such as life-history species characteristics, topography and land cover to complement the bioclimatic model-based species vulnerability measures can significantly deepen the assessments of species susceptibility to climate change.

AB A tree ring-width record spanning from AD 1377-1998 was developed from Tibetan juniper (Cupressus gigantea) growing at sites north of the deep gorge of the Yarlung Tsangbo River of southeast Tibet. A linear regression model between ring width and mean January-June temperature accounts for 35% of January-June temperature variance for the period 1961-1998. Based on this model, we reconstructed January-June temperature variation history for the study region during the past 622 years. Warm conditions occurred during AD 1385-1418, 1443-1466, 1482-1501, 1523-1548, 1570s, 1705-1759, 1770-1790, 1851-1888, 1910s, and 1938-1965, and periods of relatively cold years are identified for AD 1419-1442, 1470s, 1502-1522, 1550-1569, 1610-1640, 1680-1700, 1760s, 1791-1850, 1900s and 1965-1995. Spatial correlation between tree rings and observed temperatures indicates that the reconstruction is representative of temperature change for southeast Tibet. Regional cold conditions during AD 1625, 1685, 1760, 1800-1850, 1890-1930 and 1965-1995, and warm conditions during 1710, 1730-1750, 1850-1890 and 1930-1960 can be identified in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our reconstruction shows good agreement with modelled regional temperatures derived from an ECHO-G model simulation. Common cold periods around 1470, 1685 and 1845 corresponding to the Sporer Minimum, the Maunder Minimum and the Dalton Minimum periods of low solar activity and increased volcanic activity were identified, indicating that solar and volcanic activity played an important role in temperature change of this region. The discrepancy between modelled and reconstructed temperatures was noted around 1965, reflecting that temperature decrease in the late 20th century (1965-1995) is anomalous.

AB P>1. Testing the comparative strength and influence of age and area of islands, proximity of source propagules and disturbances on community assembly, species diversity and vegetation structure has proved difficult at large scales. The little-studied rain forests in the Tropical South Pacific (TSP) provide a unique study area to investigate determinants of community dynamics, with islands varying in age, isolation, area and cyclone frequency. We tested the effects of biogeographical factors and cyclone frequency on the species composition, species diversity and forest structure of old-growth rain forest using 1-ha inventory plots on 12 islands between New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.
   2. As predicted by the General Dynamic Model of Oceanic Island Biogeography, the biogeographical variables of archipelago age and island area are the most important factors affecting species richness and diversity, with older and larger islands having higher richness and diversity. There is no significant effect of cyclone frequency on species diversity.
   3. The theory that diversity drives endemism is not supported in this system as endemism is not correlated with species diversity. Instead, age and isolation of an island best explain patterns of endemism, with the latter suggesting dispersal limitations between archipelagos.
   4. Proximity to source area influences species composition of lowland tropical rain forests in the TSP, which is also supported by a strong correlation between geographic distance and floristic similarity. Vector-fitting onto non-metric multidimensional scaling suggests that archipelago age and cyclone frequency may, in addition to proximity to source area, influence species composition. This implies that a species' tolerance to cyclones affects its abundance at different cyclone frequencies.
   5. Synthesis. Both biogeographical variables (island area and isolation) and cyclone frequency appear to affect community assembly in lowland rain forests in the TSP. While species are hence not ecologically equivalent, interspecific ecological differences do not seem to affect the overall patterns of species diversity, which are mostly determined by biogeographical variables, as predicted by the neutral theory.

AB P> Shallow lakes and ponds contribute disproportionally to species richness relative to other aquatic ecosystems. In-lake conditions (e.g. presence of submerged plants) seem to play a key role in determining diversity, as has been demonstrated for temperate lakes. When water quality deteriorates and turbidity increases, conditions in such lakes are affected drastically resulting in a loss of diversity. However, it is not clear whether subtropical lakes show the same pattern and whether the richness of all groups reacts similarly to environmental changes.
   Our aim was to analyse the main factors explaining patterns of species richness in plankton, fish and submerged macrophyte assemblages in both turbid and clear subtropical shallow lakes. We analysed abiotic and biotic features of 18 subtropical, small- to medium-sized, shallow lakes along the Uruguayan coast. We compared both turbid and clear ecosystem states and evaluated the relative variance explained by the factors measured.
   Variables describing lake and catchment morphology, as well as the percentage of the water column occupied by submerged macrophytes (%PVI) and water turbidity, had strong effects on taxon richness. Interestingly, individual biotic groups had dissimilar richness patterns. Macrophyte %PVI decreased with increasing lake area, while fish species richness showed the opposite pattern. Phytoplankton species richness increased with macrophyte %PVI, while the zooplankton richness pattern varied depending on the taxonomic group considered.
   Overall, our results indicate that, as found for temperate lakes, a greater submerged plant cover promotes higher species richness in several groups, and that this may overwhelm the otherwise expected positive effect of lake size on species richness. On the other hand, small-bodied zooplankton predominated in lakes with high plant abundance. Our findings concur with recent studies, indicating that refuge capacity of aquatic plants might be weaker in (sub)tropical than in temperate shallow lakes.
   The extremely high plant cover, frequently observed in warm lakes, could potentially lead to different richness patterns in some groups. This conclusion has important consequences for local managers and conservationists.

AB Myco-heterotrophic plants are partly or entirely non-photosynthetic plants that obtain energy and nutrients from fungi. These plants form a symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi to meet their nutrient demands.
   This Botanical Briefing summarizes current knowledge about myco-heterotrophy, discusses its controversial aspects and highlights future directions for research.
   Considerable recent progress has been made in terms of understanding the evolutionary history, germination and nutrition of myco-heterotrophic plants. Myco-heterotrophic plants: (1) are diverse and often ancient lineages that have coevolved with fungi, (2) often demonstrate unusually high specificity towards fungi during germination and maturity, and (3) can either cheat common mycorrhizal networks supported by neighbouring photosynthetic plants to satisfy all or part of their energetic and nutritional needs, or recruit free-living saprotrophic fungi into novel mycorrhizal symbioses. However, several fundamental aspects of myco-heterotrophy remain controversial or unknown, such as symbiotic costs and physiology.

AB The dynamics of the Lesina coastal lagoon (Italy) in terms of nutrients, phytoplankton and chemical-physical parameters were evaluated, together with their functional relationships with freshwater inputs, in order to identify ecosystem responses to changes in driving forces in a Mediterranean non-tidal lentic environment. Lesina Lagoon is a shallow coastal environment characterised by limited exchange with coastal waters, which favours enrichment of nutrients and organic matter and benthic fluxes within the system. Lagoon-sea exchanges are influenced by human management. There is a steep salinity gradient from East to West. High nitrogen and silica values were found close to freshwater inputs, indicating wastewater discharges and agricultural runoff, especially in winter. Dissolved oxygen was well below saturation (65%) near sewage and runoff inputs in the western part of the lagoon during summer. Classification in accordance with EEA (2001) guidelines suggests the system is of "poor" or "bad" quality in terms of nitrogen concentrations in the eastern zone during the winter rainy period. In terms of phosphate concentrations, the majority of the stations fall into the "good" category, with only two stations (close to the sewage and runoff inputs) classed as "bad". In both cases, the raw nitrogen levels make the lagoon a P-limited system, especially in the eastern part. There was wide space-time variability in chlorophyll a concentrations, which ranged from 0.25 to 56 mu g l(-1). No relationships between chlorophyll a and nutrients were found, suggesting that autotrophic biomass may be controlled by a large number of internal and external forcing factors driving eutrophication processes. Water quality for this type of environment depends heavily on pressure from human activities but also on the management of sewage treatment plants, agricultural practices and the channels connecting the lagoon with the sea.

AB The ridge and slough landscape of the Florida Everglades consists of a mosaic of linear sawgrass ridges separated by deeper-water sloughs with tree islands interspersed throughout the landscape. We used pollen assemblages from transects of sediment cores spanning sawgrass ridges, sloughs, and ridge-slough transition zones to determine the timing of ridge and slough formation and to evaluate the response of components of the ridge and slough landscape to climate variability and 20th-century water management. These pollen data indicate that sawgrass ridges and sloughs have been vegetationally distinct from one another since initiation of the Everglades wetland in mid-Holocene time. Although the position and community composition of sloughs have remained relatively stable throughout their history, modern sawgrass ridges formed on sites that originally were occupied by marshes. Ridge formation and maturation were initiated during intervals of drier climate (the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age) when the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone shifted southward. During these drier intervals, marsh taxa were more common in sloughs, but they quickly receded when precipitation increased. Comparison with regional climate records suggests that slough vegetation is strongly influenced by North Atlantic Oscillation variability, even under 20th-century water management practices.

AB We studied the parasitoid complex of Bactrocera oleae Rossi (Diptera: Tephritidae) in order to analyse the parasitism response to landscape structure at different spatial extents. Olive fruits were sampled and incubated in the laboratory for insect emergence, thus allowing the calculation of parasitoid emergence rates. A landscape analysis was performed in five concentric buffers, ranging from 0.5 to 2 km diameter around the sampling points. Woodland was chosen as focal class. The percentage of landscape and the splitting index, a measure of fragmentation, were used to quantify landscape composition and configuration, respectively. Significant effects of landscape on parasitism rates were detected. In particular, the percent parasitoid emergence was negatively affected by the splitting index of woodland at a spatial extent ranging from 1 to 2 km. These findings suggest that landscape characteristics are likely to affect parasitoids in well-structured agroecosystems as well. In particular, connectivity at a large scale may favour B. oleae parasitoids more than the abundance of woodland. Potential implications for conservation biological control are discussed.

AB It has been hypothesized that species living in small lentic water bodies, because of the short-term geological persistence of their habitat, should show higher dispersal ability, with increased gene flow among populations and a less pronounced phylogeographical structure. Conversely, lotic species, living in more geologically stable habitats, should show reduced dispersal and an increased phylogeographical structure at the same geographical scales. In this work we tested the influence of habitat type in two groups of aquatic Coleoptera (Nebrioporus ceresyi and Ochthebius notabilis groups, families Dytiscidae and Hydraenidae respectively), each of them with closely related species typical of lotic and lentic saline Western Mediterranean water bodies. We used mitochondrial cox1 sequence data of 453 specimens of 77 populations through the range of nine species to compare a lotic vs. a lentic lineage in each of the two groups. Despite the differences in biology (predators vs. detritivorous) and evolutionary history, in both lotic lineages there was a higher proportion of nucleotide diversity among than within groups of populations, and a faster rate of accumulation of haplotype diversity (as measured by rarefaction curves) than in the lentic lineages. Similarly, lotic lineages had a higher absolute phylogenetic diversity, more remarkable considering their smaller absolute geographical ranges. By comparing closely related species, we were able to show the effect of contrasting habitat preferences in two different groups, in agreement with predictions derived from habitat stability.

AB Environmental variables can strongly influence a variety of intra- and inter-population processes, including demography, population structure and gene flow. When environmental conditions are particularly harsh for a certain species, investigating these effects is important to understanding how populations persist under difficult conditions. Furthermore, species inhabiting challenging environments present excellent opportunities to examine the effects of complex landscapes on population processes because these effects will often be more pronounced. In this study, I use 16 microsatellite loci to examine population structure, gene flow and demographic history in the black toad, Bufo exsul, which has one of the most restricted natural ranges of any amphibian. Bufo exsul inhabits four springs in the Deep Springs Valley high desert basin and has never been observed more than several meters from any source of water. My results reveal limited gene flow and moderately high levels of population structure (F-ST = 0.051-0.063) between all but the two closest springs. I found that the geographic distance across the arid scrub habitat between springs is significantly correlated with genetic structure when distance accounts for topography and barriers to dispersal. I also found very low effective population sizes (N-e = 7-30) and substantial evidence for historical population bottlenecks in all four populations. Together, these results suggest that the desert landscape and B. exsul's high habitat specificity contribute significantly to population structure and demography in this species and emphasize the importance of considering behavioural and landscape data in conservation genetic studies of natural systems.

AB P>Climate change in cold biomes not only involves higher summer temperatures, but also warmer springs and more winter precipitation. So far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal components of climate change.
   We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the responses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia, the deciduous dwarf shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus.
   We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios) going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to N-limited plant growth.
   The natural abundance of N-15 varied very strongly among species and growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms, but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5 parts per thousand). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen shrubs < deciduous shrubs.
   After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming effects.
   This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of these climate changes.

AB Patterns of biodiversity are influenced by habitat features at multiple spatial scales, yet few studies have used a multi-scale approach to examine ground-dwelling beetle diversity patterns. We trapped and quantified ground-dwelling beetle assemblages at two spatial scales: (1) microhabitat elements, represented by open ground, ground under trees and ground next to logs and (2) macrohabitat, represented by three vegetation types in a box-gum grassy woodland in south-eastern Australia. Species richness and evenness was highest at samples from under trees and lowest at samples in the open. At the macrohabitat scale, species richness and evenness did not differ among vegetation types. Assemblage composition was significantly different between trees, logs and open elements. Assemblage composition was different only between vegetation types with contrasting high and low shrub cover. Estimation of true species richness indicated assemblages at logs may have a higher number of species compared to trees and open elements, and implied greater spatial heterogeneity in assemblages at logs. Significant spatial autocorrelation in beetle assemblages was detected for logs at up to 400 m, but not for ground under trees or in the open. In agreement with previous studies, a mix of vegetation types at the macrohabitat scale is important for beetle conservation. Assemblage composition, however, appears to be more closely linked with habitat elements at the microhabitat scale, where logs support a high diversity of beetle species. This strongly supports the idea that restoring logs to box-gum grassy woodlands would be useful for increasing beetle species richness and assemblage heterogeneity.

AB All metacommunity theories incorporate dispersal as a key process influencing community composition. If communities are examined across a habitat-patch isolation gradient, different metacommunity theories predict contrasting patterns of community divergence and responses of rare species. We used bird and reptile data collected in three years from 168 habitat patches in a fragmented agricultural landscape, and bird data gathered from 63 remnants embedded in a pine plantation over two years to examine predictions arising from six metacommunity theories: A, neutral; B, species sorting; C, species sorting at low isolation but neutral at high isolation; D, neutral at low isolation but species sorting at high isolation; E, mass effects; and F, patch dynamics. We identified three classes of predictions arising from these theories that we could test using community survey data: (1) trajectories of rare species across an isolation gradient; (2) the influence of geographic distance, environmental parameters, and patch isolation on pair-wise comparisons of community divergence; and (3) the influence of isolation and environmental parameters on the divergence of communities from a regional species pool. Some analyses indicated moderately common support for neutral and species-sorting concepts, often acting simultaneously. Opposite responses by different groups of rare species to the isolation gradient showed that neutral and patch-dynamic processes may act on different components of the same community. Different analyses provided support for different theories, and so helped us to avoid being misled by a single analysis. However, generally we found very little consistent support for any of the metacommunity theories. Our analyses suggested that different metacommunity mechanisms act ephemerally, sometimes simultaneously and on different subsets of the fauna in different regions. The complexity of responses means that metacommunity ideas cannot yet be used predictively in a management context. We encourage further testing of the multiple predictions that arise from current metacommunity concepts, using additional data sets. However, if metacommunity processes act simultaneously and ephemerally, the predictions of any one metacommunity theory may be hard to detect at the community level. In that case, examining the ecology of multiple species in the same landscape may be needed to characterize metacommunity processes in nature.

AB In the paper we investigate how owner personality, attitude and gender influence dog behavior, dyadic practical functionality and the level of dog salivary cortisol. In three meetings, 12 female and 10 male owners of male dogs answered questionnaires including the Neo-FFI human personality inventory. Their dyadic behavior was video-taped in a number of test situations, and saliva samples were collected. Owners who scored highly in neuroticism (Neo-FFI dimension one) viewed their dogs as social supporters and spent much time with them. Their dogs had low baseline cortisol levels. but such dyads were less successful in the operational task. Owners who scored highly in extroversion (Neo-FFI dimension two) appreciated shared activities with their dogs which had relatively high baseline cortisol values. Dogs that had female owners were less sociable-active (dog personality axis 1) than dogs that had male owners. Therefore, it appears that owner gender and personality influences dyadic interaction style, dog behavior and dyadic practical functionality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB To assess how habitat affinities in the native distribution range influence the invasion success of 282 central European neophytes (alien plants introduced after ad 1500).
   Czech Republic.
   Classification trees were used to determine which native habitats donate the most alien species, the correspondence between habitats occupied by species in their native and invaded distribution ranges, and invasion success of species originating from different habitats.
   The species most likely to naturalize in Central Europe are those associated with thermophile woodland fringes in their native range (81%), cultivated areas of gardens and parks (75%) and broad-leaved deciduous woodlands (72%). The largest proportions of invasive species recruit from those that occur on riverine terraces and eroded slopes, or grow in both deciduous woodland and riverine scrub. When the relative role of habitats in the native range is assessed as a determinant of the probability that a species will become invasive in concert with other factors (the species' residence time, life history, region of origin), the direct effect of habitat is negligible. However, the effect of native habitats on patterns of invasions observed in central Europe is manifested by large differences in the numbers of species they supply to the invaded region. More than 50 neophytes were recruited from each of the following habitats: dry grasslands, ruderal habitats, deciduous woodland, inland cliffs, rock pavements and outcrops, and tall-herb fringes and meadows.
   Casual species recruit from a wider range of habitats in their native range than they occupy in the invaded range; naturalized but not invasive species inhabit a comparable spectrum of habitats in both ranges, and successful invaders occupy a wider range of habitats in the invaded than in the native range. This supports the idea that the invasive phase of the process is associated with changes in biological features that allow for extension of the spectrum of habitats invaded.

AB I used time-lapse videotaping to identify predators of open songbird nests in fragmented deciduous woodland (nine plots, 2-10 ha each) in the Czech Republic from 2002 to 2006. I documented 22 species of predators at 171 nests of 13 species (mainly Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, Song Thrush Turdus philomelos, Common Blackbird Turdus merula, Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs). The main predators were Pine Marten Martes martes (37% of 178 predation events), Jay Garrulus glandarius (29%), Buzzard Buteo buteo (7%) and Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major (7%); mammals accounted for 48% of total predation. At least 3% of nests were depredated by multiple predators. In spite of their local abundance, Hooded Crows Corvus cornix did not present a serious threat for shrub nesting songbirds (< 1% of total predation). No predation by mice was recorded, suggesting that their importance has been overestimated in artificial nest studies. The proportional species composition of predators depended on which species occupied the monitored nest and location (study plot), but not on the year or the time of season. Corvids and raptors accounted for a relatively larger percentage of total predation of small ('warblers') and large ('thrushes') prey species, respectively, whereas carnivores were important predators of all prey species. Active nests of thrushes were only rarely robbed by Jays (< 4% of 52 events), presumably due to parental nest defence. Predation by woodpeckers was spatially clumped, probably due to individual foraging specialization. Predation by the other major predators was documented on most/all study plots.

AB P>The potential for a habitat shift is enhanced when selection against immigrants is augmented by a temporal difference between them and inhabitants of core populations. Genetically mediated changes in flowering time often accompany niche shifts in plants.
   The possibility that temporal change may arise from plastic responses to novel, stressful, environments rather than from genetic alteration has not been explored. This option is considered here, and it may be quite common.
   The substantial literature on transplant and common garden experiments shows that invaders of novel habitats are likely to undergo a developmentally based phenological shift. A phenological change in the invading population leads to assortative mating within populations, which in turn facilitates the evolution of local adaptation by the invader. Environmental induction may be the sole contributor to temporal change, or this factor may act in concert with genetic change.
   Flowering shifts based on developmental responses are immediate, not subject to remediation by gene flow and not affected by a paucity of genetic variation, negative genetic correlations or antagonistic pleiotropy, all of which might constrain phenological evolution.

AB To explore the genetic and phylogeographic structure of a temperate forest species, Pinus strobiformis Englem., in a subtropical region in the context of climate change during the Pleistocene. It is expected that the colder conditions during glacial stages favoured range expansions of P. strobiformis, thus promoting gene flow.
   Mexico and the United States.
   Estimates of genetic diversity and structure were obtained using chloroplast microsatellite loci of 23 populations of P. strobiformis across its entire range, seven neighbouring populations of Pinus ayacahuite Ehrenb. ex. Schtdl, and one population of Pinus flexilis James.
   The genetic diversity of P. strobiformis (H-e = 0.856) was found to be high, especially in western populations, whereas eastern populations were less variable and more genetically similar to P. ayacahuite of central Mexico. We found evidence of significant phylogeographic structure (N-ST = 0.444; P = 0.026), high genetic structure (R-ST = 0.270), and isolation by distance. Pairwise R-ST and samova (spatial analysis of molecular variance) results indicated an east-west partition of genetic variation, with populations within each group showing little differentiation and no isolation by distance.
   The phylogeographic structure of P. strobiformis across the entire range was pronounced, with two main genetic and geographic groups separated by the Chihuahuan Desert. However, within each of the two groups there was little population differentiation and no isolation by distance, suggesting genetic connectivity as a result of population expansions within these areas during glacial stages.

AB Interspecific competitive relationships and their effect on yield have been analysed in the association of potato and maize, two species with contrasting patterns of root and shoot systems establishment. Greenhouse experiments were carried out under three configurations (NC: no interspecific competition; FC: shoot and root interspecific competition; SO shoot-only interspecific competition). Despite large variations between replicate experiments associated with seasonal effects, the study revealed consistent patterns of competition for above- and below-ground resources. Light interception in FC and SC was dominated by potato (60%) during the first 45 days after planting and by maize thereafter (80%). The extra shade caused by the companion crop increased soil moisture by up to 10% in SC treatments. The yield of the two species responded in opposite ways to SC, which was consistent with asymmetric patterns of competition between the two species. In potato, FC reduced tuber yield (number and size) by 4-26%, while SC increased tuber size (compared to NC) by 3-39%. In maize, FC reduced LA1 and plant height by up to 45%, shoot and root dry mass, nutrient content, yield, the weight of 100 grains and harvest index by ca. 30-100%, while SC affected all but LA1 and plant height. It appears that the contrast between the progressive installation of the maize root system and the rapid early extension of the potato root system is amplified by the restriction of maize root development under competition, which leads to close interdependencies between root and shoot competitive relationships. Although the specific effects of root competition cannot be uncovered by this set of experiments, competition effects on maize in the potato/maize intercropping seem to primarily related to light availability in the mixed canopy.

AB Boreal forest ecosystems are generally highly sensitive to logging and other forestry activities. Thus, commercial forestry has had major effects on the forests and landscape structure in northern Sweden since the middle of the 19th Century, when it rapidly extended across the region. Lichens (which constitute up to 80% of reindeer forage in winter and early spring) have often been amongst the most severely affected ecosystem components. The overall aim of the present study was to analyze how forestry has influenced the potential supply of ground-growing lichens as winter forage for the reindeer in this region over the past ca. 100 years. For this purpose, we analysed changes in forest and stand structure in Scots pine-dominated (Pinus sylvestris L) reindeer wintering areas in the southern part of the county Norrbotten (covering ca. 58,000 ha) using detailed historical forest inventories and management plans. We found that the amount of the forest types considered potentially good pasture (mainly middle-aged and old pine forests) decreased during the first part of the 20th Century. However, the quality of grazing grounds was improved by forestry during this time mainly because selective logging made the forests more open which benefits lichen growth. During the last part of the 20th century forestry impaired the quality of grazing grounds in several ways, e.g. by clear-cutting and intensified use of various silvicultural measures. We conclude that ca. 30-50% of the winter grazing grounds have been lost in the study area because of intensive forest management during the last century. The spatially precise historical information about the affects of forestry on lichen pasture provided in this study can be used to direct forest management which will facilitate and promote reindeer herding in the future.

AB To investigate the role of ecological and historical factors in the organization of communities, we describe the ecomorphological structure of an assemblage of snakes (61 species in six families) in the Cerrado (a savanna-like grassland) of Distrito Federal, Brazil. These snakes vary in habits, with some being fossorial, cryptozoic, terrestrial, semi-aquatic, or arboreal. Periods of activity also vary. A multivariate analysis identified distinct morphological groups associated with patterns of resource use. We report higher niche diversification compared to snakes in the Caatinga (a semi-arid region in northeastern Brazil), with fossorial and cryptozoic species occupying morphological space that is not occupied in the Caatinga. Monte Carlo permutations from canonical phylogenetic ordination revealed a significant phylogenetic effect on morphology for Colubridae, Colubrinae, Viperidae, Elapidae, and Boidae indicating that morphological divergence occurred in the distant past. We conclude that phylogeny is the most important factor determining structure of this Neotropical assemblage. Nevertheless, our results also suggest a strong ecological component characterizes a peculiar snake fauna.

ID ACINONYX-JUBATUS; HOME-RANGE; CONSERVATION; LIONS
AB Knowledge of a species' ranging behaviour is both fundamental to understanding its behavioural ecology and a prerequisite to planning its management. Few data exist on the spatial ecology of cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus outside protected areas, but such areas are particularly important to their conservation. Cheetahs on Namibian farmlands occupied exceptionally large home ranges, averaging 1651 km(2) (+/- 1594 km(2)), with no detectable effect of sex, social grouping or seasonality. Despite such large ranges, cheetahs tended to utilize intensively only a small fraction of that area: 50% of the fixes were located within an average of 13.9 +/- 5.3% of the home range. Ranges were not exclusive, overlapping on average by 15.8 +/- 17.0%, with male cheetahs showing more intra-sexual range overlap than did females. Coalitions of males appeared to select for a dense, prey-rich habitat, but this preference was not apparent for other social groupings. Conflict with humans is an important contributor to the species' decline, and these large, overlapping cheetah home ranges result in the movements of each individual cheetah encompassing many farms (21 based on the average home-range size). Consequently, many cheetahs may be exposed to a minority of farmers attempting to kill them, and also that many farmers may see the same cheetahs, thereby gaining an exaggerated impression of their abundance. Conservation priorities for cheetahs outside protected areas are the development of techniques for conflict resolution, as well as the maintenance and restoration of suitable habitat and promotion of land-management practices compatible with the continued existence of large carnivores.

AB Mating systems and recombination are thought to have a deep impact on the organization and evolution of genomes. Because of the decline in effective population size and the interference between linked loci, the efficacy of selection is expected to be reduced in regions with low recombination rates and in the whole genome of self-fertilizing species. At the molecular level, relaxed selection is expected to result in changes in the rate of protein evolution and the pattern of codon bias. It is increasingly recognized that recombination also affects non-selective processes such as the biased gene conversion towards GC alleles (bGC). Like selection, this kind of meiotic drive in favour of GC over AT alleles is expected to be reduced in weakly recombining regions and genomes. Here, we investigated the effect of mating system and recombination on molecular evolution in four Triticeae species: two outcrossers (Secale cereale and Aegilops speltoides) and two selfers (Triticum urartu and Triticum monococcum). We found that GC content, possibly driven by bGC, is affected by mating system and recombination as theoretically predicted. Selection efficacy, however, is only weakly affected by mating system and recombination. We investigated the possible reasons for this discrepancy. A surprising one is that, in outcrossing lineages, selection efficacy could be reduced because of high substitution rates in favour of GC alleles. Outcrossers, but not selfers, would thus suffer from a 'GC-induced' genetic load. This result sheds new light on the evolution of mating systems.

AB In nonresource based mating systems females are thought to derive indirect genetic benefits by mating with high-quality males. Such benefits can be due either to the intrinsic genetic quality of sires or to beneficial interactions between maternal and paternal haplotypes. Animals with external fertilization and no parental care offer unrivaled opportunities to address these hypotheses. With these systems, cross-classified breeding designs and in vitro fertilization can be used to disentangle sources of genetic and environmental variance in offspring fitness. Here, we employ these approaches in the Australian sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma and explore how sire-dam identities influence fertilization rates, embryo viability (survival to hatching), and metamorphosis, as well as the interrelationships between these potential fitness traits. We show that fertilization is influenced by a combination of strong maternal effects and intrinsic male effects. Our subsequent analysis of embryo viability, however, revealed a highly significant interaction between parental genotypes, indicating that partial incompatibilities can severely limit offspring survival at this life-history stage. Importantly, we detected no significant relationship between fertilization rates and embryo viability. This finding suggests that fertilization rates should not be inferred from hatching rates, which is commonly practiced in species in which it is not possible to estimate fertilization at conception. Finally, we detected significant additive genetic variance due to sires in rates of juvenile metamorphosis, and a positive correlation between fertilization rates and metamorphosis. This latter finding indicates that the performance of a male's ejaculate in noncompetitive IVF trials predicts heritable offspring traits, although the fitness implications of variance in rates of spontaneous juvenile metamorphosis have yet to be determined.

AB The recent Forum contribution by Grime (2006) contrasts the MacArthur/Diamond assembly-rule approach to studying plant communities with the study of environmental trait gradients. Both are valid and useful. In doing so, Grime declares that the assembly rules model, in which negative interactions between plants act with limiting similarity to cause local trait divergence, is "not supported by empirical study of plant communities". This is, he says, the agony of community ecology. I show that there is now abundant evidence for assembly rules, and no agony.

AB The body shape of 1303 adult male three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus from 118 populations on Haida Gwaii archipelago off the mid-coast of British Columbia was investigated using discriminant function analysis on partial warp scores generated from 12 homologous landmarks on a digital image of each fish. Results demonstrated geographical differences in adult body shape that could be predicted by both abiotic and biotic factors of the habitat. Populations with derived shape (CV1-), including thick peduncles, posterior and closely spaced dorsal spines, anterior pelvis, small dorsal and anal fins, were found in small, shallow, stained ponds, and populations with less derived shape (CV1+), with small narrow peduncles, anterior and widely spaced dorsal spines, posterior pelvis, large dorsal and anal fins were found in large, deep, clear lakes. This relationship was replicated between geographic regions; divergent mtDNA haplotypes in lowland populations; between predation regimes throughout the archipelago, and in each geographical region and between predation regimes in lowland populations monomorphic for the Euro and North American mtDNA haplotype. There were large-bodied populations with derived shape (CV2-), including small heads and shallow elongate bodies in open water habitats of low productivity, and populations with smaller size and less derived shape (CV2+), with large heads and deeper bodies in higher productivity, structurally complex habitats. This relationship was replicated between geographic regions, and partially between divergent mtDNA haplotypes in lowland populations. Field tests for phenotypic plasticity of body shape suggest that < 10% of the total variation in body shape among populations throughout the archipelago can be attributed to plasticity.

AB Despite increased recognition of the importance of urban vegetation research, few attempts have been made to assess the relative influence of ecological variables on the species composition of urban wastelands. The main aim of this paper is to assess the relative importance of soil and microclimatic variables in structuring plant species richness and diversity in this habitat. Field investigations were carried out in 22 wasteland sites situated within the city of Brussels. The vegetation has been recorded in 38 4 m(2)-plots according to the Braun-Blanquet-method. A total of 19 environmental variables were taken into consideration, among others the presence of different kinds of anthropogenic substrates and microclimatic variables. Results indicate that plant species composition in urban wastelands is mainly driven by soil nutrient content, soil moisture, soil pH and light intensity (as inferred by the mean Ellenberg's indicator values). Various types of anthropogenic substrates such as concrete, pebbles, sand and rubble had different effects on the species composition, the proportion of neophytes, hemeroby and urbanity level. Air temperature and humidity did show a significant influence on the presence of some species. The contribution of these environmental variables to the species composition and diversity of urban wastelands is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Landscape-level metrics can be used to measure changes in landscape structure overtime. Four landscape-level metrics and rank-size distributions were used to describe changes in landscape structure caused by urbanization in a portion of the Tucson, Arizona metropolitan area between 1984 and 1998. This analysis describes what each metric conveys regarding how urbanization affects landscape structure. It also compares the efficacy of rank-size distributions with the other metrics. Results indicate all five metrics provided information about a specific aspect of landscape structure including patch size, shape, or dispersion. Results indicate that rank-size distributions and their scaling exponents are useful because they provide information not available from the other metrics. Rank-size distributions describe the patch-size scaling properties of specific land-cover types, the relative effect of large and small patches on the distribution of patch sizes, the magnitude of change in patch size, where patch sizes differ from what is expected by the regression model, and the range of patch sizes displaying fractal patterns.

AB The effects of Quaternary glacial range partitioning on the diversification of Holarctic biota remain unclear. Glacial refugial lineages may form vicariant species, hybrid products, or merge after secondary contact. Here, we assess the effects of Quaternary glaciation on a Holarctic sexual zooplankter, Daphnia galeata, with apparently marked dispersal capacity and a widespread hybrid lineage in the New World. We collected samples of this species from 148 Holarctic lakes, analysed the nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences, and tested predictions for hypotheses that account for the origin and spread of the New World D. galeata. We detected five nuclear phylogroups and four mitochondrial phylogroups, most of which were restricted to either the New World or the Old World. The oldest mitochondrial phylogroup was restricted to Japan. One major mitochondrial clade was distributed throughout the Holarctic, but only four haplotypes were shared among continents, and analysis of molecular variance indicated significant structure at the continental level. Haplotype sharing among continents could largely be attributed to anthropogenic introductions. Mismatch distributions, haplotype networks, phylogenetic trees, longitudinal haplotype diversity erosion and coalescence analyses are consistent with colonization from an Old World and a New World refugium. Our nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence evidence supports the hypothesis that the New World D. galeata underwent introgression with Daphnia dentifera, with dispersal being enhanced by glaciation. We conclude that Quaternary glaciation had a pronounced effect on the diversification of a Holarctic sexual zooplankter.

AB Non-indigenous animal species threaten biodiversity and ecosystem stability by damaging or transforming habitats, killing or out-competing native species and spreading disease. We use World Heritage Area Kakadu National Park, northern Australia, as a focal region to illustrate the current and potential threats posed by non-indigenous animal species to internationally and nationally recognised natural and cultural values. Available evidence suggests that large feral herbivores such as Asian swamp buffalo, pigs and horses are the most ecologically threatening species in this region. This may reflect the inherent research bias, because these species are highly visible and impact primary production; consequently, their control has attracted the strongest research and management efforts. Burgeoning threats, such as the already established cane toad and crazy ant, and potentially non-indigenous freshwater fish, marine invertebrates and pathogens, may cause severe problems for native biodiversity. To counter these threats, management agencies must apply an ongoing, planned and practical approach using scientifically based and well funded control measures; however, many stakeholders require direct evidence of the damage caused by non-indigenous species before agreeing to implement control. To demonstrate the increasing priority of non-indigenous species research in Australia and to quantify taxonomic and habitat biases in research focus, we compiled an extensive biography of peer-reviewed articles published between 1950 and 2005. Approximately 1000 scientific papers have been published on the impact and control of exotic animals in Australia, with a strong bias towards terrestrial systems and mammals. Despite the sheer quantity of research on non-indigenous species and their effects, management responses remain largely ad hoc and poorly evaluated, especially in northern Australia and in high-value areas such as Kakadu National Park. We argue that improved management in relatively isolated and susceptible tropical regions requires (1) robust quantification of density - damage relationships, and (2) the delivery of research findings that stimulate land managers to develop cost-effective control and monitoring programs.

AB Phylogeography can inform conservation strategies through assessment of genetic diversity that incorporates an evolutionary perspective, and allows evaluation within a geographical context, thus providing integration with other biogeographical information. Comparative phylogeography can identify significant historical processes that have had major influences on the biota and provides a historical context for understanding current species distributions. The phylogeographic patterns in the flora of south-western Australia are reviewed. Concordant patterns of lineage divergence in three unrelated taxa from separate families with widespread distributions indicate a common response to major historical processes involved in Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Identification of highly divergent haplotypes in some species indicates areas that may represent refugia during times of climatic instability. Analysis of phylogeographic patterns in the flora of south-western Australia has revealed the influence of historical climate change in promoting high phylogenetic diversity within species that is comparable to the high species diversity that is well known in the Western Australian flora. Knowledge of historical influences and species responses provides an evolutionary context for conservation management strategies that facilitate the continued action of dynamic evolutionary processes.

AB A simulation model based on satellite observations of monthly vegetation cover from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) was used to estimate monthly carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems of the conterminous United States over the period 2001-04. Predicted net ecosystem production (NEP) flux for atmospheric CO2 in the United States was estimated as annual net sink of about +0.2 Pg C in 2004. Regional climate patterns were reflected in the predicted annual NEP flux from the model, which showed extensive carbon sinks in ecosystems of the southern and eastern regions in 2003-04, and major carbon source fluxes from ecosystems in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest regions in 2003-04. As demonstrated through tower site comparisons, net primary production (NPP) modeled with monthly MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) inputs closely resembles both the measured high- and low-season carbon fluxes. Modeling results suggest that the capacity of the NASA Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model to use 8-km resolution MODIS EVI data to predict peak growing season uptake rates of CO2 in irrigated croplands and moist temperate forests is strong.

AB Dominant species are known to exert strong influence over community dynamics, although little work has addressed how they affect invasibility. In this study, we examined whether dominant species identity and abundance affected invasibility of old-field plant communities. To quantify invasibility, we added seeds of 19 plant species into plots dominated by one of four different herbaceous perennial species (Andropogon virginicus, Bromus inermis, Centaurea maculosa, or Solidago canadensis). We found that, independent of species richness and abiotic variables, plots dominated by Andropogon were the least invasible, while Bromus and Centaurea plots had the highest invasibility. We examined several potential mechanisms by which these dominant species might influence invasibility, and found invasion to increase with decreasing litter biomass and increasing community species richness. The abundance of the dominant species was not a significant predictor of invasion. These results indicate that dominant species identity plays an important role in determining invasibility of plant communities, though exact mechanisms underlying these effects still need to be explored.

AB 1. Commercial forests represent an important but often neglected biological resource. This study related the understorey plant species composition of a coniferous plantation forest managed by clearfelling to environmental factors (stand structure, soil pH and previous land use) and ecological patterns (abundance-occupancy relationships, species dispersal and life history).
   2. Plant species richness and composition were recorded in 326 managed stands of different ages, soil types and land-use histories in a 185-km(2) lowland forest planted onto heath and arable land.
   3. Stands replanted in the last 10 years had the greatest species richness, typically containing in the order of 18 plant species. Stands on soils of high pH had greater plant species richness, as did those on previously arable land.
   4. Less than a quarter (23%) of all species persisted in the above-ground vegetation throughout the growth cycle. The majority recolonized forest stands during the cycle, by physical dispersal or from the seed bank, largely after canopy opening in mature stands (26%) or after felling (47%). Annual species and species with plumed seeds were most abundant in early growth stages, while shrubs with berries were more abundant in mature stands.
   5. We found a strong positive interspecific relationship between frequency of stand occupancy and mean abundance within occupied stands. For species not persisting above-ground throughout the forestry cycle (i.e. patch colonizers), the slope of the abundance-occupancy relationship was steeper for those with a long-distance dispersal mechanism than for those lacking such a mechanism.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Rotational clearfelling of plantations may be an appropriate form of forest and conservation management in forests planted on former open areas such as heaths, where the conservation interest is not in old-growth species but in earlier successional species. Maximizing representation of young growth stages will help maximize plant diversity in such cases. These prescriptions contradict guidance for sustainable forestry; however, it is appropriate to vary guidelines according to land-use history and species composition. Our findings confirm the importance of dispersal to species persistence within landscapes comprising successional patch networks.

AB Macroinvertebrate assemblages of large alluvial streams are poorly documented. This study identified the physical characteristics affecting the macroinvertebrates community distribution in a large alluvial river devoid of major anthropogenic impacts. It was oriented towards the influence of the characteristics of the physical habitat (velocity, depth, grain-size classes of mineral substrates, macrophytes) on macroinvertebrates (richness, density, body size, feeding habits), with particular attention to the pollution-sensitive taxa. The study was carried out in June during a period of hydrological stability. The effects of water velocity, depth and substrates on taxa were evaluated with multivariate analyses. Mineral substrates were most abundant while macrophytes accounted for only 3% of sampled habitat. Invertebrates that were present were those characteristics of the transition zone between upper and middle life reaches. Among the 63 taxa sampled, 14 were abundant. In relation to the characteristics of the physical environment, the macroinvertebrate assemblages were discriminated by substrate, velocity, and depth. Habitat exploitation, however, appeared complex. The highest community richness, EPT richness, and density were found in various substrates where the velocity ranged between 30 and 120 cm s(-1), depths ranged from 16 to 50 cm. The most pollution-sensitive taxa preferred riffle habitats with velocities > 70 cm s(-1) and substrate > 64 mm. This suggest that rapid bioassessment programmes should be carried out in the mineral substrates of the geomorphological unit riffles where richness is high and density sufficient to represent the macroinvertebrate community, including pollution-sensitive taxa.

AB 1. Across the vast boreal forests of North America, no population cycles in Clethrionomys species occur. In Eurasia, by contrast, some Clethrionomys populations of the same species undergo regular 3-5-year cycles. We examined the effects of nutrients, food, competitors, predators and climate on population limitation in the northern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus Pallas) in the south-western Yukon to determine why this difference occurs.
   2. From 1986 to 1996 we added food, reduced large mammal predators and excluded snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) from large plots and found that none of these manipulations affected red-backed vole abundance. Adding nutrients as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilizer had a slight negative effect, probably acting through a reduction in dwarf shrub productivity caused by competition from grasses.
   3. We monitored weasel populations directly through trapping and indirectly through snow tracking. Predation by these vole specialists was irrelevant as a limiting factor most of the time because voles in this area do not reach the densities needed to sustain weasel populations. Other boreal forest mammal and bird predators did not focus on red-backed voles. However, when red-backed vole populations increased in the forest and Microtus voles also increased in the meadows, weasel populations increased and may have temporarily depressed red-backed voles in winter.
   4. We monitored one major potential food, white spruce seeds, but seed fall was not related to population changes in red-backed voles, even after mast years.
   5. We assessed the impact of weather variables, and the average depth of the snow pack during winter (October-March) was correlated directly with vole demography, having both direct effects in that year and delayed effects in the following year.
   6. Our long-term trapping data (1973-96) indicate that Clethrionomys populations fluctuated, with peaks following hare peaks by 2-3 years.
   7. We propose that the key variable limiting these vole populations is overwinter survival, and this is a function of overwinter food from berries produced during the previous summer by dwarf shrubs. These shrubs may be stimulated by abundant moisture from winter snows or by periodic fertilization from large quantities of pellets produced at snowshoe hare peaks.

AB The natural N-15 abundance (delta N-15) of different ecosystem compartments is considered to be an integrator of nitrogen (N) cycle processes. Here we investigate the extent to which patterns of delta N-15 in grassland plants and soils reflect the effect of different management practices on N cycling processes and N balance. Investigations were conducted in long-term experimental plots of permanent montane meadows with treatments differing in the amount and type of applied fertilizer (0-200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); mineral fertilizer, cattle slurry, stable manure) and/or the cutting frequency (1-6 cuts per season). The higher delta N-15 values of organic fertilizers compared to mineral fertilizer were reflected by higher delta N-15 values in soils and harvested plant material. Furthermore, delta N-15 of top soils and plant material increased with the amount of applied fertilizer N. N balances were calculated from N input (fertilization, atmospheric N deposition and symbiotic N-2 fixation) and N output in harvest. 'Excess N-the fraction of N input not harvested-was assumed to be lost to the environment or accumulated in soil. Taking fertilizer type into account, strong positive correlations between delta N-15 of top soils and the N input-output balance were found. In plots receiving mineral N fertilizer this indicates that soil processes which discriminate against 15 N (e.g. nitrification, denitrification, ammonia volatilization) were stimulated by the increased supply of readily available N, leading to loss of the N-15 depleted compounds and subsequent N-15 enrichment of the soils. By contrast, in plots with organic fertilization this correlation was partly due to accumulation of N-15-enriched fertilizer N in top soils and partly due to the occurrence of significant N losses. Cutting frequency appeared to have no direct effect on delta N-15 patterns. This study for the first time shows that the natural abundance of N-15 of agricultural systems does not only reflect the type (organic or mineral fertilizer) or amount of annual fertilizer amendment (0-200 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) but that plant and soil delta N-15 is better described by N input-output balances.

AB Microbial communities play an important role in stream ecosystem processes, such as breakdown of senescent leaf litter, and as a primary nutritional source for detritivorous macroinvertebrates. Antibiotics may affect stream microbial communities and associated ecosystem processes, especially because recent stream and river monitoring programs have indicated the presence of antibiotics downstream of wastewater treatment plants. In the current study, effects of chronic exposure to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) were examined on stream microbial community-level physiological profiles and growth indices of detritivorous amphipods (Gammarus spp.) and caddisflies (Lepidostoma liba). Microcosm experiments were conducted using stream sediments and water, senesced leaf material (Acer saccharum), and macroinvertebrates. A shift in function of leaf-associated microbial communities (based on carbon source utilization) was observed for samples exposed to 100 mu g/L of Cipro for 12 d compared to control and treatments exposed to 1 and 10 mu g/L of Cipro. This was attributable to carbohydrate substrates, which had 2.7- to 3.5-fold lower microbial respiration than the lower concentrations and control (p < 0.001). For detritivores, Gammarus spp. condition index did not differ among control, 0.1, and 1.0 mu g/L treatments after 30-d exposures (p > 0.05). Similarly, L. liba growth rate did not vary among control, 10, and 100 mu g/L treatments after 45-d exposures (p > 0.05). These results suggest that Cipro may affect leaf-associated microbial communities, but at concentrations four orders of magnitude above those detected in streams. However, effects of the antibiotic on growth and condition of detritivores were not observed. Future work should focus on identifying specific changes in stream microbial communities as a result of Cipro exposure and impacts on other aquatic species.

AB In birds, it has been shown that reproductive effort may impair parental condition, while the relation of different condition indices to subsequent survival is still poorly understood. In this study, we measured body mass and various hematological condition indices in breeding great tits in relation to local survival. Number and quality of nestlings and the occurrence of second broods, potentially reflecting parents' breeding effort, were also considered in analyses. The great tits, both male and female, that returned the following year had had a higher albumin/globulin ratio, lower plasma globulin concentration, and a lower heterophile/lymphocyte ratio during breeding in the preceding year, compared to those who did not return. Surviving males (but not females) also had had a higher level of circulating lymphocytes, compared to nonsurvivors. There was no correlation between breeding effort and survival. We conclude that better immunological state and lower stress in great tits during breeding were positively related to their survival probability.

AB Our purpose was to define a quantitative and expeditious method to analyze the effects of processes that influence species distribution and abundance at different organizational scales. We considered habitat loss, the breaking apart of habitat patches, and habitat structural alteration critical processes that affect species distribution and abundance. We evaluated the effects of these processes by considering the response of selected indicator species to isolation (landscape scale), patch size and edge effect (patch scale), and habitat structure (plot scale). We used broadleaf forests as our case-study ecosystem and birds as indicator species. Faunal data came from a georeferenced, long-term, breeding-bird database, and environmental data were obtained from field surveys and land-use digital cartography. Birds, grouped according to their sensitivity to patch isolation, patch size, edge effect, and habitat structure, indicated how environmental conditions affected species abundance. The most sensitive group to the above-mentioned processes included the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), and Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). We evaluated the umbrella effect of these species for the conservation of the other co-occurring birds and found that their effectiveness varied according to the criterion used to select sites for protection. Site selection based on indicator species identified forest patches with greater species abundance than an alternative criterion that chose sites based on patch isolation and size, edge effect, and forest structure. The alternative criterion, although not as efficient as indicator species, may nevertheless be useful and effective for conservation when faunal data are lacking and guidelines for habitat management or restoration are needed. Our method is applicable to other ecosystems and taxa because the processes we considered occur in many ecosystems and may have significant effects on species from all taxonomic groups.

AB Population Substructure has important implications for a species' ecology and evolution. As such, knowledge of this structuring is critical for the conservation and management of natural populations. Among marine mammals, many examples exist of species chat enjoy a broad geographical distribution, yet are characterized by fine-scale Population subdivisions. Coastal bottlenose dolphins have been studied extensively in a few regions globally, and these studies have highlighted a great diversity in both social strategies and demographic isolation. Here we use molecular genetic markets to examine the degree Of Population Subdivision among three study sites separated by less than 250 km on Little Bahama Bank in the northern Bahamas. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation and microsatellite genotypes were used to assess partitioning of genetic variance among 56 individually recognized coastal ecotype bottlenose dolphins. Although resolved levels of genetic differentiation suggest gene flow among the three study sites, both nuclear and mitochondrial data indicate a significant degree of subdivision within the Little Bahama Bank population, and sex-based analyses Suggest that patterns of dispersal may not be strictly biased toward males. These results corroborate the site fidelity documented through long-term photo-identification studies in the NE Bahamas, and highlight the need to consider independent subpopulation units for the conservation and management of coastal bottlenose dolphins in the Bahamas.

AB The size distribution of the pelagic community has the potential to compare ecosystems with different species composition as well as to identify the main functional properties of the system. Plankton size spectra are an effective approach of summarising the size structure of the community and have the potential to indicate the transfer of energy up the trophic food web. However, data on which open ocean plankton biomass-size structure can be constructed are scarce. Here we present the latitudinal distribution in the Atlantic Ocean of normalised biomass-size spectra (NB-S), plankton biomass and abundance, as well as mean zooplankton size between 70 degrees N and 50 S. Samples were collected from three Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruises during May/June 2003, September/October 2003 and April/June 2004, as well as from a Marine Productivity (MarProd) cruise farther north in the Irminger Sea during spring 2002. The biomass-size distribution covered a body size range from nano- to mesoplankton and was based on a depth range of 50-0m on the AMT and 120-0 m on the Irminger Sea cruise. The distribution of normalised biomass versus size was linear on a double log plot at all of the 95 stations. The slopes of the NB-S spectra ranged from -0.93 to -1.26 and -1.12 to -1.46 on the AMT and Irminger Sea cruises, respectively. A "dome-shaped" pattern in the slopes of community size spectra was observed in the Atlantic, indicating a decrease in the trophic transfer efficiency of energy with increasing latitude and phytoplankton biomass. Mesozooplankton biomass, abundance, and mean size followed a distribution similar to ecosystem productivity. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. There is growing consensus that much of the marked broad-scale spatial variation in species richness is associated with variation in environmental energy availability, but at least nine principal mechanisms have been proposed that may explain these patterns.
   2. The evolutionary-rates hypothesis suggests that high environmental energy availability elevates rates of molecular evolution, promoting faster speciation, so that more species occur in high-energy areas because more evolve there. Direct tests of this hypothesis are rare and their conclusions inconsistent. Here we focus on assessing the support for its underlying assumptions.
   3. First, the evolutionary-rates hypothesis assumes that high energy levels promote mutation. There is certainly evidence that high levels of ultraviolet radiation increase mutation rates. High temperatures may also reduce generation times and elevate metabolic rates, which may promote mutation. On balance, data support a link between rates of metabolism and mutation, but a link between the latter and generation time is more equivocal and is particularly unlikely in plants.
   4. Second, the evolutionary-rates hypothesis assumes that mutation rates limit speciation rates. This may be true if all else was equal, but correlations between mutation and speciation are probably very noisy as many other factors may influence rates both of sympatric and allopatric speciation, including the occurrence of physical isolation barriers, the magnitude of selection and population size.
   5. Third, the evolutionary-rates hypothesis assumes that there is a strong correlation between current and historical energy levels. Factors such as tectonic drift may weaken such relationships, but are likely to have had negligible effects over the time period during which the majority of extant species evolved.
   6. Fourth, the evolutionary-rates hypothesis assumes that changes in species ranges following speciation do not sufficiently weaken the correlation between the rate of speciation in an area and species richness. The ranges of many species appear to alter dramatically following speciation, and this may markedly reduce the strength of the relationship, but to what extent is unclear.
   7. In sum, the degree to which the evolutionary-rates hypothesis can explain spatial variation in species richness remains surprisingly uncertain. We suggest directions for further research.

AB An ecosystem health index methodology (EHIM) was developed for assessing lake ecosystem health. A scale from 0 to 100 was chosen as a basis for ranking where an ecosystem health index (EHI) of zero indicates the worst possible health state and one of 100 the best possible health state. There are five necessary steps in the EHIM: (1) to select basic and additional indicators; (2) to calculate sub-EHIs for all selected indicators; (3) to determine weighting factors for all selected indicators; (4) to calculate a synthetic EHI using the sub-EHIs and weighting factors for all selected indicators; (5) to assess ecosystem health based on synthetic EHI values. The EHIM was successfully applied to a series of Italian lakes for assessment and comparison purposes. Phytoplankton biomass (BA) was selected to serve as a basic indicator, while zooplankton biomass (BZ), the ratio of BZ to BA (BZ/BA), and exergy and structural exergy were used as additional indicators. The results suggest that the EHIM is a valuable relatively uncomplicated methodology with simple principles, ease of calculation, reliable and intuitive results. As a practical planning tool, it can be widely used for the quantitative assessment and comparison of ecosystem health states for a single lake, a series of different lakes, or more complicated lake systems.

AB Locally called IAG pond, system is a small, oligotrophic, shallow, urban reservoir located in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga Biological Reserve, south of Sao Paulo municipality, southeastern Brazil. Study was carried out in two phases to cover the two climatic periods (dry and rainy) that characterize the area. Daily samples were collected on seven consecutive days (dry = 20-26 August 1996; rainy = 22-28 January 1997), three times a day (07:00 h, 13:00 h, and 19:00 h), following the water column vertical profile at reservoir's deepest site (Z(max) = 4.7 m). The phytoplankton's community structure's diurnal variation was compared with environmental variables (thermal structure of the water column, pH, CO2, dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, and NH4). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant variation among sampling hours and days but not among depths for most species, thus revealing a tendency towards a homogeneous vertical distribution of phytoplankton in the reservoir. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed a significant relationship between distribution of phytoplankton species and environmental variables used for ordination. Water temperature was the environmental variable that best explained distribution of sample units. Atelomixis was the only possible explanation for how a non-motile alga as, for example, the chlorococcal Oocystis lacustris Chodat and the diatom Cyclotella stelligera Cleve & Grunow, can be so widespread and abundant in the IAG pond during the stratified period.

AB Attributes of the recipient community may affect the invasion success of arriving non-indigenous organisms. In particular, biotic interactions may enhance the resistance of communities to invasion. Invading organisms typically encounter a novel suite of competitors and predators, and thus their invasiveness may be affected by how they cope with these interactions. Behavioral plasticity may help invaders to respond appropriately to novelty. We examined the behavioral responses of highly invasive mosquitofish to representative novel competitors and predators they might encounter as they spread through North America. We compared the behavior of invasive Gambusia holbrooki and G. affinis to that of two close relatives of lower invasive potential (G. geiseri and G. hispaniolae) in order to elucidate whether responses to novelty related to invasiveness. In short-term assays, female Gambusia were paired with a novel competitor, Pimephales promelas, and a novel predator, Micropterus dolomieu. Behavioral responses were measured in terms of foraging success and efficiency, activity, refuge use, predator inspections, and interspecific aggression. Contrary to a priori predictions, invasive and non-invasive responses to novel interactions did not differ consistently. In response to novel competition, both invasive species increased foraging efficiency, but so did G. geiseri. In response to novel predation, only G. holbrooki decreased consumption and activity and increased refuge use. No antipredator response was observed in G. affinis. We found consistent differences, however, between invasives and non-invasives in foraging behavior. Both in the presence and absence of the competitor and the predator, invasives foraged more efficiently and consumed more prey than non-invasives.

   PREFERENCE
AB Male genitalia are typically highly variable across species, for which sexual selection is thought to be responsible. Sexually selected traits characteristically show positive allometry and high phenotypic variation, although genitalia seem to be typified by negative allometry due to stabilizing selection. Additionally, while sexual selection appears to be the primary force responsible for genital evolution, the precise mechanism is unclear, but good-genes selection could be involved. If so, male genital variation should correlate with some male quality measure(s). We investigated the allometry of male Nyctalus noctula genitalia and investigated associations between genital size and three phenotypic measures of male quality (body size, relative body mass, and fluctuating asymmetry (FA)) We found that the penis exhibited positive allometry and high phenotypic variation, and was positively associated with male body size and relative body mass, but not with FA. This pattern is more typical of sexually selected display traits, contrasting with general patterns of genital allometry. The baculum was negatively allometric and was not associated with any quality measure. Our results suggest that the N. noctula penis is under directional sexual selection and is a reliable indicator of male phenotypic quality. (C) 2004 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Global climate warming, now conclusively linked to anthropogenically-increased CO2 levels in the earth's atmosphere, has already had impacts on the earth's biodiversity and is predicted to threaten more than 1 million species with extinction by 2050. Climate change in southern Africa is expected to involve higher temperatures and lower rainfall, with less predictability and a greater frequency of severe storms, fires and El Nino events. The predicted changes to birds in Africa - the continent most at risk from climate. change - have hardly been explored, yet birds and many other vertebrates face uncertain futures. Here, in one of the first focused analyses of the correlates of climate change vulnerability in southern African birds, we offer a wideranging perspective on which species may be most at risk, and explore which traits may influence the adaptability of extinction risk of bird species.
   Our review suggests that small nomadic species with short generation times may be least at risk. While larger-bodied species may be physiologically buffered against environmental change, their longer generation times may make them less able to adapt evolutionarily to climate change. Migrant species, and those with specialised feeding niches such as pollinators, are also predicted to be at risk of population declines, based on low ability to adapt to new environments when introduced there as aliens. Species with small ranges (<50 000km(2)) restricted to the two southern African biodiversity hotspots most at risk from climate change - the Cape Floral Kingdom and the Succulent Karoo - are ranked according to low, medium or high risk of extinction. Those restricted to mountain slopes, mountain tops or islands, and those occurring mainly at the southern or western extremes of these biomes, are ranked as highest risk. These include endemic sunbirds, warblers and rock-jumpers - none of which are currently recognised Red Data species. Using climate envelopes we modelled the possible range shifts by 2050 of three pairs of species found in habitats considered to be at risk: fynbos, mountain and and Karoo. All six species lost substantial portions of their range (x = 40%), with the montane Drakensberg Rock-jumper Chaetops aurantius losing most (69%). Significant reductions of available climate space in all species may interact with life history characteristics to threaten many southern African bird species unable to shift geographic range or adapt to novel resource conditions. We conclude with a list of research priorities and testable hypotheses which may advance our understanding of the complex influence that climate change is likely to have on African, particularly southern African, birds.

AB The global association between heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton in the open ocean was examined to identify the macroecological limits of bacterial abundance. A consolidated dataset was constructed using 13,973 paired measurements of bacterial abundance and chlorophyll concentration from 15 years of observation in various biogeochemical provinces covering the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans as well as the Arabian Sea. The bivariate relationship between bacteria and chlorophyll is a filled polygon whose upper boundary undergoes a change in slope from positive to negative at about 1 mgChl m(-3), suggesting a transition from bottom-up to top-down control of bacteria along a resource supply gradient. The upper limit of bacterial abundance in the ocean is everywhere set by phytoplankton, but the limit is not realized in productive waters because of mortality losses. A carrying capacity of about 7 trillion bacteria for 1 mg of chlorophyll is indicated by empirical observations, consistent with theoretical considerations and predictions from food web modelling.

AB The diploid hybrid species Helianthus deserticola inhabits the desert floor, an extreme environment relative to its parental species Helianthus annuus and Helianthus petiolaris. Adaptation to the desert floor may have occurred via selection acting on transgressive, or extreme, traits in early hybrids between the parental species. We explored this possibility through a field experiment in the hybrid species' native habitat using H. deserticola, H. annuus, H. petiolaris, and two populations of early-generation (BC2) hybrids between the parental species, which served as proxies for the ancestral genotype of the ancient hybrid species. Character expression was evaluated for each genotypic class. Helianthus deserticola was negatively transgressive for stem diameter, leaf area, and flowering date, and the latter two traits are likely to be advantageous in a desert environment. The BC 2 hybrids contained a range of variation that overlapped these transgressive trait means, and an analysis of phenotypic selection revealed that some of the selective pressures on leaf size and flowering date, but not stem diameter, would move the BC2 population toward the H. deserticola phenotype. Thus, H. deserticola may have originated from habitat-mediated directional selection acting on hybrids between H. annuus and H. petiolaris in a desert environment.

AB In newly invaded communities, interspecific competition is thought to play an important role in determining the success of the invader and its impact on the native community. In southern Australia, the native Polistes humilis was the predominant social wasp prior to the arrival of the exotic Vespula germanica (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). Both species forage for similar resources (water, pulp, carbohydrate and protein prey), and concerns have arisen about potential competition between them. The aim of this study was to identify the protein foods that these wasps feed on. As many prey items are masticated by these wasps to the degree that they cannot be identified using conventional means, morphological identification was complemented by sequencing fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. GenBank searches using BLAST and phylogenetic analyses were used to identify prey items to at least order level. The results were used to construct complete prey inventories for the two species. These indicate that while P. humilis is restricted to feeding on lepidopteran larvae, V. germanica collects a variety of prey of invertebrate and vertebrate origin. Calculated values of prey overlap between the two species are used to discuss the implications of V. germanica impacting on P. humilis. Results obtained are compared to those gained by solely 'conventional' methods, and the advantages of using DNA-based taxonomy in ecological studies are emphasized.

AB The science of climate change has matured considerably during the past decade, both relative to the strength of the evidence documenting the ongoing anthropogenic climate change and in terms of the quality of climate models projecting future changes in climate. Concomitantly, modeling studies to project the likely impacts of climate change on agricultural production also have become more sophisticated. Nonetheless, agricultural impact assessments still do not account for all important factors; for example, potential changes in yield losses due to altered dynamics and intensity of pests (insects, plant pathogens, and weeds) under climate change are generally ignored - an important omission, given the significant role of plant pests in constraining the production of food and fiber worldwide; This paper highlights selected challenges that must be overcome before we can hope to quantify the impacts of a changing climate on plant disease intensity and yield loss. They pertain both to retrospective analyses seeking to identify fingerprints related to climate change in long-term plant-disease records, as well as to the use of mathematical models to predict likely impacts on plant pathosystems in the future. The use of climate-change fingerprints has been limited because time series containing disease variables collected in a standardized manner are unavailable for most plant pathogens; in cases where such long-term records do exist, trends are often confounded by changes in biological or management factors over time. As for the use of models for impact assessment, key challenges pertain to uncertainty in input variables, the difficulty in predicting biological responses in the presence of nonlinearities and thresholds, and the high likelihood of genetic adaptation to climate change.

AB An assessment of air quality in the Grenoble area was made using the index of atmospheric purity (IAP). The survey area was divided into 198 units (0.7 X 1 km), in which 345 average lichen releves were analyzed according to the Braun-Blanquet method. Each releve station was characterized in the field by a subjective index of human impact (IHI) calculated according to four local environmental parameters influencing the epiphytic lichen flora: urbanization (urban, suburban or rural area), road traffic (low or high), local developments (stations located within crop fields, green areas, housing sites or car parks), and exposure (trees isolated, in rows or grouped). Eighty-three epiphytic lichen species and two algae were recorded and grouped into three ecological categories defined according to bark type and nutrient needs: nitrophytic, neutrophytic and acidophytic species. IAP values, varying from 5.9 to 71.7, were clustered into five categories in order to produce an air-quality map. The geographical pattern of the IAP map showed no clear connection with local sources of pollution, such as the vicinity of a road or an industrial plant, and was not correlated with annual mean values of SO(2), NO(2) and NO for the years 1994-1997. IAP appeared to be influenced by environmental artificiality as shown by a polynomial trend observed between IAP and IHI, even if IAP values were broadly scattered. Multivariate analysis (canonical correspondence) showed that high IAP values could be observed in stations of 'natural' environments at high elevations and in stations of 'artificial' environments at low elevations. It was also shown that IAP varied in relation to the relative proportion of ecological groups of lichen releves: although a majority of neutrophytic species (> 50%) with a much lower percentage of nitrophytic species generally characterized high IAP, a predominance of acidophytic or nitrophytic species led to a decrease in the IAP. A correlation between nitrophytic species and artificiality of the environment was also shown. Furthermore, IAP, initially created to characterize atmospheric pollution or atmospheric purity by means of the lichen flora, is shown to be influenced by other parameters such as environmental and landscape factors.

AB To investigate how progressive urbanization influences the distribution of ant species in cities, I compared the ant species richness in urban parks of different areas and ages of Tokyo, the most intensively developed urban region in Japan, and its developing neighbor, Chiba City. A total of 43 ant species were found from 98 parks. Multiple regression analysis revealed that park area and age had a positive effect on the number of ant species in the parks and that the parks in Tokyo contained fewer species than did comparable parks in Chiba. Thus, the progression of urbanization reduces ant species richness in urban parks, most likely because it isolates the parks from the surrounding area. Next, in order to examine the relationships between the types of landform modification and the ant distribution in urban areas, I compared the ant species richness in urban parks of Chiba City among different landform types (upland + terraces, lowlands, cut and fill, banking, and reclamation). This study showed that the parks in the reclaimed lands and lowlands contained fewer ant species than did parks in other areas. The reason for this decline of ant fauna is discussed.

AB In New Zealand, one species of mangrove, Avicennia marina var. australasica, forms a characteristic and often an extensive feature of the tidal mudflats of harbours and estuaries. Within their natural range, mangroves have generally increased in abundance in New Zealand over the last 100 yr in response to increased sedimentation associated with concurrent changes in catchment land use. However, little information is available about the ecological consequences of changes in the extent of mangrove habitats under varying sedimentation regimes. We therefore conducted a study to determine the effects of high sedimentation rates on mangrove plant communities and associated benthic community composition. We selected an estuary that is experiencing high rates of sedimentation (as high as 23 mm yr(-1)) and associated increases in mangrove area. We recorded clear differences in both plant and benthic communities along a gradient of decreasing sedimentation. Mangrove architecture (such as height and density of plants) and health (as measured by chlorophyll a fluorescence) were linked to high mud content of the sediment and elevated sedimentation patterns. Mangrove plants at the upper landward sites, characterised by a high percentage of mud and high total nutrients (total phosphorus [TP] and total nitrogen [TN]) and organic content, were taller than those at the seaward sites and had a larger number of pneumatophores as well as the greatest number of new seedlings. However, benthic macrofaunal diversity and abundance within the mangrove habitats were lower than expected, and clear functional differences were found between habitats with differing sedimentation patterns. Sites with high sedimentation rates had lower numbers of suspension feeders, low macrobenthic diversity, and were dominated by deposit-feeding polychaetes and oligochaetes. The diversity and density of benthic macrofaunal communities was, however, lower than that of sandflat communities for both mangrove habitats and adjacent intertidal mudflats in these sheltered areas, suggesting a response to the increased silt/clay from sedimentation rather than to the mangroves themselves. Our study demonstrates the potential for functional and structural effects on benthic communities on a larger spatial scale in estuarine areas experiencing high rates of sedimentation.

AB In southern Finland, most of the rivers are turbid and suffer from eutrophication and leaching of suspended solids from diffuse sources. We first related benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate structure to environmental factors using direct ordination. Second, benthic diatoms and macroinvertebrates were simultaneously sampled in several South-Finnish rivers and streams to compare two monitoring methods. The study sites constituted of some large, moderately nutrient rich rivers and some smaller, less eutrophic streams situated on the south coast of Finland. Diatom species distribution was most affected by conductivity, total P and latitude. Species distribution of macroinvertebrates was mostly related to channel width, conductivity and pH. For diatoms, separation of community structure between sampling stations was clear, but corresponding macroinvertebrate communities were more similar to each other. Correlation between diatom and macroinvertebrate pollution indices was rather low and insignificant (r=0.28). As a whole, variation of macroinvertebrate index values (CV=4.7%) among replicate samples was slightly lower than for diatom index (CV=6.0%). On the contrary, community similarity between the replicate samples was slightly lower among macroinvertebrates (r=0.770) due probably to their larger local scale spatial variation, sampling of more habitats and lower density compared to diatoms (r=0.874). In conclusion, multiple pressures affecting the river ecosystems at different spatial and temporal scales should lead to choosing more than one biological monitoring method with clearly identifiable responses.

AB Primula sect. Auricula is one of only a few endemics of the European high mountains with a comparatively large number of species. We explored the section's geographical origin, time of origin, and temporal course of diversification via parsimony, genetic distance, and lineages-through-time analyses based on the internal transcribed spacer ( ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. The taxa analyzed included 52 individuals representing all 25 species of the section, representatives of seven other European, Asian, and/or North American sections of the genus, and two species of Douglasia. We present evidence that sect. Auricula likely originated from an Asian ancestor at the end of the Late Tertiary, followed by its primary diversification into an "eastern'' and "western'' lineage at the Plio-/Pleistocene boundary. Comparison with a constant rates null model of stochastic diversification-extinction (birth-death) demonstrates that diversification has proceeded nonrandomly through Quaternary times in both lineages. They display a pulse of speciation events occurring soon after their origin and relatively few such events occurring since. This pattern contrasts with the predictions of the Late Pleistocene origins hypothesis and implies unpredictability of the evolutionary response of sect. Auricula to the recurrent abiotic conditions of the Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. We conclude that it is not necessary to invoke an increase in extinction rate. Rather, the observed slowdown of interspecific ( and intraspecific) diversification in sect. Auricula toward the present likely results from a decrease in diversification rate due to ecological and/or geographical space-filling processes.

These include the properties of parameters such as range, abundance, dispersion, evenness and diversity; the relationships between these parameters; the relationship between geographical distributions and landscape structure; and the co-occurrence of species. These patterns have often been used in the past to evaluate the role of ecological processes in structuring natural communities. In this paper, I investigate the patterns produced by simple neutral community models (NCMs) and compare them with the output of systematic biological surveys. The NCM generates qualitatively, and in some cases quantitatively, the same patterns as the survey data. It therefore provides a satisfactory general theory of diversity and distribution, although what patterns can be used to distinguish neutral from adaptationist interpretations of communities, or even whether such patterns exist, remains unclear.

AB Analyses of species-environment relationships are critically needed to guide conservation of many declining species. Comprehensive investigations of these relationships must incorporate environmental variables at multiple spatial scales since species responses to the environment vary with the scale of observation. We used partial canonical correspondence analysis to associate a bird assemblage in a threatened pitch pine-scrub oak (Pinus rigida-Quercus ilicifolia) community in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, USA, with plot, patch, and landscape level variables. The first level of analysis partitioned the amount of variance in the bird community explained by plot, patch, and landscape factors from that explained by spatial autocorrelation. The second level partitioned the amount of variance explained by plot, patch, and landscape factors alone and in combination. All three levels of environmental variables together accounted for 43% of the variance in the species data and only 5% of the variance was explainable by spatial factors alone. Landscape level factors accounted for a slightly larger amount of the, explained variation (12%) than plot (11%) or patch (8%) level factors. We also examined the cumulative fit of each species to the plot, patch, and landscape partial models. Nine species of regional and/or national conservation concern had distributions that fit one model considerably better than the others. The Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus) and Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia) were predominantly associated with plot level factors; the Whip-poor-will (Caprimulgus vociferus) was predominantly associated with patch level factors; and the Purple Finch (Carpodacus purpureus), Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Brown Thrasher (Toxostoma rufum), and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus) were predominantly associated with landscape level factors. This study suggests that focusing conservation efforts at the landscape level would provide the most effective protection for the largest number of sensitive species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The water chemistry of lake systems on the edge of the Antarctic continent responds quickly to changes in the moisture balance. This is expressed as increasing salinity and decreasing lake water level during dry periods, and the opposite during wet periods. The diatom composition of the lakes also changes with these fluctuations in salinity and lake water depth. This is important, as their siliceous remains become incorporated into lake sediments and can provide long-term records of past salinity using transfer functions. In order to develop transfer functions, diatoms and water chemistry data were inter-calibrated from five different East Antarctic oases, namely the Larsemann Hills, the Bolingen Islands, the Vestfold Hills, the Rauer Islands and the Windmill Islands. Results indicate that salinity is the most important environmental variable explaining the variance in the diatom flora in East Antarctic lakes. In oligo- saline lakes the variance is mainly explained by lake water depth. This dataset was used to construct a weighted averaging transfer function for salinity in order to infer historical changes in the moisture balance. This model has a jack-knifed r(2) of 0.83 and a RMSEP of 0.31. The disadvantage of this transfer function is that salinity changes in oligo- saline lakes are reconstructed inaccurately due to the 'edge effect' and due to the low species turnover along the salinity gradient at its lower end. In order to infer changes in the moisture balance in these lakes, a second transfer function using weighted averaging partial least squares ( with two components) for depth was constructed. This model has a jack-knifed r(2) of 0.76 and a RMSEP of 0.22. Both transfer functions can be used to infer climate driven changes in the moisture balance in lake sediment cores from oligo-, hypo-, meso- and hyper-saline lakes in East Antarctic oases between 102-758degreesE. The transfer function for lake water depth is promising to track trends in the moisture balance of small freshwater lakes, where changes in shallow and deep-water sediments are readily reflected in changing diatom composition.

AB Oxygen consumption of gestating Aspic vipers, Vipera aspis ( L.), was strongly dependent on body temperature and mass. Temperature-controlled, mass-independent oxygen consumption did not differ between pregnant and nonpregnant females. Maternal metabolism was not influenced during early gestation by the number of embryos carried but was weakly influenced during late gestation. These results differ from previous investigations that show an increase in mass-independent oxygen consumption in reproductive females relative to nonreproductive females and a positive relationship between metabolism and litter size. These data also conflict with published field data on V. aspis that show a strong metabolic cost associated with reproduction. We propose that, under controlled conditions (i.e., females exposed to precise ambient temperatures), following the mobilisation of resources to create follicles (i.e., vitellogenesis), early gestation per se may not be an energetically expensive period in reproduction. However, under natural conditions, the metabolic rate of reproductive females is strongly increased by a shift in thermal ecology ( higher body temperature and longer basking periods), enabling pregnant females to accelerate the process of gestation. Combining both laboratory and field investigation in a viviparous snake, we suggest that reproduction entails discrete changes in the thermal ecology of females to provide optimal temperatures to the embryos, whatever their number. This results in the counterintuitive notion that metabolism may well be largely independent of fecundity during gestation, at least in an ectothermic reptile.

AB Converging themes from the fields of environmental health, ecology and health, and human ecology highlight opportunities for innovation and advancement in environmental health theory and practice. In this commentary we outline the role of research and applied programs that integrate biophysical and social sciences with environmental health practice in order to address deficiencies in each field when taken on its own. New opportunities for environmental health protection and promotion are outlined based on the three converging themes: integrated approaches to research and policy, methodological acknowledgment of the synergies between the social and biophysical environments, and incorporation of core ecosystem principles into research and practice. These converging themes are discussed in relation to their implications for new types of intervention to achieve health gains across different spatial and temporal scales at the interface between biophysical and social environments.

AB The 'high-dose-refuge' (HDR) strategy is widely recommended by the biotechnology industry and regulatory authorities to delay pest adaptation to transgenic crops that produce Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins. This involves cultivating nontoxic plants (refuges) in close proximity to crops producing a high dose of Bt toxin. The principal cost associated with this strategy is due to yield losses suffered by farmers growing unprotected, refuge plants. Using a population genetic model of selection in a spatially heterogeneous environment, we show the existence of an optimal spatial configuration of refuges that could prevent the evolution of resistance whilst reducing the use of costly refuges. In particular, the sustainable control of pests is achievable with the use of more aggregated distributions of nontransgenic plants and transgenic plants producing lower doses of toxin. The HDR strategy is thus suboptimal within the context of sustainable agricultural development.

AB The knowledge about the relative contributions of additive genetic and maternal effects, as well as the proximate determinants of maternal effects variation, on population differentiation remains elusive. Likewise, although embryonic performance is often an important component of fitness, it has been relatively little explored in respect to population differentiation. By conducting reciprocal crosses between an acid and a neutral origin population of moor frogs (Rana arvalis), we investigated the relative importance of additive genetic versus maternal effects in local adaptation to acidity in embryonic traits. Furthermore, by performing removal experiments of gelatinous egg capsules (jelly), we evaluated the possibility that differences in the extraembryonic membranes might explain the interpopulation variation in embryonic acid tolerance found in this and earlier studies. Embryos were raised from fertilization to hatching at three different pH levels (pH 4.0, 4.25, and 7.5) in the laboratory, and acid stress tolerance was measured in terms of embryonic survival, growth and development (i.e., size and age at hatching). The results show that the higher acid tolerance of acid population embryos (in terms of survival) was maternally determined, indicating adaptive maternal effects. The jelly removal experiment revealed that adaptation to acidity in embryonic survival may arise through variation related to structure/composition of the egg capsules. There was no evidence for a genetic basis in acid tolerance in sublethal effects, but additive and nonadditive genetic effects were found in embryonic growth and development, independently of treatment. The results indicate a role for maternal effects in local adaptation to acidity in amphibians, and genetically based differences in early life-histories among the populations.

AB We studied two Corbicula morphotypes in a syntopic population in the Rhine River in order to reveal their taxonomic, reproductive and phylogenetic relationship, using morphometrics, DAF-fingerprinting, mitochondrial COI and nuclear ITS1 sequence variation. Morphometric analysis showed that two statistically distinguishable morphotypes with few intermediates were present.Mitochondrial sequence analysis detected two divergent clades. DAF-fingerprinting revealed three highly distinctive multilocus genotypes. Two of the multilocus genotypes were significantly associated with different morphotypes and mitochondrial lineages. The third genotype B, however, was found in both morphotypes, intermediates and mitochondrial lineages. Conclusive evidence for hybridization came from RFLP analysis of the nuclear ITS1 locus. We interpret the hybrids as F1 hybrids between different evolutionary lineages. Integration of Corbicula sequences from all over the world into Maximum Parsimony analysis suggested a simultaneous radiation resulting in several evolutionary lineages whose species status remained doubtful. An unequivocal taxonomic assignment of the two evolutionary lineages in the Rhine population was therefore not possible.

AB 1. The aim of ecological risk assessments is to evaluate the likelihood that ecosystems are adversely affected by human-induced disturbance that brings the ecosystem into a new dynamic equilibrium with a simpler structure and lower potential energy. The risk probability depends on the threshold capacity of the system (resistance) and on the capacity of the system to return to a state of equilibrium (resilience).
   2. There are two complementary approaches to assessing ecological risks of riverine landscape dynamics. The reductionist approach aims at identifying risk to the ecosystem on the basis of accumulated data on simple stressor-effect relationships. The holistic approach aims at taking the whole ecosystem performance into account, which implies meso-scale analysis.
   3. Landscape patterns and their dynamics represent the physical framework of processes determining the ecosystem's equilibrium. Assessing risks of landscape dynamics to riverine ecosystems implies addressing complex interactions of system components (e.g. population dynamics and biogeochemical cycles) occurring at multiple scales of space and time.
   4. One of the most important steps in ecological risk assessment is to establish clear assessment endpoints (e.g. vital ecosystem and landscape attributes). Their formulation must recognise that riverine ecosystems are dynamic, structurally complex and composed of both deterministic and stochastic components.
   5. Remote sensing (geo)statistics and geographical information systems are primary tools for quantifying spatial and temporal components of riverine ecosystem and landscape attributes.
   6. The difficulty to experiment at the riverine landscape level means that ecological risk management is heavily dependent on models. Current models are targeted towards simulating ecological risk at levels ranging from single species to habitats, food webs and meta-populations to ecosystems and entire riverine landscapes, with some including socioeconomic considerations.

AB We compared patterns of genetic structure at potentially selected (two allozyme loci) and neutral molecular markers (six microsatellite loci) in the acorn barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Our results confirmed the presence of a geographical shift in alleles MPI and GPI near the Miramichi River. In contrast, no significant patterns of population differentiation among samples located north and south of the river mouth were detected for four of six microsatellite loci. However, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) at individual loci revealed that a significant proportion of the total variance in allele frequencies was partitioned among samples located north and south of the river for both the allozyme and the other two microsateliite loci. The two most common alleles at these microsatellites showed frequencies that were highly correlated (r=0.65-0.74, P<0.05) with those of the MPI*2 allele, perhaps because of either physical linkage or epistasis. The two allozyme loci were significantly correlated in barnacles located north of the Miramichi River (r=0.86, P<0.05). Overall, our results supported the hypothesis that the broad scale pattern of allozyme allelic shifts is maintained by selection. They also indicated that microsatellites may not always behave in a neutral way and must be used cautiously, especially when evidence for genetic structuring relies on only a few assayed loci.

AB A simulation model was used to study the age structure of unmanaged forest landscapes under different fire regimes. Stand age was defined as the age of the oldest tree cohort in a stand. When most fires are not stand-replacing, the theoretical equilibrium stand age distribution is either bell-shaped or bimodal and dominated by old age-classes. Old-growth forests (oldest cohort > 150 y) dominate the landscape unless fires are both frequent and severe. Simulation results and analytical calculations show that if a regime of frequent fires (about every 50 y) maintains landscapes dominated by old-growth forests, then old-growth dominance persists when the number of fires is decreased, despite the associated increase in fire severity, Simulation results were applied to Pinus sylvestris-dominated landscapes of middle boreal Fennoscandia, which according to empirical results were dominated by old-growth forests when fires were frequent during the 19th century. Since the changes in the fire regime can be plausibly explained by changes in the number of human-caused ignitions, old-growth forests have evidently also dominated the landscapes earlier when fires were less frequent. The simulation model is used to produce plausible age distributions of middle boreal Fennoscandian forest landscapes under different historical fire regimes. In summary, the frequency of large-scale disturbance alone predicts forest landscape dynamics poorly, and the roles played by fire severity and residual stands need to be considered carefully. Maintaining and restoring old-growth structures is essential to regaining the natural variability of Fennoscandian forest landscapes.

AB We studied the role of genetic variability of donor beds in establishing transplantation criteria for the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Horizontal rhizomes, collected from three geographically distinct populations, were transplanted into a common bed at a highly human-impacted locality. The transplantation site was located near one of the donor populations. After three years, the shoots collected in the population adjacent to the transplanting site showed the lowest growth performance. Genetic variability, assessed through the analysis of hypervariable microsatellite regions, and growth performance followed a similar trend. The shoots growing and branching at the highest rate were those collected from populations with the highest heterozygosity values, despite greater geographic distance. No genetic differences were found between the transplanted shoots and shoots from donor meadows, as expected due to the low rate of sexual reproduction in P. oceanica and the short time that had passed since the transplants. The problem of affecting the local gene pool by the introduction of foreign genotypes could arise, but introduction of new alleles could balance the degradation of genetic variability caused by human impact. In general our study suggests that the genetic variability of source material is an important aspect to consider in the development of seagrass restoration strategies.

AB It has been suggested previously that the presence and abundance of indigenous species have a marked influence on the likelihood of invasion of a community. It has also been suggested that such biotic resistance has a negligible influence on the outcome of an invasion, but that the abiotic characteristics of the environment being invaded are more important. The latter has been claimed to be especially important on the islands of the Southern Ocean. In order to test these competing hypotheses we examined the distribution and abundance of indigenous and introduced springtails across 13 habitats, which differ considerably in the properties of their soils, and soil temperature, on the eastern quarter of sub-Antarctic Marion Island. There was no evidence of negative abundance covariation or species associations within habitats, nor were there significant relationships between species richness or abundance of the indigenous as opposed to the introduced collembolans across habitats. Interspecific interactions thus seem to have played no readily identifiable role in the outcome of invasions by Collembola on Marion Island. In contrast, the indigenous and introduced species responded very differently to abiotic variables. The indigenous Collembola prefer drier, more mineral soils with a low organic carbon content, and species richness tends to be highest in cold, fellfield areas. On the other hand, the introduced springtails prefer moist, warm sites, with organically enriched soils. Introduced species richness was negligible in cold, fellfield areas. Disturbance also appeared to influence positively the species richness and abundance of introduced species at a site. These results provide independent support for the idea that abiotic factors, especially temperature, significantly influence the likelihood of biological invasions on Southern Ocean islands. They also suggest that predicting the outcome of climate change on community structure in this region is likely to be problematic, especially in the case of the Collembola.

AB Biotic and abiotic factors causing aggregations of butterflies were investigated in a variety of uncultivated habitats on an organic farm in Denmark. By combining the method of butterfly transect counting with multiple regression analysis, environmental and floral variables influencing butterfly abundance in linear and non-linear uncultivated habitats were identified. Dependent variables were: butterfly totals, Thymelicus spp. (mainly T. lineola), Aphantopus hyperantus, Maniola jurtina, Pieris rapae/napi and four mobility groups. In linear habitats, environmental variables of major importance were: insolation, width of non-crop ground vegetation and abundance of nectar sources, while in non-linear habitats these were: larval host plants, presence of stream and degree of grazing. Among the preferred nectar sources were: Knautia arvensis, Trifolium pratense, Cirsium spp. and Hieracium pilosella. Most butterfly species had significantly higher abundances in non-linear habitats compared to linear habitats. The impact of different environmental and floral variables on the butterfly fauna is discussed, emphasizing the major importance of certain habitat types and characteristics for the butterfly species inhabiting uncultivated habitats surrounded by cultivated fields.

AB We used experimental nests baited with California Quail (Callipepla californica) eggs or clay eggs to examine relative risks of nest predation in an agricultural landscape and in two large forest preserves in a south-temperate rainforest in Chile. The most common predators, as identified by marks on clay eggs, were a caracara (Milvago chimango), a blackbird (Curaeus curaeus), and rodents. Nest losses from predation were similar in large and small forest patches and lower in patches than in extensive forest. In general, predation risk was higher (and nest survival therefore lower) on forest edges than in forest interior, in short-grass pasture than in tall-grass pasture, in narrow corridors than in wide corridors, and on visible nests than on concealed nests. High predation risks in pasture habitat tended to increase the risk of nest predation in adjacent forest edges. For open-cup nesters, the risk of nest predation was relatively high in the present agricultural landscape, indicating that much of the available wooded habitat (forest edges, narrow corridors) offers poor nesting habitat, although it may be suitable for foraging and traveling. The numerous bird-plant mutualisms in this landscape may be at risk if nesting success of the principal mutualists is consistently low.

AB Most investigations of altitudinal zonation of river macrobenthic communities have been conducted in the northern hemisphere. Conversely, South American habitats, and specifically the Argentinean ones, are poorly known. This is the first study of altitudinal zonation of macrobenthic communities in the Patagonian Andes. It was carried out at 14 sampling stations along 51 km of the Esquel-Percy River system over a 1000 m altitudinal gradient. Untreated sewage of Esquel City discharges in the middle section of the system. The main species assemblages of the monitored sites were identified and a functional categorization of the taxa was produced. Population distribution patterns were analyzed throughout a complete annual cycle, and both qualitative and quantitative variations were interpreted as a function of abiotic and biotic variables. The macrobenthic community found along the Esquel-Percy system is rich and diverse, except at middle-stretch stations, which are altered by anthropogenic perturbations. Specific composition, diversity and density were influenced by the topographic gradient, geochemical (conductivity and total alkalinity) and anthropogenic factors (BOD and oxygen saturation), and the seasonality of the system. Similarities with lotic environments of Australia and New Zealand were found in specific composition, density, and community structure. The biomass of shredders and predators decreased, while collectors increased, downstream from the headwaters. Collector-gatherers were the most important group at all sites. Functional organization showed better correspondence with the RCC model if biomass was used instead of macroinvertebrate density. We found that local and regional characteristics produced deviations from the RCC model, but it is still useful as a comprehensive framework for stream ecology in the Patagonian Andes.

AB Pasture lands are an important facet of land use in the northeast United States, yet little is known about their recent diversity. To answer some fundamental questions about the diversity of these pasture lands, we designed a broad survey to document plant species richness using an intensive, multi scale sampling method. We also wanted to learn whether environmental (soils or climate) or land management variables could help explain patterns of species richness. A total of 17 farms, encompassing 37 pastures, were sampled in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Maryland, Massachusetts and Connecticut during July and August 1998. We positively identified a total of 161 different plant species across the study region. Species richness averaged 31.7 +/-1.1 on pastures. Infrequent, transient species that were mostly perennial and annual forbs accounted for similar to 90% of the species richness. Except for a subjective rating of grazing intensity, land management methods were not good predictors of species richness. Over time, it appears that grazing neither reduces nor increases species richness in pastures. Of the environmental variables measured, only soil P explained a significant amount of the variation in species richness. Soil P was inversely related to species richness at the 1m(2) scale. Percent SOM was positively associated with species richness at this scale, although weakly. At larger spatial scales, we suggest that patterns of species richness are best explained by the species diversity of soil seed banks, or seed rain, and stochastic recruitment of these species into existing vegetation.

AB We examined the diets of 5 hake species in the continental shelf ecosystem of the northeast USA: offshore hake Merluccius albidus, silver hake M. bilinearis, white hake Urophycis tenuis, red hake U. chuss, and spotted hake U. regia. We conducted a multivariate analysis of stomach contents from bottom-trawl surveys to assess the major factors that determine diet composition, to compare and contrast diets between species, and to compare the trophic role of the hakes in the northwest Atlantic to hakes in other ecosystems. These fish consume pelagic invertebrates (e.g. euphausiids and other shrimps) and pelagic fish prey, including conspecifics. The incidence of piscivory generally increases with increasing size. Regional and temporal (seasonal and yearly) variation in hake diets generally reflects differences in prey availability. Hakes are among the most abundant. predators in continental shelf ecosystems worldwide. Fish prey consumption by hakes can be high and may be a primary source of mortality for economically important pelagic species. Hake predation plays an important role in the dynamics of both the US northeast continental shelf ecosystem and generally on a global scale.

AB Macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis were used to study the disturbance history and development of a boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karat.) forest landscape in southeastern Norway. The sites studied were natural forests and the charcoal records showed no evidence of fire disturbance that could have broken the continuity in the spruce forests that were established ca. 1700 years ago. Consequently, true spruce forest ecosystem continuity was documented on a landscape level. However, fire disturbed the mixed pine-deciduous forest ecosystems that preceded the present spruce forests, suggesting a shift from fire-prone, to fire-free forest ecosystems.
   It is argued that the studied forest landscape has the potential to be an important natural reference for future forestry, that would be required to mimic natural forest dynamics to be biologically sustainable. A stereotypic promiscuous use of fire in the regeneration phase may cause serious damages in forest ecosystems that have developed without the impact of fire disturbance.

AB Samples of the demersal fish fauna have been collected by beam trawl from the coastal waters of northwest Europe (49-57 degrees N, 8 degrees W-9 degrees E) by the UK, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, since 1990, during the third quarter of the year. Changes in community structure within small spatial scales were subtle as species compositions formed part of a continuum over the entire continental shelf. Populations of low diversity were particularly evident in the German Eight and on the North Sea continental coast, where dab Limanda limanda were abundant. In the Channel and to the west of the UK the demersal assemblages were more species-rich than in the North Sea and, although dab was still an important member of the underlying fish assemblage, the abundance of other species, especially poor cod Trisopterus minutus, solenette Buglossidium luteum, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, and the lesser weever, Echiichthys vipera, allowed a range of different groups to be identified. Despite the greater species diversity in this westerly region only eight out of a total nineteen flatfish species were found in abundance. The dominance of different species in different size classes was a key feature of the community structure. Flatfish were the largest group by weight in the smaller-length classes (<30 cm), and in western areas the elasmobranchs dominated the larger-size classes. Observed patterns in community structure were partly explained by the zoogeography of the region and the presence of the British Isles at the boundary between two faunal types. The additional influence on demersal populations of depth and substrate type, which may regulate the abundance of flatfish at key stages in their life history, was also discussed. In addition to these natural processes, recent increases in fishing effort are thought to have affected the structure of the demersal assemblage, and an examination of aggregated length-frequency distributions from these surveys tends to support this conclusion. Without further information on the distribution of fishing effort, it is not possible to separate the influence of natural faunal changes between regions from that of artificial changes caused by fishing activity.

AB Sympatric lizards in a transitional forest of Roraima, Brazil, dividing Amazon rain forest from savanna, contained a lizard assemblage of 16 species representing six families. Lizards varied in size, activity (diurnal versus nocturnal), microhabitats used, exposure to various conditions of light availability, prey types, and prey sizes. Overlaps in microhabitat occurrence varied from 0 (no overlap) to 1.0 (total overlap) whereas overlaps in prey types varied from 0.005 to 0.607. Microhabitat overlaps were higher overall than dietary overlaps. Pseudocommunity analyses on microhabitat data indicate that the community is got randomly assembled and that two distinct guilds exist, a leaf-litter guild and an arboreal guild, each with four species. Similar analyses on diet data revealed no apparent guild structure at the first rank (nearest neighbour). Lizard diets did not differ from a random assortment based on prey type. At lower levels, the assemblage was structured with respect to food. Variation in prey use among lizard species was tied more closely to the effect of lizard body size on prey size (lizards ate different-sized prey items). Although exploitative competition among species may maintain structure within this assemblage it does not necessarily cause the observed differences. Several species are nearly identical ecologically to sister taxa in other environments and within different lizard assemblages suggesting that composition of the local assemblage limits the species that can enter the assemblage. Finally, lack of structure at the lowest (most similar) neighbour ranks may reflect the impact of a transitional habitat on stability of species interactions at the local level.

AB Natural and human disturbances have had fundamentally different effects on ecosystems. Range scientists have proposed a new successional model, a ''state-and-transition model,'' which recognizes the possibility of multiple stable states in vegetation. This paper assesses this model via an investigation of the influence of fluvial processes and landforms on variation in a mosaic of riparian vegetation patches of different ages on a river reach in montane southwestern Colorado. We sampled the composition of herbaceous and shrubby plants in 67 contiguous patches along a 6 km reach of the river, measured 14 environmental variables in each patch, and then analyzed the relationship of the vegetation and environmental gradients using correspondence analysis. The variation in vegetation correlates most highly with the age of the patch, surficial-sediment size, and soil development, which represent different aspects of a gradient in time since last disturbance by floods. A consistent pattern of post-flood succession is not evident in the trends in species richness, mean percent cover, and species composition. The evidence suggests that exceptional floods in 1911 and 1927 altered fundamentally the physical environment on newly exposed bars. As a result, succession slowed and its trajectory may have been redirected toward a new stable state. While this may be a case of multiple stable states in a natural ecosystem, we suggest that such cases are rare in natural ecosystems. We also argue that proponents of state-and-transition models conclude wrongly that these models imply that managers can, or should, choose the desired state based primarily on human uses instead of managing for the potential natural vegetation. That decision is a societal one that should not be implicit in a successional model.

SO RESTORATION ECOLOGY

ID LEPIDOPTERA; POPULATION; SUGAR; POLLINATION; NYMPHALIDAE
AB Despite the critical role insects play in ecosystem functioning, there has been little study of factors affecting their reestablishment in restored ecosystems. The goals of this research were to quantify the nectar resources provided by reclaimed coal surface mines and to examine the role nectar resources play in determining butterfly community composition on these sites. Adult butterfly communities and nectar resources were sampled on 18 reclaimed coal surface-mined sites and five unmined hardwood sites in southwestern Virginia. Recently, reclaimed sites provided an average of 300 times the nectar abundance of the surrounding hardwoods, and nectar abundance and species richness decreased with time since reclamation. Total nectar abundance was highly correlated with total butterfly abundance and species richness for the entire flight season; these variables were also significantly correlated among sites during most of the 12 sampling periods during the flight season. In only a few cases, however, were butterfly and nectar abundance and species richness significantly correlated within individual sites during the flight season. These results suggest that, although adults of many butterfly species move in response to nectar availability, nectar resources are not sufficiently limiting that their life histories have evolved to maximize nectar resources temporally. While planting species in restored areas that provide abundant nectar will likely attract adult butterflies, this is only one of a number of habitat variables that must be considered in efforts to restore butterfly populations. Finally, adult butterflies appear to have limited utility as indicators of revegetation success.

AB This paper reports the results of a field experiment to identify factors regulating local variations in population sizes of a common insectivore. A low density population of hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus was artificially increased in numbers while simultaneously a high density population was reduced. Subsequent dispersal, mortality and natality were monitored in complete censuses of the total populations, and compared to a control population of transplanted hedgehogs at unchanged density. Predation on hedgehogs was principally by badgers Meles meles which forage for substantially similar foods to hedgehogs, and was significantly higher in the expanded population during the first 2 wk after transplant than in the control, which nevertheless suffered a high overall mortality. Dispersal of male hedgehogs in particular from the expanded population contributed to reducing the density close to its original level within 1 month of transplant, after which the population remained relatively stable for a further 2 months of monitoring. Surviving hedgehogs at this site maintained closer proximity to residential buildings. which were avoided by badgers, than those at the control site, rates of weight gain by males were also superior to those in the control population. The artificially reduced population in an urban area containing no badgers was partially replenished within 1 month. through a decreased loss rate and an increased gain rate, initially of adults and later in the year of juveniles born after the transplant. The hedgehogs here showed seasonal variation in dispersion between fields, which were associated with the breeding cycle and the distribution of earthworm prey. Hedgehogs utilized mown grass fields in relation to the availability of earthworms Lumbricus spp., which was itself dependent on the age of fields. The study demonstrates that predation can influence the abundance of hedgehogs as well as their distribution in a heterogeneous environment. Residential and urban patches of land appear to represent a niche largely free from badger activity, where hedgehog populations maintain a high equilibrium density despite predation by domestic dogs which can contribute to a rapid population turn-over.

AB Quaternary palaeoecology and vegetation science seem to have little in common today, despite similar aims and interests. Both subjects have much to contribute to each other. Three contributions of vegetation science to Quaternary palaeoecology are discussed: (1) the ecological interpretation of fossil assemblages using the plant-sociological literature, (2) the numerical arrangement of stratigraphical pollen diagrams to produce ''structured'' pollen diagrams, and (3) the use of ecological indicator values to reconstruct past environments from local-scale pollen-stratigraphical data. Three contributions of Quaternary palaeoecology to vegetation science are reviewed: (1) the recent history of the Blechno-quercetum petraeae association of western Britain, (2) the antiquity of modern vegetation types as assessed by analogue matching, and (3) the integration (or otherwise) of vegetation over long time periods. Future developments at strengthening the links between Quaternary palaeoecology and vegetation science are suggested. These are: (1) greater concern with spatial, temporal, and taxonomic precision, (2) more rigorous design of projects and selection of sites in relation to the aims of the investigation, and (3) the need for rigorous hypothesis testing in palaeoecology using Monte Carlo permutation procedures to assess statistical significances. The contributions of J.C. Ritchie to vegetation science and Quaternary palaeoecology are reviewed.

AB The relationships between 23 scaled chrysophyte taxa (Chrysophyceae and Synurophyceae) and measured limnological variables in 62 Adirondack, New York, drainage lakes were examined by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The major proportion of variation in chrysophyte species distributions was strongly related to total monomeric Al (Al(m)) and Mg concentrations, and their close correlates pH, Na, Ca, and acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC). Total monomeric Al concentrations explain a greater proportion of species variation than pH, suggesting that Al(m) concentrations may be more important in governing the distribution of chrysophyte taxa in these lakes. Gaussian logit (GL) and linear logit (LL) regressions of the relative percentages of individual chrysophyte taxa to lakewater pH and Al(m) concentrations and the examination of pH-Al(m) response surfaces show that many chrysophyte taxa exhibit unique responses to these environmental gradients; taxa can be characterized as alkaline, circumneutral, acidic, and pH indifferent. Within each of these groups, taxa can be characterized further based upon their optima and tolerances to Al(m) concentrations. Chrysophyte indicator species (i.e. a toxon with a strong statistical relationship to the environmental variable of interest, a well-defined optimum, and a narrow tolerance to the variable of interest) for pH include Mallomonas hindonii, M. crassisquama, M. pseudocoronata, and Synura uvella; M. hindonii, M. crassisquama, M. pseudocoronata, S. petersenii, and S. spinosa are good indicators of Al(m) concentrations. Highly significant predictive models were developed to infer lakewater pH and Al(m) concentrations from the relative percentages of chrysophyte scales in the study lakes. Model evaluation was based on their correlation coefficients and the root-mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) derived from bootstrapping. Weighted averaging regression and calibration with tolerance down-weighting (i.e. weighting taxa inversely to their variance) produced superior results when compared to the computationally and data-demanding maximum likelihood methods and to simple weighted averaging regression and calibration.

AB The California Basin Study program (CaBS) has measured carbon and nitrogen flows between some of the compartments of a planktonic system off Southern California. We have used an inverse analysis approach to infer those flows which were not measured in order to develop a more complete description of the planktonic food web. We then analyzed these results by using network analysis and by following the movement of imaginary tracers through the food web. Results suggest that detritus was a crucial part of the food web, with a substantial fraction of algal production flowing directly to it. Detrital production of dissolved organic matter (DOM), along with leakage from grazers, were the dominant sources of bacterial food. Bacteria did not provide an important path for the movement of organic matter to the larger mesozooplankton. Although mesozoa were not the dominant grazers of algal production, they were important for the movement of material below the euphotic zone, accounting for nearly half of the downward flux. Flows of carbon and nitrogen were quite different because Of Carbon respiration. Nitrogen removal from the euphotic zone was influenced by high dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations. The effects of DON and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in euphotic zone elemental cycling imply that an element used to trace new production will have a different removal rate from the euphotic zone unless it also has a comparable dissolved organic phase. More experimental effort needs to be devoted to detrital dynamics, as well as those of sub-copepod sized grazers.

AB Stellaria species are common herbs, preferred humid mountainously slopes, but some grew in desert. Main center of diversification for Stellaria is Eurasia, with a center of distribution in the mountains of central Asia. Some species are also cosmopolitan. It is represented by 9 species in Iran. The genus has high medicinal value. To determine the genetic diversity and understand the species' limits within the Iranian Stellaria, we produced molecular data using 139 randomly collected plants representing 8 species from five provinces of Iran. A total of 122 reproducible bands were generated by 10 of 25 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers, with an average of 12.2 bands/primer and 33% polymorphism. Largest number of effective alleles (Ne), genetic diversity (H), and Shannon Index (I) were shown by S. media. Our data depicted highest similarity between S. media and S. pallida and lowest between S. media and S. graminea. S. pallida showed relatively low level of genetic variation. Finally, the Neighbor Joining (NJ) trees based on RAPD markers data divided the populations into two different clusters, indicating their genetic difference which is discussed in details.

AB The purpose of this paper is to convey a thorough understanding of the governance-related determinants and financial consequences of carbon performance and disclosure. Its motivation lies in the increasing global political, social, academic as well as practical importance of managing and reporting on carbon-related issues. Methodologically, we employ a systematic literature review. Thus, we identify 73 quantitative peer-reviewed empirical studies in this field and categorize them according to a legitimacy-theory-based framework. Our four main contributions offer new insights into this emerging research field and provide guidance for the development of new research models: First, we help future researchers to structure this emerging field of research with respect to the interactions of the phenomenon itself (carbon performance vs. disclosure), its determinants (country- and firm-related governance), and its financial consequences (value relevance, information asymmetry, financial performance, and cost of capital). Second, we provide a comprehensive overview of variables and proxies used in the studies and list their main statistical effects, which facilitates building novel models. There are indications that 1) board composition positively influences both carbon performance and disclosure, 2) carbon performance and carbon disclosure are positively connected, 3) carbon disclosure reduces information asymmetry, and 4) carbon performance increases financial performance. Third, we develop a research agenda with concise suggestions for future studies. Fourth, we argue that due to the under-theorization of concepts the comparability of included studies is challenging, this research field may be characterized as a vibrant field for extensive future research.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a valuable resource for mediating global climate change and securing food production. Despite an alarming rate of global plant diversity loss, uncertainties concerning the effects of plant diversity on SOC remain, because plant diversity not only stimulates litter inputs via increased productivity, thus enhancing SOC, but also stimulates microbial respiration, thus reducing SOC. By analysing 1001 paired observations of plant mixtures and corresponding monocultures from 121 publications, we show that both SOC content and stock are on average 5 and 8% higher in species mixtures than in monocultures. These positive mixture effects increase over time and are more pronounced in deeper soils. Microbial biomass carbon, an indicator of SOC release and formation, also increases, but the proportion of microbial biomass carbon in SOC is lower in mixtures. Moreover, these species-mixture effects are consistent across forest, grassland, and cropland systems and are independent of background climates. Our results indicate that converting 50% of global forests from mixtures to monocultures would release an average of 2.70 Pg C from soil annually over a period of 20 years: about 30% of global annual fossil-fuel emissions. Our study highlights the importance of plant diversity preservation for the maintenance of soil carbon sequestration in discussions of global climate change policy.

AB The rhizosphere is a hotspot for microbial carbon transformations, and is the entry point for root polysaccharides and polymeric carbohydrates that are important precursors to soil organic matter (SOM). However, the ecological mechanisms that underpin rhizosphere carbohydrate depolymerization are poorly understood. Using Avena fatua, a common annual grass, we analyzed time-resolved metatranscriptomes to compare microbial functions in rhizosphere, detritusphere, and combined rhizosphere-detritusphere habitats. Transcripts were binned using a unique reference database generated from soil isolate genomes, single-cell amplified genomes, metagenomes, and stable isotope probing metagenomes. While soil habitat significantly affected both community composition and overall gene expression, the succession of microbial functions occurred at a faster time scale than compositional changes. Using hierarchical clustering of upregulated decomposition genes, we identified four distinct microbial guilds populated by taxa whose functional succession patterns suggest specialization for substrates provided by fresh growing roots, decaying root detritus, the combination of live and decaying root biomass, or aging root material. Carbohydrate depolymerization genes were consistently upregulated in the rhizosphere, and both taxonomic and functional diversity were highest in the combined rhizosphere-detritusphere, suggesting coexistence of rhizosphere guilds is facilitated by niche differentiation. Metatranscriptome-defined guilds provide a framework to model rhizosphere succession and its consequences for soil carbon cycling.

AB Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides great potential for estimating gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems. A strong relationship between SIF and GPP has been observed at the seasonal scale from both ground-based and satellite observations. However, variations of SIF due to changes in plant growth stages appear to influence the SIF-GPP relationship. It remains unclear how this relationship is affected by plant growth-related changes, especially for C4 plants such as maize. In this study, continuous in situ measurements for canopy far-red SIF retrieval and GPP calculation were made in maize during the growing season of 2017. Diurnal and seasonal variations of canopy SIF and its yield (SIFyield) were analyzed over different growth stages of maize to understand how they affect the relationship with GPP. The results show that the relationship between SIP and GPP varies with the growth stages of maize during the growing season, indicating that canopy structure has a strong impact on the seasonal variations of canopy SIF and its relation to GPP. Furthermore, we found that SIFyield is significantly correlated with canopy photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) at the canopy level throughout the season. However, it is almost uncorrelated with LUE after adjusting for the effects of canopy structure with the structural vegetation index MTVI2. This finding highlights the importance of canopy structure in the relationship between SIFyield and LUE, complicating the use of canopy SIF for tracking vegetation physiological activity. Overall, our observation-based findings show that canopy structure affects the SIF-GPP relationship, strengthening our understanding of the mechanistic link between SIF and photosynthesis.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides have been signaled as an important driver of widespread declines in bee diversity and abundance. Neonicotinoids were registered in the 1990s and by 2010 accounted for one third of the global insecticide market. Following a moratorium in 2013, their use on open-field crops was completely banned in the EU in 2018. Pesticide regulation should be based on solid and updated scientific evidence, whereby products showing unacceptable effects on the environment are not approved. Clearly, pesticide regulation failed to detect the ecological threats posed by neonicotinoids. We argue that at the time neonicotinoids were authorized, risk assessment (RA) protocols were inadequate to detect some of the risks associated with neonicotinoid properties, including high efficacy, long persistence, high systemicity, high mobility, and application versatility. We advocate for the adoption of a more holistic RA approach that should account for: a) temporal and spatial dimensions of pesticide exposure; b) co-exposure to multiple compounds; c) differences among bee species with different life histories in levels of exposure and sensitivity; and d) sublethal effects (mostly ignored in current RA procedures). We also argue that regulatory studies conducted to support pesticide registration should be publicly available, and that pesticide regulation should not be discontinued once a product has been authorized. We should use the knowledge acquired through the neonicotinoid experience as an opportunity to profoundly revise bee RA schemes. These efforts should be initiated promptly; the neonicotinoid story has also taught us that the regulatory system is reluctant to react.

AB Freshwater ecosystems constitute only a small fraction of the planet's water resources, yet support much of its diversity, with freshwater fish accounting for more species than birds, mammals, amphibians or reptiles. Fresh waters are, however, particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts, including habitat loss, climate and land use change, pollution and biological invasions. This environmental degradation, combined with unprecedented rates of biodiversity change, highlights the importance of robust and replicable programmes to monitor freshwater fish. Such monitoring programmes can have diverse aims, including confirming the presence of a single species (e.g., early detection of alien species), tracking changes in the abundance of threatened species, or documenting long-term temporal changes in entire communities. Irrespective of their motivation, monitoring programmes are only fit for purpose if they have clearly articulated aims and collect data that can meet those aims. This review, therefore, highlights the importance of identifying the key aims in monitoring programmes and outlines the different methods of sampling freshwater fish that can be used to meet these aims. We emphasize that investigators must address issues around sampling design, statistical power, species' detectability, taxonomy and ethics in their monitoring programmes. Additionally, programmes must ensure that high-quality monitoring data are properly curated and deposited in repositories that will endure. Through fostering improved practice in freshwater fish monitoring, this review aims to help programmes improve understanding of the processes that shape the Earth's freshwater ecosystems and help protect these systems in face of rapid environmental change.

AB Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but only recently community ecologists realized the need to document their spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time - i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modeling. We apply this framework to host-parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modeling and community ecology.

AB Support for the "biotic resistance hypothesis," that species-rich communities are more successful at resisting invasion by exotic species than are species-poor communities, has long been debated. It has been argued that native-exotic richness relationships (NERR) are negative at small spatial scales and positive at large scales, but evidence for the role of spatial scale on NERR has been contradictory. However, no formal quantitative synthesis has previously examined whether NERR is scale-dependent across multiple studies, and previous studies on NERR have not distinguished spatial grain and extent, which may drive very different ecological processes. We used a global systematic review and hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the patterns of NERR over a range of spatial grain sizes and spatial extents, based on 204 individual cases of observational (non-experimental) NERRs from 101 publications. We show that NERR was indeed highly scale dependent across studies and increased with the log of grain size. However, mean NERR was not negative at any grain size, although there was high heterogeneity at small grain sizes. We found no clear patterns of NERR across different spatial extents, suggesting that extent plays a less important role in determining NERR than does grain, although there was a complex interaction between extent and grain size. Almost all studies on NERR were conducted in North America, western Europe, and a few other regions, with little information on tropical or Arctic regions. We did find that NERR increased northward in temperate regions and also varied with longitude. We discuss possible explanations for the patterns we found, and caution that our results do not show that invasive species are benign or have no negative consequences for biodiversity preservation. This study represents the first global quantitative analysis of scale-based NERR, and casts doubt on the existence of an "invasion paradox" of negative NERR at small scales and positive correlations at large scales in non-experimental studies.

AB The current generation of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) lacks a mechanistic representation of vegetation responses to soil drought, impairing their ability to accurately predict Earth system responses to future climate scenarios and climatic anomalies, such as El Nino events. We propose a simple numerical approach to model plant responses to drought coupling stomatal optimality theory and plant hydraulics that can be used in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). The model is validated against stand-scale forest transpiration (E) observations from a long-term soil drought experiment and used to predict the response of three Amazonian forest sites to climatic anomalies during the twentieth century. We show that our stomatal optimization model produces realistic stomatal responses to environmental conditions and can accurately simulate how tropical forest E responds to seasonal, and even long-term soil drought. Our model predicts a stronger cumulative effect of climatic anomalies in Amazon forest sites exposed to soil drought during El Nino years than can be captured by alternative empirical drought representation schemes. The contrasting responses between our model and empirical drought factors highlight the utility of hydraulically-based stomatal optimization models to represent vegetation responses to drought and climatic anomalies in DGVMs.

AB The impact of increasing vertebrate predator numbers on bird populations is widely debated among the general public, game managers and conservationists across Europe. However, there are few systematic reviews of whether predation limits the population sizes of European bird species. Views on the impacts of predation are particularly polarised in the UK, probably because the UK has a globally exceptional culture of intensive, high-yield gamebird management where predator removal is the norm. In addition, most apex predators have been exterminated or much depleted in numbers, contributing to a widely held perception that the UK has high numbers of mesopredators. This has resulted in many high-quality studies of mesopredator impacts over several decades. Here we present results from a systematic review of predator trends and abundance, and assess whether predation limits the population sizes of 90 bird species in the UK. Our results confirm that the generalist predators Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Crows (Corvus corone and C. cornix) occur at high densities in the UK compared with other European countries. In addition, some avian and mammalian predators have increased numerically in the UK during recent decades. Despite these high and increasing densities of predators, we found little evidence that predation limits populations of pigeons, woodpeckers and passerines, whereas evidence suggests that ground-nesting seabirds, waders and gamebirds can be limited by predation. Using life-history characteristics of prey species, we found that mainly long-lived species with high adult survival and late onset of breeding were limited by predation. Single-brooded species were also more likely to be limited by predation than multi-brooded species. Predators that depredate prey species during all life stages (i.e. from nest to adult stages) limited prey numbers more than predators that depredated only specific life stages (e.g. solely during the nest phase). The Red Fox and non-native mammals (e.g. the American Mink Neovison vison) were frequently identified as numerically limiting their prey species. Our review has identified predator-prey interactions that are particularly likely to result in population declines of prey species. In the short term, traditional predator-management techniques (e.g. lethal control or fencing to reduce predation by a small number of predator species) could be used to protect these vulnerable species. However, as these techniques are costly and time-consuming, we advocate that future research should identify land-use practices and landscape configurations that would reduce predator numbers and predation rates.

AB In spite of the extensive contribution of intestinal pathology to the pathophysiology of schistosomiasis, little is known of the impact of schistosome infection on the composition of the gut microbiota of its mammalian host. Here, we characterised the fluctuations in the composition of the gut microbial flora of the small and large intestine, as well as the changes in abundance of individual microbial species, of mice experimentally infected with Schistosoma mansoni-with the goal of identifying microbial taxa with potential roles in the pathophysiology of infection and disease. Bioinformatic analyses of bacterial 165 rRNA gene data revealed an overall reduction in gut microbial alpha diversity, alongside a significant increase in microbial beta diversity characterised by expanded populations of Akkermansia muciniphila (phylum Verrucomicrobia) and lactobacilli, in the gut microbiota of S. mansoni-infected mice when compared to uninfected control animals. These data support a role of the mammalian gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of hepato-intestinal schistosomiasis and serves as a foundation for the design of mechanistic studies to unravel the complex relationships amongst parasitic helminths, gut microbiota, pathophysiology of infection and host immunity.

AB Marine invasion ecology and management have progressed significantly over the last 30years although many knowledge gaps and challenges remain. The kelp Undaria pinnatifida, or Wakame, has a global non-native range and is considered one of the world's worst invasive species. Since its first recorded introduction in 1971, numerous studies have been conducted on its ecology, invasive characteristics, and impacts, yet a general consensus on the best approach to its management has not yet been reached. Here, we synthesize current understanding of this highly invasive species and adopt Undaria as a case study to highlight challenges in wider marine invasion ecology and management. Invasive species such as Undaria are likely to continue to spread and become conspicuous, prominent components of coastal marine communities. While in many cases, marine invasive species have detectable deleterious impacts on recipient communities, in many others their influence is often limited and location specific. Although not yet conclusive, Undaria may cause some ecological impact, but it does not appear to drive ecosystem change in most invaded regions. Targeted management actions have also had minimal success. Further research is needed before well-considered, evidence-based management decisions can be made. However, if Undaria was to become officially unmanaged in parts of its non-native range, the presence of a highly productive, habitat former with commercial value and a broad ecological niche, could have significant economic and even environmental benefit. How science and policy reacts to the continued invasion of Undaria may influence how similar marine invasive species are handled in the future.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to profile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from early-stage PD patients for disease-related metabolic changes and to determine a robust biomarker signature for early-stage PD diagnosis.
   Methods: By applying a non-targeted and mass spectrometry-driven approach, we investigated the CSF metabolome of 44 early-stage sporadic PD patients yet without treatment (DeNoPa cohort). We compared all detected metabolite levels with those measured in CSF of 43 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. After this analysis, we validated the results in an independent PD study cohort (Tubingen cohort).
   Results: We identified that dehydroascorbic acid levels were significantly lower and fructose, mannose, and threonic acid levels were significantly higher (P < .05) in PD patients when compared with healthy controls. These changes reflect pathological oxidative stress responses, as well as protein glycation/glycosylation reactions in PD. Using a machine learning approach based on logistic regression, we successfully predicted the origin (PD patients vs healthy controls) in a second (n = 18) as well as in a third and completely independent validation set (n = 36). The biomarker signature is composed of the three markersmannose, threonic acid, and fructoseand allows for sample classification with a sensitivity of 0.790 and a specificity of 0.800.
   Conclusion: We identified PD-specific metabolic changes in CSF that were associated with antioxidative stress response, glycation, and inflammation. Our results disentangle the complexity of the CSF metabolome to unravel metabolome changes related to early-stage PD. The detected biomarkers help understanding PD pathogenesis and can be applied as biomarkers to increase clinical diagnosis accuracy and patient care in early-stage PD.

AB Gastrointestinal helminth parasites share their habitat with a myriad of other organisms, that is, the commensal microbiota. Increasing evidence, particularly in humans and rodent models of helminth infection, points towards a multitude of interactions occurring between parasites and the gut microbiota, with a profound impact on both host immunity and metabolic potential. Despite this information, the exploration of the effects that parasite infections exert on populations of commensal gut microbes of veterinary species is a field of research in its infancy. In this article, we summarise studies that have contributed to current knowledge of helminth-microbiota interactions in species of veterinary interest, and identify possible avenues for future research in this area, which could include the exploitation of such relationships to improve parasite control and delay or prevent the development of anthelmintic resistance.

AB Remnant habitat patches immersed within biofuel cropland matrices can retain considerable species diversity, although the effects of land use change on species persistence in historically modified landscapes remain unclear. The Atlantic Forest is one of the most fragmented South American biodiversity hotspots and retains about 12% of its original vegetation cover. Most of these remnants are distributed in small isolated fragments immersed mainly within pastures and sugarcane monocultures. Here we examine how species richness and composition of medium and large-sized mammals are explained by forest cover, structural area and forest edge amount at the landscape scale. We sampled 22 fragmented landscapes dominated by sugarcane plantations along a wide gradient of forest cover (3% to 96%) in southeastern Brazil. We recorded 88% of terrestrial mammal species expected for this region, but many likely local extirpations were detected at the landscape scale, with losses between 50% to 80% of species. Most of the landscapes were highly depleted of forest-specialist species, with replacements by exotics and/or species typical of non-forest habitats. We found that total mammalian species richness, which includes forest-specialists, generalists, exotics and non-forest dwelling species, was not affected by landscape metrics, such as forest cover, structural area and forest edge amount. Nevertheless, forest cover was important predictor of the presence of three ungulates, a medium-sized rodent and an armadillo. Local mammalian communities exhibited a high degree of species turnover between landscapes, representing 95% of the total beta-diversity. In this region, where there was no regional extinction, landholder compliance with the Brazilian Forest Bill and restoration measures will enhance habitat connectivity and mammal persistence across the wider unprotected countryside.

AB Global warming has revitalized interest in the relationship between body size and temperature, proposed by Bergmann's rule 150 years ago, one of the oldest manifestations of a 'biogeography of traits'. We review biogeographic evidence, results from clonal cultures and recent micro-and mesocosm experiments with naturally mixed phytoplankton communities regarding the response of phytoplankton body size to temperature, either as a single factor or in combination with other factors such as grazing, nutrient limitation, and ocean acidification. Where possible, we also focus on the comparison between intraspecific size shifts and size shifts resulting from changes in species composition. Taken together, biogeographic evidence, community-level experiments and single-species experiments indicate that phytoplankton average cell sizes tend to become smaller in warmer waters, although temperature is not necessarily the proximate environmental factor driving size shifts. Indirect effects via nutrient supply and grazing are important and often dominate. In a substantial proportion of field studies, resource availability is seen as the only factor of relevance. Interspecific size effects are greater than intraspecific effects. Direct temperature effects tend to be exacerbated by indirect ones, if warming leads to intensified nutrient limitation or copepod grazing while ocean acidification tends to counteract the temperature effect on cell size in non-calcifying phytoplankton. We discuss the implications of the temperature-related size trends in a global-warming context, based on known functional traits associated with phytoplankton size. These are a higher affinity for nutrients of smaller cells, highest maximal growth rates of moderately small phytoplankton (ca. 102 mu m(3)), size-related sensitivities for different types of grazers, and impacts on sinking rates. For a phytoplankton community increasingly dominated by smaller algae we predict that: (i) a higher proportion of primary production will be respired within the microbial food web; (ii) a smaller share of primary production will be channeled to the classic phytoplankton-crustacean zooplankton-fish food chain, thus leading to decreased ecological efficiency from a fish-production point of view; (iii) a smaller share of primary production will be exported through sedimentation, thus leading to decreased efficiency of the biological carbon pump.

AB Many temperate European tree species have their southernmost distribution limits in the Mediterranean Basin. The projected climatic conditions, particularly an increase in dryness, might induce an altitudinal and latitudinal retreat at their southernmost distribution limit. Therefore, characterizing the morphological and physiological variability of temperate tree species under dry conditions is essential to understand species' responses to expected climate change. In this study, we compared branch-level hydraulic traits of four Scots pine and four sessile oak natural stands located at the western and central Mediterranean Basin to assess their adjustment to water limiting conditions. Hydraulic traits such as xylem-and leaf-specific maximum hydraulic conductivity (KS-MAX and KL-MAX), leaf-to-xylem area ratio (A(L): A(X)) and functional xylem fraction (FX) were measured in July 2015 during a long and exceptionally dry summer. Additionally, xylem-specific native hydraulic conductivity (KS-N) and native percentage of loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) were measured for Scots pine. Interspecific differences in these hydraulic traits as well as intraspecific variability between sites were assessed. The influence of annual, summer and growing season site climatic aridity (P/PET) on intraspecific variability was investigated. Sessile oak displayed higher values of KS-MAX, KL-MAX, A(L): A(X) but a smaller percentage of FX than Scots pines. Scots pine did not vary in any of the measured hydraulic traits across the sites, and PLC values were low for all sites, even during one of the warmest summers in the region. In contrast, sessile oak showed significant differences in KS-MAX, KL-MAX, and FX across sites, which were significantly related to site aridity. The striking similarity in the hydraulic traits across Scots pine sites suggests that no adjustment in hydraulic architecture was needed, likely as a consequence of a drought-avoidance strategy. In contrast, sessile oak displayed adjustments in the hydraulic architecture along an aridity gradient, pointing to a drought-tolerance strategy.

AB Aims We aim to document elevational richness patterns of geometrid moths in a globally replicated, multi-gradient setting, and to test general hypotheses on environmental and spatial effects (i. e. productivity, temperature, precipitation, area, mid-domain effect and human habitat disturbance) on these richness patterns.
   Location Twenty-six elevational gradients world-wide (latitudes 288 S to 518 N).
   Methods We compiled field datasets on elevational gradients for geometrid moths, a lepidopteran family, and documented richness patterns across each gradient while accounting for local undersampling of richness. Environmental and spatial predictor variables as well as habitat disturbance were used to test various hypotheses. Our analyses comprised two pathways: univariate correlations within gradients, and multivariate modelling on pooled data after correcting for overall variation in richness among different gradients.
   Results The majority of gradients showed midpeak patterns of richness, irrespective of climate and geographical location. The exclusion of humanaffected sampling plots did not change these patterns. Support for univariate main drivers of richness was generally low, although there was idiosyncratic support for particular predictors on single gradients. Multivariate models, in agreement with univariate results, provided the strongest support for an effect of area-integrated productivity, or alternatively for an elevational area effect. Temperature and the mid-domain effect received support as weaker, modulating covariates, while precipitation-related variables had no explanatory potential.
   Main conclusions Despite the predicted decreasing diversity-temperature relationship in ectotherms, geometrid moths are similar to ants and salamanders as well as small mammals and ferns in having predominantly their highest diversity at mid-elevations. As in those comparative analyses, single or clear sets of drivers are elusive, but both productivity and area appear to be influential. More comparative elevational studies for various insect taxa are necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of elevational diversity and productivity.

AB Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a prototypical B cell-mediated autoimmune disease affecting 20-50 people per 100,000. The majority of patients fall into two clinically distinguishable types based on whether they produce autoantibodies targeting the acetylcholine receptor (AChR-MG) or muscle specific kinase (MuSK-MG). The autoantibodies are pathogenic, but whether their generation is associated with broader defects in the B cell repertoire is unknown. To address this question, we performed deep sequencing of the BCR repertoire of AChR-MG, MuSK-MG, and healthy subjects to generate similar to 518,000 unique V-H and V-L sequences from sorted naive and memory B cell populations. AChR-MG and MuSK-MG subjects displayed distinct gene segment usage biases in both V-H and V-L sequences within the naive and memory compartments. The memory compartment of AChR-MG was further characterized by reduced positive selection of somatic mutations in the V-H CDR and altered V-H CDR3 physicochemical properties. The V-L repertoire of MuSK-MG was specifically characterized by reduced V-J segment distance in recombined sequences, suggesting diminished V-L receptor editing during B cell development. Our results identify large-scale abnormalities in both the naive and memory B cell repertoires. Particular abnormalities were unique to either AChR-MG or MuSK-MG, indicating that the repertoires reflect the distinct properties of the subtypes. These repertoire abnormalities are consistent with previously observed defects in B cell tolerance checkpoints in MG, thereby offering additional insight regarding the impact of tolerance defects on peripheral autoimmune repertoires. These collective findings point toward a deformed B cell repertoire as a fundamental component of MG.

AB Questions: Many studies report a decrease of native species richness in communities after plant invasion by exotic taxa, but the implications of species losses on community functional structure and ecosystem processes have been less explored. The questions addressed are: (1) what are the impacts of invasive plant taxa on the functional structure of the recipient community; and (2) are there links between such functional structure and ecosystem properties representing key ecosystem processes?
   Location: Costal habitats of Mallorca and Menorca, Balearic Islands, Spain.
   Methods: In paired invaded and non-invaded plots, species frequencies and ecosystem properties related to biogeochemical cycles (soil C and N content, soil moisture and decomposition rate) were assessed. For every native species we obtained values of several functional traits (plant height, woodiness, N fixation and evergreenness). Then we calculated indices of community functional structure (community-weighted means for each trait; functional diversity: richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion; and functional redundancy) and compared them between paired invaded and non-invaded plots. The relationship with ecosystem properties was assessed using GLM.
   Results: The spectra of trait distribution changed in the invaded assemblages towards a higher frequency of woodiness and evergreenness. Invaded communities showed decreased species richness, and lower functional richness, divergence, dispersion and redundancy. In contrast, ecosystem properties were scarcely sensitive to invasion. Functional redundancy was negatively related to soil N of invaded plots and soil moisture in the dry season, which suggests higher depletion of soil resources when several species share the same combination of trait values.
   Conclusions: Carpobrotus invasion led to a functional homogenization within communities, which probably reduces their resilience. The functional structure of the community was more responsive to invasion than the ecosystem properties. The weak relationship between functional indices and ecosystem properties suggests that they may respond to invasion at different rates.

AB Anthropogenic pressures on tropical forests are rapidly intensifying, but our understanding of their implications for biological diversity is still very limited, especially with regard to soil biota, and in particular soil bacterial communities. Here we evaluated bacterial community composition and diversity across a gradient of land use intensity in the eastern Amazon from undisturbed primary forest, through primary forests varyingly disturbed by fire, regenerating secondary forest, pasture, and mechanized agriculture. Soil bacteria were assessed by paired-end Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments (V4 region). The resulting sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) at a 97% similarity threshold. Land use intensification increased the observed bacterial diversity (both OTU richness and community heterogeneity across space) and this effect was strongly associated with changes in soil pH. Moreover, land use intensification and subsequent changes in soil fertility, especially pH, altered the bacterial community composition, with pastures and areas of mechanized agriculture displaying the most contrasting communities in relation to undisturbed primary forest. Together, these results indicate that tropical forest conversion impacts soil bacteria not through loss of diversity, as previously thought, but mainly by imposing marked shifts on bacterial community composition, with unknown yet potentially important implications for ecological functions and services performed by these communities.

AB Insect pollinators are essential for both the production of a large proportion of world crops and the health of natural ecosystems. As important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to feed both themselves and provision their colonies.
   Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However, little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate flowers.
   We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10ppb thiamethoxam) or control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) in an outdoor flight arena.
   We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became foragers, and that they visited more L.corniculatus flowers than controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide. There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T.repens flowers, and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L.corniculatus on their first visit.
   Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary for ecosystem functioning.

AB The two main challenges of ecological modelling are to yield more general understanding and theory and to provide testable and robust predictions. To achieve this, emergence, structural realism, and prediction have to become key elements of designing models. In the special issue "Next-generation ecological modelling", which is dedicated to Donald DeAngelis on the occasion of his 70th birthday, 16 contributions present and discuss main features of next-generation ecological modelling. One key feature is to base the description of individuals' behaviour and interactions on first principles rooted in energetic or evolutionary theory. To cope with increasing model complexity, standardization, separate testing of alternative submodels against multiple output patterns, and documenting these tests will be required. Including micro-evolution is essential to capture organisms' response to changing conditions. Functional types may be used instead of species for representing communities. Model analysis will be challenging, but robustness analysis, which tries to break models' explanations, can help to tell signals from noise and identify general mechanisms underlying the internal organization of ecological systems. Ultimately, next-generation modelling should aim at developing general theory to better understand stability properties and mechanisms. This understanding then can provide the basis for restoring, maintaining, or strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and supporting sustainable management of natural resources.

AB Sustainably managing marine species is crucial for the future health of the human population. Yet there are diverse perspectives concerning which species can be exploited sustainably, and how best to do so. Motivated by recent debates in the published literature over marine conservation challenges, we review ten principles connecting life-history traits, population growth rate, and density-dependent population regulation. We introduce a framework for categorizing life histories, POSE (Precocial-Opportunistic-Survivor-Episodic), which illustrates how a species' life-history traits determine a population's compensatory capacity. We show why considering the evolutionary context that has shaped life histories is crucial to sustainable management. We then review recent work that connects our framework to specific opportunities where the life-history traits of marine species can be used to improve current conservation practices.

AB Variation in resource availability commonly exerts strong effects on fitness-related traits in wild animals. However, we know little about the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects, or about their persistence over time. To address these questions, we profiled genome-wide whole-blood DNA methylation levels in two sets of wild baboons: (i) 'wild-feeding' baboons that foraged naturally in a savanna environment and (ii) 'Lodge' baboons that had ready access to spatially concentrated human food scraps, resulting in high feeding efficiency and low daily travel distances. We identified 1014 sites (0.20% of sites tested) that were differentially methylated between wild-feeding and Lodge baboons, providing the first evidence that resource availability shapes the epigenome in a wild mammal. Differentially methylated sites tended to occur in contiguous stretches (i.e., in differentially methylated regions or DMRs), in promoters and enhancers, and near metabolism-related genes, supporting their functional importance in gene regulation. In agreement, reporter assay experiments confirmed that methylation at the largest identified DMR, located in the promoter of a key glycolysis-related gene, was sufficient to causally drive changes in gene expression. Intriguingly, all dispersing males carried a consistent epigenetic signature of their membership in a wild-feeding group, regardless of whether males dispersed into or out of this group as adults. Together, our findings support a role for DNA methylation in mediating ecological effects on phenotypic traits in the wild and emphasize the dynamic environmental sensitivity of DNA methylation levels across the life course.

AB Exposure to phthalates has been found to have adverse effects on male reproductive function in animals. However, the findings from human studies are inconsistent. Here we examined the associations of phthalate exposure with semen quality and reproductive hormones in a Chinese population using phthalate metabolite concentrations measured in semen as biomarkers. Semen (n = 687) and blood samples (n = 342) were collected from the male partners of sub-fertile couples who presented to the Reproductive Center of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Semen quality parameters and serum reproductive hormone levels were determined. Semen concentrations of 8 phthalate metabolites were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Associations of the semen phthalate metabolites with semen quality parameters and serum reproductive hormones were assessed using confounder-adjusted linear and logistic regression models. Semen phthalate metabolites were significantly associated with decreases in semen volume [mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP)], sperm curvilinear velocity [monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), MEHP, the percentage of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate metabolites excreted as MEHP (%MEHP)], and straight-line velocity (MBzP, MEHP, %MEHP), and also associated with an increased percentage of abnormal heads and tails (MBzP) (all p for trend <0.05). These associations remained suggestive or significant after adjustment for multiple testing. There were no significant associations between semen phthalate metabolites and serum reproductive hormones. Our findings suggest that environmental exposure to phthalates may impair human semen quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban growth is a major factor of global environmental change and has important impacts on biodiversity, such as changes in species composition and biotic homogenization. Most previous studies have focused on effects of urban area as a general measure of urbanization, and on few or single taxa. Here, we analyzed the impacts of the different components of urban sprawl (i.e., scattered and widespread urban growth) on species richness of a variety of taxonomic groups covering mosses, vascular plants, gastropods, butterflies, and birds at the habitat and landscape scales. Besides urban area, we considered the average age, imperviousness, and dispersion degree of urban area, along with human population density, to disentangle the effects of the different components of urban sprawl on biodiversity. The study was carried out in the Swiss Plateau that has undergone substantial urban sprawl in recent decades.
   Vascular plants and birds showed the strongest responses to urban sprawl, especially at the landscape scale, with non-native and ruderal plants proliferating and common generalist birds increasing at the expense of specialist birds as urban sprawl grew. Overall, urban area had the greatest contribution on such impacts, but additional effects of urban dispersion (i.e., increase of non-native plants) and human population density (i.e., increases of ruderal plants and common generalist birds) were found. Our findings support the hypothesis that negative impacts of urban sprawl on biodiversity can be reduced by compacting urban growth while still avoiding the formation of very densely populated areas.

AB Thanks to protection by law and increasing habitat restoration, wolves (Canis lupus) are currently re-colonizing Europe from the surviving populations of Russia, the Balkan countries, Spain and Italy, raising the need to update conservation strategies. A major conservation issue is to restore connections and gene flow among fragmented populations, thus contrasting the deleterious consequences of isolation. Wolves in Italy are expanding from the Apennines towards the Alps, crossing the Ligurian Mountains (northern Italy) and establishing connections with the Dinaric populations. Wolf expansion is threatened by poaching and incidental killings, mainly due to livestock depredations and conflicts with shepherds, which could limit the establishment of stable populations. Aiming to find out the factors affecting the use of livestock by wolves, in this study we determined the composition of wolf diet in Liguria. We examined 1457 scats collected from 2008 to 2013. Individual scats were genotyped using a non-invasive genetic procedure, and their content was determined using microscopical analyses. Wolves in Liguria consumed mainly wild ungulates (64.4%; in particular wild boar Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) and, to a lesser extent, livestock (26.3%; in particular goats Capra hircus). We modeled the consumption of livestock using environmental features, wild ungulate community diversity, husbandry characteristics and wolf social organization (stable packs or dispersing individuals). Wolf diet varied according to years and seasons with an overall decrease of livestock and an increase of wild ungulate consumption, but also between packs and dispersing individuals with greater livestock consumption for the latter. The presence of stable packs, instead of dispersing wolves, the adoption of prevention measures on pastures, roe deer abundance, and the percentage of deciduous woods, reduced predation on livestock. Thus, we suggest promoting wild ungulate expansion, the use of prevention tools in pastures, and supporting wolf pack establishment, avoiding lethal control and poaching, to mitigate conflicts between wolf conservation and husbandry.

AB The relationships between modern pollen and floristic plant richness, diversity and evenness are assessed using pollen assemblages and associated vegetation data from 52 lakes along an elevational and vegetational gradient in the Setesdal valley of south-central Norway. Various data transformations were applied to minimise bias in the vegetation and pollen datasets. Plant species were transformed to their pollen or spore equivalents to reduce taxonomic biases. Pollen counts were transformed using Andersen's general pollen-representation values for northern European trees and shrubs and the Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model with pollen-productivity estimates (PPEs) appropriate for Setesdal to minimise pollen-representation bias. Pollen count-size bias (before or after transformation) was eliminated by rarefaction analysis based on bootstrap resampling. Richness and diversity were quantified using Hill numbers (N0, N1, N2), and evenness was estimated as the ratios of N0, N1 and N2. Diversity partitioning was used to estimate diversity. The strongest correlations between pollen and plant richness and diversity are with pollen counts transformed using Andersen's representation values and rarefied to a common count size and with plants transformed to their pollen equivalents. However, if sites from the low-alpine zone are excluded where there are high values of far-transported tree pollen, the richness and diversity relationships are also statistically significant for untransformed pollen data and plants transformed into their pollen equivalents. The effects of data transformation on diversity partitioning and estimates of diversity are explored. We demonstrate that there are statistically significant positive relationships between pollen and plant richness and diversity along the entire elevational gradient after transforming the datasets to minimise biases due to taxonomic differences, differential pollen representation, and pollen-count size, and similar significant positive relationships along the forested parts of the gradient (nemoral, boreonemoral, southern boreal, middle boreal) after transforming the datasets to minimise biases due to taxonomic differences and pollen-count size.

AB Heat waves that trigger severe droughts are predicted to increase globally; however, we lack an understanding of how trees respond to the combined change of extreme temperatures and water availability. Here, we studied the impacts of two consecutive heat waves as well as post-stress recovery in young Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco (Douglas-fir) and Robinia pseudoacacia L. (black locust) growing under controlled conditions. Responses were compared under water supply close to the long-term average and under reduced irrigation to represent drought. Exposure to high temperatures (+10 degrees C above ambient) and vapour pressure deficit strongly affected the trees in terms of water relations, photosynthesis and growth. Douglas-fir used water resources conservatively, and transpiration decreased in response to mild soil water limitation. In black locust, heat stress led to pronounced tree water deficits (stem diameter shrinkage), accompanied by leaf shedding to alleviate stress on the hydraulic system. The importance of water availability during the heat waves became further apparent by a concurrent decline in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance with increasing leaf temperatures in both species, reaching the lowest rates in the heat-drought treatments. Stress severity determined both the speed and the amount of recovery. Upon release of stress, photosynthesis recovered rapidly in drought-treated black locust, while it remained below control rates in heat (t = -2.4, P < 0.05) and heat-drought stressed trees (t = 2.96, P < 0.05). In Douglas-fir, photosynthesis recovered quickly, while water-use efficiency increased in heat-drought trees because stomatal conductance remained reduced (t = -2.92, P < 0.05). Moreover, Douglas-fir was able to compensate for stem-growth reductions following heat (-40%) and heat-drought stress (-68%), but most likely at the expense of storage and other growth processes. Our results highlight the importance of studying heat waves alongside changes in water availability. They further suggest that we should look beyond the actual stress event to identify lagged effects and acclimation processes that may determine tree resilience in the long term.

AB Stakeholder participation in environmental management has become widespread globally while the normative benefits of multi-stakeholder processes in governing natural resources are promoted by academics and policy makers. As projections indicate more frequent and intense flood events with future climate change, this article examines one stakeholder participation process within UK flood risk management to evaluate whether it contributes to enhancing effective engagement, through social learning. Evidence is derived from multiple interviews conducted within the England's Regional Flood and Coastal Committees (RFCCs), which were specifically introduced to better integrate local level interests in regional flood defence decision-making. In testing a modified 'individual-community interaction' learning framework, it is apparent that personal and group learning outcomes were evident to varying degrees, suggesting that stakeholder participation was relatively successful. Flowever, our analysis suggests that flexibility exists within such structures, allowing reflexive reconstitution to further increase social learning. Recommendations for future stakeholder participation are proposed, providing lessons for both UK flood governance and similar flood risk management processes in other countries.

AB Background and Aims Unrelated organisms that share similar niches often exhibit patterns of convergent evolution in functional traits. Based on bimodal distributions of hawkmoth tongue lengths and tubular white flowers in Africa, this study hypothesized that long-tongued hawkmoths comprise a pollination niche (ecological opportunity) that is distinct from that of shorter-tongued hawkmoths.
   Methods Field observations, light trapping, camera surveillance and pollen load analysis were used to identify pollinators of plant species with very long-tubed (>8 cm) flowers. The nectar properties and spectral reflectance of these flowers were also measured. The frequency distributions of proboscis length for all captured hawkmoths and floral tube length for a representative sample of night-blooming plant species were determined. The geographical distributions of both native and introduced plant species with very long floral tubes were mapped.
   Key Results The convolvulus hawkmoth Agrius convolvuli is identified as the most important pollinator of African plants with very long-tubed flowers. Plants pollinated by this hawkmoth species tend to have a very long (approx. 10 cm) and narrow flower tube or spur, white flowers and large volumes of dilute nectar. It is estimated that >70 grassland and savanna plant species in Africa belong to the Agrius pollination guild. In South Africa, at least 23 native species have very long floral tubes, and pollination by A. convolvuli or, rarely, by the closely related hawkmoth Coelonia fulvinotata, has been confirmed for 11 of these species. The guild is strikingly absent from the species-rich Cape floral region and now includes at least four non-native invasive species with long-tubed flowers that are pre-adapted for pollination by A. convolvuli.
   Conclusions This study highlights the value of a niche perspective on pollination, which provides a framework for making predictions about the ecological importance of keystone pollinators, and for understanding patterns of convergent evolution and the role of floral traits in plant colonization.

AB Mediterranean ecosystems are commonly vulnerable to wildfires. Accelerated erosion processes due to wildfires in those environments constitute a major restrictive factor in their sustainability. This study aims at evaluating the use of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment (PESERA) models in predicting the changes in spatial variability of soil erosion following a wildfire event. A site in Greece on which a wildfire occurred in the summer of 2007 is used as a case study. Soil erosion rates for the site before and after the fire outbreak were estimated by the two models. Inputs for both models included climatic, land-use, soil type, topography, Earth Observation (EO) as well as management and other ancillary data.
   Both models showed a substantial increase of soil erosion rates in the affected area as a result of the fire, particularly towards the steeper slopes and on areas of high burning severity. Yet, there were noticeable differences in the predictions between the 2 models in terms of absolute estimates of soil erosion rates before and after the fire event Mean pre-fire erosion rates from RUSLE were similar to 2.5 times higher than those from PESERA. RUSLE predicted considerably higher mean erosion in comparison to PESERA for the post-fire conditions, yet of much less spatial variability. Average post-fire soil loss value, compared to pre-fire, was about nine and six times greater when using the RUSLE and the PESERA model respectively. RUSLE predictions were most sensitive to topographic and rainfall erosivity factors. PESERA showed high sensitivity to the vegetation coverage as well as to the soil characteristics inserted as crusting and erodibility variables.
   To our knowledge, this is the first study performing an intercomparison of soil erosion rate predictions between these two models, particularly so in the context of the influence of wildfire events. This study provides a key contribution towards our ability to better understand the effect of fire on soil erosion in the Mediterranean and elsewhere, as well as the ability of those widely used models as efficient tools to be used for this purpose. The latter is of key significance and practical value for research and policy decision making purposes alike, where information on spatiotemporal estimates of soil erosion rates may be required.

AB Species diversity, and the various interactions that occur between species, supports ecosystems functioning and benefit human societies. Monitoring the response of species interactions to human alterations of the environment is thus crucial for preserving ecosystems. Ecological networks are now the standard method for representing and simultaneously analyzing all the interactions between species. However, deciphering such networks requires considerable time and resources to observe and sample the organisms, to identify them at the species level and to characterize their interactions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, combined with network learning and modelling, can help alleviate these constraints. They are essential for observing cryptic interactions involving microbial species, as well as short-term interactions such as those between predator and prey. Here, we present three case studies, in which species associations or interactions have been revealed with NGS. We then review several currently available statistical and machine-learning approaches that could be used for reconstructing networks of direct interactions between species, based on the NGS co-occurrence data. Future developments of these methods may allow us to discover and monitor species interactions cost-effectively, under various environmental conditions and within a replicated experimental design framework.

AB Many arid and semiarid ecosystems have soils covered with well-developed biological soil crust communities (biocrusts) made up of mosses, lichens, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophs living at the soil surface. These communities are a fundamental component of dryland ecosystems, and are critical to dryland carbon (C) cycling. To examine the effects of warming temperatures on soil C balance in a dryland ecosystem, we used infrared heaters to warm biocrust-dominated soils to 2 A degrees C above control conditions at a field site on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We monitored net soil exchange (NSE) of CO2 every hour for 21 months using automated flux chambers (5 control and 5 warmed chambers), which included the CO2 fluxes of the biocrusts and the soil beneath them. We observed measurable photosynthesis in biocrust soils on 12 % of measurement days, which correlated well with precipitation events and soil wet-up. These days included several snow events, providing what we believe to be the first evidence of substantial photosynthesis underneath snow by biocrust organisms in drylands. Overall, biocrust soils in both control and warmed plots were net CO2 sources to the atmosphere, with control plots losing 62 +/- A 8 g C m(-2) (mean +/- A SE) over the first year of measurement and warmed plots losing 74 +/- A 9 g C m(-2). Between control and warmed plots, the difference in soil C loss was uncertain over the course of the entire year due to large and variable rates in spring, but on days during which soils were wet and crusts were actively photosynthesizing, biocrusts that were warmed by 2 A degrees C had a substantially more negative C balance (i.e., biocrust soils took up less C and/or lost more C in warmed plots). Taken together, our data suggest a substantial risk of increased C loss from biocrust soils with higher future temperatures, and highlight a robust capacity to predict CO2 exchange in biocrust soils using easily measured environmental parameters.

AB Pesticides constitute an integral part of high-intensity European agriculture. Prior to their authorization, a highly elaborated environmental risk assessment is mandatory according to EU pesticide legislation, i.e., Regulation (EC) No. 1107/2009. However, no field data-based evaluation of the risk assessment outcome, i.e., the regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs), and therefore of the overall protectiveness of EU pesticide regulations exists. We conducted here a comprehensive meta-analysis using peer-reviewed literature on agricultural insecticide concentrations in EU surface waters and evaluated associated risks using the RACs derived from official European pesticide registration documents. As a result, 44.7 % of the 1566 cases of measured insecticide concentrations (MICs) in EU surface waters exceeded their respective RACs. It follows that current EU pesticide regulations do not protect the aquatic environment and that insecticides threaten aquatic biodiversity. RAC exceedances were significantly higher for insecticides authorized using conservative tier-I RACs and for more recently developed insecticide classes, i.e., pyrethroids. In addition, we identified higher risks, e.g., for smaller surface waters that are specifically considered in the regulatory risk assessment schemes. We illustrate the shortcomings of the EU regulatory risk assessment using two case studies that contextualize the respective risk assessment outcomes to field exposure. Overall, our meta-analysis challenges the field relevance and protectiveness of the regulatory environmental risk assessment conducted for pesticide authorization in the EU and indicates that critical revisions of related pesticide regulations and effective mitigation measures are urgently needed to substantially reduce the environmental risks arising from agricultural insecticide use.

AB Chronic exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides has been linked to reduced survival of pollinating insects at both the individual and colony level, but so far only experimentally. Analyses of large-scale datasets to investigate the real-world links between the use of neonicotinoids and pollinator mortality are lacking. Moreover, the impacts of neonicotinoid seed coatings in reducing subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and increasing crop yield are not known, despite the supposed benefits of this practice driving widespread use. Here, we combine large-scale pesticide usage and yield observations from oilseed rape with those detailing honey bee colony losses over an 11 year period, and reveal a correlation between honey bee colony losses and national-scale imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) usage patterns across England and Wales. We also provide the first evidence that farmers who use neonicotinoid seed coatings reduce the number of subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and may derive an economic return. Our results inform the societal discussion on the pollinator costs and farming benefits of prophylactic neonicotinoid usage on a mass flowering crop.

AB Urban environments offer wildlife novel anthropogenic resources that vary spatiotemporally at fine scales. Property damage, economic losses, human injury, or other human-wildlife conflicts can occur when wildlife use these resources; however, few studies have examined urban wildlife resource selection at fine scales to guide conflict mitigation. We studied black bears (Ursus americanus) in the urban area of Aspen, Colorado, USA from 2007 to 2010 to quantify bear foraging on natural and anthropogenic resources and to model factors associated with anthropogenic feeding events. We collected fine-scale spatiotemporal data by tracking GPS-collared bears at 30-min intervals and backtracked to bear locations within 24 hours of use. We used discrete choice models to assess bears' resource selection, modeling anthropogenic feeding (use) and five associated random (availability) locations as a function of attributes related to temporally changing natural (e.g., ripe mast) and human (e.g., garbage) food resources, urban characteristics (e.g., housing density), and land cover characteristics (e.g., distance to riparian area). We backtracked to 2,675 locations used by 24 bears and classified 20% as foraging locations. We found that bears foraged on both natural and anthropogenic food sources in the urban environment, with 77% of feeding events being anthropogenic. We documented inter-and intra-annual foraging patterns in which bears foraged extensively in urban areas when natural food production was poor, then switched to natural food sources when available. These patterns suggest that bears balance energy budgets and individual safety when making foraging decisions. Overwhelmingly, garbage was the main anthropogenic food source that bears used. Selection of foraging sites was not only influenced by presence of garbage but also by proximity to riparian habitat and presence of ripe anthropogenic fruit trees. We found that while 76% of the garbage containers at random locations were bear-resistant, 57% of these bear-resistant containers were not properly secured. We recommend conflict mitigation focus on reducing available garbage and anthropogenic fruit trees, particularly near riparian areas, to make urban environments less energetically beneficial for foraging. Additionally, deploying bear-resistant containers is inadequate without education and proactive enforcement to change human behavior to properly secure garbage and ultimately reduce human-bear conflict.

Biotic and abiotic wetland characteristics likely affect neonicotinoid presence and environmental persistence, but concentrations vary widely between wetlands that appear ecologically (e.g., plant composition) and physically (e.g., depth) similar for reasons that remain unclear. We conducted intensive surveys of 238 wetlands, and documented 59 wetland (e.g., dominant plant species) and landscape (e.g., surrounding crop) characteristics as part of a novel rapid wetland assessment system. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis to predict both probability of neonicotinoid analytical detection and concentration. BRT models effectively predicted the deviance in neonicotinoid detection (62.4%) and concentration (74.7%) from 21 and 23 variables, respectively. Detection was best explained by shallow marsh plant species identity (34.8%) and surrounding crop (13.9%). Neonicotinoid concentration was best explained by shallow marsh plant species identity (14.9%) and wetland depth (14.2%). Our research revealed that plant composition is a key indicator and/or driver of neonicotinoid presence and concentration in Prairie wetlands. We recommend wetland buffers consisting of diverse native vegetation be retained or restored to minimize neonicotinoid transport and retention in wetlands, thereby limiting their potential effects on wetland-dependent organisms.

AB Future climate regimes characterized by rising [CO2], rising temperatures and associated droughts may differentially affect tree growth and physiology. However, the interactive effects of these three factors are complex because elevated [CO2] and elevated temperature may generate differential physiological responses during drought. To date, the interactive effects of elevated [CO2] and elevated temperature on drought-induced tree mortality remain poorly understood in gymnosperm species that differ in stomatal regulation strategies. Water relations and carbon dynamics were examined in two species with contrasting stomatal regulation strategies: Pinus radiata D. Don (relatively isohydric gymnosperm; regulating stomata to maintain leaf water potential above critical thresholds) and Callitris rhomboidea R. Br (relatively anisohydric gymnosperm; allowing leaf water potential to decline as the soil dries), to assess response to drought as a function of [CO2] and temperature. Both species were grown in two [CO2] (C-a (ambient, 400 mu l l(-1)) and C-e (elevated, 640 mu l l(-1))) and two temperature (T-a (ambient) and T-e (ambient + 4 degrees C)) treatments in a sun-lit glasshouse under well-watered conditions. Drought plants were then exposed to a progressive drought until mortality. Prior to mortality, extensive xylem cavitation occurred in both species, but significant depletion of non-structural carbohydrates was not observed in either species. T-e resulted in faster mortality in P. radiata, but it did not modify the time-to-mortality in C. rhomboidea. C-e did not delay the time-to-mortality in either species under drought or T-e treatments. In summary, elevated temperature (+ 4 degrees C) had greater influence than elevated [CO2] (+ 240 mu l l(-1)) on drought responses of the two studied gymnosperm species, while stomatal regulation strategies did not generally affect the relative contributions of hydraulic failure and carbohydrate depletion to mortality under severe drought.

AB Past changes in plant and landscape diversity can be evaluated through pollen analysis, however, pollen-based diversity indexes are potentially biased by differential pollen production and deposition. Studies examining the relationship between pollen and landscape diversity are therefore needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate how different pollen-based indexes capture aspects of landscape diversity. Pollen counts were obtained from surface samples of 50 small- to medium-sized lakes in Brandenburg (north-east Germany) and compiled into two sets, with one containing all pollen counts from terrestrial plants and the second restricted to wind-pollinated taxa. Both sets were adjusted for the pollen production/dispersal bias using the REVEALS model. A high-resolution biotope map was used to extract the density of total biotopes and different biotopes per area as parameters describing landscape diversity. In addition, tree species diversity was obtained from forest inventory data. The Shannon index and the number of taxa in a sample of 10 pollen grains are highly correlated and provide a useful measure of pollen type diversity which corresponds best to landscape diversity within one km of the lake and the proportion of non-forested area within seven km. Adjustments of the pollen production/dispersal bias only slightly improve the relationships between pollen diversity and landscape diversity for the restricted data set as well as for the forest inventory data and corresponding pollen types. Using rarefaction analysis, we propose the following convention: pollen type diversity is represented by the number of types in a small sample (low count e.g. 10), pollen type richness is the number of types in a large sample (high count e.g. 500), and pollen sample evenness is characterized by the ratio of the two.Synthesis. Pollen type diversity is a robust index that captures vegetation structure and landscape diversity. It is ideally suited for between site comparisons as it does not require high pollen counts. In concert with pollen type richness and evenness, it helps evaluating the effect of climate change and human land use on vegetation structure on long timescales.

AB Recent studies have reported correlations between stem sapwood capacitance (C-wood) and xylem vulnerability to embolism, but it is unclear how C-wood relates to the eventual ability of plants to reverse embolism. We investigated possible functional links between embolism reversal efficiency, C-wood, wood density (WD), vulnerability to xylem embolism and hydraulic safety margins in nine woody species native to dry sclerophyllous forests with different degrees of iso versus anisohydry. Substantial inter-specific differences in terms of seasonal/diurnal changes of xylem and leaf water potential, maximum diurnal values of transpiration rate and xylem vulnerability to embolism formation were recorded. Significant diurnal changes in percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) were recorded for five species. Significant correlations were recorded between diurnal PLC changes and P-50 and P-88 values (i.e., xylem pressure inducing 50 and 88% PLC, respectively) as well as between diurnal PLC changes and safety margins referenced to P-50 and P-88. WD was linearly correlated with minimum diurnal leaf water potential, diurnal PLC changes and wood capacitance across all species. In contrast, significant relationships between P-50, safety margin values referenced to P-50 and WD were recorded only for the isohydric species. Functional links between diurnal changes in PLC, hydraulic strategies and WD and C-wood are discussed.

AB The claim that nature delivers health benefits rests on a thin empirical evidence base. Even less evidence exists on how specific conservation policies affect multiple health outcomes. We address these gaps in knowledge by combining municipal-level panel data on diseases, public health services, climatic factors, demographics, conservation policies, and other drivers of land-use change in the Brazilian Amazon. To fully exploit this dataset, we estimate random-effects and quantile regression models of disease incidence. We find that malaria, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and diarrhea incidence are significantly and negatively correlated with the area under strict environmental protection. Results vary by disease for other types of protected areas (PAs), roads, and mining. The relationships between diseases and land-use change drivers also vary by quantile of the disease distribution. Conservation scenarios based on estimated regression results suggest that malaria, ARI, and diarrhea incidence would be reduced by expanding strict PAs, and malaria could be further reduced by restricting roads and mining. Although these relationships are complex, we conclude that interventions to preserve natural capital can deliver cobenefits by also increasing human (health) capital.

AB Conservation science needs to engage the general public to ensure successful conservation interventions. Although online technologies such as Twitter and Facebook offer new opportunities to accelerate communication between conservation scientists and the online public, factors influencing the spread of conservation news in online media are not well understood. We explored transmission of conservation research through online news articles with generalized linear mixed-effects models and an information theoretic approach. In particular, we assessed differences in the frequency conservation research is featured on online news sites and the impact of online conservation news content and delivery on Facebook likes and shares and Twitter tweets. Five percent of articles in conservation journals are reported in online news, and the probability of reporting depended on the journal. There was weak evidence that articles on climate change and mammals were more likely to be featured. Online news articles about charismatic mammals with illustrations were more likely to be shared or liked on Facebook and Twitter, but the effect of news sites was much larger. These results suggest journals have the greatest impact on which conservation research is featured and that news site has the greatest impact on how popular an online article will be on Facebook and Twitter. Cuantificacion del Papel de las Noticias En Linea en el Enlazamiento de la Investigacion para la Conservacion con Facebook y Twitter
   Resumen La ciencia de la conservacion necesita envolver al publico en general para asegurar intervenciones exitosas de conservacion. Aunque tecnologias en linea como Twitter y Facebook ofrecen nuevas oportunidades para acelerar la comunicacion entre los cientificos de la conservacion y el publico en linea, los factores que influyen sobre el esparcimiento de las noticias de conservacion en los medios en linea no estan bien entendidos. Exploramos la transmision de la investigacion de la conservacion a traves de articulos en linea con modelos lineales generalizados de efectos mixtos y un enfoque teorico de informacion. En particular, evaluamos las diferencias en la frecuencia con la que la investigacion de la conservacion es incluida en sitios en linea de noticias y el impacto del contenido y la forma de comunicarse de las noticias de conservacion sobre los likes y numero de veces que se comparte en Facebook y sobre los tuits en Twitter. El 5% de los articulos de las revistas de conservacion se reportan en noticias en linea y la probabilidad de reportar dependio de la revista. Hubo evidencias debiles de que los articulos sobre el cambio climatico y los mamiferos tuvieran mayor probabilidad de ser incluidos. Las noticias en linea sobre mamiferos carismaticos con ilustraciones fueron mas probables de ser compartidas o que obtuvieran likes en Facebook y Twitter, pero el efecto de los sitios de noticias fue mucho mayor. Estos resultados sugieren que las revistas tienen el mayor impacto sobre cual investigacion se incluye y que los sitios de noticias tienen el mayor impacto sobre cuan popular sera un articulo en Facebook o Twitter.

   MethodsmtDNA data sets for 11 rocky shore and reef-dwelling marine species with diverse life history strategies (broadcast spawning, brooding and live-bearing) were used to quantify intraspecific genetic connectivity by means of global and pairwise (st). Mantel tests were used to assess the significance of genetic structure with geographic distance. Significant, positive slopes were used to estimate dispersal distances. For all species, we also plotted genetic diversity along the coast and compared this to patterns of species richness.
   ResultsFor seven of the 11 species tested, we report positive IBD relationships, with patterns of IBD of similar magnitude in broadcast spawners and live-bearers. Dispersal estimates were low, with effective distances of <10km per generation. We find discordance between pelagic larval development and population structure and that genetic structure and the physio-geographic features of the coastline considered to be important biogeographic barriers do not overlap. Genetic diversity and species richness show congruent patterns, with both variables lowest on the west coast, and increasing towards the east.
   Main conclusionsOur study highlights the complexity of marine systems and the clear need for regional assessments of connectivity, rather than more general management plans which may not otherwise effectively encompass area-specific conservation needs. Importantly, we show that the current marine protected area (MPA) network in South Africa is not effective in protecting evolutionary processes and strongly recommend a network of more closely spaced MPAs in the region that reflects the low average connectivity between distant marine populations.

AB AimUnderstanding the mechanisms that generate diversity patterns requires analyses at spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate to the dispersal capacities and ecological requirements of organisms. Oceanic archipelagos provide a range of island sizes and configurations which should predictably influence colonization, diversification and extinction. To explore the influence of these factors on archipelagic diversity, we relate the numbers of native and endemic species of vascular plants, birds, land snails and spiders - taxa having different dispersal capabilities and population densities - to the number and sizes of islands in the major oceanic archipelagos of the globe.
   LocationFourteen major oceanic archipelagos of the globe.
   MethodsSpecies richness was collated for native and endemic species in each archipelago. We used linear mixed effect models to quantify the influence on diversity of total area, number of islands, isolation and latitude. We then applied process-based modelling in a Bayesian framework to evaluate how speciation, colonization and extinction are influenced by characteristics of archipelagos associated with species richness, i.e. area, isolation and number of islands.
   ResultsWe found parallel scaling of species richness among taxa with respect to total area and number of islands across groups. The process-based model supported effects of isolation on colonization and of area and number of islands on extinction rates, with the scaling exponents mostly similar across taxa. Data are consistent with a range of scaling exponents for speciation rate, implying that those relationships are difficult to infer from the data used.
   ConclusionsWe demonstrate an unexpected parallel scaling of species richness of four taxa with area and number of islands for the major oceanic archipelagos of the globe. We infer that this scaling arises through similar effects of the physical characteristics of archipelagos on extinction, colonization and speciation rates across these disparate taxa, indicating that similar mechanisms have created variation in diversity.

AB Vegetation productivity metrics such as gross primary production (GPP) at the canopy scale are greatly affected by the efficiency of using absorbed radiation for photosynthesis, or light use efficiency (LUE). Thus, close investigation of the relationships between canopy GPP and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation is the basis for quantification of LUE. We used multiyear observations over irrigated and rainfed contrasting C3 (soybean) and C4 (maize) crops having different physiology, leaf structure, and canopy architecture to establish the relationships between canopy GPP and radiation absorbed by vegetation and quantify LUE. Although multiple LUE definitions are reported in the literature, we used a definition of efficiency of light use by photosynthetically active "green" vegetation (LUEgreen based on radiation absorbed by "green" photosynthetically active vegetation on a daily basis. We quantified, irreversible slowly changing seasonal (constitutive) and rapidly day-to-day changing (facultative) LUEgreen, as well as sensitivity of LUEgreen to the magnitude of incident radiation and drought events. Large (2-3-fold) variation of daily LUEgreen over the course of a growing season that is governed by crop physiological and phenological status was observed. The day-to-day variations of LUEgreen oscillated with magnitude 10-15% around the seasonal LUEgreen trend and appeared to be closely related to day-to-day variations of magnitude and composition of incident radiation. Our results show the high variability of LUEgr, between C3 and C4 crop species (1.43 gC/MJ vs. 2.24 gC/MJ, respectively), as well as within single crop species (i.e., maize or soybean). This implies that assuming LUEgreen as a constant value in GPP models is not warranted for the crops studied, and brings unpredictable uncertainties of remote GPP estimation, which should be accounted for in LUE models. The uncertainty of GPP estimation due to facultative and constitutive changes in LUEgregg can be considered as a critical component of the total error budget in the context of remotely sensed based estimations of GPP. The quantitative framework of LUEgreen estimation presented here offers a way of characterizing LUEgreen in plants that can be used to assess their phenological and physiological status and vulnerability to drought under current and future climatic conditions and is essential for calibration and validation of globally applied LUE algorithms.

AB Corvids are often viewed as efficient predators capable of limiting prey species populations. Despite this widely held belief, a comprehensive review quantifying the effect of corvids on the demography of prey species is lacking. We examine the impacts of crows, ravens Corvus spp. and Eurasian Magpies Pica pica on the population parameters of other bird species. We summarize results from 42 studies, which included 326 explicit evaluations of relationships between a corvid and a potential prey species. Population parameters of studied prey species were categorized as abundance-related (numbers, nest density) or productivity-related (nest success, brood size). Information from both experimental removal studies and correlative studies was examined. Combining all studies, no negative influence of corvids on either abundance or productivity of prey species was found in 81% of cases. Negative impacts were significantly more likely in cases examining productivity rather than abundance (46 vs. 10%). Experimental studies that removed only corvid species were significantly less likely to show a positive impact on productivity than those removing corvids alongside other predators (16 vs. 60%). This suggests that the impact of corvids is smaller than that of other predators, or that compensatory predation occurs. The impact of corvids was similar between diverse avian groups (such as gamebirds, passerines and waders; or ground-nesting and other species). Crows were found to be significantly more likely to have a negative impact on prey species productivity than were Magpies (62 vs. 12%), but no differences were found in relation to prey abundance. We conclude that while corvids can have a negative impact on bird species, their impact is small overall, and nearly five times more frequent for productivity than for abundance. These results suggest that in most cases bird populations are unlikely to be limited by corvid predation and that conservation measures may generally be better targeted at other limiting factors. However, negative impacts were found in a minority of cases, and those may require further investigation to develop management tools to mitigate such impacts where they are of economic or conservation concern.

AB This study assesses the facet structure and psychometric properties of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) with a heterogeneous clinical sample of individuals with mood and anxiety disorders. Various factor models of the FFMQ were submitted to confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). A four factor hierarchical solution, consisting of an overall mindfulness construct subsuming at least four factors, was adopted. Both internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity were assessed. Along with demonstrating good internal consistency, the facets of the FFMQ were appropriately associated with other psychological constructs. Many mindfulness facets exhibited inverse relationships with emotion dysregulation, emotional avoidance, and psychological distress. The observe facet appeared to assume a role antagonistic to overall mindfulness within a clinical sample, as it exhibited a positive relationship with anxious arousal and no relationship with two other mindfulness facets. Findings support the notion of mindfulness as a multifaceted construct, the structure of which alters in the context of psychopathology.

AB The use of systemic insecticides as seed treatments has raised concern about the possible impacts of these products on natural enemies. This study assessed the effects of sunflower seed treatments with chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam on Chrysoperla carnea by exposing larvae and adults to sunflower stem segments grown from treated seeds and the nectar secreted by their extrafloral nectaries. Confinement of larvae with stem segments for their entire developmental period had no effect on their survival or any life history parameter, except that the sex ratio of resulting adults was lower in the thiamethoxam treatment than in chlorantraniliprole. However, when adult pairs of C. carnea were exposed to treated stem segments during their maturation period, their subsequent survival and fecundity was significantly reduced by both materials, with thiamethoxam reducing median survival (LT50) and fecundity to a greater degree than chlorantraniliprole. Insufficient offspring were obtained from adults exposed to thiamethoxam to permit assessment of their fitness, but the offspring in the chlorantraniliproleexposed adults had reduced larval survival relative to controls. The greater impact of seed treatments on adult lacewings may be partly attributable to their greater consumption of extra-floral nectar. Our results indicate that seed treatment with systemic insecticides can cause negative effects on beneficial insects, potentially disrupting their population dynamics, and should not be assumed compatible with biological control and IPM simply because this mode of application limits direct exposure.

AB AimGeographical, climatic and soil factors are major drivers of plant beta diversity, but their importance for dryland plant communities is poorly known. The aim of this study was to: (1) characterize patterns of beta diversity in global drylands; (2) detect common environmental drivers of beta diversity; and (3) test for thresholds in environmental conditions driving potential shifts in plant species composition.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsBeta diversity was quantified in 224 dryland plant communities from 22 geographical regions on all continents except Antarctica using four complementary measures: the percentage of singletons (species occurring at only one site); Whittaker's beta diversity, (W); a directional beta diversity metric based on the correlation in species occurrences among spatially contiguous sites, (R-2); and a multivariate abundance-based metric, (MV). We used linear modelling to quantify the relationships between these metrics of beta diversity and geographical, climatic and soil variables.
   ResultsSoil fertility and variability in temperature and rainfall, and to a lesser extent latitude, were the most important environmental predictors of beta diversity. Metrics related to species identity [percentage of singletons and (W)] were most sensitive to soil fertility, whereas those metrics related to environmental gradients and abundance [((R-2) and (MV)] were more associated with climate variability. Interactions among soil variables, climatic factors and plant cover were not important determinants of beta diversity. Sites receiving less than 178mm of annual rainfall differed sharply in species composition from more mesic sites (> 200mm).
   Main conclusionsSoil fertility and variability in temperature and rainfall are the most important environmental predictors of variation in plant beta diversity in global drylands. Our results suggest that those sites annually receiving c. 178mm of rainfall will be especially sensitive to future climate changes. These findings may help to define appropriate conservation strategies for mitigating effects of climate change on dryland vegetation.

AB To reveal the diversity and geographic distribution of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) rhizobia in China, a total of 226 strains of nodule bacteria were isolated from bean plants grown in fields of nine sites in northern (ecoregion I) and southern (ecoregion II) regions of China, with soil pH ranged from 8.06 to 4.97. Based upon the phylogenies of housekeeping and symbiotic genes, 96.9% of the isolates were Rhizobium corresponding to four defined species and four unnamed genospecies, while the remaining were five Bradyrhizobium genospecies. Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium etli and Rhizobium sp. II or IV were dominant in different ecoregions, with varied relative abundances. Therefore, diverse and distinctive bean rhizobial communities exist in different ecoregions of China, demonstrating that the introduction of bean plants has driven the evolution of rhizobia to fit the necessity to nodulate the host plant under the local conditions, mainly the soil pH and the nutrient availability. The predominance of R. etli and the high similarities in the symbiotic genes (nodC and nifH) of all the Rhizobium genospecies with R. etli evidenced that symbiotic genes were transferred from R. etli, possibly introduced to China accompanying the seeds, to the related indigenous rhizobia. These findings enlarged the diversity of bean rhizobia, evidenced the biogeographic patterns of these rhizobia, and demonstrated the possible evolution and emerging of novel rhizobia under the combined selection of host plant and soil conditions.

AB Ecosystems are linked within landscapes by the physical and biological processes they mediate. In such connected landscapes, the response of one ecosystem to climate change could have profound consequences for neighbouring systems. Here, we report the first quantitative predictions of interdependencies between ecosystems in response to climate change. In shallow tropical marine ecosystems, coral reefs shelter lagoons from incoming waves, allowing seagrass meadows to thrive. Deepening water over coral reefs from sea-level rise results in larger, more energetic waves traversing the reef into the lagoon(1,2), potentially generating hostile conditions for seagrass. However, growth of coral reef such that the relative water depth is maintained could mitigate negative effects of sea-level rise on seagrass. Parameterizing physical and biological models for Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, we find negative effects of sea-level rise on seagrass before the middle of this century given reasonable rates of reef growth. Rates of vertical carbonate accretion typical of modern reef flats (up to 3mm yr(-1)) will probably be insufficient to maintain suitable conditions for reef lagoon seagrass under moderate to high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios by 2100. Accounting for interdependencies in ecosystem responses to climate change is challenging, but failure to do so results in inaccurate predictions of habitat extent in the future.

AB Concern is growing over the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides, which can impair honey bee cognition. We provide the first demonstration that sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid can harm honey bee decision-making about danger by significantly increasing the probability of a bee visiting a dangerous food source. Apis cerana is a native bee that is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and native plants in Asia. When foraging on nectar containing 40 mu g/L (34 ppb) imidacloprid, honey bees (Apis cerana) showed no aversion to a feeder with a hornet predator, and 1.8 fold more bees chose the dangerous feeder as compared to control bees. Control bees exhibited significant predator avoidance. We also give the first evidence that foraging by A. cerana workers can be inhibited by sublethal concentrations of the pesticide, imidacloprid, which is widely used in Asia. Compared to bees collecting uncontaminated nectar, 23% fewer foragers returned to collect the nectar with 40 mu g/L imidacloprid. Bees that did return respectively collected 46% and 63% less nectar containing 20 mu g/L and 40 mu g/L imidacloprid. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee decision-making and other advanced cognitive functions should be explored. Moreover, research should extend beyond the classic model, the European honey bee (A. mellifera), to other important bee species.

AB Landscape genetics has tremendous potential for enhancing our understanding about landscape effects on effective dispersal and resulting genetic structures. However, the vast majority of landscape genetic studies focus on effects of the landscape among sampling locations on dispersal (i.e. matrix quality), while effects of local environmental conditions are rather neglected. Such local environmental conditions include patch size, habitat type or resource availability and are commonly used in (meta-) population ecology and population genetics. In our opinion, landscape genetic studies would greatly benefit from simultaneously incorporating both matrix quality and local environmental conditions when assessing landscape effects on effective dispersal. To illustrate this point, we first outline the various ways in which environmental heterogeneity can influence different stages of the dispersal process. We then propose a three-step approach for assessing local and matrix effects on effective dispersal and review how both types of effects can be considered in landscape genetic analyses. Using simulated data, we show that it is possible to correctly disentangle the relative importance of matrix quality vs. local environmental conditions for effective dispersal. We argue that differentiating local and matrix effects in such a way is crucial for predicting future species distribution and persistence, and for optimal conservation decisions that are based on landscape genetics. In sum, we think it is timely to move beyond purely statistical, pattern-oriented analyses in landscape genetics and towards process-oriented approaches that consider the full range of possible landscape effects on dispersal behaviour and resulting gene flow.

AB Edge effects of native forest fragmentation have been well studied, but there are few studies of open-ground habitats fragmented by plantation forests. We measure forestry edge effects on open-ground breeding birds, following one of Europe's biggest and most controversial land-use transformations. The Flow Country' of northern Scotland is one of the world's greatest expanses of blanket bog. It became fragmented by conifer forests planted in the late 20th century, and these now adjoin open peatlands protected under European conservation legislation. Detrimental edge effects on breeding birds were anticipated, but not apparent shortly after planting. Using survey data collected in 2003-2006, and logistic regression modelling, we tested whether breeding distributions of three wader species of international conservation concern, dunlin, European golden plover and common greenshank, were influenced by distance to forest edge, controlling for habitat and topography. All three species were more likely to occupy flatter, more exposed ground close to bog pools and were influenced by peatland vegetation structure. There was an additive and adverse effect of proximity to forest edge for dunlin and European golden plover, but not common greenshank. This effect was strongest within 700m of forest edges. We used these results to predict which areas should benefit most from removal of adjacent forestry and so guide maintenance and restoration of the bird interests of the protected areas.Synthesis and applications. Edge effects of mature forestry on dunlin and golden plover are apparent over several hundred metres and are now being used to guide forest planning in northern Scotland. The scale of edge effect is broadly consistent with other avian studies in open-ground habitats across Eurasia and North America, so buffer zones of this order are consistent with possible impacts of plantation forestry on open-ground habitats of bird conservation interest. Given renewed interest in conifer afforestation as a climate change mitigation measure, an improved understanding of edge effects and the mechanisms through which they operate is vital to managing plantation forestry in ways that maintain open-ground landscapes of high conservation value.

AB AimTo quantify the relative importance of propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability for the invasion of agricultural pest arthropods in Europe and to forecast newly emerging pest species and European areas with the highest risk of arthropod invasion under current climate and a future climate scenario (A1F1).
   LocationEurope.
   MethodsWe quantified propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability by aggregating large global databases for trade, European arthropod interceptions, Koeppen-Geiger world climate classification (including the A1F1 climate change scenario until 2100) and host plant distributions for 118 quarantine arthropod species.
   ResultsAs expected, all the three factors, propagule pressure, climate suitability and host availability, significantly explained quarantine arthropod invasions in Europe, but the propagule pressure only had a positive effect on invasion success when considered together with climate suitability and host availability. Climate change according to the A1F1 scenario generally increased the climate suitability of north-eastern European countries and reduced the climate suitability of central European countries for pest arthropod invasions.
   Main conclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that propagule pressure interacts with other factors to drive invasions and is not alone sufficient to explain arthropod establishment patterns. European countries with more suitable climate and large agricultural areas of suitable host plants for pest arthropods should thus be more vigilant about introduction pathways. Moreover, efforts to reduce the propagule pressure, such as preventing pests from entering pathways and strengthening border controls, will become more important in north-eastern Europe in the future as the climate becomes more favourable to arthropod invasions.

AB Studies of Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum, the wild progenitor of cultivated barley, have mostly relied on materials collected decades ago and maintained since then ex situ in germplasm repositories. We analyzed spatial genetic variation in wild barley populations collected rather recently, exploring sequence variations at seven single-copy nuclear loci, and inferred the relationships among these populations and toward the genepool of the crop. The wild barley collection covers the whole natural distribution area from the Mediterranean to Middle Asia. In contrast to earlier studies, Bayesian assignment analyses revealed three population clusters, in the Levant, Turkey, and east of Turkey, respectively. Genetic diversity was exceptionally high in the Levant, while eastern populations were depleted of private alleles. Species distribution modeling based on climate parameters and extant occurrence points of the taxon inferred suitable habitat conditions during the ice-age, particularly in the Levant and Turkey. Together with the ecologically wide range of habitats, they might contribute to structured but long-term stable populations in this region and their high genetic diversity. For recently collected individuals, Bayesian assignment to geographic clusters was generally unambiguous, but materials from genebanks often showed accessions that were not placed according to their assumed geographic origin or showed traces of introgression from cultivated barley. We assign this to gene flow among accessions during ex situ maintenance. Evolutionary studies based on such materials might therefore result in wrong conclusions regarding the history of the species or the origin and mode of domestication of the crop, depending on the accessions included.

AB Taller plant species can pre-empt solar energy and suppress growth of subordinate species in vegetation stands, which is described through one-sided competition. Yet, in much of the world's vegetation species of different statures coexist. This study aims to clarify the mechanisms underlying this apparent paradox. We quantified how co-occurring species and individuals intercepted and used light for growth in a mature, warm-temperate evergreen forest. This was performed by determining the 3D distribution of foliage and light with a ground-based lidar system in combination with nondestructive measurements of plant growth. Taller trees intercepted light more efficiently per unit of above-ground biomass than shorter trees did (=higher light interception efficiency, LIE). However, taller trees tended to have lower biomass production per unit light interception (=lower light use efficiency, LUE). Reduced LUE in taller trees was associated with their higher biomass allocation to nonphotosynthetic organs and probably with over-saturated light intensity for photosynthesis at high canopy positions. Due to the increased LIE and decreased LUE with tree heights, a trade-off between LIE and LUE was found, and this trade-off resulted in trees of different statures having similar relative growth rates.Synthesis. Light competition drives trees to grow taller, and the light interception efficiency is higher in taller trees; however, this benefit comes at a cost of decreased efficiency of light use for growth. This trade-off allows trees of different statures to grow at proportionally comparable rates and may promote coexistence of tree species in one-sided light competition.

AB Early generations of hybrids can express both genetic incompatibilities and phenotypic novelty. Insights into whether these conflicting interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic selection persist after a few generations of recombination require experimental studies. To address this question, we use interpopulation crosses and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the copepod Tigriopus californicus, and focus on two traits that are relevant for the diversification of this species: survivorship during development and tolerance to thermal stress. Experimental crosses between two population pairs show that most RILs between two heat-tolerant populations show enhanced tolerance to temperatures that are lethal to the respective parentals, whereas RILs between a heat-tolerant and a heat-sensitive population are intermediate. Although interpopulation crosses are affected by intrinsic selection at early generational hybrids, most of the sampled F-9 RILs have recovered fitness to the level of their parentals. Together, these results suggest that a few generations of recombination allows for an independent segregation of the genes underlying thermal tolerance and cytonuclear incompatibilities, permitting certain recombinant lineages to survive in niches previously unused by parental taxa (i.e., warmer thermal environments) without incurring intrinsic selection.

AB Conventional wisdom predicts that sequential founder events will cause genetic diversity to erode in species with expanding geographic ranges, limiting evolutionary potential at the range margin. Here, we show that invasive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in South Africa preserve genetic diversity during range expansion, possibly as a result of frequent long-distance dispersal events. We further show that unfavourable environmental conditions trigger enhanced dispersal, as indicated by signatures of selection detected across the expanding range. This brings genetic variation to the expansion front, counterbalancing the cumulative effects of sequential founding events and optimizing standing genetic diversity and thus evolutionary potential at range margins during spread. Therefore, dispersal strategies should be highlighted as key determinants of the ecological and evolutionary performances of species in novel environments and in response to global environmental change.

AB Existing models estimating oil spill costs at sea are based on data from the past, and they usually lack a systematic approach. This make them passive, and limits their ability to forecast the effect of the changes in the oil combating fleet or location of a spill on the oil spill costs.
   In this paper we make an attempt towards the development of a probabilistic and systematic model estimating the costs of clean-up operations for the Gulf of Finland. For this purpose we utilize expert knowledge along with the available data and information from literature. Then, the obtained information is combined into a framework with the use of a Bayesian Belief Networks. Due to lack of data, we validate the model by comparing its results with existing models, with which we found good agreement.
   We anticipate that the presented model can contribute to the cost-effective oil-combating fleet optimization for the Gulf of Finland. It can also facilitate the accident consequences estimation in the framework of formal safety assessment (FSA). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the warming Arctic, aquatic habitats are in flux and salmon are exploring their options. Adult Pacific salmon, including sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), coho (O. kisutch), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) have been captured throughout the Arctic. Pink and chum salmon are the most common species found in the Arctic today. These species are less dependent on freshwater habitats as juveniles and grow quickly in marine habitats. Putative spawning populations are rare in the North American Arctic and limited to pink salmon in drainages north of Point Hope, Alaska, chum salmon spawning rivers draining to the northwestern Beaufort Sea, and small populations of chum and pink salmon in Canada's Mackenzie River. Pacific salmon have colonized several large river basins draining to the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian seas in the Russian Arctic. These populations probably developed from hatchery supplementation efforts in the 1960's. Hundreds of populations of Arctic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are found in Russia, Norway and Finland. Atlantic salmon have extended their range eastward as far as the Kara Sea in central Russian. A small native population of Atlantic salmon is found in Canada's Ungava Bay. The northern tip of Quebec seems to be an Atlantic salmon migration barrier for other North American stocks. Compatibility between life history requirements and ecological conditions are prerequisite for salmon colonizing Arctic habitats. Broad-scale predictive models of climate change in the Arctic give little information about feedback processes contributing to local conditions, especially in freshwater systems. This paper reviews the recent history of salmon in the Arctic and explores various patterns of climate change that may influence range expansions and future sustainability of salmon in Arctic habitats. A summary of the research needs that will allow informed expectation of further Arctic colonization by salmon is given.

AB Examining intraspecific variation in growth and function in relation to climate may provide insight into physiological evolution and adaptation, and is important for predicting species responses to climate change.
   Under common garden conditions, we grew nine genotypes of the C-4 species Panicum virgatum originating from different temperature and precipitation environments. We hypothesized that genotype productivity, morphology and physiological traits would be correlated with climate of origin, and a suite of adaptive traits would show high broad-sense heritability (H-2).
   Genotype productivity and flowering time increased and decreased, respectively, with home-climate temperature, and home-climate temperature was correlated with genotypic differences in a syndrome of morphological and physiological traits. Genotype leaf and tiller size, leaf lamina thickness, leaf mass per area (LMA) and C:N ratios increased with home-climate temperature, whereas leaf nitrogen per unit mass (N-m) and chlorophyll (Chl) decreased with home-climate temperature. Trait variation was largely explained by genotypic differences (H-2 = 0.33-0.85).
   Our results provide new insight into the role of climate in driving functional trait coordination, local adaptation and genetic divergence within species. These results emphasize the importance of considering intraspecific variation in future climate change scenarios.

AB Habitat selection studies generally assume that animals select habitat and food resources at multiple scales to maximise their fitness. However, animals sometimes prefer habitats of apparently low quality, especially when considering the costs associated with spatially heterogeneous human disturbance. We used spatial variation in human disturbance, and its consequences on lynx survival, a direct fitness component, to test the Hierarchical Habitat Selection hypothesis from a population of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in southern Norway. Data from 46 lynx monitored with telemetry indicated that a high proportion of forest strongly reduced the risk of mortality from legal hunting at the home range scale, while increasing road density strongly increased such risk at the finer scale within the home range. We found hierarchical effects of the impact of human disturbance, with a higher road density at a large scale reinforcing its negative impact at a fine scale. Conversely, we demonstrated that lynx shifted their habitat selection to avoid areas with the highest road densities within their home ranges, thus supporting a compensatory mechanism at fine scale enabling lynx to mitigate the impact of large-scale disturbance. Human impact, positively associated with high road accessibility, was thus a stronger driver of lynx space use at a finer scale, with home range characteristics nevertheless constraining habitat selection. Our study demonstrates the truly hierarchical nature of habitat selection, which aims at maximising fitness by selecting against limiting factors at multiple spatial scales, and indicates that scale-specific heterogeneity of the environment is driving individual spatial behaviour, by means of trade-offs across spatial scales.

AB Effective fisheries management needs to consider spatial behavior in addition to more traditional aspects of population dynamics. Acoustic telemetry has been extensively used to provide information on fish movements over different temporal and spatial scales. Here, we used a fixed-receiver array to examine the movement patterns of Labrus bergylta Ascanius 1767, a species highly targeted by the artisanal fleet of Galicia, NW Spain. Data from 25 individuals was assessed for a period of 71 days between September and November 2011 in the Galician Atlantic Islands Maritime-Terrestrial National Park. Fish were present within the monitored area more than 92% of the monitored time. The estimated size of individual home ranges, i.e. the area where fish spent most of their time, was small. The total minimum convex polygons area based on all the estimated positions was 0.133 +/- 0.072 km(2), whereas the home range size estimated using a 95% kernel distribution of the estimated positions was 0.091 +/- 0.031 km(2). The core area (50% kernel) was 0.019 +/- 0.006 km(2). L. bergylta exhibited different patterns of movement in the day versus the night, with 92% of the fish detected more frequently and traveling longer distances during the daytime. In addition, 76% of the fish displayed a larger home range during the day versus during the night. The linearity index was less than 0.005 for all fish suggesting random movements but within a relatively small area, and the volume of intersection index between consecutive daily home ranges was 0.75 +/- 0.13, suggesting high site fidelity. The small home range and the sedentary behavior of L bergylta highlight the potential use of small MPAs as a management tool to ensure a sustainable fishery for this important species.

AB 1.This study examines phylogeography and phylogeny of the threatened stone crayfish, Austropotamobius torrentium, in order to elucidate the role of the Dinaric Karst geology in shaping the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of aquatic fauna in the western Balkans. Mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI genes were partially sequenced from 188 and 159 crayfish, respectively, sampled from 70 localities. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using four methods of phylogenetic inference. Divergence times between phylogroups were estimated in a Bayesian framework, and their demographic history was examined using neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analysis. 2.Seven geographically localised phylogroups separated by pronounced genetic gaps were found. Five of them have a distribution range within the northern-central Dinaric (NCD) region, while the remaining two include populations from the southern Balkans (SB) and central and south-eastern Europe (CSE). The oldest divergence event separated two NCD lineages from the rest of populations in the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene. Divergences amongst the five NCD phylogroups and SB+CSE occurred in the Pliocene. The most recent split separated SB and CSE phylogroups during the Late Pliocene. For both genes, uncorrected pairwise divergences between most of the phylogroups (4.18.7% for COI and 1.64.8% for 16S rRNA) were of the same range as, or higher than, some of the interspecific distances previously reported for the genus Austropotamobius. 3.Geographically isolated and deeply divergent cryptic monophyletic phylogroups within A.torrentium in the NCD region arose in the course of intensification of Neotectonic movements during the Pliocene and the beginning of the Pleistocene and the development of karstification that has heavily fragmented the palaeohydrography of the area. The results confirm a gradual northsouth expansion of stone crayfish during the pre-Pleistocene that preceded the rapid northward post-glacial re/colonisation of central Europe (CSE phylogroup) through the Danube drainage. 4.Austropotamobius torrentium comprises morphologically cryptic but molecularly distinct taxa. Considering the relatively small geographical areas they inhabit, the NCD phylogroups of stone crayfish should be given the highest conservation priority.

AB Aim Many taxa, especially invertebrates, remain biogeographically highly understudied and even baseline assessments are missing, with too limited and heterogeneous sampling being key reasons. Here we set out to assess the human geographic and associated environmental factors behind inventory completeness for the hawkmoths of Africa. We aim to separate the causes of differential sampling from those affecting gradients of species richness to illustrate a potential general avenue for advancing knowledge about diversity in understudied groups. Location Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods Using a database of distributional records of hawkmoths, we computed rarefaction curves and estimated total species richness across 200km x 200km grid cells. We fitted multivariate models to identify environmental predictors of species richness and used environmental co-kriging to map region-wide diversity patterns. We estimated cell-wide inventory completeness from observed and estimated data, and related these to human geographic factors. Results Observed patterns of hawkmoths species richness are strongly determined by the number of available records in grid cells. Both show spatially structured distributions. Variables describing vegetation type, emerge as important predictors of estimated total richness, and variables capturing heat, energy availability and topographic heterogeneity all show a strong positive relationship. Patterns of interpolated richness identify three centres of diversity: Cameroon coastal mountains, and the northern and southern East African montane areas. Inventory completeness is positively influenced by population density, accessibility, protected areas and colonial history. Species richness is still under-recorded in the western Congo Basin and southern Tanzania/Mozambique. Main conclusions Sampling effort is highly biased and controlling for it in large-scale compilations of presence-only data is critical for drawing inferences from our still limited knowledge of invertebrate distributions. Our study shows that a baseline of estimate of broad-scale diversity patterns in understudied taxa can be derived from combining numerical estimators of richness, models of main environmental effects and spatial interpolation. Inventory completeness can be partly predicted from human geographic features and such models may offer fruitful guidance for prioritization of future sampling to further refine and validate estimated patterns of species richness.

AB Aim Our aims were: (1) to separately evaluate the elevational patterns of -diversity for nestedness, species richness difference and replacement, (2) to identify the drivers of -diversity patterns by testing the effect of geographical and environmental distance (human population, temperature and land-use), and (3) to compare the response on native versus alien species to elucidate mechanisms of community assembly along elevational gradients. Location Two mountain regions (Bergamo-Brescia and Trento) in the Italian Alps. Methods We used two floristic datasets in which species composition was sampled within two regular grids. First, we extracted species elevational range and quantified species composition nestedness along the elevational gradient. Second, we partitioned -diversity into its species richness difference and replacement components and tested drivers using regression on distance matrix and hierarchical partitioning. All analyses were performed on natives and aliens, separately. Results For aliens, we found lack of mountain specialists (i.e. species with a distribution range restricted to high elevations), large nestedness, large species richness difference and low species replacement between low and high elevations. All findings point in the same direction: a great majority of alien species were introduced to the lowlands and only a subset of this community spread up the mountains. Both human pressures and temperature selection were important processes underpinning the observed filtering, while geographical and land-use distances were not important. Natives present contrasting patterns with large replacement along the elevation gradients indicating different mechanisms of community assembly. Main conclusions The relatively large alien species replacement in the lowlands indicated the presence of a pool of species that may potentially invade the temperate mountains in the future. Investigations of the identity of alien species occurring in the lowlands and their climatic pre-adaptation might provide tools to prevent invasions in the mountains by predicting the potential invaders and their future elevational distribution.

AB Differences between native and exotic species in competitive ability and susceptibility to herbivores are hypothesized to facilitate coexistence. However, little fieldwork has been conducted to determine whether these differences are present in invaded communities. Here, we experimentally examined whether asymmetries exist between native and exotic plants in a community invaded for over 200 years and whether removing competitors or herbivores influences coexistence. We found that natives and exotics exhibit pronounced asymmetries, as exotics are competitively superior to natives, but are more significantly impacted by herbivores. We also found that herbivore removal mediated the outcome of competitive interactions and altered patterns of dominance across our field sites. Collectively, these findings suggest that asymmetric biotic interactions between native and exotic plants can help to facilitate coexistence in invaded communities.

AB A central aim of forest ecologists is to quantify the relative importance of different community assembly mechanisms in tropical and subtropical tree communities. Recent work in this field has focused on the importance of functional trait similarity and abiotic filtering. While important, none of this work has simultaneously: linked these trait dispersion patterns to the underlying abiotic environment, considered dispersal limitation and quantified the degree to which patterns of trait dispersion may be explained simply by shared ancestry. Here we use data from a subtropical Chinese forest to accomplish this goal. We first examine the trait dispersion (leaf area, specific leaf area, seed mass, wood density, maximum height and five traits together) on local scales by comparing the observed trait dispersion pattern to that expected from a null model. Then we use a variance partitioning approach to examine the degree to which spatial proximity, environmental similarity or the phylogenetic dispersion of the species determine the observed trait dispersion. The results show that, on local scales, trait dispersion is often non-randomly filtered. Further the widespread trait clustering observed is largely explained by the environment and space, while the phylogenetic dispersion of species in a sample explains relatively little. This result further underscores that inferring an assembly mechanism from a pattern of phylogenetic dispersion is tenuous. The work is important in that it is the first to partition the variation in tree trait diversity into its spatial, environmental and phylogenetic components and that it demonstrates that functional trait data often lack enough phylogenetic signal on local scales to confidently link patterns of trait and phylogenetic dispersion. Ultimately, the findings suggest a strong role for abiotic filtering and dispersal limitation during community assembly on local spatial scales and that shared evolutionary history plays a relatively small role.

AB Many animals rely on long-range communication for species recognition, mate selection and territorial defense, but background noise from the environment can constrain their communication. Background noise from both biotic and abiotic sources is ubiquitous. In general, acoustic noise from abiotic sources, including anthropogenic noise, has energy mostly below 1 kHz. Arthropods tend to produce sounds in the 4-10 kHz range, while birds, amphibians and mammals generally have vocalizations with frequencies between 1 and 5 kHz. There are several ways that signalers could improve the efficiency of their acoustic signals to counteract the constraints of background noise. Signalers could make long-term and short-term signal adjustments to increase the detectability and discriminability of their signals. As predicted by signal detection theory adjustments can include increases in contrast between signals and noise, such as the intensity of the signal, the structure of the signal and an increase in signal redundancy. Our study reviews the sources of acoustic background noise, adjustments made by signalers to increase signal efficacy, and the influence of acoustic background noise on the evolution of acoustic communication in terrestrial vertebrate species.

AB In recent years, several attractant pheromones have been identified for cerambycid beetles, including 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol (hereafter monochamol) for Monochamus galloprovincialis (Olivier), M. alternatus Hope, and M. scutellatus (Say). This study screened eight known cerambycid pheromones or their analogues (including monochamol) as potential attractants for M. carolinensis Olivier and M. titillator (F.), in the presence and absence of the host volatile alpha-pinene. Monochamol attracted M. carolinensis in the presence and absence of alpha-pinene, whereas M. titillator was only attracted to the combination of monochamol and alpha-pinene. (2R*, 3R*)-2,3-Hexanediol also attracted both M. carolinensis and M. titillator, but only in the presence of alpha-pinene. Subsequent coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection analyses of extracts of volatiles collected from both sexes demonstrated that male M. carolinensis and M. titillator release monochamol, and that antennae of males and females of both species detect it. These results indicate that monochamol is a male-produced pheromone for both M. carolinensis and M. titillator.

AB In spite of considerable progress in our understanding of ecosystem functioning, our ability to design effective and enforceable environmental policies requires a deep understanding of human perceptions and beliefs. In this respect, what is called today stakeholder analysis is an eclectic mixture of qualitative and semi-quantitative techniques aiming at eliciting, understanding and de-codifying how individuals perceive risks and threats towards sustainability. Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) is gradually emerging as an alternative methodology capable of assisting researchers in the domain of environmental policy. We explored the promise that FCM holds to support environmental policy makers. We suggest FCM approach as a new participatory method in environmental policy: through aiding in Multi-stakeholder (actor) analysis for risk assessment, capturing values and scenarios construction. To show how this is feasible we try to answer three basic questions: How cognitive mapping can support decision-making? How FCM can support environmental decision-making? How simulation of concepts may help in communicating stakeholders' views to environmental decision makers? Then we explore the potential application of FCM in environmental policy, especially in environmental economics, trying to substantiate economic values for nature providing 'flesh and bones' to the concept of economic preferences.

AB In this first of three papers we examine the use of niche concepts in ecology and especially in species distribution modelling (SDM). This paper deliberately focuses on the lack of clarity found in the term niche. Because its meanings are so diverse, the term niche tends to create confusion and requires constant qualification. The literature houses many idiosyncratic ideas of what the niche is, but few examples where niche is more explanatory than the terminologies of population and community ecology or the statistical methods used to implement SDM analyses. In many cases the original (and inspirational) concepts are not directly applicable to our modern applications (e.g. set theory). There are some conceptual limitations found in individual definitions of niche (e.g. the fundamental niche concept), so it is perhaps understandable why more neutral terminology is becoming popular in SDM. An examination of the literature reveals a wide range of uncritical use of niche terminology. Our findings in this paper do not necessarily support the position of niche as a universally useful concept.

AB The pace of on-going climate change calls for reliable plant biodiversity scenarios. Traditional dynamic vegetation models use plant functional types that are summarized to such an extent that they become meaningless for biodiversity scenarios. Hybrid dynamic vegetation models of intermediate complexity (hybrid-DVMs) have recently been developed to address this issue. These models, at the crossroads between phenomenological and process-based models, are able to involve an intermediate number of well-chosen plant functional groups (PFGs). The challenge is to build meaningful PFGs that are representative of plant biodiversity, and consistent with the parameters and processes of hybrid-DVMs. Here, we propose and test a framework based on few selected traits to define a limited number of PFGs, which are both representative of the diversity (functional and taxonomic) of the flora in the Ecrins National Park, and adapted to hybrid-DVMs. This new classification scheme, together with recent advances in vegetation modeling, constitutes a step forward for mechanistic biodiversity modeling.

AB Long-term human-wildlife sympatry depends on the willingness and capacity of local people to coexist with wild animals. With human population growth and deforestation for agriculture, farmers increasingly live in proximity to wildlife, including large mammals of conservation concern. Understanding local perspectives and concerns regarding wildlife is essential for informing appropriate management strategies that reduce conflicts and promote sustainable coexistence. Social science approaches therefore have a critical role in integrated conservation programmes. We undertook an attitude survey to understand residents' perspectives about sharing a landscape with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in an unprotected forest-agriculture mosaic in Uganda. Interviews (n = 134) in 12 villages demonstrate residents' ambivalence towards living alongside these protected yet potentially troublesome mammals. Chimpanzee behaviour is reported to have undergone recent changes. Residents claim apes increasingly enter villages for food, threaten people, and pose a particular threat to children's safety. Chimpanzee numbers are believed to have increased locally. Most interviewees fear chimpanzees, considering them dangerous. Crop losses to chimpanzees were widely reported. Farmers tolerate raiding of domestic fruits, but not cash-crops. Results demonstrate that attitudes towards wildlife are not fixed. Reported changes to chimpanzee behaviour are challenging villagers' traditionally benign attitude towards them. Even so, residents acknowledge benefits to chimpanzees because they reportedly displace other crop-raiding wildlife which, unlike chimpanzees, damage important staple food crops. Survey findings are contextualised with respect to recent, major land-use changes in Uganda (clearance of unprotected forest for timber and agriculture) that have precipitated a sharp rise in farmer-chimpanzee interactions. We discuss the study's broader implications for protected mammal management and conflict mitigation in human-dominated landscapes, and ask whether it is appropriate to expect impoverished rural farmers to accommodate large-bodied mammals that pose a potential threat to their safety and livelihoods.

AB Mitochondrial DNA barcodes provide a simple taxonomic tool for systematic and ecological research, with particular benefit for poorly studied or species-rich taxa. Barcoding assumes genetic diversity follows species boundaries; however, many processes disrupt species-level monophyly of barcodes leading to incorrect classifications. Spatial population structure, particularly when shared across closely related and potentially hybridizing taxa, can invalidate barcoding approaches yet few data exist to examine its impacts. We test how shared population structure across hybridizing species impacts upon mitochondrial barcodes by sequencing the cytochrome b gene for 518 individuals of four well-delimited Western Palaearctic gallwasp species within the Andricus quercuscalicis species group. Mitochondrial barcodes clustered individuals into mixed-species clades corresponding to refugia, with no difference in within- and between-species divergence. Four nuclear genes were also sequenced from 4 to 11 individuals per refugial population of each species. Multi-locus analyses of these data supported established species, with no support for the refugial clustering across species seen in mitochondrial barcodes. This pattern is consistent with mitochondrial introgression among populations of species sharing the same glacial refugium, such that mitochondrial barcodes identify a shared history of population structure rather than species. Many taxa show phylogeographic structure across glacial refugia, suggesting that mitochondrial barcoding may fail when applied to other sets of co-distributed, closely related species. Robust barcoding approaches must sample extensively across population structure to disentangle spatial from species-level variation. Methods incorporating multiple unlinked loci are also essential to accommodate coalescent variation among genes and provide power to resolve recently diverged species.

AB Globally, cassava is the second most important root crop after potatoes and the fifth most important crop overall in terms of human caloric intake. In addition to its growing global importance for feed, fuel, and starch, cassava has long been vital to food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate change is expected to have its most severe impact on crops in food insecure regions, yet little is known about how cassava productivity will respond to climate change. The most important driver of climate change is globally increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]). However, the potential for cassava to enhance food security in an elevated [CO2] world is uncertain as greenhouse and open top chamber (OTC) study reports are ambiguous. Studies have yielded misleading results in the past regarding the effect of elevated [CO2] on crop productivity, particularly in cases where pots restricted sink growth. To resolve these conflicting results, we compare the response of cassava to growth at ambient (ca. 385 similar to ppm) and elevated [CO2] (585 similar to ppm) under field conditions and fully open air [CO2] elevation. After three and half months of growth at elevated [CO2], above ground biomass was 30% greater and cassava root tuber dry mass increased over 100% (fresh weight increased 89%). High photosynthetic rates and photosynthetic stimulation by elevated [CO2], larger canopies, and a large sink capacity all contributed to cassava's growth and yield stimulation. Cassava exhibited photosynthetic acclimation via decreased Rubisco capacity early in the season prior to root tuber initiation when sink capacity was smaller. Importantly, and in contrast to a greenhouse study, we found no evidence of increased leaf N or total cyanide concentration in elevated [CO2]. All of our results are consistent with theoretical expectations; however, the magnitude of the yield increase reported here surpasses all other C3 crops and thus exceeds expectations.

AB Whilst global environmental change in the 21st century will undoubtedly have direct impacts on built heritage, it will also have important indirect effects through its influence on microbial, plant and animal life on heritage sites. Environmental change will affect both the structure of biotic communities and the function of such communities. Both impacts will, in turn, influence the deterioration and conservation of heritage sites. Changes in precipitation will exert a major, but as yet poorly understood, control on heritage biotas, whilst changes in atmospheric composition may also be important. Climatic changes will cause range shifts for some taxa, further influencing community composition. Whilst there are many unknowns, making prediction difficult, some scenarios can be proposed based on ecological response to stress and disturbance. This approach indicates some hotspots at risk of experiencing dramatic shifts in biotic communities and their impacts, which may switch from biodeteriogenic to bioprotective or vice versa. Such hotspots include vulnerable sandstone and limestone heritage structures in areas of the Mediterranean, Middle East, Caribbean and Southern Africa.

TI Haste Makes Waste but Condition Matters: Molt Rate-Feather Quality

   MIGRATORY BEHAVIOR; FLIGHT PERFORMANCE; BODY CONDITION; GROWTH-RATE;
   MASS; SELECTION; DURATION
AB Background: The trade-off between current and residual reproductive values is central to life history theory, although the possible mechanisms underlying this trade-off are largely unknown. The 'molt constraint' hypothesis suggests that molt and plumage functionality are compromised by the preceding breeding event, yet this candidate mechanism remains insufficiently explored.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The seasonal change in photoperiod was manipulated to accelerate the molt rate. This treatment simulates the case of naturally late-breeding birds. House sparrows Passer domesticus experiencing accelerated molt developed shorter flight feathers with more fault bars and body feathers with supposedly lower insulation capacity (i.e. shorter, smaller, with a higher barbule density and fewer plumulaceous barbs). However, the wing, tail and primary feather lengths were shorter in fast-molting birds if they had an inferior body condition, which has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The rachis width of flight feathers was not affected by the treatment, but it was still condition-dependent.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study shows that sedentary birds might face evolutionary costs because of the molt rate-feather quality conflict. This is the first study to experimentally demonstrate that (1) molt rate affects several aspects of body feathers as well as flight feathers and (2) the costly effects of rapid molt are condition-specific. We conclude that molt rate and its association with feather quality might be a major mediator of life history trade-offs. Our findings also suggest a novel advantage of early breeding, i.e. the facilitation of slower molt and the condition-dependent regulation of feather growth.

AB Recent studies emphasize the role of indirect relationships and feedback loops in maintaining ecosystem resilience. Environmental changes that impact on the organisms involved in these processes have the potential to initiate threshold responses and fundamentally shift the interactions within an ecosystem. However, empirical studies are hindered by the difficulty of designing appropriate manipulative experiments to capture this complexity. Here we employ structural equation modeling to define and test the architecture of ecosystem interaction networks. Using survey data from 19 estuaries we investigate the interactions between biological (abundance of large bioturbating macrofauna, micro-phytobenthos, and detrital matter) and physical (sediment grain size) processes. We assess the potential for abrupt changes in the architecture of the network and the strength of interactions to occur across environmental gradients. Our analysis identified a potential threshold in the relationship between sediment mud content and benthic chlorophyll a, at similar to 12 mu g/g, using quantile regression. Below this threshold, the interaction network involved different variables and fewer feedbacks than above. This approach has potential to improve our empirical understanding of thresholds in ecological systems and our ability to design manipulative experiments that test how and when a threshold will be passed. It can also be used to indicate to resource managers that a particular system has the potential to exhibit threshold responses to environmental change, emphasizing precautionary management and facilitating a better understanding of how persistent multiple stressors threaten the resilience and long-term use of natural ecosystems.

AB Adaptive radiations have helped shape how we view animal speciation, particularly classic examples such as Darwin's finches, Hawaiian fruitflies and African Great Lakes cichlids. These 'island' radiations are comparatively recent, making them particularly interesting because the mechanisms that caused diversification are still in motion. Here, we identify a new case of a recent bird radiation within a continentally distributed species group; the capuchino seedeaters comprise 11 Sporophila species originally described on the basis of differences in plumage colour and pattern in adult males. We use molecular data together with analyses of male plumage and vocalizations to understand species limits of the group. We find marked phenotypic variation despite lack of mitochondrial DNA monophyly and few differences in other putatively neutral nuclear markers. This finding is consistent with the group having undergone a recent radiation beginning in the Pleistocene, leaving genetic signatures of incomplete lineage sorting, introgressive hybridization and demographic expansions. We argue that this apparent uncoupling between neutral DNA homogeneity and phenotypic diversity is expected for a recent group within the framework of coalescent theory. Finally, we discuss how the ecology of open habitats in South America during the Pleistocene could have helped promote this unique and ongoing radiation.

AB There is increasing empirical evidence that individuals utilize social and environmental cues in making decisions as to whether or not to disperse. However, we lack theory exploring the influence of information acquisition and use on the evolution of dispersal strategies and metapopulation dynamics. We used an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to explore the evolution of emigration strategies under varying precision of information about the natal patch, cost of information acquisition, and environmental predictability. Our findings show an interesting interplay between information use and the evolved emigration propensity. Lack of information led to higher emigration probabilities in more unpredictable environments but to lower emigration probabilities in constant or highly predictable scenarios. Somewhat-informed dispersal strategies were selected for in most cases, even when the acquisition of information was associated with a moderate reproductive cost. Notably, selection rarely favored investment in acquisition of high-precision information, and the tendency to invest in information acquisition was greatest in predictable environments when the associated cost was low. Our results highlight that information use can affect dispersal in a complex manner and also emphasize that information-acquisition behaviors can themselves come under strong selection, resulting in evolutionary dynamics that are tightly coupled to those of context-dependent behaviors.

AB Although trait analyses have become more important in community ecology, trait-environment correlations have rarely been studied along successional gradients. We asked which environmental variables had the strongest impact on intraspecific and interspecific trait variation in the community and which traits were most responsive to the environment. We established a series of plots in a secondary forest in the Chinese subtropics, stratified by successional stages that were defined by the time elapsed since the last logging activities. On a total of 27 plots all woody plants were recorded and a set of individuals of every species was analysed for leaf traits, resulting in a trait matrix of 26 leaf traits for 122 species. A Fourth Corner Analysis revealed that the mean values of many leaf traits were tightly related to the successional gradient. Most shifts in traits followed the leaf economics spectrum with decreasing specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents with successional time. Beside succession, few additional environmental variables resulted in significant trait relationships, such as soil moisture and soil C and N content as well as topographical variables. Not all traits were related to the leaf economics spectrum, and thus, to the successional gradient, such as stomata size and density. By comparing different permutation models in the Fourth Corner Analysis, we found that the trait-environment link was based more on the association of species with the environment than of the communities with species traits. The strong species-environment association was brought about by a clear gradient in species composition along the succession series, while communities were not well differentiated in mean trait composition. In contrast, intraspecific trait variation did not show close environmental relationships. The study confirmed the role of environmental trait filtering in subtropical forests, with traits associated with the leaf economics spectrum being the most responsive ones.

ID CHALLENGES
AB The health risk of noncarcinogenic substances is usually represented by the hazard quotient (HQ) or target organ-specific hazard index (TOSHI). However, three problems arise from these indicators. Firstly, the HQ overestimates the health risk of noncarcinogenic substances for non-critical organs. Secondly, the TOSHI makes inappropriately the additive assumption for multiple hazardous substances affecting the same organ. Thirdly, uncertainty of the TOSHI undermines the accuracy of risk characterization. To address these issues, this article proposes the use of Bayesian belief networks (BBN) for health risk assessment (HRA) and the procedure involved is developed using the example of road constructions. According to epidemiological studies and using actual hospital attendance records, the BBN-HRA can specifically identify the probabilistic relationship between an air pollutant and each of its induced disease, which can overcome the overestimation of the HQ for non-critical organs. A fusion technique of conditional probabilities in the BBN-HRA is devised to avoid the unrealistic additive assumption. The use of the BBN-HRA is easy even for those without HRA knowledge. The input of pollution concentrations into the model will bring more concrete information on the morbidity and mortality rates of all the related diseases rather than a single score, which can reduce the uncertainty of the TOSHI.

AB Aim The dimensions of species vulnerability to climate change are complex, and this impedes efforts to provide clear advice for conservation planning. In this study, we used a formal framework to assess species vulnerability to climate change quantifying exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and then used this information to target areas for reducing vulnerability at a regional scale.
   Location The 6500-km(2) Mount Lofty Ranges region in South Australia.
   Methods We quantified the vulnerability of 171 plant species in a fragmented yet biologically important agro-ecological landscape, typical of many temperate zones globally. We specified exposure, using three climate change scenarios; sensitivity, as the adverse impact of climate change on species' spatial distribution; and adaptive capacity, as the ability of species to migrate calculated using dispersal kernels. Priority areas for reducing vulnerability were then identified by incorporating these various components into a single priority index.
   Results Climate change had a variable impact on species distributions. Those species whose range decreased or shifted geographically were attributed higher sensitivity than those species that increased geographic range or remained unchanged. The ability to adapt to range changes in response to shifting climates varies both spatially and between species. Areas of highest priority for reducing vulnerability were found at higher altitudes and lower latitudes with increasing severity of climate change.
   Main conclusions Our study demonstrates the use of a single spatially explicit index that identifies areas in the landscape for targeting specific conservation and restoration actions to reduce species vulnerability to climate change. Our index can be transferred to other regions around the world in which climate change poses an increasing threat to native species.

AB Size- and age-specific physiological constraints coupled with inexperience make the transition to independent foraging in juvenile divers a crucial period with important consequences for survival, dispersal and future reproduction. Variation in environmental conditions and associated changes in food availability can additionally constrain the juvenile's development to independence. Juvenile Galapagos sea lions Zalophus wollebaeki (GSL) represent an extreme example of these constraints owing to a low growth rate, seasonal variation in food abundance and unpredictable declines in food availability during El Nino events. Time-depth recorder (TDR) data and stable isotope data of delta N-15 and delta C-13 of known age juvenile GSL were analysed to investigate the development of diving and foraging, and a regular year was compared with an El Nino year to determine the effect of environmental change on the foraging behaviour of juvenile and adult GSL. GSL juveniles started diving activity at 12 mo of age and showed distinct juvenile-specific diving strategies that suggest there is an ontogenetic niche shift between juvenile and adult GSL foraging. Successful independent foraging, indicated by a strong decrease in delta N-15 ratio, started considerably later (at 18 mo of age) and was further delayed in the El Nino warm season, indicating there is an even longer dependency on maternal milk during environmentally adverse conditions. Our results suggest that prolonged maternal energetic investment buffers GSL juveniles against the constraints of diving and foraging under environmentally variable conditions and is linked to the low reproductive rate of this species.

AB Natural hybridization between two strains, varieties, or species is a common phenomenon in both plants and animals. Although hybridization may skew established gene pools, it generates population diversity efficiently and sometimes results in the emergence of newly adapted genotypes. Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes the most frequent opportunistic fungal infection in immunocompromised hosts, has three serotypes: A, D, and AD. Serotype-specific multilocus sequence typing and serotype-specific comparative genome hybridization were applied to investigate the genetic variability and genomic organization of C. neoformans serotype AD isolates. We confirm that C. neoformans serotype AD isolates are hybrids of serotype A and D strains. Compared with haploid strains, most AD hybrid isolates exhibit unique multilocus sequence typing genotypes, suggesting that multiple independent hybridization events punctuated the origin and evolutionary trajectory of AD hybrids. The MATa alleles from both haploid and AD hybrid isolates group closely to form a cluster or subcluster in both the serotype A and D populations. The rare and unique distribution of MATa alleles may restrict sexual reproduction between isolates of opposite mating types. The genetic diversity of the serotype D population, including haploid strains and serotype D genomes of the AD hybrid, is significantly greater than that of serotype A, and there are signatures of recombination within the serotype D population. Given that MATa isolates are relatively rare, both opposite-sex and same-sex mating may contribute to genetic recombination of serotype D in nature. Extensive chromosome loss was observed in AD hybrid isolates, which results in loss of heterozygosity in the otherwise-heterozygous AD hybrid genome. Most AD hybrid isolates exhibit hybrid vigor and are resistant to the antifungal drug FK506. In addition, the C. neoformans AD hybrid genome is highly dynamic, with continuous chromosome loss, which may be a facile route for pathogen evolution through which genotypic and phenotypic variation is generated.

AB Global climate change (GCC) is expected to lead to massive loss of global biodiversity in the alpine regions of mountain ranges. Studies on the potential effects of GCC on low mountain areas remain sparse, however, despite the high conservation value of these areas as biodiversity refugia. We chose a species distribution modeling approach to assess potential GCC impacts on the future distributions of montane freshwater invertebrates under two different greenhouse gas scenarios and three averaged general circulation models. For this, ensemble models consisting of six algorithms [generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), generalized additive model (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)] were applied to project areas of 23 cold-stenothermic aquatic insects from montane regions of Central Europe. We found an average loss of 70-80% of the potential distribution for the study species until 2080, depending on the underlying Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario. Species distribution ranges below 1000 m above sea level were found to decrease by up to similar to 96% according to the severest greenhouse gas emission scenario. While the Alps remain the single main refugium under the A2a greenhouse gas emission scenario, the more moderate climate scenario B2a shows fragmented potential persistence of montane insects in some low mountain ranges. The results show that montane freshwater assemblages in low mountain ranges are particularly threatened by ongoing GCC. As vertical dispersal is limited by elevational restriction, low mountain ranges may act as summit traps under GCC. We thus propose that GCC will lead to the extinction of several species and unique genetic lineages of postglacial relict species, resulting in a significant decline in Central European fauna.

AB We modelled the combined effects of past and expected future changes in climate and nitrogen deposition on tree carbon sequestration by European forests for the period 1900-2050. Two scenarios for deposition (current legislation and maximum technically feasible reductions) and two climate scenarios (no change and SRES A1 scenario) were used. Furthermore, the possible limitation of forest growth by calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus is investigated. The area and age structure of the forests was assumed to stay constant to observations during the period 1970-1990. Under these assumptions, the simulations show that the change in forest growth and carbon sequestration in the past is dominated by changes in nitrogen deposition, while climate change is the major driver for future carbon sequestration. However, its impact is reduced by nitrogen availability. Furthermore, limitations in base cations, especially magnesium, and in phosphorus may significantly affect predicted growth in the future.

   COMPONENTS; INNOVATION; ELEMENTS; BARRIERS
AB It is becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile the observed extent of horizontal gene transfers with the central metaphor of a great tree uniting all evolving entities on the planet. In this manuscript we describe the Public Goods Hypothesis and show that it is appropriate in order to describe biological evolution on the planet. According to this hypothesis, nucleotide sequences (genes, promoters, exons, etc.) are simply seen as goods, passed from organism to organism through both vertical and horizontal transfer. Public goods sequences are defined by having the properties of being largely non-excludable (no organism can be effectively prevented from accessing these sequences) and non-rival (while such a sequence is being used by one organism it is also available for use by another organism). The universal nature of genetic systems ensures that such non-excludable sequences exist and non-excludability explains why we see a myriad of genes in different combinations in sequenced genomes. There are three features of the public goods hypothesis. Firstly, segments of DNA are seen as public goods, available for all organisms to integrate into their genomes. Secondly, we expect the evolution of mechanisms for DNA sharing and of defense mechanisms against DNA intrusion in genomes. Thirdly, we expect that we do not see a global tree-like pattern. Instead, we expect local tree-like patterns to emerge from the combination of a commonage of genes and vertical inheritance of genomes by cell division. Indeed, while genes are theoretically public goods, in reality, some genes are excludable, particularly, though not only, when they have variant genetic codes or behave as coalition or club goods, available for all organisms of a coalition to integrate into their genomes, and non-rival within the club. We view the Tree of Life hypothesis as a regionalized instance of the Public Goods hypothesis, just like classical mechanics and euclidean geometry are seen as regionalized instances of quantum mechanics and Riemannian geometry respectively. We argue for this change using an axiomatic approach that shows that the Public Goods hypothesis is a better accommodation of the observed data than the Tree of Life hypothesis.

   BENEFITS; EXPOSURE; STRESS
AB Background: Globally, the human and economic burdens of mental illness are increasing. As the prevalence and costs associated with mental illness rise, we are progressively more aware that environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss impact on human health.
   Hypothesis: This paper hypothesises that increased biodiversity in urban environments is associated with improved mental health and wellbeing. It proposes the ecological mechanism through which the association may exist, and explores the extant literature to determine the extent of empirical evidence to support our hypothesis.
   Evidence: While there is a substantial literature investigating the impact of 'green space' and contact with nature on mental health, we identified only one original research paper that directly investigated the link between biodiversity and mental health. This suggests that the extant evidence considers only 'one part of the story', providing an evidence base which is inadequate to inform policy on biodiversity conservation and public health.
   Implications: Our hypothesised relationship between environmental change and mental health proposes conservation and restoration of biodiversity in urban environments as a form of intervention for improving human health. It also highlights the need for a better evidence base to demonstrate the synergistic benefits of increased biodiversity and mental health to decision makers. Well-designed quantitative epidemiological research is needed to establish the strength of any such causal relationship. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim Vitis subg. Vitis provides an example of a plant disjunction occurring in the Northern Hemisphere. It shows broad morphological variation but is assumed to be a species complex with limited genetic differentiation. Based on a comprehensive sampling of taxa and polymorphism in both chloroplast and nuclear DNA, we assessed genetic variation within this subgenus. Our aims were to clarify the relationships among species and to examine their historical biogeography.
   Location Asia, Europe, North America.
   Methods We analysed a total of 30 species and putative hybrids from subgenus Vitis and examined the infra-specific variation in some species. Polymorphism in chloroplast DNA was assessed in trnL and trnH-psbA-trnK sequences (c. 2170 bp) and in 15 microsatellite loci. We also obtained nuclear data for size variation at 24 microsatellite loci. Phylogenetic inference was performed with Bayesian analyses. A maximum parsimony network was constructed to depict the evolutionary relationships among haplotypes, and microsatellite data were also subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis using the Ward distance. In addition, we assessed size homoplasy by sequencing both chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite loci.
   Results Chloroplast polymorphisms resolved subgenus Vitis as a monophyletic group with limited genetic variation. The ancestral haplotypes were found in Eurasia. American taxa all harboured derived haplotypes. Most of them formed a monophyletic group that did not include Vitis californica. The four main haplotypes in Vitis vinifera corresponded to two different origins. Nuclear microsatellites indicated that genetic variation was especially large in North America. Asian species exhibited a lower level of nuclear divergence and the European V. vinifera corresponded to a differentiated nuclear lineage.
   Main conclusions We obtained some evidence that subgenus Vitis has an Asian origin and then dispersed to Europe and North America. Geographic separation was followed by diversification, presumably during the Pleistocene, resulting in phylogeographic patterns similar to other biota. In contrast to chloroplast DNA, nuclear DNA shows a larger than expected genetic variation. Our molecular data also highlight the need to re-examine certain aspects of the current subgeneric classification.

AB The Socotra Archipelago (Yemen) is globally recognized for its outstanding biodiversity and endemism, designated on this basis a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. The island underwent long geological and political isolation, ensuring preservation of unique ecosystems until the start of the new millennium. Now, Socotra Island is undergoing rapid development, out of balance with conservation. Major causes for biodiversity loss in other global insular ecosystems such as habitat fragmentation and degradation, pollution, invasive species and the impact of tourism, are becoming pressing issues that deserve close attention. Unsustainable resource use, the loss of traditional land management and illegal trade in biota are worrying phenomena that further increase the pressures on Socotra's ecosystems. We provide the first comprehensive review of potential human impacts on Socotra before the 21(st) century, an updated discussion of some of the principal threats to its biodiversity in recent times, discussing local examples within a historical context of known extinction processes on islands, and underline the importance of traditional knowledge in the protection of Socotran ecosystems.

AB In the last decade, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) have become one of the most widely used molecular markers to study the genetic structure of natural populations. Most of the statistical methods available to study the genetic structure of populations using AFLPs consider these markers as dominant and are thus unable to distinguish between individuals being heterozygous or homozygous for the dominant allele. Some attempts have been made to treat AFLPs as codominant markers by using AFLP band intensities to infer the most likely genotype of each individual. These two approaches have some drawbacks, the former discarding potentially valuable information and the latter being sometimes unable to correctly assign genotypes to individuals. In this study, we propose an alternative likelihood-based approach, which does not attempt at inferring the genotype of each individual, but rather incorporate the uncertainty about genotypes into a Bayesian framework leading to the estimation of population-specific FIS and FST coefficients. We show with simulations that the accuracy of our method is much higher than one using AFLP as dominant markers and is generally close to what would be obtained by using the same number of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. The method is applied to a data set of four populations of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) from Grisons in Switzerland, for which we obtained 562 polymorphic AFLP markers. Our approach is very general and has the potential to make AFLP markers as useful as SNP data for nonmodel species.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate how future harvesting of spruce low stumps as a renewable energy source, might influence the saproxylic (wood living) beetle fauna. Species richness, abundance and assemblages of saproxylic beetles were compared on low stumps, high stumps and logs of spruce on 10 clear-cuts in northern Sweden. The sampling was conducted with emergence traps and a total of 929 individuals and 120 species were collected. No significant differences in beetle abundance or species richness were detected between substrate types. However, there were clear differences in assemblage composition between all substrate types. Our results suggest that low stumps created at final felling support as many species and individuals per volume dead wood as other dead wood substrates and that they are therefore overlooked as substrates for wood living organisms. Consequently, harvesting of low stumps might have negative effects on the diversity of saproxylic beetles, as up to 80% of the dead wood remaining on clear-cuts is in the form of low stumps. Future studies should evaluate if compensatory measures can be performed to minimize negative impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the role of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) as predators, we studied diet, prey selection, and predation impact of jackals on 2 game ranches in South Africa that differed in ungulate diversity and biomass. Results showed that large (>15 kg) ungulate species dominated jackal diets throughout the year on both the less diverse (range of ingested biomass across seasons = 39-78%) and more diverse (26-69%) game ranch. Other important food items included medium-sized mammals (1-3 kg; 1-26%) and fruit (2-69%), whereas small mammals comprised 3-11% of ingested biomass across seasons on both sites. Jackals were not random in consumption of ungulates, and consumption patterns suggested jackals actively hunted certain species rather than consumed them as carrion. During ungulate birthing periods, jackals consumed almost exclusively those ungulate species that were hiders (i.e., fawns were hidden in tall vegetation away from herd) regardless of ungulate densities, suggesting that primarily fawns were preyed upon. Among hiders, there was a negative relationship (P = 0.01) between body size and percent of population consumed by jackals, indicating smaller species were more susceptible than larger species to jackal predation. Consequently, springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) were always selected over other ungulate species on both sites, and this species was the most impacted by jackal predation. In contrast, ungulate species that were followers (i.e., fawns immediately followed mothers within protection of the herd) were scarcely or not at all consumed by jackals, regardless of body size or density. Medium-sized mammals were selectively consumed over ungulates, and there was a negative relationship (P < 0.01) between consumption of berries and ungulates, indicating alternative food resources influenced consumption of ungulates on our study sites. Our results will help wildlife managers in Africa identify ungulate species susceptible to jackal predation, and can be used to develop management strategies for reducing jackal predation in areas where it is problematic.

AB Despite a long history of work on relationships between area and number of species, the details of mechanisms causing patterns have eluded ecologists. The general principle that the number of species increases with the area sampled is often attributed to a sampling artifact due to larger areas containing greater numbers of individuals. We manipulated the patch size and surface area of experimental mimics of macro- algae to test several models that can explain the relationship between abundance and species richness of assemblages colonizing different habitats. Our results show that patch size and structural complexity have independent effects on assemblages of macroinvertebrates. Regardless of their structural complexity, larger habitats were colonized by more species. Patch size did not have a significant effect on numbers of individuals, so the increased number of species in larger habitats was not simply a result of random placement associated with sampling increased number of individuals. Similarly, random placement alone could not explain differences in numbers of species among habitats with different structural complexity, contrary to suggestions that the relationship between number of species and surface area might also be a sampling artifact due to more complex habitats having larger areas and therefore sampling more individuals. Future progress would benefit from manipulating properties of habitat in conjunction with experimental manipulations of area.

AB P>1. Understanding the degree to which reproductive success varies with an individual's age and lifespan, and the degree to which population-level variation mirrors individual-level variation, is central to understanding life-history evolution and the dynamics of age-structured populations. We quantified variation in the survival probability of offspring, one key component of reproductive success and fitness, in relation to parent age and lifespan in a wild population of red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax).
   2. On average across the study population, the first-year survival probability of offspring decreased with increasing parent age and lifespan; offspring of old parents were less likely to survive than offspring of young parents, and offspring of long-lived parents were less likely to survive than offspring of short-lived parents.
   3. However, survival did not vary with parent age across offspring produced by groups of parents that ultimately had similar lifespans.
   4. Rather, across offspring produced by young parents, offspring survival decreased with increasing parent lifespan; parents that ultimately had long lifespans produced offspring that survived poorly, even when these parents were breeding at young ages.
   5. The average decrease in offspring survival with increasing parent age observed across the population therefore reflected the gradual disappearance of short-lived parents that produced offspring that survived well, not age-specific variation in offspring survival within individual parents.
   6. The negative correlation between offspring survival and maternal lifespan was strongest when environmental conditions meant that offspring survival was low across the population.
   7. These data suggest an environment-dependent trade-off between parent and offspring survival, show consistent individual variation in the resolution of this trade-off that is set early in a parent's life, and demonstrate that such structured life-history variation can generate spurious evidence of senescence in key fitness components when measured across a population.

AB Large-scale (temporal and/or spatial) molecular investigations of the diversity and distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) require considerable sampling efforts and high-throughput analysis. To facilitate such efforts, we have developed a TaqMan real-time PCR assay to detect and identify AMF in environmental samples. First, we screened the diversity in clone libraries, generated by nested PCR, of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of AMF in environmental samples. We then generated probes and forward primers based on the detected sequences, enabling AMF sequence type-specific detection in TaqMan multiplex real-time PCR assays. In comparisons to conventional clone library screening and Sanger sequencing, the TaqMan assay approach provided similar accuracy but higher sensitivity with cost and time savings. The TaqMan assays were applied to analyze the AMF community composition within plots of a large-scale plant biodiversity manipulation experiment, the Jena Experiment, primarily designed to investigate the interactive effects of plant biodiversity on element cycling and trophic interactions. The results show that environmental variables hierarchically shape AMF communities and that the sequence type spectrum is strongly affected by previous land use and disturbance, which appears to favor disturbance-tolerant members of the genus Glomus. The AMF species richness of disturbance-associated communities can be largely explained by richness of plant species and plant functional groups, while plant productivity and soil parameters appear to have only weak effects on the AMF community.

AB Ecologists often believe the discovery of mechanism to be the central goal of scientific research. While many macroecologists have inherited this view, to date they have been much more efficient at producing patterns than identifying their underlying processes. We discuss several possible attitudes for macroecologists to adopt in this context while also arguing that in fact macroecology already has many mechanisms that are ignored. We briefly describe six of these: central limit theorem, fractals, random sampling and placement, neutral theory (and descendents), concordance of forces, and maximum entropy. We explore why these mechanisms are overlooked and discuss whether they should be. We conclude that macroecology needs to take a more pragmatic, less ideological approach to mechanism. We apply this viewpoint to the recent controversy over maximum entropy and suggest that maximum entropy needs to be viewed more pragmatically and less ideologically.

AB Riparian vegetation, particularly trees and shrubs, can play a crucial role in the construction and turnover of fluvial landforms, but aquatic plants may also act as river ecosystem engineers.
   Macrophyte and environmental data from 467 British river reaches are used to explore associations between aquatic plant morphotypes and the physical characteristics of the reaches. The abundance of five plant morphotypes (mosses, linear-submerged, patch-submerged, linear emergent, branched emergent) is estimated for each river reach. Cluster analysis is applied to the abundances of the five morphotypes across the 467 reaches to identify six typical assemblages or clusters of the morphotypes. These clusters are found to be associated with statistically significantly different values of seven physical variables (altitude, slope, median annual flood discharge, channel width, mean bed sediment size, percentage cover of sand and silt on the river bed, and unit stream power). Associations between the morphotype clusters and combinations of the physical variables are explored using Canonical Correspondence Analysis and standard slope-discharge-sediment calibre-channel style graphs.
   Several of the morphotype clusters are discriminated by unit stream power and bed sediment size. In particular, morphotype clusters dominated by emergent and submerged macrophytes are associated with granules, sand, and finer bed sediments and are rarely found where unit stream power exceeds 100 W m(-2). One cluster characterised by branched emergent species with relatively low cover of submerged morphotypes is confined to sites with unit stream power below 20 W m(-2); and another cluster characterised by linear emergents with low cover of submerged morphotypes is associated with particularly extensive, fine bed sediments, suggesting possible smothering of submerged plants. In contrast, mosses reach their highest abundance in two clusters associated with the highest unit stream power and coarsest bed sediments, with the patch-submerged morphotype reaching relatively high abundance in the slightly lower energy cluster of these two.
   British rivers have been modified over hundreds of years such that the sample of study reaches have predominantly single-thread channels. However, the plotting positions of these reaches on established graphs describing slope-discharge-sediment calibre-channel style associations, illustrates the potential of some of these sites to develop wandering or braided forms and, in lower energy situations, the potential for aquatic plants to trap fine sediments and contribute to landform building and channel change if maintenance (cutting and dredging) of the emergent and submerged morphotypes were reduced.

AB Sperm competition exerts strong selection on males to produce spermatozoa with an optimal morphology that maximizes their fertilization success. Long sperm were first suggested to be favored because they should swim faster. However, studies that investigated the relationship between sperm length and sperm competitive ability or sperm swimming velocity yielded contradictory results. More recently, ratios of the different sections of a spermatozoon (the head, midpiece, and flagellum) were suggested to be more crucial in determining swimming velocity. Additionally, sperm ability to remain and survive in the female storage organs may also influence fertilization success, so that optimal sperm morphology may rather maximize sperm longevity than velocity. In this study, we investigated how sperm morphology is related to sperm velocity and sperm longevity in the house sparrow Passer domesticus. Sperm velocity was found to be correlated with head/flagellum ratio. Sperm with small heads relative to their flagellum showed higher swimming velocity. Additionally, shorter sperm were found to live longer. Finally, we found sperm morphological traits to vary substantially within males and the head/flagellum ratio to be unrelated to total sperm length. We discuss the hypothesis that the substantial within-male variation in sperm morphology reflects a male strategy to produce a diversity of sperm from long, fast-swimming to short, long-living sperm to maximize their fertilization success in a context of sperm competition.

AB Alpine shrub- and grasslands are shaped by extreme climatic conditions such as a long-lasting snow cover and a short vegetation period. Such ecosystems are expected to be highly sensitive to global environmental change. Prolonged growing seasons and shifts in temperature and precipitation are likely to affect plant phenology and growth. In a unique experiment, climatology and plant growth was monitored for almost a decade at 17 snow meteorological stations in different alpine regions along the Swiss Alps. Regression analyses revealed highly significant correlations between mean air temperature in May/June and snow melt out, onset of plant growth, and plant height. These correlations were used to project plant growth phenology for future climate conditions based on the gridded output of a set of regional climate models runs. Melt out and onset of growth were projected to occur on average 17 days earlier by the end of the century than in the control period from 1971-2000 under the future climate conditions of the low resolution climate model ensemble. Plant height and biomass production were expected to increase by 77% and 45%, respectively. The earlier melt out and onset of growth will probably cause a considerable shift towards higher growing plants and thus increased biomass. Our results represent the first quantitative and spatially explicit estimates of climate change impacts on future growing season length and the respective productivity of alpine plant communities in the Swiss Alps.

AB Subarctic and arctic lakes are the focus of many paleolimnological studies, as they are still among the least impacted lakes by humans. Hence they provide an excellent setting for studies on long-term climatic variability without the overriding effects of direct anthropogenic perturbation. On the other hand, these ecosystems are highly vulnerable to even moderate anthropogenic influence like long-distance airborne transport of nutrients and pollutants. The paleolimnological studies conducted in these areas usually include a multitude of different proxies, but so far only few have used the green algal group of Pediastrum Meyen. These algae, however, preserve well in sediments and can be identified to species level, which lends them potential as a paleo-proxy. In this study we analysed the present Pediastrum assemblages from surface-sediments of 16 subarctic lakes in Finnish Lapland as well as bottom samples from the same sediment cores, which are "spot" samples from the recent past. We found a total of 14 Pediastrum taxa, five of which occurred at moderate to high relative abundances. The majority of the taxa showed distinct relationships to environmental variables measured. Of these, pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) explained most of the variance in the distribution of Pediastrum and generally summarised the main environmental gradients in our data set well. Five of the studied lakes lacked Pediastrum taxa altogether, and Pediastrum occurred at low abundances in four additional lakes. All of these nine lakes have extremely low nutrient concentrations and generally lowest pH and DOC in the data set and were defined by barren catchment areas and scarce lake macrophyte growth. According to a top-bottom analysis of sediment cores, the Pediastrum assemblages of the study lakes have changed moderately, suggesting changed environmental conditions in the lakes. Although these changes appear to be climate-related, more studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB The United States National Park Service was created to protect and make accessible to the public the nation's most precious natural resources and cultural features for present and future generations. However, this heritage is threatened by the invasion of non-native plants, animals, and pathogens. To evaluate the scope of invasions, the USNPS has inventoried non-native plant species in the 216 parks that have significant natural resources, documenting the identity of non-native species. We investigated relationships among non-native plant species richness, the number of threatened and endangered plant species, native species richness, latitude, elevation, park area and park corridors and vectors. Parks with many threatened and endangered plants and high native plant species richness also had high non-native plant species richness. Non-native plant species richness was correlated with number of visitors and kilometers of backcountry trails and rivers. In addition, this work reveals patterns that can be further explored empirically to understand the underlying mechanisms.

AB Integrative studies of genetics, neurobiology and behaviour indicate that polymorphism in specific genes contributes to variation observed in some complex social behaviours. The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin plays an important role in the regulation of a variety of social behaviours, including social attachment of males to females, through its action on the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). In socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), polymorphism in the length of microsatellite DNA within the regulatory region of the gene (avpr1a) encoding the V1aR predicts differences among males in neural expression of V1aRs and partner preference under laboratory conditions. However, understanding the extent to which V1aR mediates variation in prairie vole social and reproductive behaviour observed in nature requires investigating the consequences of avpr1a polymorphism and environmental influences under ecologically relevant conditions. We examined the relationship between avpr1a length polymorphism and monogamy among male prairie voles living in 0.1 ha enclosures during a time similar to their natural lifespan. We found no evidence that avpr1a genotype of males predicts variation in social monogamy measured in the field but some indices of social monogamy were affected by population density. Parentage data indicated that a male's avpr1a genotype significantly influenced the number of females with which he sired offspring and the total number of offspring sired. Total brain concentrations of V1aR mRNA were not associated with either male behaviour or avpr1a genotype. These data show that melding ecological field studies with neurogenetics can substantially augment our understanding of the effects of genes and environment on social behaviours.

ID BALANCE CLOSURE; NET ECOSYSTEM; FLUX; EXCHANGE; CARBON
AB The Penman-Monteith combination equation, which is most frequently used to derive the surface conductance to water vapour (G(s)), implicitly assumes the energy balance to be closed. Any energy imbalance (positive or negative) will thus affect the calculated G(s). Using eddy covariance energy flux data from a temperate grassland and a desert shrub ecosystem we explored five possible approaches of closing the energy imbalance and show that calculated G(s) may differ considerably between these five approaches depending on the relative magnitudes of sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the magnitude and sign of the energy imbalance. Based on our limited understanding of the nature of the energy imbalance, we tend to favour an approach which preserves the Bowen-ratio and closes the energy balance on a larger time scale.

AB The Great Lakes region of East Africa, including Lake Victoria, is the center of diversity of the mega-diverse cichlid fishes (Perciformes: Teleostei). Paleolimnological evidence indicates dramatic desiccation of this lake ca. 18,000-15,000 years ago. Consequently, the hundreds of extant endemic haplochromine species in the lake must have either evolved since then or refugia must have existed, within that lake basin or elsewhere, from which Lake Victoria was recolonized. We studied the population history of the Lake Victoria region superflock (LVRS) of haplochromine cichlids based on nuclear genetic analysis (12 microsatellite loci from 400 haplochomines) of populations from Lake Kivu, Lake Victoria, and the connected and surrounding rivers and lakes. Population genetic analyses confirmed that Lake Kivu haplochromines colonized Lake Victoria. Coalescent analyses show a 30- to 50-fold decline in the haplochromine populations of Lake Victoria, Lake Kivu, and the region ca. 18,000-15,000 years ago. We suggest that this coincides with drastic climatic and geological changes in the late Pleistocene. The most recent common ancestor of the Lake Victoria region haplochromines was estimated to have existed about 4.5 million years ago, which corresponds to the first radiation of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika and the origin of the tribe Haplochrominii. This relatively old evolutionary origin may explain the high levels of polymorphism still found in modern haplochromines. This degree of polymorphism might have acted as a "genetic reservoir'' that permitted the explosive radiation of hundreds of haplochromines and their array of contemporary adaptive morphologies.

AB Diversity is one major factor driving plant productivity in temperate grasslands. Although decomposers like earthworms are known to affect plant productivity, interacting effects of plant diversity and earthworms on plant productivity have been neglected in field studies. We investigated in the field the effects of earthworms on plant productivity, their interaction with plant species and functional group richness, and their effects on belowground plant competition. In the framework of the Jena Experiment we determined plant community productivity (in 2004 and 2007) and performance of two phytometer plant species [Centaurea jacea (herb) and Lolium perenne (grass); in 2007 and 2008] in a plant species (from one to 16) and functional group richness gradient (from one to four). We sampled earthworm subplots and subplots with decreased earthworm density and reduced aboveground competition of phytometer plants by removing the shoot biomass of the resident plant community. Earthworms increased total plant community productivity (+11%), legume shoot biomass (+35%) and shoot biomass of the phytometer C. jacea (+21%). Further, phytometer performance decreased, i.e. belowground competition increased, with increasing plant species and functional group richness. Although single plant functional groups benefited from higher earthworm numbers, the effects did not vary with plant species and functional group richness. The present study indicates that earthworms indeed affect the productivity of semi-natural grasslands irrespective of the diversity of the plant community. Belowground competition increased with increasing plant species diversity. However, belowground competition was modified by earthworms as reflected by increased productivity of the phytometer C. jacea. Moreover, particularly legumes benefited from earthworm presence. Considering also previous studies, we suggest that earthworms and legumes form a loose mutualistic relationship affecting essential ecosystem functions in temperate grasslands, in particular decomposition and plant productivity. Further, earthworms likely alter competitive interactions among plants and the structure of plant communities by beneficially affecting certain plant functional groups.

AB In many regions of the Iberian peninsula, wild ungulates have disappeared and wolves Canis lupus often depend on garbage dumps and domestic animals.This paper represents an example of wild ungulate preferences of the Iberian wolf Canis lupus signatus in an environment with no human-wildlife conficts, because wolves rarely predate on livestock. I studied the patterns of repy selection by the Iberian wolf during may 1998-October 2002 in north-western Spain, in an area which supports a diverse community of wild ungulates and in which also domestic ungulates are present, My analysis of 593 wolf scats showed that wild ungulates were consumed preferentially over other prey (i.e, domestic ungulates, carnivores and lagomorphs). Roe deer Capreolus capreolus was the most important prey species followed by red deer Cervus elaphus and wild boar Sus scrofa. Domestic ungulates were poorly represented in the wolf diet. Predation frequencies of domestic and wild ungulates varied seasonally and between years. This consumption of roe deer and wild boar increased during the birthing season, probably because of the higher vulnerability of newly born animals; wolves predate mainly on juvenile roe deer and wild boar.

AB Knowledge about the phylogenetic history, genetic variation and ecological requirements of a species is important for its conservation and management. Unfortunately, for many species this information is lacking. Here we use multiple approaches (phylogenetics, population genetics and ecological modelling) to evaluate the evolutionary history and conservation status of Capra walie, an endangered flagship species of wild goat endemic to Ethiopia. The analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b and Y-chromosome DNA sequences suggests that C. walie forms a monophyletic clade with Capra nubiana, but potentially has been isolated for up to 0.8 million years from this closely related species. Microsatellite DNA analyses show that C. walie has very low genetic variation (mean heterozygosity=0.35) compared with other endangered mammals. This reduced variation likely derives from a prolonged demographic decline and small effective population size. Ecological niche modelling using the bioclimatic features of habitats occupied by C. walie, suggests ecological differences between C. walie and C. nubiana, and identifies the areas most suitable for future reintroductions of C. walie. The genetic and bioclimatic data suggest that C. walie is distinct and requires immediate conservation actions including genetic monitoring and reintroductions to establish independent populations. This study illustrates how combining noninvasive sampling along with genetic and ecological (bioclimatic) approaches can help assess conservation status of poorly known species.

AB 1. Signals used during male combat are expected to be honest indicators of fighting ability. However, recent studies show that dishonesty in male signalling is more prevalent than previously believed.
   2. Here we show that regenerated (leptochelous) claws in male Uca mjoebergi fiddler crabs are not only dishonest signals of two types of whole-organism performance capacities that are likely to be useful during fights (claw closing force and pull-resisting force), but they are also less effective as weapons in situations where males are unable to bluff.
   3. Original (brachychelous) male claws are statistically significant predictors (independent of body size) of both closing force and the force required to pull a male out of a tunnel. By contrast, leptochelous claw size does not convey information on those performance capacities following control for body size.
   4. Furthermore, claw size affects fighting ability such that leptochelous residents are at a significant competitive disadvantage to brachychelous residents, although claw type does not affect the ability of non-resident males to win fights.
   5. This study is among the first to show that male armaments can dishonestly signal performance traits that are likely important for winning fights, and is the first to show evidence for dishonest signalling of multiple components of fighting ability.

AB Post-copulatory sexual selection (PCSS) is thought to be one of the evolutionary forces responsible for the rapid and divergent evolution of sperm design. However, whereas in some taxa particular sperm traits are positively associated with PCSS, in other taxa, these relationships are negative, and the causes of these different patterns across taxa are poorly understood. In a comparative study using New World blackbirds (Icteridae), we tested whether sperm design was influenced by the level of PCSS and found significant positive associations with the level of PCSS for all sperm components but head length. Additionally, whereas the absolute length of sperm components increased, their variation declined with the intensity of PCSS, indicating stabilising selection around an optimal sperm design. Given the diversity of, and strong selection on, sperm design, it seems likely that sperm phenotype may influence sperm velocity within species. However, in contrast to other recent studies of passerine birds, but consistent with several other studies, we found no significant link between sperm design and velocity, using four different species that vary both in sperm design and PCSS. Potential reasons for this discrepancy between studies are discussed.

AB Fire is an important control on the carbon (C) balance of the boreal forest region. Here, we present findings from two complementary studies that examine how fire modifies soil organic matter properties, and how these modifications influence rates of decomposition and C exchange in black spruce (Picea mariana) ecosystems of interior Alaska. First, we used laboratory incubations to explore soil temperature, moisture, and vegetation effects on CO2 and DOC production rates in burned and unburned soils from three study regions in interior Alaska. Second, at one of the study regions used in the incubation experiments, we conducted intensive field measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across an unreplicated factorial design of burning (2 year post-fire versus unburned sites) and drainage class (upland forest versus peatland sites). Our laboratory study showed that burning reduced the sensitivity of decomposition to increased temperature, most likely by inducing moisture or substrate quality limitations on decomposition rates. Burning also reduced the decomposability of Sphagnum-derived organic matter, increased the hydrophobicity of feather moss-derived organic matter, and increased the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in both the upland and peatland sites. At the ecosystem scale, our field measurements indicate that the surface organic soil was generally wetter in burned than in unburned sites, whereas soil temperature was not different between the burned and unburned sites. Analysis of variance results showed that ER varied with soil drainage class but not by burn status, averaging 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) d(-1) in the upland and peatland sites, respectively. However, a more complex general linear model showed that ER was controlled by an interaction between soil temperature, moisture, and burn status, and in general was less variable over time in the burned than in the unburned sites. Together, findings from these studies across different spatial scales suggest that although fire can create some soil climate conditions more conducive to rapid decomposition, rates of C release from soils may be constrained following fire by changes in moisture and/or substrate quality that impede rates of decomposition.

AB Research that connects the effects of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem services is lacking. Ants perform multifarious ecological functions that stabilize ecosystems and contribute to a number of ecosystem services. We studied responses of ant communities to urbanization in the Lake Tahoe basin by sampling sites along a gradient of urban land development. We sampled ant communities, measured vegetation characteristics, quantified human activities, and evaluated ant-community responses by grouping ants into service-providing units (SPUs), defined as a group of organisms and their populations that perform specific ecosystem services, to provide an understanding of urbanization impacts on biodiversity and their delivery of ecosystem services. Species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate levels of urban development, as did the richness of 3 types of ant SPUs (aerators, decomposers, and compilers). With increasing land development aerator and decomposer ants significantly declined in abundance, whereas compiler ants significantly increased in abundance. Competing models demonstrated that precipitation was frequently among the strongest influences on ant community structure; however, urban development and human activities also had a strong, negative influence on ants, appearing in most models with Delta AIC(c) < 2 for species richness and abundance patterns of SPUs and generalists. Response diversity was observed within SPUs, which suggests that the corresponding ecosystem services were maintained until development reached 30-40%. Our data provide evidence that ecosystem functions, such as water infiltration and soil productivity, may be diminished at sites subject to greater levels of urbanization and that conserving ant communities and the ecosystem services they provide could be an important target in land-use planning and conservation efforts.

AB Anthropogenic change such as road construction and subsequent traffic noise in pristine habitats has been shown to be detrimental to a range of vertebrate taxa. The effect of anthropogenic noise on anuran communication is not well known, and has only recently been a topic of investigation. We tested the effect of anthropogenic noise on the calling behaviour of the Amazonian treefrog Dendropsophus triangulum. We performed four experiments. We first presented frogs with the noise of a pre-recorded motorcycle engine, and recorded the call rates of focal frogs for 5 min, then for another 5 min during which they were presented with a broadcast of noise, and again for 5 min post-stimulus. We repeated this experiment using music as the stimulus. We then tested the effect of intermittent engine noise, recording baseline call rate and response to six cycles of intermittent noise. In all experiments, call rates nearly doubled during playbacks. Finally, we compared frogs' responses to anthropogenic noise to responses to chorus noise broadcast at the same intensity; call rates did not differ between treatments. These results demonstrate a clear effect of exogenous noise on male D. triangulum.

AB The occupancy probability of 35 large-bodied bird and mammal species was examined in relation to patch- and landscape-scale habitat and disturbance variables in 147 forest patches distributed throughout the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula. Occupancy was assessed on the basis of interviews with local informants. The most important predictors of vertebrate species richness, composition, and patch occupancy were human population density and the extent and quality of forest cover. Most forest species responded positively to forest extent, while felids in particular were sensitive to human population density. However, the effects of human density on patch occupancy operated at extremely local scales. Effects were stronger at a smaller grain size, offering optimistic prospects for conservation strategies that incorporate human population effects. Three arboreal frugivores (Ateles geoffroyi, Alouatta pigra, and Ramphastos sulfuratus) were strongly associated with total basal area of trees bearing fleshy fruits. The degree of hunting pressure was not related to human population density, and affected the occupancy probability of three game species, two of which (Mazama spp., Crax rubra) are among the most preferred prey across the Yucatan Peninsula. Levels of patch occupancy across this region varied considerably among species, and were best explained by body size and degree of forest habitat specificity, large-bodied species and habitat specialists being the most vulnerable. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the conservation potential of large vertebrates in Mesoamerica and identifies disturbance-sensitive species. This can inform regional-scale conservation planning at a time when low deforestation in parts of the Yucatan Peninsula still provides a narrow window of conservation opportunity given the rapid human population growth.

AB Diatom floras were examined from geothermal environments in three contrasting tectonic settings. These included subduction-related acid and alkaline springs in New Zealand; alkaline springs along a divergent plate boundary on Iceland; and alkaline springs in the Kenya Rift. These shallow (< 1 cm) aquatic environments vary considerably (e.g., temperature: 21.3-99 degrees C; pH: 2.1-9.65; 56.41-643 mg l(-1) SiO(2)). Diatoms form an important component of geothermal floras at temperatures of < 45 degrees C. The floras from New Zealand are distinguished by the common occurrence of Pinnularia. Icelandic springs have a variety of Fragilariaceae. Navicula and Anomoeoneis are most common in the Kenyan springs. Statistical analyses suggest that the diatoms cluster into seven major groups. The most common taxa include: Achnanthidium exiguum v. heterovalvum (Kras.) Czarn., Anomoeoneis sphaerophora (Ehrenb.) Pfitz, Brachysira brebissonii f. thermalis Grun., Caloneis bacillum (Grun.) Cl., Craticula cuspidata (Kutz.) Mann, Diadesmis confervacea Kutz., Epithemia argus (Ehrenb.) Kutz., Frustulia rhomboides (Ehrenb.) DeT., Hantzschia amphioxys (Ehrenb.)

Mull., Staurosira construens v. venter (Ehrenb.) Ham., Staurosira elliptica (Schum.) Will. & Round, and Staurosirella pinnata (Ehrenb.) Will. & Round. Canonical correspondence analysis shows clear correlations between species, alkalinity, pH, and conductivity, with less strong correlations for silica and temperature. Other factors include substrate type, current velocity, and light conditions. The preservation potential of host deposits varies considerably, being lowest for springs on clastic deltas and highest where travertine or sinter is accumulating.

AB There have been several attempts to build a unified framework for macroecological patterns. However, these have mostly been based either on questionable assumptions or have had to be parameterized to obtain realistic predictions. Here, we propose a new model explicitly considering patterns of aggregated species distributions on multiple spatial scales, the property which lies behind all spatial macroecological patterns, using the idea we term 'generalized fractals'. Species' spatial distributions were modelled by a random hierarchical process in which the original 'habitat' patches were randomly replaced by sets of smaller patches nested within them, and the statistical properties of modelled species assemblages were compared with macroecological patterns in observed bird data. Without parameterization based on observed patterns, this simple model predicts realistic patterns of species abundance, distribution and diversity, including fractal-like spatial distributions, the frequency distribution of species occupancies/abundances and the species-area relationship. Although observed macroecological patterns may differ in some quantitative properties, our concept of random hierarchical aggregation can be considered as an appropriate null model of fundamental macroecological patterns which can potentially be modified to accommodate ecologically important variables.

TI Ecological implications of the presence of the tube-building polychaete
   Lanice conchilega on soft-bottom benthic ecosystems
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HYDRODYNAMIC PROCESSES; NORTH-SEA; SEDIMENT; PALLAS; DIVERSITY
AB The common tube-building polychaete Lanice conchilega is known as a habitat structuring species and can form dense aggregations. The effects of L. conchilega on the surrounding benthic community have received little attention, especially in subtidal areas. Therefore, the presence of L. conchilega in different habitats in the North Sea and its effect on the abundance, species richness, diversity and community structure in these habitats are evaluated in the present paper, based on data from the ICES North Sea Benthos Survey of 2000. Lanice conchilega has a wide geographical distribution and a low habitat specialization, but optimally occurs in shallow fine sands. In the present study, the presence of L. conchilega resulted in a density increase and a significant (positive) correlation of the benthos density with the density of L. conchilega. Furthermore, the species richness (number of species) increased with increasing density of L. conchilega. This trend was, however, not consistent: the number of species reached more or less an asymptotic value or even decreased after reaching a critical density of L. conchilega (> 500-1,000 ind/m(2)), as observed in shallow fine sands. The same overall pattern was detected concerning the expected number of species. The N-1-diversity index showed similar or slightly higher values in L. conchilega patches compared to patches without L. conchilega. From the results of the community analysis, it can be concluded that the species, which were responsible for the increase of the diversity, belonged to the overall species-pool of that habitat. The effects on density and diversity differed between the four discerned habitats (shallow muddy sand, shallow fine sand, shallow medium sand and deep fine sand), and were most pronounced in shallow fine sands. These patterns can be attributed to the habitat structuring capacity of L. conchilega. The mechanisms responsible for the increase of the habitat quality in patches of L. conchilega can be summarized as (1) changes in the hydrodynamics, (2) increases of the habitat stability and oxygen supply, and (3) a creation of habitat heterogeneity in a uniform environment. In this way, L. conchilega alters the habitat characteristics and affects other organisms, and can therefore even be considered as an ecosystem engineer. In other words, L. conchilega patches are responsible for an increased habitat quality in an otherwise uniform habitat, which results in a higher survival of the surrounding benthic species.

AB Soil fungi couple plant and ecosystem resource demands to pools of soil resources. Research on these organisms is needed to predict how rising atmospheric CO2 will influence forest ecosystem processes and soil carbon (C) sequestration potential. We examined the influence of free-air-CO2-enrichment (FACE) on mycorrhizal and extraradical rhizomorph dynamics over a 5-year period in a loblolly pine forest using minirhizotrons. Standing crop of mycorrhizal root tips varied greatly spatially and through time. Summed across all years, CO2 enrichment increased mycorrhizal root tip production by 194% in deep soil (15-30 cm) but did not influence mycorrhizal production in shallow soil (0-15 cm). Production and mortality of soil rhizomorph length was 27% and 25% greater in CO2-enriched plots compared with controls over a 5-year period beginning in January of 2000 and running through autumn 2004. Effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on longevity of mycorrhizal root tips and rhizomorphs varied with soil depth (mycorrhizae and rhizomorphs) and with diameter (rhizomorphs). For instance, survival of mycorrhizal tips was reduced in CO2-enriched plots in deep soil (15-30 cm depth) but was increased in shallower soil (0-15 cm). Rhizomorph turnover was accelerated in shallow soil but effects on survivorship in deep soil varied according to diameter. A drought in 2002 coupled with loss of leaf area to an ice storm late in 2002 were followed by reductions in rhizomorph and mycorrhizal production, increases in mortality, and decreases in standing crop during 2003 and 2004. These effects tended to be more severe in CO2-enriched plots. Positive effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on mycorrhizal fungi, primarily observed in deeper soil, are probably contributing to the prolonged stimulation of NPP by CO2 enrichment at the Duke FACE study site.

AB The extent of soil microbial diversity in agricultural soils is critical to the maintenance of soil health and quality. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of land use intensification on soil microbial diversity and thus the level of soil suppressiveness of cucumber Fusarium wilt. We examined three typical microbial populations, Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Fuasarium oxysporum, and bacterial functional diversity in soils from three different land use types in China's Yangtze River Delta, and related those to suppressiveness of cucumber Fusarium wilt. The land use types were a traditional rice wheat (or rape) rotation land, an open field vegetable land, and a polytunnel greenhouse vegetable land that had been transformed from the above two land use types since 1995. Results generated from the field soils showed similar counts for Bacillus spp. (log 5.87-6.01 CFU g(-1) dw soil) among the three soils of different land use types, significantly lower counts for Pseudomonas spp. (log 5.44 CFU g(-1) dw soil) in the polytunnel greenhouse vegetable land whilst significantly lower counts for Fusarium oxysporum (log 3.21 CFU g(-1) dw soil) in the traditional rice wheat (or rape) rotation land. A significant lower dehydrogenase activity (33.56 mg TPF kg(-1) dw day(-1)) was observed in the polytunnel greenhouse vegetable land. Community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of the bacterial communities in soils showed that the average well color development (AWCD) and three functional diversity indices of Shannon index (H'), Simpson index (D) and McIntosh index (U) at 96 h incubation in BIOLOG Eco Micro plates were significantly lower in the polytunnel greenhouse vegetable land than in both the traditional rice wheat (or rape) rotation land and the open field vegetable land. A further greenhouse experiment with the air-dried and sieved soils displayed significantly lower plant growth parameters of 10-old cucumber seedlings as well as significantly lower biomass and total fresh fruit yield at the end of harvesting at day 70 in the polytunnel greenhouse vegetable soil sources. The percentages of Fusarium wilt plant death were greatly increased in the polytunnel greenhouse vegetable plants, irrespective of being inoculated with or without Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. Our results could provide a better understanding of the effects of land use intensification on soil microbial population and functional diversity as well as the level of soil suppressiveness of cucumber Fusarium wilt.

AB This study aimed to determine factors that influence the detection of DNA of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in the gut contents of arthropod predators when the polymerase chain reaction is used to amplify a diagnostic fragment of the gene coding for cytochrome oxidase subunit I. The effects of temperature, time since feeding, subsequent food intake, sex, weight, and species of predator on prey detectability were studied in the laboratory. Three types of predator were studied: the spider Venator spenceri Hogg. (Araneae: Lycosidae), a bug with sucking mouthparts, Nabis kinbergii (Reuter) (Heteroptera: Nabidae), and a coccinellid with chewing mouthparts, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In all experiments, the detectability of prey DNA was negatively correlated with time post-feeding. The duration of detectability differed among the predator species. The time calculated for median detection success at 20 degrees C ranged from 49.6 h in V. spenceri to 36.1 h in N. kinbergii and 17.1 h in H. variegata. In H. variegata, but not in V. spenceri, the rate of detection decreased with increasing temperature. Subsequent food intake did not affect the detectability of DNA of P. xylostella in V. spenceri. In H. variegata, sex and weight of the predator did not influence detection of prey DNA. In addition, this study uncovered potential sources of error caused by detection of prey DNA following secondary cannibalistic and intraguild predation. The results provide essential information for the interpretation of prey detection data from field-collected predators' gut contents.

AB To be used as honest signals of quality, phenotypic traits must vary markedly within populations and show repeatable differences between individuals. Eastern kingbirds, Tyrannus tyrannus, sing a distinctive dawn song in the predawn darkness, and one hypothesis for its function is that it serves as an honest signal of male quality that females use during choice of within- pair or extrapair mates. Over a 2- year period, we quanti. ed dawn songs of males to measure between- and within- season repeatability of the timing ( start and end time) and length of song bouts, and song rate. We also measured morphological characters to measure repeatability and describe individual differences in body size and plumage quality. All song traits varied considerably among males, start time and song rates were repeatable between years, and all song rates were repeatable within both years. All morphological characters were significantly repeatable between years. Moreover, early singing males were larger and had relatively long flight feathers, and males that sang at high rates had relatively long flight feathers. Early singing males were also paired to the earliest breeding females, and in one year, male song rate was positively correlated with their social mate's clutch size. Relatively long. flight feathers in other species are typical of older males and individuals of higher body condition, suggesting that, despite being suboscine passerines with relatively simple and innate songs, eastern kingbirds use song performance as an honest signal of male quality that females may use during mate choice.

AB Salt marshes are interesting and endangered ecosystems in West-Europe. Nevertheless, their arthropod fauna remains largely unknown and the factors determining assemblages at micro-habitat scale are poorly understood. Few data are also available about the effects of management measures in salt marshes and how to monitor them. The aim of the present study is to determine the major factors structuring two dominant communities of arthropods, spider and ground beetles, in natural, managed (cutting and sheep grazing) and invaded (by the grass Elymus athericus) salt marshes. The two taxa were studied during 2002 and 2003 in different salt marshes of the Mont Saint-Michel Bay (NW France) by pitfall traps and hand-collecting. A total of 12350 spiders (57 species) and 16355 ground beetles (35 species) were caught during the study and analysed with respect to effects of the salinity gradient and of habitat structure characteristics. Spiders and ground beetles reacted differently to environmental factors in salt marshes. Spiders could more easily cope with salinity and their presence/absence was less related to the salinity than that of ground beetles. For ground beetles, there were few other community-structuring environmental factors and these were only related the edaphic environment: species restricted to open habitats, significant effects of moisture content and salinity revealed by CCA. Because they are likely to bring complementary information on abiotic factors, we finally suggest using both spiders and ground beetles for monitoring the effects of management practices in salt marshes.

AB The distinctness, uniformity and stability (DUS) requirements involve expensive, space- and time-consuming measurements of morphological traits. Moreover, for a majority of traits, interactions between genotype and environment complicate the evaluation. Molecular markers have a potential to facilitate this procedure, increase the reliability of decisions, and substantially save the time and space needed for experiments. We chose 25 varieties of pea (Pisum sativum L.) from the list of recommended varieties for cultivation in the Czech Republic, and made both a standard classification by 12 morphological descriptors and a classification by biochemical-molecular markers. Two isozyme systems, 10 microsatellite loci, 2 retrotransposons for multilocus inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP), and 12 retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism (RBIP) DNA markers were analysed. The main objective of the study was to examine the potential of each method for discrimination between pea varieties. The results demonstrate a high potential and resolving power of DNA-based methods. Superior in terms of high information content and discrimination power were SSR markers, owing to high allelic variation, which was the only biochemical-molecular method allowing clear identification of all varieties. Retrotransposon markers in RBIP format proved to be the most robust and easy to score method, while multilocus IRAP produced informative fingerprint already in a single analysis. Isozyme analysis offered a fast and less expensive alternative. The results showed that molecular identification could be used to assess distinctness and complement morphological assessment, especially in cases where the time frame plays an important role. Currently developed pea marker systems might serve also for germplasm management and genetic diversity studies.

TI Regeneration of treeline birch (Betula utilis D. don) forest in a

LA English
DT Article
ID RECRUITMENT; GAPS
AB Distribution and community structure of treeline birch (Betula utilis D. Don) forest in a trans-Himalayan dry valley was studied in Manang (central Nepal) with the major focus on regeneration. Along 5 vertical transects, a total of 41 square quadrats (10 m x 10 m) were sampled to determine the importance value index (IVI) of tree species, distribution pattern of seedlings and saplings, and soil attributes. Regeneration was assessed by a density-diameter curve. Moisture plays an important role in spatial (horizontal) distribution of Betula utilis. Pure Betula forest forming the treeline was mature, with high basal area (2.3%), but mixed Betula forest at lower elevations was young. This might have developed after large-scale clear cutting of Abies spectabilis. If not severely disturbed, mixed Betula forest may be replaced by Abies spectabilis. In general, Betula utilis was regenerating, as evident from a reverse J-shaped density-diameter curve for both forests. However, the distribution of seedlings and saplings was spatially heterogeneous and appeared to depend on canopy cover. The stands with highest seedling and sapling densities of Betula utilis had no trees. Betula seedlings were absent where the tree density and basal area (BA) exceeded 20 stems/100 m(2) and 1.0% respectively. It was apparent that Betula seedlings could not establish under their own closed canopy even if they produced viable seeds. Partial canopy opening may induce seedling establishment and hence continuous regeneration of Betula utilis at mature stands. The treeline formed by Betula utilis was abrupt-the anthropozoogenic type-without the krummholz zone.

AB To investigate forces influencing diversification in Neotropical fishes, the phylogenetic relationships among species and populations of the cichlid genus Cichla were examined. Mitochondrial DNA was sequenced for 454 individuals of the 5 nominal Cichla species and several putative undescribed species. Phylogenetic analyses support the distinction of two major clades of Cichla. Clade A includes C. temensis and two undescribed species from the lower Amazonas and Xingu Rivers. Clade B includes C. orinocensis, C monoculus, C ocellaris. C, intermedia, and an undescribed species from the upper Madeira River. Species boundaries were relatively well-circumscribed for clade B, while incomplete lineage sorting was inferred for clade A. Three probable instances of introgression were observed, including a regional population of C orinocensis from the Negro River that shows a history of introgression. Biogeographic patterns from Cichla are partially congruent with those seen in several other Neotropical fish clades, and the diversification of Cichla species is inferred to result from both vicariance and sympatric divergence.

AB Cavity nesters may either reuse an old cavity or excavate a new one. Nest reuse among cavity nesting birds has been considered traditionally to be a characteristic of weak excavators that lack nest sites and to be a strong force in the evolution of life history traits such as clutch size. We develop a simple model to examine factors that may favour one or the other nesting strategy, assuming a trade off between investment in excavation of a new hole and investment in offspring. Consistent with time and energy costs of excavation, male northern flickers Colaptes auratus that excavated were in better body condition than those that reused cavities, and a greater proportion of second nests were in reused holes. Data for other facultative excavators including woodpeckers, nuthatches and chickadees revealed a general pattern of earlier laying dates and larger clutches in reused compared to freshly excavated holes. We suggest that nest reuse is motivated by multiple causes, but may often be adaptive by offering time and energy savings.

AB Extinction risk is not evenly distributed among all species. Therefore, identifying shared characteristics of species that have shown serious population declines and range contractions can help to predict which types of species are likely to be vulnerable to extinction. The present study investigates ecological and life-history traits related to range contractions among breeding birds in Japan. Recent changes in nationwide distribution of each species were estimated using data from distributional surveys of breeding area in Japanese birds (1978 and 1998-2002). The Phylogenetic generalised least squares model revealed that the species with the following five traits have experienced particularly severe range contractions: medium body size, low annual productivity, solitary breeding, occurrence on farmland, and long-distance migration. Earlier theoretical studies have revealed that species with medium body sizes and low annual productivities are vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Thus, results from the present study, which showed a decline in species with those two traits, may be indicating that habitat loss and fragmentation play an important role in range contractions in Japanese birds too. Whether, and through which mechanisms, coloniality reduces extinction risks of populations remains to be investigated. A large number of studies, mainly in Europe, have revealed the mechanisms behind the declines in farmland birds and long-distance migrants. In Japan, however, few studies have explored the processes through which such species decline. Direct causes of population declines in species sharing traits associated with range contractions need to be investigated urgently so that appropriate conservation measures can be taken.

AB The aim of this study was to provide an analysis of vegetation and environment relationships in the Alxa Plateau of Inner Mongolia, China. Seventy species representing 46 genera and 16 families were collected. The largest families were Leguminosae, Polygonaceae, Gramineae and Compositae, representing 20.0%, 15.7%, 14.3% and 14.3% of the total flora, respectively. Phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes were the most abundant life-form. Classification of the vegetation was analysed using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) techniques. This resulted in the recognition of six vegetation groups, each of definite vegetation and soil characteristics, which could be linked to a specific geomorphologic unit. Ordination techniques as detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to examine the relationship between the vegetation and environmental parameters. Analysis with DCA gave results similar to CCA, suggesting that there is a relatively strong correspondence between vegetation and environmental factors. CCA axis 1 was highly associated with organic matter, total nitrogen, silt and clay content, elevation, Kira moisture index and relative humidity, while CCA axis 2 showed significant correlation with chlorine, calcium ion, magnesium ion and electrolytic conductivity. These gradients were related closely to the first two canonical axes, and accounted for 60% of the species-environment relationship in the study sites. Understanding relationships between environmental variables and vegetation distribution in this area helps us to apply these findings in management, reclamation, and development of arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems.

AB Mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus) are nocturnal primates endemic to the island of Madagascar. Until recently, they were classified as two species, one from eastern and one from western Madagascar. Previously published analyses of morphometric and mitochondrial DNA data show strong support for the recognition of more than eight species, however. Here, we test the eight-species hypothesis with DNA data derived from four independently segregating nuclear loci. We find many areas of congruence between the mitochondrial and nuclear data, but incomplete lineage sorting and low mutation rates limit the phylogenetic resolution of the nuclear data. Even so, the nuclear loci unanimously find evidence for three deeply diverged lineages within the mouse lemur radiation: one that is congruent with the mtDNA "southern clade", another that is congruent with the mtDNA "northern clade", and one monospecific branch comprised of the species Microcebus ravelobensis. The latter result in particular emphasizes the need for careful biological study of this species. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Different functional groups of beetles are likely to exhibit different responses to forest management and it is essential that we gain knowledge on these responses to understand and minimize the negative impacts of forestry in boreal ecosystems. In a large-scale manipulative experiment in nine sites (including 27 stands) in northern Sweden, we tested how saproxylic beetles, fire-favoured beetles and functional groups of beetles were affected by log treatment (shaded, burnt and fungi inoculated logs) and stand type (clear-cuts, mature managed and old-growth stands). All sites included one clear-cut, one mature managed stand and one old-growth stand, which give in total 27 stands. Fresh logs were placed out in the stands and exposed to different treatments. Insects were caught in eclector traps attached to the experimental logs. Log treatment, stand type and their interactions affected abundance, species richness and assemblages of saproxylic beetles, fire-favoured beetles and functional groups of beetles. Cambium consumers were less abundant on burnt logs compared with control logs. Furthermore, the assemblage composition differed between burnt logs and control logs for fire-favoured species and cambium consumers. On the clear-cuts burnt logs hosted lower abundance of all saproxylic beetles and fire-favoured species. For predators, the assemblage composition differed between burnt logs and control logs on clear-cuts. Shaded logs hosted lower abundance of wood borers compared to control logs. Shaded logs also supported different assemblages of saproxylic beetles and predators compared with the control logs on clear cuts. The effect of stand type was stronger than the effect of log treatment and for most of the examined groups; the clear-cuts differed from the mature managed and old-growth stands, while few differences was detected between mature managed and old-growth stands. The results indicate that in an area with intense forestry, both old-growth forest reserves and the creation of suitable substrates in managed forests are needed to conserve functionally intact beetle assemblages.

AB [ 1] The current latitudinal gradient in biomass suggests a climate-driven limitation of biomass in high latitudes. Understanding of the underlying processes, and quantification of their relative importance, is required to assess the potential carbon uptake of the biosphere in response to anticipated warming and related changes in tree growth and forest extent in these regions. We analyze the hydrological effects of thawing and freezing of soil on vegetation carbon density (VCD) in permafrost-dominated regions of Siberia using a process-based biogeochemistry-biogeography model, the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM). The analysis is based on spatially explicit simulations of coupled daily thaw depth, site hydrology, vegetation distribution, and carbon fluxes influencing VCD subject to climate, soil texture, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. LPJ represents the observed high spring peak of runoff of large Arctic rivers, and simulates a realistic fire return interval of 100 to 200 years in Siberia. The simulated VCD changeover from taiga to tundra is comparable to inventory-based information. Without the consideration of freeze-thaw processes VCD would be overestimated by a factor of 2 in southern taiga to a factor of 5 in northern forest tundra, mainly because available soil water would be overestimated with major effects on fire occurrence and net primary productivity. This suggests that forest growth in high latitudes is not only limited by temperature, radiation, and nutrient availability but also by the availability of liquid soil water.

AB Question: What are the edge effect responses of epiphytic lichen communities in Mediterranean Quercus pyrenaica forest?
   Location: Central Spain.
   Methods: We established ten transects perpendicular to a road dissecting a well conserved remnant of Q. pyrenaica forest into two sections. Transects extended from the forest/road edge to 100 m into the forest. Data were collected from seven plots in each transect at different distances from the edge. Variables were grouped into stand scale variables (distance to edge, number of trees per plot, mean diameter per plot, irradiance) and tree scale variables (diameter and height of sampled trees, aspect of the sampled square and relative height of the square). We used General Mixed Linear Models and constrained ordination techniques to test the hypothesis that the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of light and water controls the occurrence of lichens and bryophytes along the edge-interior gradient in the Q. pyrenaica forest.
   Results: Microclimatic parameters vary in a non-linear way; edge and interior stands showed the most divergent and extreme values. Although the micro-environment within Mediterranean forests is heterogeneous, interior conditions are apparently suitable for the performance of some specific forest epiphytes. Consequently, species richness does not show significant differences along the gradient. Total epiphytic cover increases towards the forest interior, but distance to the edge together with other predictors at the tree scale (aspect and height of the square) are the most relevant predictors for the composition and structure of these communities.
   Conclusions: Composition and structure of epiphytic communities in a Mediterranean semi-deciduous forest are affected by the edge between the forest and the road constructed. Since some extremely rare lichens only occur at interior stands, the conservation of these threatened elements requires urgent conservation measures because well preserved and unmanaged forests in the Mediterranean region are very rare.

AB 1. Introduced plant species modify the environment and alter ecological interactions in communities, often to the detriment of native fauna, but the causes driving negative effects on fauna are rarely examined. We used native Australian scincid lizards Carlia munda and Carlia pectoralis and the introduced weed rubber vine Cryptostegia grandiflora as a model system to determine the possible underlying mechanisms driving habitat selection by native fauna in an environment invaded by weeds.
   2. Lizards were allowed to select between rubber vine and native eucalypt leaf litter in semi-natural enclosures. To determine the mechanisms of habitat preference, we examined differences in temperature, prey (arthropod) availability and composition, and leaf shape of naturally occurring rubber vine and native vegetation.
   3. Lizards discriminated between leaf litter types: 85% of Carlia pectoralis and 80% of Carlia munda chose native leaf litter over rubber vine, clearly indicating a preference for native habitat.
   4. In the field, rubber vine leaf litter was cooler at the surface than native leaf litter, and during peak lizard activity was below the temperature range of Carlia. Rubber vine also contained significantly fewer arthropod taxa and a significantly different composition of arthropod taxa, with fewer preferred prey items of Carlia than native vegetation.
   5. Finally, rubber vine leaves were significantly shorter than native leaves and the lizards themselves. The shape of rubber vine leaves was different from that of the lizards, potentially making the lizards more obvious on rubber vine litter. This may increase the susceptibility of the lizards to detection by predators.
   6. Synthesis and applications. In comparison with native habitat, rubber vine provided a suboptimal environment for litter-dwelling lizards because of the lower ambient temperatures, reduced availability of prey and a reduction in camouflage from predators (dissimilar leaf and lizard shapes). Our study has identified three possible mechanisms by which an introduced plant species can alter the availability of resources in an environment, making it less attractive to native fauna. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how alien plants alter the environment and further emphasize the critical need for management of plants that replace native habitat with a suboptimal environment.

AB The extent of diversity within closely related taxa may be a function of their shared evolutionary history or of selective forces causing adaptive changes. Examining variation among taxa within a single genus may help to identify flexibility in trait variation because recently diverged populations are more likely living in the environment of adaptation. This study examines correlates of diversity in Eulemur, a genus that has a wide distribution in a variety of habitat types throughout Madagascar. Previously published data were gathered from 11 long-term studies of Eulemur populations. Variables were categorized into multiple datasets: (1) environmental characteristics, (2) social organization, and (3) ecology, which included subsets for ranging behavior, diet, and activity budget. Molecular phylogenies from the literature were used to create the fourth and final dataset, a dissimilarity matrix of evolutionary distance among the 12 species and subspecies. Principal components and cluster analyses were implemented to examine the overall ecological similarity among Eulemur populations and to determine which variables contribute most to the variation among taxa. Partial Mantel tests were conducted to test for correlations among the dataset matrices. The results suggest ecological flexibility for the genus, in particular, populations in similar environments displayed similar activity patterns. In contrast, social organization showed no relationship with environment but was correlated with phylogenetic distance among populations. While Eulemur seems to demonstrate some flexibility for ecological adaptations, characteristics related to group size and sex ratio more closely track phylogeny and thus may be less flexible.

AB Benthic foraminifera were investigated from 20 grab samples collected from a large marine embayment, Disko Bugt, along the west Greenland margin. Agglutinated and calcareous foraminifera were found throughout Disko Bugt, with agglutinated species dominating 19 out of the 20 samples. The most common species are Adercotryma glomerata, Spiroplectammina biformis, Textularia earlandi, Cribrostomoides crassimargo and Reophax fusiformis. Six faunal assemblage zones were identified from cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis. The relationship between the foraminifera and environmental variables was investigated using canonical correspondence analysis. From this analysis, bottom water salinity and water depth were identified as the most important environmental variables explaining the foraminiferal assemblages. This result suggests water mass characteristics in Disko Bugt are an important control on the benthic foraminiferal assemblage zones. Where the warm and saline West Greenland Current water mass impinges on the seafloor, the assemblage is dominated by A. glomerata, T. earlandi, R. fusiformis and Reophax pilulifer. Sites with the cold, lower salinity Polar Water mass at the seafloor are dominated by S. biformis and A. glomerata, with common Cuneata aretica and C crassimargo. In shallow locations with a relatively warm and low salinity surface water mass and coarse sediments the fauna is dominated by Cibicides lobatulus. In similar hydrographic locations with fine-grained sediments a mixed faunal assemblage dominated by Ammoscalaria pseudospiralis and Eggerella advena is found.

AB While the importance of spatial scale in ecology is well established, few studies have investigated the impact of data grain on conservation planning outcomes. In this study, we compared species richness hotspot and representation networks developed at five grain sizes. We used species distribution maps for mammals and birds developed by the Arizona and. New Mexico Gap Analysis Programs (GAP) to produce 1-km(2), 100-km(2) 625-km(2), 2500-km(2), and 10000-km(2) grid cell resolution distribution maps. We used these distribution maps to generate species richness and hotspot (95th quantile) maps for each taxon in each state. Species composition information at each grain size was used to develop two types of representation networks using the reserve selection software MARXAN. Reserve selection analyses were restricted to Arizona birds due to considerable computation requirements. We used MARXAN to create best reserve networks based on the minimum area required to represent each species at least once and equal area networks based on irreplaceability values. We also measured the median area of each species' distribution included in hotspot (mammals and birds of Arizona and New Mexico) and irreplaceability (Arizona birds) networks across all species.
   Mean area overlap between richness hotspot reserves identified at the five grain sizes was 29% (grand mean for four within-taxon/state comparisons), mean overlap for irreplaceability reserve networks was 32%, and mean overlap for best reserve networks was 53%. Hotspots for mammals and birds showed low overlap with a mean of 30%. Comparison of hotspots and irreplaceability networks showed very low overlap with a mean of 13%. For hotspots; median species distribution area protected within reserves declined monotonically from a high of 11% for 1-km(2) networks down to 6% for 10000-km(2) networks. Irreplaceability networks showed a similar, but more variable, pattern of decline.
   This work clearly shows that map resolution has a profound effect on conservation planning outcomes and that hotspot and representation outcomes may be strikingly dissimilar. Thus, conservation planning is scale dependent, such that reserves developed using coarse-grained data do not subsume fine-grained reserves. Moreover, preserving both full species representation and species rich areas may require combined reserve design strategies.

AB We tested the relative vulnerability of islands to Oxalis pes-caprae L. invasion compared to mainland regions. Oxalis pes-caprae is a South African annual geophyte that reproduces via bulbils, and has spread in many Mediterranean and temperate regions of the world where introduced. Our study is one of the first detailed regional analyses of the occurrence and local abundance of a non-native plant.
   We conducted an extensive survey (2000 sampling points) to examine local and coarse-scale patterns in both the occurrence and abundance of O. pes-caprae on islands and in neighbouring mainland regions of Spain.
   We analysed occurrence (number of samples where present) and abundance (percentage cover) on two Balearic Islands (Menorca and Mallorca) and in two mainland administrative provinces of Spain (Murcia and Valencia).
   Oxalis pes-caprae occurrence was consistently higher on islands. Occurrence varied among habitats, being the highest in tree groves and the lowest in forests and shrublands. It was never found in these two habitats on the mainland. Mean O. pes-caprae abundance was greatest in tree groves on the mainland, and in field margins and old fields on the islands. However, in general there were not significant differences in local abundances between island and mainland locations.
   These findings suggest that local processes (such as the biotic resistance of plant communities) are less important than coarse-scale phenomena (such as environmental driving forces) in explaining differences in the invasion patterns observed between islands and adjacent mainland regions. We suggest that O. pes-caprae has occupied a larger proportion of available habitats on islands due to: (1) its strong dependence on domestic animal and human-mediated dispersal which are probably greater on the islands than in mainland areas, and (2) the smaller area encompassed by islands that, over a comparable period of time, enables a greater proportion of available habitats to be colonized (and hence higher occurrence) than equivalent larger mainland areas.

AB In natural plant populations, fine-scale spatial genetic structure can result from limited gene flow, selection pressures or historical events, but the role of each factor is in general hard to discern. One way to investigate the origination of spatial genetic structure within a plant population consists of comparing spatial genetic structure among different life history stages. In this study, spatial genetic structure of the food-deceptive orchid Orchis purpurea was determined across life history stages in two populations that were regenerating after many years of population decline. Based on demographic analyses (2001-2004), we distinguished between recruits and adult plants. For both sites, there was no difference in the proportion of polymorphic loci and expected heterozygosity between life history stages. However, spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that spatial genetic structure increased in magnitude with life history stage. Weak or no spatial genetic structure was observed for recruits, whereas adult plants showed a pattern that is consistent with that found in other species with a predominantly outcrossing mating system. The observed differences between seedlings and adults are probably a consequence of changes in management of the two study sites and associated demographic changes in both populations. Our results illustrate that recurrent population crashes and recovery may strongly affect genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure of plant populations.

AB The size dependency of maximum growth rates was investigated in cyanobacteria and in green algae (Chlorophyta). Both unicellular and colony-forming species were included in the study. Significant allometric relationships were found between size and maximum growth rate for both cyanobacteria and green algae. The size-dependent growth could be described by the same scaling exponent in both cyanobacteria and green algae, but in both cyanobacteria and green algae only unicells evinced size-dependent growth rates-there was no relationship between colony size and growth rate in colonial forms of cyanobacteria and green algae. It is concluded that the colonial growth form represents an evolutionary adaptation to escape the negative effects of size-dependent growth, while retaining the positive effects of increased size, e.g. a decreased grazing pressure.

ID ABUNDANCE; OVERLAP; HABITS
AB The dietary structure and distribution patterns of red foxes Vulpes vulpes in situations of different food supply in the coniferous-deciduous (mostly small-leaved) woodlands of northern Belarus were investigated. A total of 1526 scats of red foxes was analysed, and snowtracking of the species was performed each winter. Abundance of the main prey (small rodents, perching birds and hares) and wild ungulates supplying carrion for red foxes in the cold season were monitored. The results suggest that in northern Belarus red foxes had a diversified diet, consisting basically of different combinations of bank votes, Microtus votes, and wild ungulate carrion. The importance of carrion much increased in winter, while the proportions of birds and fruits grew during the warm season. In the ecologically rich woodland harbouring on clay soil, red foxes relied more on small rodents, white carrion and fruits appeared to be more important food item of the predator in the barren forested terrain dwelling on poor sandy deposits. During Microtus population outbreaks, red foxes more frequently fed on this prey. One-sixth Lower density of red foxes was attributable to the forested terrain on sandy deposits compared to the woodland on clay soil, and a pronounced Landscape-related difference in the habitat selection by the predator was found.

AB Terrestrial weeds continue to evolve in association with the rapid global changes in our land-use systems, due to their regenerative strategies, their adaptability to change, and their inherent diversity. Currently, invasive weeds are estimated to cost the United States' economy up to $35 billion per year, and this total is rapidly increasing, as greater numbers of invasive species become naturalized. Several invasive exotic species have more recently established across New York State, creating difficulties for agricultural producers, roadside and natural areas managers, and homeowners and resulting in millions of dollars expended annually for their control. Three perennials that have become particularly problematic in New York State in recent years in both agricultural and roadside settings include Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. & Zucc.), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris L.), and pale swallow-wort (Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleop.) Barbar.). This review describes their history, biology, ecology, and potential for management and focuses on key characteristics contributing to their spread in New York State and adjacent regions.

AB In monogamous bird species, male parental investment may influence offspring fitness and females may gain advantages through mating with males providing extensive paternal care. However, paternal care is a benefit that can only be assessed indirectly because mate choice precedes paternal activities. Individual quality and age, both signalled by morphological characteristics, may reflect parental abilities. Because they may reflect individual foraging abilities, carotenoid-based colorations have been proposed to honestly signal parental quality. The blackbird (Turdus merula), a socially monogamous species, exhibits biparental care and males show bills that vary from pale yellow to orange due to carotenoid pigments. In this study, we investigated whether male bill colour and age are associated with parental ability. Our results suggest that males with more orange bills and older males are better fathers. Indeed, male visit rate increased with their bill colour index independently of age, and brood condition was higher for adult males, compared to yearlings, independently of bill colour. Overall, the number of fledglings produced was positively influenced by both the age of males and the colour intensity of their bills. Males with more orange bills and adults had a greater number of fledglings and these males also had higher levels of prolactin, a hormone known to promote parental care. This latter finding suggests that prolactin may be the link between carotenoid based colorations and the intensity of paternal effort. Thus, male bill colour seems to honestly reveal male physiological adjustment to paternal activities.

AB The community of predators within agroecosystems has the potential to restrict aphid populations, especially early in the season before exponential increases in density and prior to the arrival of specialist natural enemies. Although direct observations of predation, laboratory feeding trials and manipulative field studies have been used to estimate levels of biological control exerted by different species (or potentially negative interactions between them), it is often difficult to extrapolate results to naturally occurring interactions in the field.
   Over 100 investigations have utilized gut-content analysis to estimate aphid predation rates by predators. Throughout the last century, gut dissection, which enables the visual identification of aphid body parts, has been used in over 50 % of studies although accurate identification and quantification of predation is difficult. Other techniques have included radio-labelling of prey, dissection of faecal samples, electrophoresis, stable isotope analysis and use of polyclonal antisera. In recent studies of invertebrate predation, monoclonal antibodies have been the most frequently applied technique but advances in molecular biology have enabled the detcetion of species-specific DNA sequences. The use of these applications to quantify predation by aphidophagous predators will be reviewed, with emphasis on potential sources of error and difficulties of quantitative interpretation. Despite the considerable focus currently directed towards molecular approaches, antibody-based techniques are likely to remain an important tool for studying predation rates of pests in the field, especially when antibodies have already been developed. However, the study of multiple predation events within complex generalist predator food webs is only likely through the detection of species-specific DNA sequences using molecular techniques.

AB Relative abundances of benthic foraminifera in 57 core tops collected within a depth-range between 700 and 4335 in below sea level [b.s.l.] from the eastern Indian Ocean (mostly between Australia and Indonesia) were investigated quantitatively using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) to analyse species spatial-distribution. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and correlation matrices were used to evaluate the relationships between the species distribution and environmental variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, carbon-flux rate). Seven key-species proved useftil for distinguishing environmental parameters. Two groups of species are identified by means of the first DCA ordination axis. The first group increases in relative abundances with depth and includes three taxa: Oridorsalis tener umbonatus, Epistominella exigua and Pyrgo murrhina. These three taxa prefer a cold (< 3 degrees C) and well-oxygenated (> 3.5 ml/l) environment, with low carbon flux to the sea floor (< 3 g C m(-2) year(-1)). O. tener umbonatus and P murrhina tend to indicate reduced food availability, whereas E. exigua may indicate periodic delivery (seasonal) of organic matter to the sea floor. The second group includes Nummoloculina irregularis and Cibicidoides pseudoungerianus, typical of upper-bathyal depths. C. pseudoungerianus is correlated with a warm (> 2.5 degrees C) environment characterised by high carbon-flux rate (> 2.5 g C m(- 2) year(-1)). N. irregularis is associated with high dissolved-oxygen concentrations (> 3 ml/l) and its distribution is limited to south of 20 degrees S. In this area, the contemporary presence of the low salinity and well oxygenated Antarctic Intermediate Water and low primary productivity at the sea-surface (which causes low oxygen consumption at the sea floor) create the ideal conditions for this species. The second ordination-axis scores identify another taxon, Uvigerina proboscidea. The distribution of this species is mainly limited to low latitudes (north of 25 degrees S), where carbon flux rate is high (> 3.5 g C m(-2) year(-1)), due to higher primary productivity levels at the sea surface, and oxygen levels are low (< 3 ml/1) due to the organic matter oxidation and the presence of oxygen-depleted Indonesian Intermediate Water and North Indian Intermediate Water.

AB Wolf-ungulate interactions were studied in a mountainous region of the western Alps (Italy) from December 1999 to November 2002. Analysis of 848 scats of wolves Canis 1upits showed that their most important prey was wild ungulates (87.2%). Cervids were the preferred prey (74.2%) and constituted predominant food items both in winter (84.2%) and summer (54.3%). Wolves preyed most intensively upon young ungulates. Presence of domestic ungulates on high-altitude pastures during summer (May-October) influenced wolf diet (summer 19.0%, winter 0.3%), but, despite the major density of domestic livestock, wolves still preferred wild ungulates. A strong trophic relationship between wolves and red deer Cervus elaphus emerged from the present study. During three winters, 177 ungulate carcasses were recorded. Excluding hunting, the most important cause of death in red deer was predation by wolves (51.5%), followed by disease and starvation (36.4%) and traffic accidents (12.1%). The majority of red deer killed were hinds (58.8%) and calves (29.4%); stag kills represented only 11.8%. For roe deer Capreolus capreolus, starvation and diseases were the lowest factor (11.5%), slightly higher than wolf predation (10.8%), while traffic accidents were the main cause of mortality (77.7%). Chamois Rupicapra rupicapra seemed to be less important than red deer and roe deer in the diet of wolves. The high susceptibility of red deer to wolf predation could be a result of the strong overlap of habitat and attitude use with the wolf, and to their more conspicuous herding.

AB Recently, we used the 5'-trnL(UAA)-trnF(GAA) region of the chloroplast DNA for phylogeographic reconstructions and phylogenetic analysis among the genera Arabidopsis, Boechera, Rorippa, Nasturtium, and Cardanzine. Despite the fact that extensive gene duplications are rare among the chloroplast genome of higher plants, within these taxa the anticodon domain of the trnF(GAA) gene exhibit extensive gene duplications with one to eight tandemly repeated copies in close 5' proximity of the functional gene. Interestingly, even in Arabidopsis thaliana we found six putative pseudogenic copies of the functional trnF gene within the 5'-intergenic trnL-trnF spacer. A reexamination of trnL(UAA)-trnF(GAA) regions from numerous published phylogenetic studies among halimolobine, cardaminoid, and other cruciferous taxa revealed not only extensive trnF gene duplications but also favor the hypothesis about a single origin of trnF pseudogene formation during evolution of the Brassicaceae family 16-21 MYA. Conserved sequence motifs from this tandemly repeated region are codistributed nonrandomly throughout the plastome, and we found some similarities with a DNA sequence duplication in the rps7 gene and its adjacent spacer. Our results demonstrate the potential evolutionary dynamics of a plastidic region generally regarded as highly conserved and probably cotranscribed and, as shown here for several genera among cruciferous plants, greatly characterized by parallel gains and losses of duplicated trnF copies.

TI Impact of stand structure on surface fire ignition potential in Picea

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH

DT Article
ID MOISTURE-CONTENT; TEMPERATURE; RADIATION
AB Forest fire ignition potential was investigated in Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce) and Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) dominated stands of 0, 15, 30-45, and 40-60 years of age. A series of small-scale (< 0.5 m(2)) ignition tests were carried out in experimental plots on 61 different days in June, July, and August. Ignition success percentages were analyzed in relation to stand structural properties, preclassified stand types, and the output of the Canadian Fire Weather Index system. In addition, the number of average stand-type-specific fire days was estimated based on weather data (June-August) for southern Finland for the years 1991-2002. Factors in stand structure that significantly correlated with the ignition success percentage were canopy depth and leaf area index, the correlation coefficients being -0.575 (p < 0.005) and -0.582 (p < 0.005), respectively. In Pinus sylvestris dominated stands, ignition tests produced self-sustained surface fires in 32.0%, 24.0%, and 19.3% of cases in 0-, 15-, and 30- to 45-year age classes, respectively. In Picea abies dominated sites conditions were favorable for fire in 12.0% and 4.6% of trials in the 0- and 40- to 60-year age classes, respectively. The output of the FWI-system correlated well with the ignition success in June and July but poorly in August. Based on the 12-year time series analysis, there were on average per year 27, 18, and 14 potential fire days in 0-, 15-, and 30- to 45-year-old Pinus sylvestris stands, and 10 and 4 potential fire days in 0- and 40- to 60-year-old Picea abies stands, respectively. We concluded that the dominance of Picea abies or Pinus sylvestris and stand age appear to modify the ignition conditions significantly and should be used as threshold indicators in fire occurrence predictions.

AB Egg composition, which is under maternal control, can have a profound effect on offspring fitness. The presence of maternal testosterone and carotenoids in avian egg yolk, for example, is thought to enhance the development and competitive ability of the offspring and protect the hatching and growing chick against oxidative stress. Egg quality often differs between females and such variation can be due to differences in maternal social environment, e. g. breeding density. However, this is confounded by the possibility that the quality of individuals breeding in high- or low-density areas may vary. We tested if maternal social environment influences egg composition in a colonial seabird, the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus). To control for confounding effects of female quality, we experimentally manipulated maternal social environment during egg formation. We increased the frequency of intra-specific interactions (i.e. aggressive encounters with conspecifics other than nest mates) in which the females were involved, by placing an elevated platform in their territory. Females that took part in more intra-specific interactions produced a heavier last egg, but the yolk testosterone concentration in eggs laid by control and experimental females did not differ. Differences in yolk testosterone concentration in relation to embryo sex were found neither in the control nor in the experimental group. In contrast, within the control group, eggs with a male embryo contained more carotenoids than eggs with a female embryo. Moreover, experimental females that had been involved in more intra-specific interactions produced female eggs with higher carotenoid levels compared to female eggs of control birds. An experimental increase in carotenoid levels was not observed in eggs containing a male embryo. Our results suggest that intra-specific interactions experienced by female birds during egg formation can influence conditions for embryonic development.

AB Since egg production is nutritionally and energetically expensive, differential allocation theory predicts that females should allocate more resources at laying when mated to an attractive male. Females are also predicted to invest more in sons than in daughters under such conditions, because male offspring should have higher fitness returns than female offspring when fathered by an attractive male. We examined primary resource allocation in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when mated to both an attractive and an unattractive male. In the first breeding round, as predicted, females mated to attractive males laid heavier eggs, and there was a positive relation between female mass and egg mass. In contrast, for females mated to unattractive males there was no correlation between egg mass and body mass. Mate attractiveness did not affect clutch size or yolk androgen investment. Unexpectedly, in the second breeding round, in which the same females were paired with different males of opposite attractiveness to those in the first round, females did not alter their individual patterns of investment in egg mass. Therefore, we suggest there may be a physiological carryover effect and that females were primed by their first reproductive experience. In both rounds of breeding there was no difference in egg mass or yolk androgen concentration between male or female eggs in either treatment. Similarly, the primary sex ratio did not differ between treatments. This suggests that females do not differentially invest in male and female offspring in relation to the attractiveness of their mate in this species.

AB While accurate information on ecosystem CO2 and water vapor exchange is available at eddy covariance flux tower sites, methods to expand predictions Of CO2 and energy exchange to regional or global scales with high fidelity are lacking. The main objective of this study was to examine the applicability of land surface and atmospheric products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for assessing the spatial variation in CO2 and water vapor fluxes for cloudless agricultural land pixels at the Island of Zealand, Denmark. The spatial distribution of green leaf area index, direct-beam and difftise solar radiation and air humidity was inferred on the basis of late morning MODIS data that was combined with afternoon AVHRR data to resolve the diurnal variation in air and surface temperature. These variables were used in a coupled "two-leaf' ecosystem model operating at an hourly time scale.
   The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was strongly correlated with field measurements of green leaf area index (r(2)=0.91) and remained sensitive to variations in green biomass up to green leaf area indices of 4-5. Evaluation against standard meteorological data showed that instantaneous estimates of air temperature, actual vapor pressure and incoming solar radiation could be retrieved with overall root mean square errors of 2.5 degreesC, 138.3 Pa and 47.7 W m(-2), respectively. The combination of late morning and afternoon inferences made it possible to resolve the diurnal course in key model parameters, and predicted rates of ecosystem CO2 and water vapor exchange were comparable to eddy covariance measurements at a single flux tower. A large spatial diversity in CO2 and water vapor exchange was maintained throughout the study period due to significant regional variations in meteorological input variables and large spatial differences in canopy development. The results of this study stress the necessity of pixel based estimates for an accurate evaluation of regional budgets Of CO2 and water vapor exchange. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying the genetic variation and selection acting on phenotypes is a prerequisite for understanding microevolutionary processes. Surprisingly, long-term comparisons across conspecific populations exposed to different environments are still lacking, hampering evolutionary studies of population differentiation in natural conditions. Here, we present analyses of additive genetic variation and selection using two body-size traits in three blue tit (Parus caeruleus) populations from distinct habitats. Chick tarsus length and body mass at fledging showed substantial levels of genetic variation in the three populations. Estimated heritabilities of body mass increased with habitat quality. The poorer habitats showed weak positive selection on tarsus length, and strong positive selection on body mass, but there was no significant selection on either trait in the good habitat. However, there was no evidence of any microevolutionary response to selection in any population during the study periods. Potential explanations for this absence of a response to selection are discussed, including the effects of spatial heterogeneity associated with gene flow between habitats.

AB Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) landraces and cultivars from Finland, Sweden, Denmark and the Baltic states, in total 127, were analysed for allelopathic activity against ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The germplasm covered most of the gene pool used during 100 years of barley breeding. An agar-based bioassay developed for screening allelopathic activity was used. In the germplasm from all countries a decreasing trend in allelopathic activity was observed with the introduction of new cultivars from 14% for the Swedish to 31% for the Finnish cultivars. In the Finnish, Swedish and Baltic cultivars an increase in root growth was noticed, and changes in root biomass therefore cannot explain the decrease in allelopathy. In fact, the allelopathic activity per milligram root decreased with 32-85%. In contrast, root growth decreased over time in the Danish collection. In the Finnish cultivars both two- and six-row barley cultivars were tested with similar results. Allelopathic activity of barley probably originated from different landraces, and in most cases from a specific landrace from the Swedish island of Gotland. We suspect that more than 100 years of selection and breeding have resulted in a dilution of the genes from landraces and consequently a declining allelopathic activity. In the Swedish collection, two cultivars did not follow the general trend and in both cultivars, several landraces had been combined.

AB Bio-optical characteristics and photosynthetic performance of five strains of benthic diatoms belonging to three different species (Nitzschia thermalis Kutzing var. minor Hilse sensu Podzorski, Nitzschia laevis Hust and Navicula incerta Grunow) were examined. The effects of treatments with monochromatic blue light (BL) were also determined. The values of photosynthesis rate at saturating photon fluence rate (PFR) (P-max and ascending initial slope of the P-PFR curves (alpha) ranged from 0.22 to 3.58 mumol O-2 per mg Chl alpha min(-1) and from 0.012 to 0.169 mumol O-2 per mg Chl alpha (mumol photons m(-2) s(-1))(-1) respectively. Onset of light saturation parameter (E-k) ranged from 43 to 12 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1). These values were comparable to those reported from measurements performed with sub-tidal benthic communities. In vivo effective optical cross-section of Chl alpha (alpha* values) was correlated to average cell surface area. Interestingly, alpha* and alpha were also negatively correlated, probably indicating that a higher pigment packaging affects negatively to alpha. The acclimation of the five strains to monochromatic BL for 2 weeks produced a reduction of P-max and alpha although the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (DeltaF/F-m') was not affected. In addition to these changes, chlorophyll alpha increased and alpha* decreased in the five strains. Therefore, it was concludedthat the reduction of alpha* could contribute to the changes in the photosynthetic performance in BL. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study addresses social-ecological dynamics in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm County, Sweden, with special focus on the National Urban Park (NUP). It is part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and has the following specific objectives: (1) to provide scientific information on biodiversity patterns, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem services generated; (2) to map interplay between actors and institutions involved in management of ecosystem services; and (3) to identify strategies for strengthening social-ecological resilience. The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal. Recreation is among the most important services and NUP, for example, has more than 15 million visitors per year. More than 65 organizations representing 175,000 members are involved in management of ecosystem services. However, because of population increase and urban growth during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three such areas around NUP identified. Preliminary results indicate that areas of informal management represent centers on which to base adaptive comanagement, with the potential to strengthen biodiversity management and resilience in the landscape.

AB The objective of this paper is to identify the factors that promote the invasiveness of Rhododendron ponticum L. by the means of comparative field observations. Rhododendron ponticum (Ericaceae) is an evergreen shrub with a natural distribution in the Mediterranean and Black Sea area and was introduced to the British Isles in 1763, Thenceforward, the species has been considered as a major threat to natural ecosystems there.
   We compared native and invasive populations of Rhododendron ponticum with respect to trait patterns that are associated with invasiveness. Six populations each in the natural part of its range, in Georgia (Caucasus) and Spain as well as six invasive ones in Ireland were examined with regard to biometrical, morphological and ecological characteristics.
   Invasive Irish populations differed from non-invasive ones mainly in growth patterns and showed much higher rates of annual shoot growth in the field and higher rates of seedling recruitment. In contrast, native Spanish populations were discriminated by their shape and a-e; whereas native Georgian rhododendron, above all, showed distinctive leaf characteristics. In general, the relationship between Irish and Spanish populations was closer than to the Georgian ones. Our results suggest that both genotype and environment account for the trait pattern found in Irish populations. Differences in genetically fixed traits had a greater effect in morphological differences to Georgian provenances. In contrast, the invasive Irish rhododendron were favoured by a more benign environment than the Spanish populations.

AB How do species that interbreed become reproductively isolated? If hybrids are less fit than parental types, natural selection should promote reproductive isolation by favoring the evolution of premating mechanisms that prevent hybridization (a process termed reinforcement). Although reinforcement should generate a decline in hybridization over time, countervailing forces of gene flow and recombination are thought to preclude natural selection from enhancing and finalizing reproductive isolation. Here, I present recent estimates of hybridization frequency between two species of spadefoot toad, Spea multiplicata and S. bombifrons. I compare these recent measures of hybrid frequency with previously published estimates and show that hybridization between these species has declined precipitously over the past 27 years. Although previous studies suggest that reinforcement possibly accounts for this decline in hybrids over time, three alternative hypotheses also can explain the observed decrease in hybridization. First, if one of the two interacting species becomes rare, opportunities for and incidence of hybridization may decrease. Second, if one of the two interacting species is initially rare, hybridization may be initially common if the rare species has difficulty locating conspecific mates. Third, if hybrids are produced only in particular environments, hybrid frequency may decline if habitat changes result in loss of those environments that promote hybrid formation. I found no support for these three alternative explanations of the decline in hybrids. Instead, reinforcement appears to best account for the evolution of enhanced reproductive isolation between these species. Moreover, the finding that hybridization declined precipitously in only 27 years suggests that many systems that have undergone reinforcement may be overlooked because reproductive isolation between the interacting populations or species may already be complete.

AB The "cagaita tree" (Eugenia dysenterica) is a plant found widespread in the Brazilian Cerrado. Its fruit is used for popular consumption and for industrial purposes. This study opens a new perspective for the generation of population genetic data and parameters estimates for devising sound collection and conservation procedures for Eugenia dysenterica. A battery of 356 primer pairs developed for Eucalyptus spp. was tested on the "cagaita tree". Only 10 primer pairs were found to be transferable between the two species. Using a polyacrilamide gel, an average of 10.4 alleles per locus was detected, in a sample of 116 individuals from 10 natural "cagaita tree" populations. Seven polymorphic loci allowed estimation of genetic parameters, including expected average heterozygosity H-e = 0,442, among population diversity, R-ST = 0,268 and gene flow Nm = 0,680. Results indicated a potential of SSR locus transferability developed for Eucalyptus to other species of different genera, such as in the case of the "cagaita tree". The high genetic diversity among populations detected with SSR markers indicated that these markers are highly sensitive to detect population structure. Estimated Nm values and the existence of private alleles indicated reduced gene flow and consequently possible damage to the metapopulation structure.

AB Predation and food supply are generally perceived as important determinants of spatial and temporal variations of populations. The population dynamics of freshwater rotifers have been well researched in this aspect. However, their spatial variations have attracted less attention and have not been studied by simultaneously considering both predation and food supply. We studied spatial variations of rotifer abundance among 34 Canadian boreal lakes. A large part of the variance of rotifer abundance was associated with variables related to trophic status including chlorophyll a and total phosphorus. However, abundances of mesozooplankton such as potential predators and competitors did not correlate with rotifer abundance and did not explain the residual of the regression between rotifer abundance and chlorophyll a. The results of the present study indicated that variation in rotifer abundance among lakes was caused by 'bottom-up' forces related to food supply and not by 'top-down' predatory interactions. This provides a contrast to previous empiric and experimental studies that reported that temporal variations of rotifer abundance were mainly regulated by 'top-down' interactions. This discrepancy suggests that overall differences in rotifer abundance among lakes are mainly determined by 'bottom-up' forces while temporal changes in single lakes are shaped by 'top-down' forces. Meanwhile, the composition of rotifer species was correlated with mesozooplankton abundance as well as trophic status. Rotifer species with long spines or rigid loricae were found in the lakes where mesozooplankton were abundant, which suggests that defensive morphology could have affected the rotifer species distribution among the study lakes.

AB Although many studies have investigated the influence of environmental patterns on local stream invertebrate diversity, there has been little consistency in reported relationships between diversity and particular environmental variables. Here we test the hypothesis that local stream invertebrate diversity is determined by a combination of factors occurring at multiple spatial scales. We developed predictive models relating invertebrate diversity ( species richness and equitability) to environmental variables collected at various spatial scales ( bedform, reach and catchment, respectively) using data from 97 sampling sites dispersed throughout the Taieri River drainage in New Zealand. Models based on an individual scale of perception ( bedform, reach or catchment) were not able to match predictions to observations (r< 0.26, P> 0.01, between observed and predicted equitability and species richness). In contrast, models incorporating all three scales simultaneously were highly significant (P< 0.01; r = 0.55 and 0.64, between observed and predicted equitability and species richness, respectively). The most influential variables for both richness and equitability were median particle size at the bedform scale, adjacent land use at the reach scale, and relief ratio at the catchment scale. Our findings suggest that patterns observed in local assemblages are not determined solely by local mechanisms acting within assemblages, but also result from processes operating at larger spatial scales. The integration of different spatial scales may be the key to increasing model predictability and our understanding of the factors that determine local biodiversity.

AB Plant and microbial communities were compared through their structure and their functions in a chalk grassland in north-western France. Multivariate statistical analyses allowed us to establish floristic patterns and to identify four stages of succession from short grasslands to early stages of forest. In each stage, several measurements were made on vegetation (floristic data, biomass weight and lignin content), on soil (total carbon, soluble organic carbon, total nitrogen, polysaccharides and phenols contents, lignin content in litter) and on soil microbial communities (microbial biomass, functional structure assessed by using BIOLOG analysis, genetic structure of bacterial and fungal communities assessed by using Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) for 16S and 18S rDNA: ARDRA 16S and 18S). Although the organic matter resources that support soil microbial communities are larger in older stages of plant succession (high plant and litter biomass and nitrogen content in plant leaves in forest stages), results show that biomass and potential level of enzymatic activity of microbial communities are negatively correlated with the presence of shrubs and positively associated with grassland habitats. These microbiological variables also present complex interactions with other factors and are positively correlated with soil humidity, soil soluble carbon and polysaccharides contents and negatively correlated with the presence of lignin in plant biomass and litter. The results show out that microbial communities are independent from the successional gradient of vegetation, in terms of functional (BIOLOG analysis) and genetic structure (ARDRA 16S and 18S). This study provides a first step in understanding the link between the biodiversity (number and type of plant species, genetic structure of microbial community) and function (biomass production, enzymatic catabolism) in chalk grassland ecosystems.

AB A number of bioindicators and biotic indices and scores based on benthic macroinvertebrates, diatoms, fishes, aquatic and riparian vegetation in relation to physicochemical parameters have been applied in assessing the water quality of the rivers Alfeios and Pineios (Peloponnisos, Greece). According to the findings, the water quality in both rivers varied from very poor to very good. Among the bioindicators used, the benthic macroinvertebrates seem to be the most reliable. The BBI and IBE were the most applicable indexes while the applicability of the IBMWP and IASPT in the Greek region can be enforced with the inclusion of the Diptreran family Rhagionidae and the Coleopteran family Elminthidae.

DE Brownfield; Carabidae; Derelict; Succession; Urban ecology
AB Brownfield sites are thought to support a minimum of 12-15% of Britain's nationally scarce and rare invertebrates. The amount of derelict land in Britain is set to decrease dramatically under current home-building and regeneration policies. There is therefore a pressing need for research into the potential importance of brownfield sites for invertebrates. In this study we sampled the carabid fauna of 26 sites, with ages varying between 2-20 years since their formation, to assess whether vegetation succession was an important determinant of invertebrate diversity the West Midlands of England. The work was carried out over the course of one growing season (in 1999), with concurrent surveys of the soil characteristics, vegetation type and land-use history. 63 carabid species were found including 2 nationally scarce species. The most species rich assemblages are found on early successional sites, which persist for 6 years on graded sites and up to 20 years on compacted substrates.

AB The within- and among-population variation in individual growth rate of brown trout Salmo trutta L. was studied in five small neighbouring streams (seven isolated populations) within a distance of 70 km in east Norway. Observed growth rate was only weakly correlated with predicted maximum growth rate based on laboratory models, and there was a significant interaction with site. A generalized linear model showed that growth rate was positively correlated with temperature, but also that growth rate decreased as the summer season progressed. This might indicate either a seasonal decline in food availability or appetite, or a change in energy allocation strategy. Growth rate decreased with increasing fish age, probably as an effect of sexual maturation of older fish, and differential allocation of protein and lipid among different size-groups of brown trout. After adjusting for variation in temperature, season, and fish mass, there was still significant among-site variation in growth rate. A significant part of this variation was due to variation in brown trout density and the presence or absence of Alpine bullhead Cottus poecilopus. Growth rate decreased with increasing brown trout density, and was lower in the presence than in the absence of Alpine bullhead after correcting for variation in brown trout density. This last result may indicate the presence of interspecific competition. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bright coloration of males in many animal species has inspired researchers for more than a century. In this field study, we investigated whether color variation between individuals is related to individual quality in pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) males in terms of arrival time at the breeding sites. In addition to traditional visual color scoring, plumage color was measured using spectroradiometric measurements between 320 and 700 nm. This range includes the near-ultraviolet waveband from 320 to 400 nm. Males that arrived earlier at breeding sites had higher proportional UV reflectance in the crown and mantle. The proportional UV reflectance in the crown and mantle was not related to traditionally scored general brownness in males. However, adult males had a higher proportion of ultraviolet in the plumage than yearling males or females. These results suggest that in pied flycatcher males, the UV reflectance of plumage may be positively correlated with individual quality.

AB The nuclear genetic variation within and between four sessile (Q. petraea) and six pedunculate (Q. robur) autochthonous Flemish oak populations was investigated with AFLP markers. One sessile and one pedunculate oak population were additionally screened for detailed leaf characteristics using an image analysis system. Principal coordinate analysis on the AFLP data classified the oaks in two main groups, according to their taxonomic status. No species-specific AFLP markers were found using four primer combinations, but marker frequency differences up to 71% were recorded between both species. Analysis of the genetic structure showed that the divergence between species, as observed by ordination, was significant. Both species revealed similar diversity levels. A smaller though significant differentiation was also revealed for both species among populations within species. Molecular and morphology based approaches showed a high degree of consistency. Screening of 60 AFLP primer combinations using a bulking strategy did not allow identifying species-specific markers, which supports the conclusions reached in previous studies. The distribution of genetic variability at the species and at the population level is discussed.

AB The chemical composition of kelps (e.g. polyphenolics) deters grazing by herbivores, but kelp detritus is potentially a source of nutrition for suspension feeders. The effects of kelp detritus derived from two species [Agarum fimbriatum Harvey and Costaria costata (Turner) Saunders] on feeding of oysters, Crassostrea gigas Thunberg, and mussels, Mytilus trossulus Gould, were examined in feeding experiments. Fresh and aged kelp particles were sequentially presented in combination with the microalga Rhodomonas lens at an initial total concentration of 5x10(-4) ml(-1). Aging of kelp particles for 4 days in seawater significantly reduced the concentration of polyphenolics without changing the total carbon or nitrogen content. Clearance rates of both mussels and oysters were significantly lower in the presence of fresh versus aged kelp particles, and clearance rates declined overall with declining polyphenolic concentrations. Video endoscopy was used to examine feeding selectivity at the level of the gill in oysters in the same food treatments used in the clearance rate experiments. Comparison of particle composition in the water versus the pseudofeces in both oysters and mussels was also used as a measure of feeding selectivity. When presented with R. lens in combination with fresh and aged kelp particles selectivity for R. lens tended to be greater against fresh than aged particles, and there was some indication that this was stronger for A. fimbriatum than for C. costata particles. The ability to select was lower at very high polyphenolic concentrations, which may reflect poisoning of sensory binding sites. These data suggest that bivalves distinguish among particles of varying chemical composition and respond by changing their clearance rates and their selectivity.

AB We analysed the interannual variability of the major reef communities (algae, corals and fishes) on the outer slope of the Tiahura sector on Moorea Island between 1991 and 1997, and examined the impacts of natural disturbances on these communities. Patterns of temporal variation and the response to natural perturbations were clearly different among the taxa examined. A sharp decrease in the percent cover of branching corals (Pocillopora and Acropora) followed cyclonic and bleaching events that occurred in 1991. After 1993, a slight increase in coral cover values was recorded, and can be interpreted. as a sign of recovery. Despite a similar proportion of bleached colonies at the beginning of bleaching events in 1991 and 1994, the bleaching in 1994 had no significant impact on coral cover. This result demonstrates the importance of understanding the ecological history of reefs (i.e. the chronology of disturbances) in interpreting the specific impacts of a particular disturbance. The decline in coral cover was accompanied by an increase in the percent cover of turf algae, but surprisingly, the percent cover of macroalgae did not show any significant temporal variation during the 7 yr period. Thus, the decrease in the percent cover of corals, which opens up new substrate, does not always result in an increase in macroalgal cover. The temporal variation of the fish community was mainly characterized by (1) the high variability in the recruitment of juveniles, with a peak in 1991; (2) the slight increase in the density of adult species; and (3) the decrease in the density of corallivorous chaetodontid fishes from 1991 to 1994. Since corals were the only taxon directly affected by natural disturbances, they were consequently the cause of the indirect effects of these disturbances (i.e. increase in turf algae and decrease in chaetodontid fishes), and can therefore be regarded as the 'key component' of the outer slope reef communities in Moorea.

AB We examined soil and vegetation N isotopic composition (delta(15)N) and soil inorganic N availability in an intact Mojave desert ecosystem to evaluate potential effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on N cycling. Vegetation from the dominant perennial shrub Larrea tridentata under elevated CO2 was enriched in N-15. Over a 7-month sampling period, Larrea delta(15)N values increased from 5.7 +/- 0.1parts per thousand to 9.0 +/- 1.1parts per thousand, with elevated CO2; under ambient conditions, delta(15)N values of shrubs increased from 4.9 +/- 0.3parts per thousand to 6.6 +/- 0.7parts per thousand. No difference was found in soil delta(15)N under elevated and ambient CO2. Soil delta(15)N values under the drought deciduous shrubs Lycium spp. were greatest (7.2 +/- 0.3parts per thousand), and soil under the C4 perennial bunchgrass Pleuraphis rigida had the lowest values (4.5 +/- 0.2parts per thousand,). Several mechanisms could explain the enrichment in N-15 of vegetation with elevated CO2. Results suggest that microbial activity has increased with elevated CO2, enriching pools of plant-available N and decreasing N availability. This hypothesis is supported by a significant reduction of plant-available N under elevated CO2. This indicates that exposure to elevated CO2 has resulted in significant perturbations to the soil 1 cycle, and that plant delta(15)N may be a useful tool for interpreting changes in the N cycle in numerous ecosystems.

AB I The short- and long-term dynamics of Nothofagus pumilio were investigated across an altitudinal gradient in Tierra del Fuego. Declining probability of establishment of individuals with increasing altitude (spatial restriction) is expected to lead to increasingly sporadic recruitment towards the alpine timberline (AT) (temporal restriction). Longevity of adult trees and difficulties in establishment at altitude should result in a static AT.
   2 The number of annual growth buds of seedlings suggests that the species regenerates episodically at all altitudes in cycles of a similar length (7-8 years) to those for seed production. Nevertheless, the seedling density in a year of high regeneration (1996) was considerably higher at lower altitudes than at the AT.
   3 Counting of the growth rings of adult individuals revealed a massive episode of establishment between 1800 and 1850 at all altitudes. There was poor establishment between 1920 and 1980. The age range for the entire population fluctuated between 49 and 377 years in 1996.
   4 Although there is no evidence for more frequent recruitment at lower altitudes, differential regeneration ensures that establishment there is more probable.
   5 Individuals at the AT had an average age of 160 years in 1996, suggesting that the border has indeed remained static for at least a century and a half.
   6 The spatial restriction determines that the AT cannot advance until removal of the temporal restriction allows turnover to occur.

   Inter-relationships for Australian inland aquatic systems

AB Natural resource managers have articulated "health" narrowly and vaguely as the condition of the biophysical environment. It is too tempting for natural resource managers to take data generated from rapid assessment techniques of biophysical condition (like species richness) as surrogates for "biodiversity." This paper takes the view that these common applications of the terms "health" and "biodiversity" obscure a meaningful search for the relationships between biodiversity, human health, and the socioeconomic well-being of human communities. Using examples of landscapes and inland waters in Australia, we argue that the biodiversity of inland waters and human health are linked in at least two ways, Biodiversity, and its endemic features, contribute to a person's attachment to a particular place and become part of a person's identity. Loss, destruction, or change in a location has the potential to affect an individual's psychological well-being, and challenge a community's identity and image of itself. Any inland waterway also has the potential to harbor biota that can directly affect the health of humans. We are exposed to this biota when we develop locations inappropriately, when we (mis)treat inland waters, or as a by-product of other land and water developments. Our health may be compromised by attempts to control this biota. And our perceptions of a place may change dramatically according to the presence of these and other organisms, or according to our efforts at their control, as illustrated by cases involving wetlands, mosquitoes, and arboviruses. We conclude by arguing that the health of inland aquatic systems will be best articulated by intertwining biodiversity, endemism, perception of place, environmental (landscape) degradation, disease-causing organisms, and management of the aquatic resource. The health sector and natural resource management agencies are encouraged to recognize the synergies between these issues in their policies and practices.

AB The dusky grouper, Epinephelus marginatus, inhabits coastal reefs in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. A decline in the abundance of this long-lived protogynous hermaphrodite has led to its listing as an endangered species in the Mediterranean, and heightened management concerns regarding its genetic variability and population substructure. To address these concerns, we analysed genetic variation at seven microsatellite and 28 allozyme loci in dusky groupers sampled from seven areas (for microsatellites) and three areas (for allozymes) in the west-central Mediterranean. Levels of genetic variability were higher for microsatellites than for allozymes (mean H-E = 0.78 and 0.07, respectively), but similar to those observed in other marine fishes with comparable markers. Both microsatellites and allozymes revealed significant genetic differentiation among all areas analysed with each class of marker, but the magnitude of differentiation revealed by allozymes over three locales (F-ST = 0.214) was greater than that detected with microsatellites over seven areas, or over the three areas shared with the allozyme analysis (F-ST = 0.018 and -0, respectively). A large proportion of the allozyme differentiation was due to a single locus (ADA*) possibly influenced by selection, but allozyme differentiation over the three areas was still highly significant (F-ST = 0.06, P < 0.0001), and the 95% confidence intervals for allozyme and microsatellite FST did not overlap when this locus was excluded. There was no evidence of isolation by distance with either class of markers. Our results lead us to conclude that dusky groupers are not panmictic in the Mediterranean Sea and suggest that they should be managed on a local basis. However, more work is needed to elucidate genetic relationships among populations.

AB We examined polymorphism at seven microsatellite loci in 4023 brown trout (Salmo trutta) collected from 32 tributaries to the Limfjord, Denmark (similar to 200 km) and from two hatcheries used for stocking. Populations differ in their estimated sizes and stocking histories. Mean individual inbreeding coefficients do not differ among locations within rivers. Relatedness varies between sites within rivers indicating varied local dynamics at a very small geographical scale. Relatedness is sometimes lower than expected among an equal number of simulated individuals with randomized genotypes, suggesting structure within locations. Five per cent of the genetic variance is distributed among rivers (F-ST = 0.049), but in the western, less heavily stocked, area of the Limfjord a higher proportion of the genetic variance is distributed among rivers than among locations within rivers. The reverse is true of the eastern, more heavily stocked, area of the Limfjord. Here, a higher proportion of the genetic variance is distributed among locations within rivers than among rivers. Assignment tests reveal that the majority of trout (mean 77% of all fish) are more probably of local origin than hatchery origin but this proportion varies regionally, with rivers in the western area of the Limfjord showing a relatively high (mean 88%) and those in the eastern area showing a relatively low (mean 72%) proportion of locally assigned trout. These results can be interpreted as reflecting stocking impact. Also, the proportion of locally assigned trout correlates with the populations' stocking histories, with rivers presently subjected to stocking (hatchery trout) showing low mean similar to0.73), and rivers where stocking was discontinued showing high (mean similar to0.84) proportions of local fish, probably reflecting lower survival of hatchery than of wild trout. There is evidence for isolation by distance at a large geographical scale when individual river populations are pooled into nine geographical regions but not at a small geographical scale when populations are considered individually. We reject the null hypothesis that stocking has had no impact on population structure but the relatively high proportion of locally assigned trout in populations where stocking with domestic fish no longer takes place suggests limited long-term success of stocking.

AB African wild dogs are large, highly mobile carnivores that are known to disperse over considerable distances and are rare throughout much of their geographical range. Consequently, genetic variation within and differentiation between geographically separated populations is predicted to be minimal. We determined the genetic diversity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and microsatellite loci in seven populations of African wild dogs. Analysis of mtDNA nucleotide diversity suggests that, historically, wild dog populations have been small relative to other large carnivores. However, population declines due to recent habitat loss have not caused a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity. We found one historical and eight recent mtDNA genotypes in 280 individuals that defined two highly divergent clades. In contrast to a previous, more limited, mtDNA analysis, sequences from these clades are not geographically restricted to eastern or southern African populations. Rather, we found a large admixture zone spanning populations from Botswana, Zimbabwe and south-eastern Tanzania. Mitochondrial and microsatellite differentiation between populations was significant and unique mtDNA genotypes and alleles characterized the populations. However, gene flow estimates (Nm) based on microsatellite data were generally greater than one migrant per generation. In contrast, gene flow estimates based on the mtDNA control region were lower than expected given differences in the mode of inheritance of mitochondrial and nuclear markers which suggests a male bias in long-distance dispersal.

AB Classifications of tree species into regeneration guilds or functional groups are often based on a limited number of life history characteristics indicative of requirements for early establishment, with the assumption that these traits are correlated with growth requirements of larger individuals. We tested the validity of this assumption for Alseis blackiana, a common canopy tree in central Panama, by examining its seed germination, seedling growth, and sapling distribution, growth, and mortality. We found that the early life history of Alseis is characteristic of pioneer species: the seed germination rate was much higher in forest gaps than in the forest understory, small seedlings were absent from the understory, and seedlings showed strong plastic responses to variation in light. Seedling relative growth rate, leaf area production rate, and maximum carbon assimilation rates of Alseis are much more similar to those of the pioneer tree Miconia argentea than to those of the non-pioneer tree Tetragastris panamensis. However, in contrast to Miconia, established seedlings of Alseis are capable of remarkable persistence in the understory; in a 1-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, the mortality rate for 722 saplings <1 cm dbh was <4% per year between 1986 and 1998. We suspect that shade tolerance in Alseis is achieved by both physiological and morphological adaptations, e.g., efficient light interception by thin, nonoverlapping leaves, tolerance to litterfall damage, and a high resprouting capacity. These results show that existing functional group classifications do not account for the full range of seedling trait combinations found in tropical trees and indicate that a gap requirement for seedling establishment need not limit the abundance of adult individuals in a stand.

AB 1. Associated with the development of the held of macroecology has been the recognition and analysis of a number of different patterns in the large-scale abundance and distribution of species. The mechanistic bases of these patterns have usually been considered in isolation, yet the patterns are necessarily linked, as the same individual animals contribute to all of them.
   2. Here, a model linking macroecological patterns in abundance, distributional extent and body mass is developed, based on how the finite amount of energy available to the species in a region is divided between them. The energy available to a species is assumed to support some quantity of biomass, which must then be allocated to either many small-bodied or fewer larger-bodied individuals. This identifies a necessary link between population size and body mass, which predicts when the variety of relationships between these variables in the published literature are expected to occur.
   3. Although framed in terms of energy use by species, the model does not assume that energy per se is necessarily limiting populations. How individuals use space determines the form of relationships between population size and distributional extent, distributional extent and body mass, and population density and body mass. The model additionally allows a number of falsifiable predictions about the anatomy of macroecological patterns.
   4. Support for the assumptions of the model is discussed.

AB We surveyed larval amphibians and fish in 25 relatively pristine depression wetlands on the upper Atlantic coastal plain of South Carolina to examine relationships among hydroperiod length, fish presence/absence and larval amphibian assemblage structure. Our goals were to test the application of general models of lentic community structure to Southeastern depression wetlands and to develop expectations of larval amphibian assemblage structure at reference sites. Amphibian species richness showed a unimodal pattern along a hydroperiod gradient, with wetlands that contained water for 8-10 mo/yr having the highest species richness. Wetlands that contained water for longer periods (i.e., dried only during severe drought) often contained fish and had relatively low amphibian species richness. Most species occurred along a restricted portion of the hydroperiod gradient, and some species were found almost exclusively in wetlands with fish. Associations among the occurrence of species led to relatively discrete breaks in assemblage structure along the hydroperiod gradient. Canonical correspondence analysis of catch-per-unit-effort data identified four groups of wetlands with similar assemblage structure: (1) short (drying in spring), (2) medium (drying in summer), and (3) long (drying in fall or semi-annually) hydroperiod wetlands without fish; and (4) long hydroperiod wetlands with fish. Our results suggest that general models of community structure in lentic systems are applicable to southeastern isolated wetlands and should form the basis for developing expectations of larval amphibian assemblage structure in these systems.

AB Microalgal photosynthesis can be predicted using empirical allometric or mechanistic bio-optic models. These two descriptions are usually considered independently. We compare the size scaling of photosynthesis predicted by these two models. Size scaling exponents for phytoplankton often deviate from the allometric 3/4 rule. This may be because the allometric model does not account for the size dependence of light absorption and its effect on the size scaling of photosynthesis. In contrast to the allometric model and experimental data, the bio-optic model predicts photosynthesis should be independent of cell size when intracellular pigment concentrations are low or inversely related to cell diameter. A composite of the allometric and bio-optic models is described and compared to laboratory data of light-limited nutrient-saturated diatom photosynthesis. The allo-bio-optic model provides a mechanistic explanation for the anomalous size scaling found in laboratory and field studies of microalgal photosynthesis and growth. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB The filter feeding oligotrich ciliate Strobilidium lacustris, the raptorial prostome ciliate Balanion planctonicum and the diffusion feeding scuticociliate Histiobalantium bodamicum could be cultivated for months/years on a sole diet of Cryptomonas sp., whereas the diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii did not support their growth. With Cryptomonas sp: as food, numerical responses of all ciliates followed a modified Michaelis-Menten model, which at 15 degrees C yielded maximum growth rates of 0.96, 1.87 and 0.33 d(-1) and threshold concentrations of 61, 78 and 290 ng C ml(-1) for S. lacustris, B. planctonicum and H, bodamicum, respectively. Functional response patterns differed between species. In all investigated ciliates, growth rates reached a maximum earlier than ingestion rates, and there were no threshold concentrations for zero ingestion. Food selectivity depended on feeding mode. H. bodamicum was not able to ingest the non-motile diatoms. Both S. lacustris and B. planctonicum selectively preferred cryptophytes when offered a mixed diet. This effect was more pronounced in the raptorial feeder compared to the filter feeder. Our results indicate that during the phytoplankton spring bloom in Lake Constance prostome and oligotrich ciliates mainly exploit cryptophytes, and that the scuticociliate H. bodamicum, due to its slow growth, is an inferior competitor during this season. The observed threshold concentrations suggest that during the rest of the year prostomes and oligotrichs must rely on small-scale patches of this food, whereas H. bodamicum, with maximum development in late summer and autumn, presumably consumes a much larger variety of prey.

AB Resident juvenile Atlantic salmon responded to a period of winter food restriction by subsequently increasing appetite when food again became available. This hyperphagy contributed to the restoration of an energy deficit (derived from a biometric estimation of body lipid reserves) incurred during the period of food restriction. The extent of this deficit influenced the duration of the hyperphagic response: those fish incurring the greatest fat losses maintained appetite longer than those with a smaller energy deficit. The initial feeding intensity of fish incurring a wide range of fat losses was found to be similar, indicating that fish were regulating the length as opposed to the intensity of the hyperphagic response in order to restore losses. The ecological implications of the results are discussed in relation to juvenile salmon overwintering strategies. (C) 1997 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB The species composition and the depth distribution of the soil propagule banks of bryophytes and vascular plants from three different soil layers in a boreal old-growth spruce forest in SE Norway were studied using the emergence method. A total of 34 taxa germinated with a predominance of ferns and mosses. The frequency of the different species exhibits a common community pattern with a few common and a large number of low frequency species. The tree Betula pubescens, the ferns Athyrium filix-femina, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, and Phegopteris connectilis, and the mosses Plagiothecium laetum agg. and Polytrichum spp. were the most frequent. There is only a moderate correspondence, decreasing with soil depth, between the propagule bank and the aboveground vegetation in the sampled plots. In the soil profile, the litter layer on average had more taxa than the peaty mor and bleached layer (7.7, 6.0, and 5.5 taxa, respectively). Five of the 17 taxa occurring in more than 10% of the soil samples from the different soil layers were significantly more frequent in the upper soil layer, while two taxa were more frequent in either peaty mor and (or) the bleached layer than in the uppermost layer. The propagule bank in the different soil layers represents an in situ potential for regeneration of the vegetation after different degrees of disturbance in the forest floor.

AB A Paulownia-winter wheat intercropping experiment with the object of quantifying photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and its effect on wheat yield was conducted 60 km south of Zhengzhou (35 degrees N 113 degrees E), Henan Province, PR China, from September 1991 to July 1992 using a tree and crop interface approach. The middle row of three 240 m long rows of 11-year-old trees was studied for its effects on the yield of irrigated and fertilized winter wheat. Photosynthetic photon flux density (Q(p)) was quantified using a split-plot design with four blocks. There were four distance (subplot) treatments (2.5 m, 5 m, 10 m and 20 m) and two direction (main plot) treatments laid out to the east and west of a north-south tree line. Results showed no difference in direction effects but Q(p) did affect total grain weight (P = 0.0047) between 2.5 m and 20 m. A regression equation was fit using the mean for each distance treatment: Y = 391.7 + 4.57X with r(2) = 0.9310 indicating a yield increase of 4.57 g m(-2) (45.7 kg ha(-1)) over a distance of 2.5 m to 20 m from the trees.

AB Wing-dimorphic, delphacid planthoppers were used to test hypotheses concerning the effects of habitat persistence and architectural complexity on the occurrence of dispersal. For reasons concerning both the durational stability of the habitat and the reduced availability of mates, selection has favored high levels of dispersal in species occupying temporary habitats. Flightlessness predominates in species occupying persistent habitats, and is promoted by a phenotypic trade-off between reproductive success and flight capability. Wings are retained in tree-inhabiting species, probably for reasons concerning the more effective negotiation of three-dimensional habitats. In contrast, flightlessness is characteristic of those species inhabiting low profile host plants. For several delphacid genera, migratory species are larger than their sedentary congeners. Because body size and fecundity are positively related in planthoppers, the large body size observed in migratory taxa may result from selection for increased fecundity in colonizing species.

AB Seasonal shifts in the microhabitats used by feeding brown trout Salmo trutia in a northern Spanish river were related to changes in habitat availability. At higher flows, mean water column velocities, focal velocities, and depths occupied by brown trout were greater and focal elevations above the substratum were less, but no changes in substratum use were detected. Cover use differed between dates, apparently according to the presence of suitable materials. In May, a lower proportion of the observed fish were holding feeding positions than in July, October, or January. Total metabolic costs associated with holding feeding stations were primarily determined by swimming costs, and both costs varied substantially between dates, mainly as a consequence of the different swimming speeds of brown trout on the different dates. Standard metabolism was less important than swimming cost in total energy expenditure and showed no obvious relationship with total metabolic mte. Brown trout exhibited considerable individual variation in swimming costs, which seemed not to be related to fish size.

AB The structure of cursorial spider assemblages was examined along a gradient of four temperate successional communities. Species diversity (H'), richness (S), and evenness (J') exhibited a dichotomy between herbaceous and woody communities rather than a progressive change with community age: all three parameters were higher in the two younger fields than in the two older woodlands, which is contrary to conventional successional theory. Species importance curves were steeper in the two woody communities. The breadth of the distribution of adult body lengths was greater in the two herbaceous communities. Indices of community similarity revealed neither a successional trend nor the vegetative dichotomy. We suggest the hypothesis that habitat structure is a more important determinant of cursorial spider diversity than successional age per se, and that the switch in dominance from herbaceous to woody vegetation is the critical change. We further suggest that competition for prey is more important to cursorial spiders in early successional (herbaceous) communities, because of a switch in the limiting resource from prey in these communities to the amount of accumulating litter (a spatial resource) in older woody stands. This may explain the greater variation in adult body size of these generalist predators in the two younger communities.

AB The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) is a species of crucial economic, agricultural and environmental importance. In the last ten years, some regions of the world have suffered from a significant reduction of honey bee colonies. In fact, honey bee losses are not an unusual phenomenon, but in many countries worldwide there has been a notable decrease in honey bee colonies. The cases in the USA, in many European countries, and in the Middle East have received considerable attention, mostly due to the absence of an easily identifiable cause. It has been difficult to determine the main factors leading to colony losses because of honey bees' diverse social behavior. Moreover, in their daily routine, they make contact with many agents of the environment and are exposed to a plethora of human activities and their consequences. Nevertheless, various factors have been considered to be contributing to honey bee losses, and recent investigations have established some of the most important ones, in particular, pests and diseases, bee management, including bee keeping practices and breeding, the change in climatic conditions, agricultural practices, and the use of pesticides. The global picture highlights the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor as a major factor in colony loss. Last but not least, microsporidian parasites, mainly Nosema ceranae, also contribute to the problem. Thus, it is obvious that there are many factors affecting honey bee colony losses globally. Increased monitoring and scientific research should throw new light on the factors involved in recent honey bee colony losses. The present review focuses on the main factors which have been found to have an impact on the increase in honey bee colony losses.

AB Allelopathy (i.e. chemical interactions between plants) is known to affect individual performance, community structure and plant invasions. Yet, a quantitative synthesis is lacking. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of 384 studies that measured allelopathic effects of one species (allelopathy plant) on another species or itself (test plant). Overall, allelopathy reduced plant performance by 25%, but the variation in allelopathy was high. The type of method affected the allelopathic effect: compared to leachates, allelopathy was more negative when residues of allelopathy plants were applied, and less negative when soil conditioned by allelopathy plants was applied. The negative effects of allelopathy diminished with study duration, and increased with concentrations of leachates or residues. Although allelopathy was not significantly related to lifespan, life form or domestication of the interacting plants, it became more negative with increasing phylogenetic distance. Moreover, native plants suffered more from leachates of naturalised alien plants than from leachates of other native plants. Our synthesis reveals that allelopathy could contribute to success of alien plants. The negative relationship between phylogenetic distance and allelopathy indicates that allelopathy might contribute to coexistence of closely related species (i.e. convergence) or dominance of single species.

AB Analysing >40 plant traits and ecosystem properties over 10 years, the authors find moderate evidence for traits being predictors of ecosystem-level properties within years, but limited evidence for any effect across years.
   Earth is home to over 350,000 vascular plant species that differ in their traits in innumerable ways. A key challenge is to predict how natural or anthropogenically driven changes in the identity, abundance and diversity of co-occurring plant species drive important ecosystem-level properties such as biomass production or carbon storage. Here, we analyse the extent to which 42 different ecosystem properties can be predicted by 41 plant traits in 78 experimentally manipulated grassland plots over 10 years. Despite the unprecedented number of traits analysed, the average percentage of variation in ecosystem properties jointly explained was only moderate (32.6%) within individual years, and even much lower (12.7%) across years. Most other studies linking ecosystem properties to plant traits analysed no more than six traits and, when including only six traits in our analysis, the average percentage of variation explained in across-year levels of ecosystem properties dropped to 4.8%. Furthermore, we found on average only 12.2% overlap in significant predictors among ecosystem properties, indicating that a small set of key traits able to explain multiple ecosystem properties does not exist. Our results therefore suggest that there are specific limits to the extent to which traits per se can predict the long-term functional consequences of biodiversity change, so that data on additional drivers, such as interacting abiotic factors, may be required to improve predictions of ecosystem property levels.

AB The occurrence of emerging contaminants, such as: personal care products, medicines, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and their transformation products in the environment is of concern for human health and aquatic ecosystems due to their high persistence, toxicity and potential to bioaccumulation. Among pesticides, the main attention and thus our focus is on neonicotinoids: acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam, which are widely used classes of insecticides in agriculture. Determining the associated risk to humans and ecosystems from neonicotinoid insecticides requires detailed understanding of their fate and transport in the environment which is complex and includes diverse pathways and processes depending on environmental compartments in which they occur. This paper critically reviews the current state of the art about processes, parameters and phenomena influencing the fate of neonicotinoid insecticides in soil-water systems (i.e. soil and groundwater), and reveals existing knowledge gaps. Sorption, biodegradation, chemical transformations of neonicotinoid insecticides in the soil and leaching to the groundwater, as well as groundwater/surface water interactions are highlighted, as they determine their further migration from sources, through soils to groundwater systems and then to other environmental compartments posing ecological and human risks. A number of key knowledge gaps in fate of neonicotinoid insecticides in soil-water systems are identified, that concern mostly processes and pathways occurring in the groundwater, and require further research to assess the associated risk to humans and ecosystems.

AB Achieving a sustainable future will only be possible through the intersection of the best science and technology in combination with the societal, economic, policy, cultural, moral, and ethical ecosystem. Green chemistry and green engineering provide the scientific and technological foundation of the elements of green and sustainable chemistry while the other elements, relating to humanitarian aims, enabling system conditions, and noble goals, provide the imperative context. This alternative periodic table, strives to outline the range of aspects and tools that are available and needed to accomplish the daunting and necessary tasks of moving toward a sustainable tomorrow.

AB Ecosystem service research is high on the policy agenda. Strategies to synthesize individual success stories and derive generalized results to provide guidance for policymakers and stakeholder is central to many science-policy initiatives, such as Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity. However, generalization requires the documentation of basic information on methods and results of case studies, which might not be present throughout all case studies. We used a quantitative review based on a random sample of studies published in the ISI Web of Knowledge between 1996 and 2016 to identify blind spots in ecosystem service research that might hinder the generalization. We structured our analysis along critical questions about five facets that characterize the holistic ideal of ecosystem services research: (i) social-ecological validity of ecosystem data and models, (ii) consideration of trade-offs between ecosystem services, (iii) recognition of off-site effects, (iv) comprehensive and shrewd involv ement of stakeholders, and (v) relevance and usability of study results for the operationalization of the ecosystem service concept in practice. Results show that these facets were not addressed by the majority of case studies including more recent studies. Clusters of ecosystem services studied together were prone to different blind spots. To effectively operationalize the concept of ecosystem services, the blind spots need to be addressed by upcoming studies. A list of critical questions is provided to raise the awareness of the blind spots both for synthesis of existing knowledge and for future research agendas.

AB Microorganisms play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem stability. The last two decades have witnessed an upsurge in studies on marine microbial community composition using high-throughput sequencing methods. Extensive mining of the compositional data has provided exciting new insights into marine microbial ecology from a number of perspectives. Both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to microbial community assembly but their relative importance in structuring subcommunities, that are categorized by traits such as abundance, functional type and activity, differs. Through correlation-based network analysis, significant progress has been made in unraveling microbial co-occurrence patterns and dynamics in response to environmental changes. Prediction of ecosystem functioning, based on microbial data, is receiving increasing attention, as closely related microbes often share similar ecological traits and microbial diversity often exhibits significant correlations to ecosystem functioning. The ecosystem functioning is likely executed not by the whole community, but rather by an active fraction of a community, which can be inferred from the marker gene transcription level of community members. Furthermore, the huge amount of microbial community data has significantly expanded the tree of life and illuminated microbial phylogenetic divergence and evolutionary history. This review summarizes important findings in microbial assembly, interaction, functioning, activity and diversification, highlighting the interacting roles of different aspects, derived from community compositional data.

AB Advances in phenology (the annual timing of species' life-cycles) in response to climate change are generally viewed as bioindicators of climate change, but have not been considered as predictors of range expansions. Here, we show that phenology advances combine with the number of reproductive cycles per year (voltinism) to shape abundance and distribution trends in 130 species of British Lepidoptera, in response to similar to 0.5 degrees C spring-temperature warming between 1995 and 2014. Early adult emergence in warm years resulted in increased within- and between-year population growth for species with multiple reproductive cycles per year (n = 39 multivoltine species). By contrast, early emergence had neutral or negative consequences for species with a single annual reproductive cycle (n = 91 univoltine species), depending on habitat specialisation. We conclude that phenology advances facilitate pole-wards range expansions in species exhibiting plasticity for both phenology and voltinism, but may inhibit expansion by less flexible species.

AB As environmental DNA (eDNA) studies have grown in popularity for use in ecological applications, it has become clear that their results differ in significant ways from those of traditional, non-PCR-based surveys. In general, eDNA studies that rely on amplicon sequencing may detect hundreds of species present in a sampled environment, but the resulting species composition can be idiosyncratic, reflecting species' true biomass abundances poorly or not at all. Here, we use a set of simulations to develop a mechanistic understanding of the processes leading to the kinds of results common in mixed-template PCR-based (metabarcoding) studies. In particular, we focus on the effects of PCR cycle number and primer amplification efficiency on the results of diversity metrics in sequencing studies. We then show that proportional indices of amplicon reads capture trends in taxon biomass with high accuracy, particularly where amplification efficiency is high (median correlation up to 0.97). Our results explain much of the observed behavior of PCR-based studies, and lead to recommendations for best practices in the field.

AB Developing a detailed understanding of how all known forms of life are related to one another in the tree of life has been a major preoccupation of biology since the idea of tree-like evolution first took hold. Since most life is microbial, our intuitive use of morphological comparisons to infer relatedness only goes so far, and molecular sequence data, most recently from genomes and transcriptomes, has been the primary means to infer these relationships. For prokaryotes this presented new challenges, since the degree of horizontal gene transfer led some to question the tree-like depiction of evolution altogether. Most eukaryotes are also microbial, but in contrast to prokaryotic life, the application of large-scale molecular data to the tree of eukaryotes has largely been a constructive process, leading to a small number of very diverse lineages, or 'supergroups'. The tree is not completely resolved, and contentious problems remain, but many well-established supergroups now encompass much more diversity than the traditional kingdoms. Some of the most exciting recent developments come from the discovery of branches in the tree that we previously had no inkling even existed, many of which are of great ecological or evolutionary interest. These new branches highlight the need for more exploration, by high-throughput molecular surveys, but also more traditional means of observations and cultivation.

AB The growth of biomass is considered the most efficient method currently available to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, biomass carbon is easily degraded by microorganisms releasing it in the form of greenhouse gases back to the atmosphere. If biomass is pyrolyzed, the organic carbon is converted into solid (biochar), liquid (bio-oil), and gaseous (permanent pyrogas) carbonaceous products. During the last decade, biochar has been discussed as a promising option to improve soil fertility and sequester carbon, although the carbon efficiency of the thermal conversion of biomass into biochar is in the range of 30%-50% only. So far, the liquid and gaseous pyrolysis products were mainly considered for combustion, though they can equally be processed into recalcitrant forms suitable for carbon sequestration. In this review, we show that pyrolytic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS) can aspire for carbon sequestration efficiencies of >70%, which is shown to be an important threshold to allow PyCCS to become a relevant negative emission technology. Prolonged residence times of pyrogenic carbon can be generated (a) within the terrestrial biosphere including the agricultural use of biochar; (b) within advanced bio-based materials as long as they are not oxidized (biochar, bio-oil); and (c) within suitable geological deposits (bio-oil and CO2 from permanent pyrogas oxidation). While pathway (c) would need major carbon taxes or similar governmental incentives to become a realistic option, pathways (a) and (b) create added economic value and could at least partly be implemented without other financial incentives. Pyrolysis technology is already well established, biochar sequestration and bio-oil sequestration in soils, respectively biomaterials, do not present ecological hazards, and global scale-up appears feasible within a time frame of 10-30 years. Thus, PyCCS could evolve into a decisive tool for global carbon governance, serving climate change mitigation and the sustainable development goals simultaneously.

AB The Simple Algorithm for Yield estimates (SAFY) is a crop yield model that simulates crop growth and biomass accumulation at a daily time step. Parameters in the SAFY model can be determined from literature, in situ measurements, or optical remote sensing data through data assimilation. For effective determination of parameters, optical remote sensing data need to be acquired at high spatial and high temporal resolutions. However, this is challenging due to interference of cloud cover and rather long revisiting cycles of high resolution satellite sensors. Spatio-temporal fusion of multi-source remote sensing data may represent a feasible solution. Here, crop phenology-related parameters in the SAFY model were derived using an improved Two-Step Filtering (TSF) model from remote sensing data generated through spatio-temporal fusion of Landsat-8 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Remaining parameters were determined through an optimization procedure using the same dataset. The SAFY model was then used for dry aboveground biomass and yield estimation at a subfield scale for corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max). The results show that the improved TSF method is able to determine crop phenology stages with an error of <5 days. After calibration, the SAFY model can reproduce daily Green Leaf Area Index (GLAI) effectively throughout the growing season and estimate crop biomass and yield accurately at a subfield scale using three Landsat-8 and 10 MODIS images acquired for the season. This approach improves the accuracy of biomass estimation by about 4% in relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE), compared with the SAFY model without forcing the phenology-related parameters. The RMSE of yield estimation is 146.33 g/m(2) for corn and 82.86 g/m(2) for soybean. The proposed framework is applicable for local-scale or field-scale phenology detection and yield estimation.

AB Global environmental changes strongly impact wild and domesticated species biology and their associated ecosystem services. For crops, global warming has led to significant changes in terms of phenology and/or yield. To respond to the agricultural challenges of this century, there is a strong need for harnessing the genetic variability of crops and adapting them to new conditions. Gene flow, from either the same species or a different species, may be an immediate primary source to widen genetic diversity and adaptions to various environments. When the incorporation of a foreign variant leads to an increase of the fitness of the recipient pool, it is referred to as "adaptive introgression". Crop species are excellent case studies of this phenomenon since their genetic variability has been considerably reduced over space and time but most of them continue exchanging genetic material with their wild relatives. In this paper, we review studies of adaptive introgression, presenting methodological approaches and challenges to detecting it. We pay particular attention to the potential of this evolutionary mechanism for the adaptation of crops. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of farmers' knowledge and practices in shaping wild-to-crop gene flow. Finally, we argue that screening the wild introgression already existing in the cultivated gene pool may be an effective strategy for uncovering wild diversity relevant for crop adaptation to current environmental changes and for informing new breeding directions.

AB Questions of definition and measurement continue to constrain a consensus on the measurement of interdisciplinarity. Using Rao-Stirling (RS) Diversity sometimes produces anomalous results. We argue that these unexpected outcomes can be related to the use of "dual-concept diversity" which combines "variety" and "balance" in the definitions (ex ante). We propose to modify RS Diversity into a new indicator (DIV) which operationalizes "variety," "balance," and "disparity" independently and then combines them ex post. "Balance" can be measured using the Gini coefficient. We apply DIV to the aggregated citation patterns of 11,487 journals covered by the Journal Citation Reports 2016 of the Science Citation Index and the Social Sciences Citation Index as an empirical domain and, in more detail, to the citation patterns of 85 journals assigned to the Web-of-Science category "information science & library science" in both the cited and citing directions. We compare the results of the indicators and show that DIV provides improved results in terms of distinguishing between interdisciplinary knowledge integration (citing references) versus knowledge diffusion (cited impact). The new diversity indicator and RS diversity measure different features. A routine for the measurement of the various operationalization of diversity (in any data matrix) is made available online.

AB Although studies of elevational diversity gradient for microbes have attracted considerable attention, the generality of these patterns and their underlying drivers are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated bacterial distribution across a high elevational gradient (4328-5228 m a.s.l.) along the Nyainqentanglha mountains on the Southwestern Tibetan Plateau. We found a decreasing diversity trend with increasing elevation, with pH contributing most to the diversity variation, followed by elevation and mean annual temperature (MAT). Bacterial community composition differed taxonomically and phylogenetically with elevation. Furthermore, partial Mantel analyzes showed that bacterial community composition was significantly influenced by elevation, pH and MAT. Phylogenetic structure analysis indicated that deterministic processes (related to pH) determined bacterial community assembly along this elevation gradient. Our results reinforce the observed rule that pH is of foremost importance in driving bacterial elevational diversity patterns. We also suggest that absence of tree cover and of human disturbance might be important in allowing an underlying elevational trend to reveal itself. Review of other studies suggests that the trend of decreasing diversity at higher elevations might be generally true above the tree line.
   Soil pH dominates elevational diversity pattern for bacteria in high elevation alkaline soils on the Tibetan Plateau.

In the past decade, tree improvement programs were mainly focused on yield but it is obvious that enhanced stress resistance is also required. In this review we highlight important drought avoidance and tolerance mechanisms in forest trees. Genomes of economically important trees species with divergent resistance mechanisms can now be exploited to uncover the mechanistic basis of long-term drought adaptation at the whole plant level. Molecular tree physiology indicates that osmotic adjustment, antioxidative defense and increased water use efficiency are important targets for enhanced drought tolerance at the cellular and tissue level. Recent biotechnological approaches focused on overexpression of genes involved in stress sensing and signaling, such as the abscisic acid core pathway, and down-stream transcription factors. By this strategy, a suite of defense systems was recruited, generally enhancing drought and salt stress tolerance under laboratory conditions. However, field studies are still scarce. Under field conditions trees are exposed to combinations of stresses that vary in duration and magnitude. Variable stresses may overrule the positive effect achieved by engineering an individual defense pathway. To assess the usability of distinct modi fications, large-scale experimental field studies in different environments are necessary. To optimize the balance between growth and defense, the use of stress-inducible promoters may be useful. Future improvement programs for drought resistance will bene fit from a better understanding of the intricate networks that ameliorate molecular and ecological traits of forest trees.

AB Climate warming challenges animals to advance their timing of reproduction [1], butmany animals appear to be unable to advance at the same rate as their food species [2, 3]. As a result, mismatches can arise between the moment of largest food requirements for their offspring and peak food availability [4-6], with important fitness consequences [7]. For long-distance migrants, adjustment of phenology to climate warming may be hampered by their inability to predict the optimal timing of arrival at the breeding grounds from their wintering grounds [8]. Arrival can be advanced if birds accelerate migration by reducing time on stopover sites [9, 10], but a recent study suggests that most long-distance migrants are on too tight a schedule to do so [11]. This may be different for capital-breeding migrants, which use stopovers not only to fuel migration but also to acquire body stores needed for reproduction [12-14]. By combining multiple years of tracking and reproduction data, we showthat a long-distance migratory bird (the barnacle goose, Branta leucopsis) accelerates its 3,000 km spring migration to advance arrival on its rapidly warming Arctic breeding grounds. As egg laying has advanced much less than arrival, they still encounter a phenological mismatch that reduces offspring survival. A shift toward using more local resources for reproduction suggests that geese first need to refuel body stores at the breeding grounds after accelerated migration. Although flexibility in body store use allows migrants to acceleratemigration, this cannot solve the timeconstraint they are facing under climatewarming.

AB Niche differentiation among species is a key mechanism by which biodiversity may be linked to ecosystem function. We tested a set of widely invoked hypotheses about the extent of niche differentiation in one of the most diverse communities on Earth, decomposer microorganisms, by measuring their response to changes in three abundant litter resources: lignin, cellulose, and nitrogen (N). To do this, we used the model system Arabidopsis thaliana to manipulate lignin, cellulose, and N availability and then used high-throughput sequencing to measure the response of microbial communities during decay. Resequencing the decomposer communities after incubation of decomposed litter with pure substrates showed that groups of species had unique substrate use profiles, such that species organized into functional "guilds" of decomposers that were associated with individual litter chemicals. Low concentrations of lignin, cellulose, or N in the litter caused unique shifts in decomposer community composition after 1 yr of decay. Low cellulose plants had low levels of fungi in all decomposer guilds, low lignin plants had high levels of fungi in all decomposer guilds, and low N plants had low levels of fungi in decomposer guilds associated with sucrose and lignin. The relative abundance of decomposer guilds correlated with the total loss of individual litter chemicals during litter decay in the field. In addition, N fertilization shifted decomposer communities during both the early and later stages of decay to those dominated by decomposers in the cellulose guild. Our results contrast the assumption that major carbon (C) and N degradation mechanisms are uniform across whole decomposer communities and instead suggest that decomposition arises from complementarity among groups of metabolically distinct taxa.

AB The development of foraging strategies that enable juveniles to efficiently identify and exploit predictable habitat features is critical for survival and long-term fitness. In the marine environment, meso-and sub-mesoscale features such as oceanographic fronts offer a visible cue to enhanced foraging conditions, but how individuals learn to identify these features is a mystery. In this study, we investigate age-related differences in the fine-scale foraging behaviour of adult (aged >= 5 years) and immature (aged 2-4 years) northern gannets Morus bassanus. Using high-resolution GPS-loggers, we reveal that adults have a much narrower foraging distribution than immature birds and much higher individual foraging site fidelity. By conditioning the transition probabilities of a hidden Markov model on satellite-derived measures of frontal activity, we then demonstrate that adults show a stronger response to frontal activity than immature birds, and are more likely to commence foraging behaviour as frontal intensity increases. Together, these results indicate that adult gannets are more proficient foragers than immatures, supporting the hypothesis that foraging specializations are learned during individual exploratory behaviour in early life. Such memory-based individual foraging strategies may also explain the extended period of immaturity observed in gannets and many other long-lived species.

AB Partitioning of soil phosphorus (P) pools has been proposed as a key mechanism maintaining plant diversity, but experimental support is lacking. Here, we provided different chemical forms of P to 15 tree species with contrasting root symbiotic relationships to investigate plant P acquisition in both tropical and subtropical forests. Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees responded positively to addition of inorganic P, but strikingly, ECM trees acquired more P from a complex organic form (phytic acid). Most ECM tree species and all AM tree species also showed some capacity to take up simple organic P (monophosphate). Mycorrhizal colonisation was negatively correlated with soil extractableP concentration, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi may regulate organic P acquisition among tree species. Our results support the hypothesis that ECM and AM plants partition soil P sources, which may play an ecologically important role in promoting species coexistence in tropical and subtropical forests.

AB Marine populations are typically characterized by weak genetic differentiation due to the potential for long-distance dispersal favouring high levels of gene flow. However, strong directional advection of water masses or retentive hydrodynamic forces can influence the degree of genetic exchange among marine populations. To determine the oceanographic drivers of genetic structure in a highly dispersive marine invertebrate, the giant California sea cucumber (Parastichopus californicus), we first tested for the presence of genetic discontinuities along the coast of North America in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Then, we tested two hypotheses regarding spatial processes influencing population structure: (i) isolation by distance (IBD: genetic structure is explained by geographic distance) and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR: genetic structure is driven by ocean circulation). Using RADseq, we genotyped 717 individuals from 24 sampling locations across 2,719 neutral SNPs to assess the degree of population differentiation and integrated estimates of genetic variation with inferred connectivity probabilities from a biophysical model of larval dispersal mediated by ocean currents. We identified two clusters separating north and south regions, as well as significant, albeit weak, substructure within regions (F-ST = 0.002, p = .001). After modelling the asymmetric nature of ocean currents, we demonstrated that local oceanography (IBR) was a better predictor of genetic variation (R-2 = .49) than geographic distance (IBD) (R-2 = .18), and directional processes played an important role in shaping fine-scale structure. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature identifying significant population structure in marine systems and has important implications for the spatial management of P.californicus and other exploited marine species.

AB Despite its negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity, tree plantations can contribute to biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes, as they harbor many native species. In this study, we investigated the impact of Eucalyptus plantations on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities, comparing ant communities sampled in managed and unmanaged (abandoned for 28 years) Eucalyptus plantations, and native Atlantic rain forests. Eucalyptus plantations, both managed and unmanaged, reduced the functional diversity and increased the similarity between ant communities leading to functional homogenization. While communities in managed plantations had the lowest values of both taxonomic and functional ant diversities, ant communities from unmanaged plantations had similar values of species richness, functional redundancy and Rao's Q compared to ant communities from forest patches (although functional richness was lower). In addition, communities in unmanaged Eucalyptus plantations were taxonomically and functionally more similar to communities located in managed plantations, indicating that Eucalyptus plantations have a severe long-term impact on ant communities. These results indicate that natural regeneration may mitigate the impact of Eucalyptus management, particularly regarding the functional structure of the community (a diversity), although it does not attenuate the effects of long term homogenization in community composition (beta diversity).

AB Seabirds are among the most threatened groups of birds, and predation by invasive mammals is one of the most acute threats at their island breeding stations. Island restoration projects increasingly involve the eradication of invasive non-native mammals, with benefits for seabirds and other island fauna. To date, demonstrated benefits of invasive mammal eradication include increased seabird nesting success and enhanced adult survival. However, the recovery dynamics of seabird populations have not been documented. Drawing on data from across the world, we assemble population growth rates () of 181 seabird populations of 69 species following successful eradication projects. After successful eradication, the median growth rate was 1.119 and populations with positive growth (>1; n=151) greatly outnumbered those in decline (<1; n=23, and seven showed no population change). Population growth was faster (1) at newly established colonies compared to those already established, (2) in the first few years after eradication, (3) among gulls and terns compared to other seabird groups, and (4) when several invasive mammals were eradicated together in the course of the restoration project. The first two points suggest immigration is important for colony growth, the third point reflects the relative lack of philopatry among gulls and terns while the fourth reinforces current best practise, the removal of all invasive mammals where feasible.

AB Insects are particularly vulnerable to rapid environmental changes, which are disproportionally affecting high latitudes. Increased temperature could influence insect species differentially and reshape assemblages over time. We quantified temporal assemblage turnover of Arctic Diptera (flies) in the Muscidae, one of the most diverse and abundant families of Arctic insects, using time series data from Zackenberg, north-east Greenland. We measured temporal patterns of abundance, diversity, and composition of muscid assemblages in wet fen, mesic and arid heath habitats from yearly collections spanning 1996-2014 and tested their relationship to climate. A total of 18 385 individuals representing 16 species of muscid flies were identified. A significant decrease of 80% of total muscid abundance was observed during the study period. Species richness declined in each habitat type but this trend was not significant across habitats. The number of common and abundant species also decreased significantly over time across habitats revealing a temporal modification of species evenness. Significant temporal changes in composition observed in the wet fen and across habitats were mainly driven by a change in relative abundance of certain species rather than by species replacement. Shift in composition in each habitat and decline in muscid abundance across habitats were associated with summer temperature, which has significantly increased over the study period. However, relationships between temperature and muscid abundance at the species level were noticeable for a few species only. Significant directional change in composition was documented in the wet fen but no biotic homogenization across habitats was observed. As one of the few studies of species-level changes in abundance, diversity and composition of an insect taxon in the Arctic over the past two decades, our study shows that habitat types may modulate insect species responses to recent climate change and that contrasting species responses can alter species assemblages within a few decades.

AB The rate of evolution of population mean fitness informs how selection acting in contemporary populations can counteract environmental change and genetic degradation (mutation, gene flow, drift, recombination). This rate influences population increases (e.g., range expansion), population stability (e.g., cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics), and population recovery (i.e., evolutionary rescue). We review approaches for estimating such rates, especially in wild populations. We then review empirical estimates derived from two approaches: mutation accumulation (MA) and additive genetic variance in fitness (I-Aw). MA studies inform how selection counters genetic degradation arising from deleterious mutations, typically generating estimates of <1% per generation. IAw studies provide an integrated prediction of proportional change per generation, nearly always generating estimates of <20% and, more typically, <10%. Overall, considerable, but not unlimited, evolutionary potential exists in populations facing detrimental environmental or genetic change. However, further studies with diverse methods and species are required for more robust and general insights.

AB This paper first reviews the concept of functional diversity in general terms and then applies it to free-living aquatic ciliates. Ciliates are extremely versatile organisms and display an enormous functional diversity as key elements of pelagic food webs, acting as predators of bacteria, algae, other protists and even some metazoans. Planktonic ciliates are important food for zooplankton, and mixotrophic and functionally autotrophic species may significantly contribute to primary production in the ocean and in lakes. The co-occurrence of many ciliate species in seemingly homogenous environments indicates a wide range of their ecological niches. Variation in space and time may foster co-occurrence and prevent violating the competitive exclusion principle among ciliates using the same resources. Considering that many ciliates may be dormant and/or rare in many habitats, ciliate species diversity must be higher than can be deduced from simple sampling techniques; molecular methods of identification clearly point to this hidden diversity. From a functional point of view, the question is how much of this diversity represents redundancy. A key challenge for future research is to link the ecophysiological performance of naturally co-occurring ciliates to their functional genes. To this end, more experimental research is needed with with functionally different species. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Pyrolysis is the thermochemical decomposition of biomass under oxygen-limiting conditions used for biochar and bio-oil production. Depending on biomass feedstock, pyrolysis technology and operating parameters, product yields and properties will differ. Among the available pyrolysis units, auger pyrolysis is a polyvalent and promising technology for producing both bio-oil and biochar. These reactors are simple to operate and can be mobile, they require little or no carrier gas and low energy. Moreover, the operating parameters can be controlled easily in order to obtain the desired products. Recently, many research articles on biomass pyrolysis in auger reactors have been published. Design of laboratory scale pyrolysis units and operating parameters differ considerably. Therefore, there was a need to list the studies in which auger pyrolysis reactors are used and to collect data for experimental operating parameters and product yields. The type and the capacity of the reactor, pyrolysis temperature, solid residence time, carrier gas flowrate, vapour residence time, and biomass feedstock type and size were identified as the parameters having the most influence on product yields and their properties. Because each pyrolysis reactor is unique, it is important to establish the relationship between operating parameters and product yields and their properties for each biomass feedstock. Future work is needed in order to provide simple solutions to scale-up laboratory-scale auger pyrolysis units to industrial size. (C) 2017 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Global environmental change not only includes changes in mean environmental conditions but also in temporal environmental fluctuations. Because it is frequently suggested that common species, and particularly invasive alien species, are phenotypically highly plastic, they might benefit more from these fluctuations than rare native and rare alien species. Experimental tests, however, are still lacking.

Here, we tested whether alien plant species take more advantage of increases in resource levels and fluctuations therein than native species, and whether common species do so more than rare species. Therefore, we grew seven common alien, seven rare alien, nine common native and six rare native herbaceous plants, in one treatment with constantly low nutrient availability and five treatments with high nutrient availability that differed in temporal availability of nutrients (constant, increasing, decreasing, single large pulse, multiple smaller pulses).
   3. We found that all species produced more biomass and longer roots, and had a lower root mass fraction under high nutrient conditions than under low nutrient conditions, irrespective of their origin and commonness. Among the high nutrient treatments, the temporal pattern of nutrient supply also influenced biomass production, root allocation and root thickness, but the magnitude and/or directions of these responses varied among the groups of species. Particularly, we found that alien plant species, irrespective of whether they are common or rare, produced more biomass, and had a higher root mass fraction when nutrients were supplied as a single pulse in the middle of the growth period instead of supplied at a constant rate, whereas the reverse was true for the native species.
   4. Synthesis. Our study suggests that species origin does not drive differences in plant biomass production, root morphology and allocation in response to changes in mean environmental nutrient availability. However in our study, alien plant species, in contrast to native plant species, benefited from a large nutrient pulse. This suggests that increased fluctuations in nutrient availability might promote alien plant invasions.

TI Altered intestinal microbiota in patients with chronic pancreatitis:
   implications in diabetes and metabolic abnormalities
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID RESOURCE
AB Intestinal dysbiosis and its functional implications in chronic pancreatitis (CP) have not been elaborately studied. We evaluated the taxonomic and functional alterations in intestinal microbiota in 30 well-characterised patients with CP (16 without, 14 with diabetes) and 10 healthy controls. The patients with CP and diabetes had significantly longer disease duration and greater degree of malnutrition. There was increase in plasma endotoxin concentrations from controls to CP non-diabetics to CP diabetics. We observed significant differences in richness and alpha diversity between the groups. We also observed increase in the Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio in CP patients without and with diabetes. There was reduction in abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Ruminococcus bromii from controls to CP non-diabetics to CP diabetics. On the other hand, there was increase in LPS (endotoxin) synthetic pathways (KEGG orthology) in the groups. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance correlated negatively with plasma endotoxin and glycemic status; while plasma endotoxin correlated positively with blood glucose and negatively with plasma insulin. Our results have important implications for future studies exploring mechanistic insights on secondary diabetes in CP.

AB Although elevational gradients in microbial biodiversity have attracted increasing attention recently, the generality in the patterns and underlying mechanisms are still poorly resolved. Further, previous studies focused mostly on species richness, while left understudied evenness, another important aspect of biodiversity. Here, we studied the elevational patterns in species richness and evenness of stream biofilm bacteria and diatoms in six mountains in Asia and Europe. We also reviewed published results for elevational richness patterns for soil and stream microbes in a literature analysis. Our results revealed that even within the same ecosystem type (that is, stream) or geographical region, bacteria and diatoms showed contrasting patterns in diversity. Stream microbes, including present stream data, tend to show significantly increasing or decreasing elevational patterns in richness, contrasting the findings for soil microbes that typically showed nonsignificant or significantly decreasing patterns. In all six mountains for bacteria and in four mountains for diatoms, species richness and evenness were positively correlated. The variation in bacteria and diatom richness and evenness were substantially explained by anthropogenic driven factors, such as total phosphorus (TP). However, diatom richness and evenness were also related to different main drivers as richness was mostly related to pH, while evenness was most explained by TP. Our results highlight the lack of consistent elevational biodiversity patterns of microbes and further indicate that the two facets of biodiversity may respond differently to environmental gradients.

AB Top carnivores play an important role in maintaining energy flow and functioning of the ecosystem, and a clear understanding of their diets and foraging strategies is essential for developing effective conservation strategies. In this paper, we compared diets and prey selection of snow leopards and wolves based on analyses of genotyped scats (snow leopards n = 182, wolves n = 57), collected within 26 sampling grid cells (5x5 km) that were distributed across a vast landscape of ca 5000 km(2) in the Central Himalayas, Nepal. Within the grid cells, we sampled prey abundances using the double observer method. We found that interspecific differences in diet composition and prey selection reflected their respective habitat preferences, i.e. snow leopards significantly preferred cliff-dwelling wild ungulates (mainly bharal, 57% of identified material in scat samples), whereas wolves preferred typically plain-dwellers (Tibetan gazelle, kiang and argali, 31%). Livestock was consumed less frequently than their proportional availability by both predators (snow leopard = 27%; wolf = 24%), but significant avoidance was only detected among snow leopards. Among livestock species, snow leopards significantly preferred horses and goats, avoided yaks, and used sheep as available. We identified factors influencing diet composition using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Wolves showed seasonal differences in the occurrence of small mammals/birds, probably due to the winter hibernation of an important prey, marmots. For snow leopard, occurrence of both wild ungulates and livestock in scats depended on sex and latitude. Wild ungulates occurrence increased while livestock decreased from south to north, probably due to a latitudinal gradient in prey availability. Livestock occurred more frequently in scats from male snow leopards (males: 47%, females: 21%), and wild ungulates more frequently in scats from females (males: 48%, females: 70%). The sexual difference agrees with previous telemetry studies on snow leopards and other large carnivores, and may reflect a high-risk high-gain strategy among males.

AB The spatial organisation of biotic communities derives from factors operating at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Despite strong scientific evidence of prevalent spatial control of community composition in freshwater ecosystems, local environmental factors are often considered as the main drivers of community change. Furthermore, taxonomic approaches are most frequently used, and few studies have compared the relative importance of local and regional control of trait versus the taxonomic composition in stream ecosystems. Using a spatially dense data set covering all stream sizes in a lowland European region of c. 42000km(2) and three organism groups (macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fishes), we compared the relative importance of spatial and environmental determinants of species and trait composition in the study streams, classified into headwaters (stream order 1-2) and downstream sites (stream order >2). We hypothesised that (i) there is a higher correspondence between environmental conditions and trait composition than with species composition, (ii) dispersal limitation (pure spatial structuring) is greater in headwaters than in downstream sites and (iii) dispersal limitation (pure spatial structuring) is weakest for macroinvertebrates, intermediate for macrophytes and strongest for fishes. The most consistent pattern across organisms and stream order groups was a higher correspondence between environmental variation and trait composition as well as a higher number of environmental variables significantly related to trait composition than with species composition (hypothesis 1). Spatial structuring peaked in headwater macrophyte communities and downstream fish communities (hypotheses 2 & 3) - a pattern that was amplified when separate analyses of traits describing species dispersal potential were undertaken. Our study highlights the potential of traits to capture multiple environmental changes in stream ecosystems and illustrates how organism-specific and highly context-dependent patterns in community organisation can emerge as a consequence of interactions between habitat connectivity (i.e. top versus lower parts of the stream network) and organism dispersal potential.

AB The phylum Ciliophora is one of the most broadly studied protozoan lineages. The era of molecular investigation has brought forth a major ongoing debate: is the subclass Peritrichia Stein, 1859 monophyletic? Numerous analyses mostly using the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene have failed to recover the Mobilida and Sessilida, the two peritrich orders, as sister clades. Here we have sequenced five peritrich species - three sessilids and two mobilids. We constructed a supermatrix of 158 genes and 44,696 characters for 24 ciliate species, and as outgroup taxa, nine species from the Apicomplexa and four from the Dinophyceae. Our analyses using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods recover a monophyletic class Oligohymenophorea and two robust clades within it. The first Glade is a monophyletic Peritrichia with the orders Sessilida and Mobilida maximally supported as sister clades. The second oligohymenophorean Glade includes species of the subclasses Scuticociliatia and Hymenostomatia, which are sister clades. Our analyses resolve a long-standing debate in ciliate molecular phylogenetics and provide support for the classical view that the morphological features of the two peritrich orders Mobilida and Sessilida arose by descent from the same common ancestor and are not the result of convergence.

AB Many ocean policies mandate integrated, ecosystem-based approaches to marine monitoring, driving a global need for efficient, low-cost bioindicators of marine ecological quality. Most traditional methods to assess biological quality rely on specialized expertise to provide visual identification of a limited set of specific taxonomic groups, a time-consuming process that can provide a narrow view of ecological status. In addition, microbial assemblages drive food webs but are not amenable to visual inspection and thus are largely excluded from detailed inventory. Molecular-based assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem function offer advantages over traditional methods and are increasingly being generated for a suite of taxa using a-microbes to mammals" or "barcodes to biomes" approach. Progress in these efforts coupled with continued improvements in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics pave the way for sequence data to be employed in formal integrated ecosystem evaluation, including food web assessments, as called for in the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive. DNA sequencing of bioindicators, both traditional (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrates, ichthyoplankton) and emerging (e.g., microbial assemblages, fish via eDNA), promises to improve assessment of marine biological quality by increasing the breadth, depth, and throughput of information and by reducing costs and reliance on specialized taxonomic expertise.

AB 1. Proboscis length has been proposed as a key dimension of plant pollination niches, but this niche space has not previously been explored at regional and global scales for any pollination system. Hawkmoths are ideal organisms for exploring pollinator niches as they are important pollinators in most of the biodiverse regions of the earth and vary greatly in proboscis length, with some species having the longest proboscides of all insects.
   2. Using data sets for nine biogeographical regions spanning the Old and New World, we ask whether it is possible to identify distinct hawkmoth pollination niches based on the frequency distribution of proboscis length, and whether these niches are reflected in the depths of flowers that are pollinated by hawkmoths. We also investigate the levels of specialization in hawkmoth pollination systems at the regional and community level using data from interaction network studies.
   3. We found that most regional hawkmoth assemblages have bimodal or multimodal distributions of proboscis length and that these are matched by similar distributions of floral tube lengths. Hawkmoths, particularly those with longer proboscides, are polyphagous and at the network level show foraging specialization equivalent to or less than that of bees and hummingbirds. In the case of plants, shorter-tubed flowers are usually visited by numerous hawkmoth species, while those that are longer-tubed tend to exclude shorter-proboscid hawkmoths and thus become ecologically specialized on longer-proboscid hawkmoth species. Longer-tubed flowers tend to have greater nectar rewards, and this promotes short-term constancy by longproboscid hawkmoths.
   4. Our results show that pollinator proboscis length is a key niche axis for plants and can account for the patterns of evolution in functional traits such as floral tube length and nectar volume. We also highlight a paradoxical trend for nectar resource niche breadth to increase according to proboscis length of pollinators, while pollinator niche breadth decreases according to the tube length of flowers.

AB Understanding mechanisms by which agricultural practices affect freshwater ecosystems helps to inform land-use policies and management strategies aimed at mitigating effects of agriculture on biodiversity. Land-use activities in the catchment, riparian and local scales likely influence stream fish communities via multiple pathways, for instance, by modifying the instream habitat. We investigated the mechanisms driving local stream fish taxonomic richness and functional diversity in South Brazilian grasslands by testing a theoretical path model in which we specified a priori relationships predicting how land use at multiple scales affects instream habitat and fish communities. Agricultural activities adjacent to streams (i.e. local impact on the streambank) and catchment-scale cropland area were positively related to macrophyte cover and negatively associated with coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, i.e. woody debris and leaf litter). Local impact also increased substrate siltation and homogenisation. Riparian vegetation in the upstream buffer ameliorated instream habitat condition by dampening macrophyte proliferation and providing CPOM. Fish species richness increased with both macrophyte cover and CPOM, revealing multiple pathways of agricultural influence. However, functional diversity decreased only with substrate siltation, revealing a response to agricultural activities adjacent to sample sites. Agricultural streams showed a replacement of benthic and lithophilic species by a larger number of morphologically similar and macrophyte-associated nektonic fish. Our study indicates that land-use adjacent to streams and upstream riparian zones is critical for maintaining taxonomically and functionally diverse fish communities due to their strong effects on instream habitat. Protection and recovery of riparian zones from land-use change can mitigate the effects of agriculture on fish communities in South Brazilian grasslands.

AB The cost and difficulty of manipulative field studies makes low statistical power a pervasive issue throughout most ecological subdisciplines. Ecologists are already aware that small sample sizes increase the probability of committing Type II errors. In this article, we address a relatively unknown problem with low power: underpowered studies must overestimate small effect sizes in order to achieve statistical significance. First, we describe how low replication coupled with weak effect sizes leads to Type M errors, or exaggerated effect sizes. We then conduct a meta-analysis to determine the average statistical power and Type M error rate for manipulative field experiments that address important questions related to global change; global warming, biodiversity loss, and drought. Finally, we provide recommendations for avoiding Type M errors and constraining estimates of effect size from underpowered studies.

AB The purpose of this analysis was to empirically model and graphically illustrate the numerical relationships between richness (S, 4-35 species) and evenness (E) with respect to Shannon-Wiener index (H', log(e)-based) values. Thirty-two richness-based third-order polynomial regression models (R >0.99, P < 0.001, n=28-71) were constructed to characterize these relationships. A composite diagram showed richness varied curvilinearly, with steepness increasing and the spacing between curves decreasing with greater evenness and H'. Maximum H' values for each richness curve were equal to log(e) S (when E = 1), whereas minima were approximated by evenness values of similar to 1/S (when H' = 0). It was concluded from multiple and polynomial regression analyses that: (i) evenness contributed more than richness (E:S >= 3:1) to determining H', based on standardized partial beta-coefficients; (ii) the differential in E:S ratios increased with greater richness; (iii) the patterns of H' sample variation between maximum unevenness and perfect evenness was convexo-concave shaped; and (iv) richness as an explanatory variable of H' was likely an artifact of evenness (0-1 scale) being rescaled according to individual H' maxima. H' was redefined as a logarithm-weighted measure of evenness at a given level of richness, which means H' is either an imperfect index of diversity or a biased measure of evenness. It was also found that the fundamental components of the Shannon-Wiener index measure dominance concentration rather than evenness, with the reversal in emphasis due to multiplication of the H' equation by -1. H'-derived effective species numbers (exp H', D) increasingly deviated from those of the diversity model D=S x E in response to increasing richness (up to 69% for 35 species), particularly when evenness was between 0.15 and 0.40. Of two cross-validated H' prediction methods (P < 0.001, n = 325), the collective use of individual richness-based polynomial regression equations (r = 0.954) was better than a single multiple regression model that incorporated a broad spectrum of richness levels (r = 0.882). A simple graphic model was constructed to illustrate patterns of evenness variation as a function of changing richness and H' values. Based on the identified biases, particularly E:S ratios, it was recommended that use of H' be discontinued as a basis for assessing diversity in ecological research or, at the very least, accompanied by independent analyzes of richness and evenness.

AB Vast areas of degraded tropical forest, combined with increasing interest in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity, demonstrate the potential value of restoring tropical forest. However, there is a lack of long-term studies assessing active management for restoration. Here we investigate Above Ground Biomass (AGB), forest structure, and biodiversity, before degradation (in old-growth forest), after degradation (in abandoned agricultural savanna grassland), and within a forest that is actively being restored in Kibale National Park, Uganda. In 1995 degraded land in Kibale was protected from fire and replanted with native seedlings (39 species) at a density of 400 seedlings ha(-1). Sixty-five plots (50 m x 10 m) were established in restoration areas in 2005 and 50 of these were re-measured in 2013, allowing changes to be assessed over 18 years. Degraded plots have an Above Ground Biomass (AGB) of 5.1 Mg dry mass ha(-1), of which 80% is grass. By 2005 AGB of trees >= 10 cm DBH was 9.5 Mg ha(-1), increasing to 40.6 Mg ha(-1) by 2013, accumulating at a rate of 3.9 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). A total of 153 planted individuals ha(-1) (38%) remained by 2013, contributing 28.9 Mg ha(-1) (70%) of total AGB. Eighteen years after restoration, AGB in the plots was 12% of old-growth (419 Mg ha(-1)). If current accumulation rates continue restoration forest would reach old-growth AGB in a further 96 years. Biodiversity of degraded plots prior to restoration was low with no tree species and 2 seedling species per sample plot (0.05 ha). By 2005 restoration areas had an average of 3 tree and 3 seedling species per sample plot, increasing to 5 tree and 9 seedling species per plot in 2013. However, biodiversity was still significantly lower than old-growth forest, at 8 tree and 16 seedling species in an equivalent area. The results suggest that forest restoration is beneficial for AGB accumulation with planted stems storing the majority of AGB. Changes in biodiversity appear slower; possibly due to low stem turnover. Overall this restoration treatment is an effective means of restoring degraded land in the area, as can be seen from the lack of regeneration in degraded plots, which remain low-AGB and diversity, largely due to the impacts of fire and competition with grasses.

AB Many studies predict that climate change will cause species movement and turnover, but few have considered the effect of climate change on range fragmentation for current species and/or populations. We used MaxEnt to predict suitable habitat, fragmentation and turnover for 134 amphibian species in China under 40 future climate change scenarios spanning four pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6 and RCP8.5) and two time periods (the 2050s and 2070s). Our results show that climate change may cause a major shift in spatial patterns of amphibian diversity. Amphibians in China would lose 20% of their original ranges on average; the distribution outside current ranges would increase by 15%. Suitable habitats for over 90% of species will be located in the north of their current range, for over 95% of species in higher altitudes (from currently 137-4,124 m to 286-4,396 m in the 2050s or 314-4,448 m in the 2070s), and for over 75% of species in the west of their current range. Also, our results predict two different general responses to the climate change: some species contract their ranges while moving westwards, southwards and to higher altitudes, while others expand their ranges. Finally, our analyses indicate that range dynamics and fragmentation are related, which means that the effects of climate change on Chinese amphibians might be two-folded.

AB Current changes in shrub abundance in alpine and arctic tundra ecosystems are primarily driven by climate change. However, while taller shrub communities are expanding, dwarf shrub communities show reductions under climate warming, and the mechanisms driving the latter (such as warming temperatures or accelerated spring snowmelt) may be complex. To determine and disentangle the response of a widespread arctic-alpine prostrate dwarf shrub to both climate warming and changes in snowmelt time, we investigated phenology, clonal and sexual reproduction, leaf size, wood tissue carbon balance and leaf damage in 480 patches of Salix herbacea, along its elevational and snowmelt microhabitat range over 3years in a space-for-time substitution. Earlier snowmelt was associated with longer phenological development periods, an increased likelihood of herbivory and fungal damage, lower stem density, smaller leaves and lower end-of-season wood reserve carbohydrates. Furthermore, while early snowmelt was associated with an increased proportion of flowering stems, the proportion of fruiting stems was not, as fruit set decreased significantly with earlier snowmelt. Warmer temperatures at lower elevations were associated with lower stem numbers and larger leaves.Synthesis. Our study indicates that phenology, fitness proxies and fungal/insect damage of the dwarf shrub S.herbacea are strongly influenced by snowmelt timing, and that earlier spring snowmelt reduced performance in S.herbacea. The likely mechanisms for many of the observed patterns are related to adverse temperature conditions in the early growing season. Reductions in clonal (stem number) and sexual reproduction (reduced fruit set) under earlier snowmelt, in addition to increasing damage probability, will likely lead to lower fitness and poorer performance, particularly in shrubs growing in early-exposure microhabitats. Further, we saw few concurrent benefits of higher temperatures for S.herbacea, particularly as warming was associated with lower clonal growth. As growing seasons become warmer and longer in arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems, early snowmelt is a critical mechanism reducing fitness and performance in a widespread dwarf shrub and may ultimately reduce dwarf shrub communities in tundra biomes.

AB Detecting and estimating the degree of genetic differentiation among populations of highly mobile marine fish having pelagic larval stages is challenging because their effective population sizes can be large, and thus, little genetic drift and differentiation is expected in neutral genomic sites. However, genomic sites subject to directional selection stemming from variation in local environmental conditions can still show substantial genetic differentiation, yet these signatures can be hard to detect with low-throughput approaches. Using a pooled RAD-seq approach, we investigated genomewide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation within and among 20 populations of Atlantic herring in the Baltic Sea (and adjacent Atlantic sites), where previous low-throughput studies and/or studies based on few populations have found limited evidence for genetic differentiation. Stringent quality control was applied in the filtering of 1 791 254 SNPs, resulting in a final data set of 68 182 polymorphic loci. Clear differentiation was identified between Atlantic and Baltic populations in many genomic sites, while differentiation within the Baltic Sea area was weaker and geographically less structured. However, outlier analyses - whether including all populations or only those within the Baltic Sea uncovered hundreds of directionally selected loci in which variability was associated with either salinity, temperature or both. Hence, our results support the view that although the degree of genetic differentiation among Baltic Sea herring populations is low, there are many genomic regions showing elevated divergence, apparently as a response to temperature-and salinity-related natural selection. As such, the results add to the increasing evidence of local adaptation in highly mobile marine organisms, and those in the young Baltic Sea in particular.

AB Diversity has long been regarded as a security mechanism for improving the resilience of software and networks against various attacks. More recently, diversity has found new applications in cloud computing security, moving target defense, and improving the robustness of network routing. However, most existing efforts rely on intuitive and imprecise notions of diversity, and the few existing models of diversity are mostly designed for a single system running diverse software replicas or variants. At a higher abstraction level, as a global property of the entire network, diversity and its effect on security have received limited attention. In this paper, we take the first step toward formally modeling network diversity as a security metric by designing and evaluating a series of diversity metrics. In particular, we first devise a biodiversity-inspired metric based on the effective number of distinct resources. We then propose two complementary diversity metrics, based on the least and the average attacking efforts, respectively. We provide guidelines for instantiating the proposed metrics and present a case study on estimating software diversity. Finally, we evaluate the proposed metrics through simulation.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of micro- and macro-scale climatic processes. In agriculture, estimates of ET are frequently used to monitor droughts, schedule irrigation, and assess crop water productivity over large areas. Currently, in situ measurements of ET are difficult to scale up for regional applications, so remote sensing technology has been increasingly used to estimate crop ET. Ratio-based vegetation indices retrieved from optical remote sensing, like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, and Enhanced Vegetation Index are critical components of these models, particularly for the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation. These indices have their limitations, however, and can induce large model bias and error. In this study, micrometeorological and spectroradiometric data collected over two growing seasons in cotton, maize, and rice fields in the Central Valley of California were used to identify spectral wavelengths from 428 to 2295 nm that produced the highest correlation to and lowest error with ET, transpiration, and soil evaporation. The analysis was performed with hyperspectral narrowbands (HNBs) at 10 nm intervals and multispectral broadbands (MSBBs) commonly retrieved by Earth observation platforms. The study revealed that (1) HNB indices consistently explained more variability in ET (Delta R-2 = 0.12), transpiration (Delta R-2 = 0.17), and soil evaporation (Delta R-2 = 0.14) than MSBB indices; (2) the relationship between transpiration using the ratio-based index most commonly used for ET modeling, NDVI, was strong (R-2 = 0.51), but the hyperspectral equivalent was superior (R-2 = 0.68); and (3) soil evaporation was not estimated well using ratio-based indices from the literature (highest R-2 = 0.37), but could be after further evaluation, using ratio-based indices centered on 743 and 953 nm (R-2 = 0.72) or 428 and 1518 nm (R-2 = 0.69).

AB In Europe,like in many temperate lowlands worldwide,forest has a long history of fragmentation and land use change. In many places,forest landscapes consist of patches of different quality,age,size and isolation,embedded in a more or less intensively managed agricultural matrix. As potential biodiversity islets,small forest patches (SFP) may deliver several crucial ecosystem services to human society,but they receive little attention compared to large,relatively intact forest patches. Beyond their role as a biodiversity reservoir,SFP provide important in situ services such as timber and wild food (game,edible plants and mushrooms) production. At the landscape scale,SFP may enhance the crop production via physical (obstacle against wind and floods) and biological (sources of pollinators and natural enemies) regulation,but may,on the other hand,also be involved in the spread of infectious diseases. Depending on their geographic location,SFP can also greatly influence the water cycle and contribute to supply high-quality water to agriculture and people. Globally,SFP are important carbon sinks and are involved in nutrient cycles,thus play a role in climate change mitigation. Cultural services are more related to landscape values than to SFP per se,but the latter may contribute to the construction of community identity. We conclude that SFP,as local biodiversity hotspots in degraded landscapes,have the potential to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and may even be crucial for the ecological intensification of agro-ecosystems. There is thus an urgent need to increase our knowledge about the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services delivered by these SFP in agricultural landscapes.

AB Context Landscape spatio-temporal heterogeneity is regarded as an important driver of biodiversity. In agricultural landscapes, the composition and configuration of cultivated fields and their multi-year dynamics should be considered. But the habitat-matrix paradigm in landscape ecology has resulted in little consideration of cropped areas.
   Objectives The main objective of our study was to determine the influences of spatial and multi-year temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic on carabid beetle assemblages of agricultural landscapes.
   Methods Carabids were sampled in 40 cereal fields in western France, and their species richness, total abundance and abundance of species groups with different dispersal abilities were measured. For each sampling site, we computed different metrics that characterized crop mosaic spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We quantified relationships between carabid assemblages and heterogeneity metrics and tested their significance.
   Results Total carabid abundance increased with increase in temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic. However, all species were not influenced in the same way by spatial and temporal heterogeneity metrics. Some species with high dispersal power such as Trechus quadristriatus were more abundant in landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity, whereas the abundance of less mobile species such as Poecilus cupreus were only positively influenced by temporal crop dynamics.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic affects farmland biodiversity, at least for species that use crops during their life cycle or disperse through fields. We highlight the importance of taking this heterogeneity into account in further ecological studies on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

AB Aim Ecological niche modelling can provide valuable insight into species' environmental preferences and aid the identification of key habitats for populations of conservation concern. Here, we integrate biologging, satellite remote-sensing and ensemble ecological niche models (EENMs) to identify predictable foraging habitats for a globally important population of the grey-headed albatross (GHA) Thalassarche chrysostoma
   Location Bird Island, South Georgia; Southern Atlantic Ocean.
   Methods GPS and geolocation-immersion loggers were used to track at-sea movements and activity patterns of GHA over two breeding seasons (n = 55; brood-guard). Immersion frequency (landings per 10-min interval) was used to define foraging events. EENM combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) identified the biophysical conditions characterizing the locations of foraging events, using time-matched oceanographic predictors (Sea Surface Temperature, SST; chlorophyll a, chl-a; thermal front frequency, TFreq; depth). Model performance was assessed through iterative cross-validation and extrapolative performance through cross-validation among years.
   Results Predictable foraging habitats identified by EENM spanned neritic (<500 m), shelf break and oceanic waters, coinciding with a set of persistent biophysical conditions characterized by particular thermal ranges (3-8 degrees C, 12-13 degrees C), elevated primary productivity (chl-a > 0.5 mg m(-3)) and frequent manifestation of mesoscale thermal fronts. Our results confirm previous indications that GHA exploit enhanced foraging opportunities associated with frontal systems and objectively identify the APFZ as a region of high foraging habitat suitability. Moreover, at the spatial and temporal scales investigated here, the performance of multi-model ensembles was superior to that of single-algorithm models, and cross-validation among years indicated reasonable extrapolative performance.
   Main conclusions EENM techniques are useful for integrating the predictions of several single-algorithm models, reducing potential bias and increasing confidence in predictions. Our analysis highlights the value of EENM for use with movement data in identifying at-sea habitats of wide-ranging marine predators, with clear implications for conservation and management.

AB The widespread and intensive use of neonicotinoid insecticides induces negative cascading effects on ecosystems. It is desirable to develop a portable sensitive sensing platform for on-site screening of high-risk pesticides. We combined an indirect competitive immunoassay, highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biochip and a simple portable imaging setup for label-free detection of imidacloprid pesticides. The SPR biochip consists of several capped nanoslit arrays with different periods which form a spectral image on the chip. The qualitative and semiquantitative analyses of pesticides can be directly observed from the spot shift on the chip. The precise semiquantitative analyses can be further completed by using image processing in a smartphone. We demonstrate simultaneous detection of four different concentrations of imidacloprid pesticides. The visual detection limit is about 1 ppb, which is well below the maximum residue concentration permitted by law (20 ppb). Compared to the one-step strip assay, the proposed chip is capable of performing semiquantitative analyses and multiple detection. Compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, our method is label-free and requires simple washing steps and short reaction time. In addition, the label-free chip has a comparable sensitivity but wider working range than those labeling techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In 2013 the European Commission launched its new green infrastructure strategy to make another attempt to stop and possibly reverse the loss of biodiversity until 2020, by connecting habitats in the wider landscape. This means that conservation would go beyond current practices to include landscapes that are dominated by conventional agriculture, where biodiversity conservation plays a minor role at best. The green infrastructure strategy aims at bottom-up rather than top-down implementation, and suggests including local and regional stakeholders. Therefore, it is important to know which stakeholders influence land-use decisions concerning green infrastructure at the local and regional level. The research presented in this paper served to select stakeholders in preparation for a participatory scenario development process to analyze consequences of different implementation options of the European green infrastructure strategy. We used a mix of qualitative and quantitative social network analysis (SNA) methods to combine actors' attributes, especially concerning their perceived influence, with structural and relational measures. Further, our analysis provides information on institutional backgrounds and governance settings for green infrastructure and agricultural policy. The investigation started with key informant interviews at the regional level in administrative units responsible for relevant policies and procedures such as regional planners, representatives of federal ministries, and continued at the local level with farmers and other members of the community. The analysis revealed the importance of information flows and regulations but also of social pressure, considerably influencing biodiversity governance with respect to green infrastructure and biodiversity.

AB Aim Understanding the drivers of forest structure, function and change is a fundamental problem in both theoretical ecology and applied forestry for carbon mapping and monitoring. An important component of forest ecology research often utilizes allometric equations to scale up local measurements to predict largescale forest and ecosystem-level properties. However, both applied and theoretical allometries in forest ecology (such as metabolic scaling theory, MST) assume that many scaling relationships are insensitive to broad-scale climate gradients or species life histories. We aim to test these assumptions by mapping continentalscale forest allometry across environmental gradients in the United States. Location United States.
   Methods We fit exponents to two allometric relationships in c. 100,000 Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) field plots: (1) the relationship between the height of an individual tree and its diameter, and (2) plot-level tree size distributions. We compare fitted exponents to environmental and life-history variables, such as climate, topography and forest structure, in an attempt to explain allometric variability and deviations from theoretically predicted allometries.
   Results We find that the structural allometry of forests varies strongly as a function of location in the United States. Allometric exponents appear to asymptote at approximately where MST theory predicts with increasing forest height, while deviations from MST are partially explained as a function of environmentally driven recruitment limitations and successional status.
   Main conclusions While we find support for invariant tree and stand allometric scaling relationships in forests that are in steady state with regard to demography and resources, we also find considerable spatial variability in forest allometric relationships when steady-state conditions are violated. These findings suggest that extensions of metabolic scaling theory should incorporate variation in demographic dynamics in younger successional forests, and factors influencing recruitment limitation.

AB Empirical modeling approaches are frequently used to upscale local eddy covariance observations of carbon, water, and energy fluxes to regional and global scales. The predictive capacity of such models largely depends on the data used for parameterization and identification of input-output relationships, while prediction for conditions outside the training domain is generally uncertain. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used for the prediction of gross primary production (GPP) and latent heat flux (LE) on local and European scales with the aim to assess the portion of uncertainties in extrapolation due to sample selection. ANNs were found to be a useful tool for GPP and LE prediction, in particular for extrapolation in time (mean absolute error MAE for GPP between 0.53 and 1.56gCm(-2)d(-1)). Extrapolation in space in similar climatic and vegetation conditions also gave good results (GPP MAE 0.7-1.41gCm(-2)d(-1)), while extrapolation in areas with different seasonal cycles and controlling factors (e.g., the tropical regions) showed noticeably higher errors (GPP MAE 0.8-2.09gCm(-2)d(-1)). The distribution and the number of sites used for ANN training had a remarkable effect on prediction uncertainty in both, regional GPP and LE budgets and their interannual variability. Results obtained show that for ANN upscaling for continents with relatively small networks of sites, the error due to the sampling can be large and needs to be considered and quantified. The analysis of the spatial variability of the uncertainty helped to identify the meteorological drivers driving the uncertainty.

AB A primary goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the historical events that have facilitated the origin and spread of adaptations. When these adaptations also lead to reproductive isolation, we can learn about the evolutionary mechanisms contributing to speciation. We reveal the complex history of the gene MaMyb2 in shaping flower colour divergence within a recent radiation of monkeyflowers. In the Mimulus aurantiacus species complex, red-flowered M. a. ssp. puniceus and yellow-flowered M. a. ssp. australis are partially isolated because of differences in pollinator preferences. Phylogenetic analyses based on genome-wide variation across the complex suggest two origins of red flowers from a yellow-flowered ancestor: one in M. a. ssp. puniceus and one in M. a. ssp. flemingii. However, in both cases, red flowers are caused by cis-regulatory mutations in the gene MaMyb2. Although this could be due to distinct mutations in each lineage, we show that the red allele in M. a. ssp. puniceus did not evolve de novo or exist as standing variation in its yellow-flowered ancestor. Rather, our results suggest that a single red MaMyb2 allele evolved during the radiation of M. aurantiacus that was subsequently transferred to the yellow-flowered ancestor of M. a. ssp. puniceus via introgressive hybridization. Because gene flow is still possible among taxa, we conclude that introgressive hybridization can be a potent driver of adaptation at the early stages of divergence that can contribute to the origins of biodiversity.

AB Genome-scale sequence data have become increasingly available in the phylogenetic studies for understanding the evolutionary histories of species. However, it is challenging to develop probabilistic models to account for heterogeneity of phylogenomic data. The multispecies coalescent model describes gene trees as independent random variables generated from a coalescence process occurring along the lineages of the species tree. Since the multispecies coalescent model allows gene trees to vary across genes, coalescent-based methods have been popularly used to account for heterogeneous gene trees in phylogenomic data analysis. In this paper, we summarize and evaluate the performance of coalescent-based methods for estimating species trees from genome-scale sequence data. We investigate the effects of deep coalescence and mutation on the performance of species tree estimation methods. We found that the coalescent-based methods perform well in estimating species trees for a large number of genes, regardless of the degree of deep coalescence and mutation. The performance of the coalescent methods is negatively correlated with the lengths of internal branches of the species tree.

AB Fungi in the genus Metarhizium are insect pathogens able to function in other niches, including soil and plant rhizosphere habitats. In agroecosystems, cropping and tillage practices influence soil fungal communities with unknown effects on the distribution of Metarhizium, whose presence can reduce populations of crop pests. We report results from a selective media survey of Metarhizium in soils sampled from a long-term experimental farming project in the mid-Atlantic region. Field plots under soybean cultivation produced higher numbers of Metarhizium colony-forming units (cfu) than corn or alfalfa. Plots managed organically and via chisel-till harboured higher numbers of Metarhizium cfu than no-till plots. Sequence typing of Metarhizium isolates revealed four species, with M.robertsii and M.brunneum predominating. The M.brunneum population was essentially fixed for a single clone as determined by multilocus microsatellite genotyping. In contrast, M.robertsii was found to contain significant diversity, with the majority of isolates distributed between two principal clades. Evidence for recombination was observed only in the most abundant clade. These findings illuminate multiple levels of Metarhizium diversity that can be used to inform strategies by which soil Metarhizium populations may be manipulated to exert downward pressure on pest insects and promote plant health.

AB Human well-being highly depends on ecosystem services and this dependence is expected to increase in the future with increasing population and economic growth. Studies that investigate trade-offs between ecosystem services are urgently needed for informing policy-makers. We examine the trade-offs between a provisioning (revenues from timber selling) and regulating (carbon storage and sequestration) ecosystem services among seven alternative forest management regimes in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimate the potential of the landscape to produce harvest revenues and store/sequester carbon across a 50-year time period. Then, we identify conflicts between harvest revenues and carbon storage and sequestration. Finally, we apply multiobjective optimization to find optimal combinations of forest management regimes that maximize harvest revenues and carbon storage/sequestration. Our results show that no management regime alone is able to either maximize harvest revenues or carbon services and that a combination of different regimes is needed. We also show that with a relatively little economic investment (5% decrease in harvest revenues), a substantial increase in carbon services could be attained (9% for carbon storage; 15-23% for carbon sequestration). We conclude that it is possible to achieve win-win situations applying diversified forest management planning at a landscape level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Symbionts can have mutualistic effects that increase their host's fitness and/or parasitic effects that reduce it. Which of these strategies evolves depends in part on the balance of their costs and benefits to the symbiont. We have examined these questions in Wolbachia, a vertically transmitted endosymbiont of insects that can provide protection against viral infection and/or parasitically manipulate its hosts' reproduction. Across multiple symbiont strains we find that the parasitic phenotype of cytoplasmic incompatibility and antiviral protection are uncorrelated. Strong antiviral protection is associated with substantial reductions in other fitness-related traits, whereas no such trade-off was detected for cytoplasmic incompatibility. The reason for this difference is likely that antiviral protection requires high symbiont densities but cytoplasmic incompatibility does not. These results are important for the use of Wolbachia to block dengue virus transmission by mosquitoes, as natural selection to reduce these costs may lead to reduced symbiont density and the loss of antiviral protection.

AB Individual-based landscape genetic methods have become increasingly popular for quantifying fine-scale landscape influences on gene flow. One complication for individual-based methods is that gene flow and landscape variables are often correlated with geography. Partial statistics, particularly Mantel tests, are often employed to control for these inherent correlations by removing the effects of geography while simultaneously correlating measures of genetic differentiation and landscape variables of interest. Concerns about the reliability of Mantel tests prompted this study, in which we use simulated landscapes to evaluate the performance of partial Mantel tests and two ordination methods, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and redundancy analysis (RDA), for detecting isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by landscape resistance (IBR). Specifically, we described the effects of suitable habitat amount, fragmentation and resistance strength on metrics of accuracy (frequency of correct results, type I/II errors and strength of IBR according to underlying landscape and resistance strength) for each test using realistic individual-based gene flow simulations. Mantel tests were very effective for detecting IBD, but exhibited higher error rates when detecting IBR. Ordination methods were overall more accurate in detecting IBR, but had high type I errors compared to partial Mantel tests. Thus, no one test outperformed another completely. A combination of statistical tests, for example partial Mantel tests to detect IBD paired with appropriate ordination techniques for IBR detection, provides the best characterization of fine-scale landscape genetic structure. Realistic simulations of empirical data sets will further increase power to distinguish among putative mechanisms of differentiation.

AB Lipid peroxidation products are widely used as markers of oxidative damage in the organism. To properly interpret the information provided by these markers, it is necessary to know potential sources of bias and control confounding factors. Here, we investigated the relationship between two indicators of lipid mobilization (circulating levels of triglycerides and cholesterol) and two common markers of oxidative damage (plasma levels of malondialdehyde and hydroperoxides; the latter estimated from the d-ROMs assay kit). The following five avian species were studied: red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor), marsh harrier (Circus aeroginosus), and Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus). In all cases, plasma triglyceride levels positively and significantly correlated with lipid peroxidation markers, explaining between 8% and 34% of their variability. Plasma cholesterol, in contrast, showed a significant positive relationship only among spotless starling nestlings and a marginally significant association in zebra finches. These results indicate that lipid peroxidation marker levels covary with circulating lipid levels. We discuss the potential causes and implications of this covariation and recommend that future studies that measure oxidative damage using lipid peroxidation markers report both raw and relative levels (i.e., corrected for circulating triglycerides). Whether the observed pattern also holds for other tissues and in other taxa would deserve further research.

AB Most metacommunity studies have taken a direct mechanistic approach, aiming to model the effects of local and regional processes on local communities within a metacommunity. An alternative approach is to focus on emergent patterns at the metacommunity level through applying the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS; Oikos, 97, 2002, 237) analysis. The EMS approach has very rarely been applied in the context of a comparative analysis of metacommunity types of main microbial, plant, and animal groups. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no study has associated metacommunity types with their potential ecological correlates in the freshwater realm. We assembled data for 45 freshwater metacommunities, incorporating biologically highly disparate organismal groups (i.e., bacteria, algae, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish). We first examined ecological correlates (e.g., matrix properties, beta diversity, and average characteristics of a metacommunity, including body size, trophic group, ecosystem type, life form, and dispersal mode) of the three elements of metacommunity structure (i.e., coherence, turnover, and boundary clumping). Second, based on those three elements, we determined which metacommunity types prevailed in freshwater systems and which ecological correlates best discriminated among the observed metacommunity types. We found that the three elements of metacommunity structure were not strongly related to the ecological correlates, except that turnover was positively related to beta diversity. We observed six metacommunity types. The most common were Clementsian and quasi-nested metacommunity types, whereas Random, quasi-Clementsian, Gleasonian, and quasi-Gleasonian types were less common. These six metacommunity types were best discriminated by beta diversity and the first axis of metacommunity ecological traits, ranging from metacommunities of producer organisms occurring in streams to those of large predatory organisms occurring in lakes. Our results showed that focusing on the emergent properties of multiple metacommunities provides information additional to that obtained in studies examining variation in local community structure within a metacommunity.

AB We present a Holocene summer air temperature reconstruction based on fossil chironomids from Lake Brazi (1740m.a.s.l.), a shallow mountain lake in the South Carpathians. Summer air temperature reconstruction was performed using transfer functions based on the Swiss (Sw-TF) and the merged Norwegian-Swiss calibration data set (NS-TF). Our results suggest that summer air temperatures increased rapidly from the onset of the early Holocene onwards (ca. 11,500-10,200cal. yr BP), reaching close to present July air temperatures (11.2 degrees C). Between ca. 10,200 and 8500cal. yr BP mean reconstructed temperatures increased further by 1.5-2.0 degrees C. Later on, from ca. 8500cal. yr BP, chironomid-based summer temperatures started to decrease, although mean values were still above present-day temperatures. The next time period (ca. 6000-3000cal. yr BP) was cooler and with less variable temperature conditions than earlier. Afterwards (ca. 3000-2000cal. yr BP), a sharp decrease occurred in inferred temperatures with values under present-day conditions by 1.8 degrees C. Finally, in the last 2000years, reconstructed temperatures showed again an increasing trend at Lake Brazi. Short-term temperature declines of 0.6-1.2 degrees C were observed between ca. 10,350-10,190, 9750-9500, 8700-8500, 7600-7300, 7100-6900 and 4400-4000cal. yr BP. These temperature declines are, however, within the estimated error of prediction of the chironomid-based inferences. Generally, our reconstructed temperatures complied with the summer insolation curve at 45 degrees N, with other proxy-records (i.e. pollen and diatoms) from the same sediment and with other records from the Carpathians and from Western Europe.

AB The relationship between soil fauna groups and different fertilization regimes has been of continuous concern. Little attention has been paid to the response of soil fauna to changes in soil fertility. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the response of soil fauna communities to fertilizer management practices, to explore the inter-relationships between soil fauna communities and fertilization regimes so as to identify soil fauna species or groups that are sensitive to changes in soil fertility. This long-term fertilization experiment was conducted with a no fertilizer control and six fertilization regimes: CK (control, no fertilizer), N (synthetic N fertilizer), NPK (synthetic fertilizer: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), OM (pig manure), OMNPK (pig manure plus nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), RSD (crop residues returned) and RSDNPK (crop residues returned with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). The application of organic fertilizers (i.e., pig manure or crop residues) promoted the diversity of the soil fauna communities due to the abundant organic matter the fertilizers supplied for the communities' survival and development. Furthermore, organic inorganic compound fertilizers (i.e., treatment of OMNPK or RSDNPK) were beneficial for richness and diversity of soil fauna communities due to their abundance of organic matter and supply of nutrients. Indices of soil fauna communities (i.e., TI, the DG (density-group) index, the number of individuals of Nemata, Lumbricida, Collembola and Oribatida) showed the same trend with an increase in the soil organic matter. Therefore, indices of soil fauna communities can be applied to indicate certain features of soil fertility, such as soil organic matter content, but they cannot be used to reflect integrated assessment for soil fertility.

AB Eddy covariance nighttime fluxes are uncertain due to potential measurement biases. Many studies report eddy covariance nighttime flux lower than flux from extrapolated chamber measurements, despite corrections for low turbulence. We compared eddy covariance and chamber estimates of ecosystem respiration at the GLEES Ameriflux site over seven growing seasons under high turbulence [summer night mean friction velocity (u*)=0.7ms(-1)], during which bark beetles killed or infested 85% of the aboveground respiring biomass. Chamber-based estimates of ecosystem respiration during the growth season, developed from foliage, wood, and soil CO2 efflux measurements, declined 35% after 85% of the forest basal area had been killed or impaired by bark beetles (from 7.1 +/- 0.22molm(-2)s(-1) in 2005 to 4.6 +/- 0.16molm(-2)s(-1) in 2011). Soil efflux remained at 3.3molm(-2)s(-1) throughout the mortality, while the loss of live wood and foliage and their respiration drove the decline of the chamber estimate. Eddy covariance estimates of fluxes at night remained constant over the same period, 3.0molm(-2)s(-1) for both 2005 (intact forest) and 2011 (85% basal area killed or impaired). Eddy covariance fluxes were lower than chamber estimates of ecosystem respiration (60% lower in 2005, and 32% in 2011), but the mean night estimates from the two techniques were correlated within a year (r(2) from 0.18 to 0.60). The difference between the two techniques was not the result of inadequate turbulence, because the results were robust to a u* filter of >0.7ms(-1). The decline in the average seasonal difference between the two techniques was strongly correlated with overstory leaf area (r(2)=0.92). The discrepancy between methods of respiration estimation should be resolved to have confidence in ecosystem carbon flux estimates.

AB Cichorieae, one of the six tribes of the sub-family Cichorioideae (Asteraceae), produces a well-recognisable fenestrate pollen type. In the Mediterranean area, the significance of high percentages of Cichorieae pollen from archaeological layers is still questioned. We assessed the presence of Cichorieae as indicators of open habitats and pasturelands in current plant communities by comparing data on vegetation composition with pollen spectra from two Hellenistic sites of Basilicata (southern Italy): Difesa San Biagio in the low valley of the river Bradano and Torre di Satriano in the Lucanian Apennines. We also analysed the pollen morphology bringing to the discrimination of size classes within the fenestrate type of Cichorieae. Pollen spectra from the considered archaeological sites have low forest cover (7% on average); Asteraceae and Poaceae are prevalent; Cichorieae account to ca. 23%; coprophilous fungal spores are varied and present high concentrations. In surface soil samples collected near the sites, Cichorieae pollen is about 12%. In current vegetation types, an increasing abundance of Cichorieae was observed from salt marshes, forests and shrublands to open habitats and grasslands. This is coherent with the actual land cover around the study sites and the findings of the archaeological sample that point to an open landscape dominated by pastures and cultivated fields. Our integrated approach confirmed that today Cichorieae are common in secondary pastures and in some types of primary open habitats of southern Italy: hence, high percentages of this pollen can be considered a good indicator of these habitats even in past environment reconstructions.

AB This study investigates the performances of different optical indices to estimate gross primary production (GPP) of herbaceous stratum in a Mediterranean savanna with different nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) availability. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence yield computed at 760 nm (Fy760), scaled photochemical reflectance index (sPRI), MERIS terrestrial-chlorophyll index (MTCI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were computed from near-surface field spectroscopy measurements collected using high spectral resolution spectrometers covering the visible near-infrared regions. GPP was measured using canopy chambers on the same locations sampled by the spectrometers. We tested whether light-use efficiency (LUE) models driven by remote-sensing quantities (RSMs) can better track changes in GPP caused by nutrient supplies compared to those driven exclusively by meteorological data (MM). Particularly, we compared the performances of different RSM formulations -relying on the use of Fy760 or sPRI as a proxy for LUE and NDVI or MTCI as a fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f APAR) - with those of classical MM.
   Results showed higher GPP in the N-fertilized experimental plots during the growing period. These differences in GPP disappeared in the drying period when senescence effects masked out potential differences due to plant N content. Consequently, although MTCI was closely related to the mean of plant N content across treatments (r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.01), it was poorly related to GPP (r(2) = 0.45, p < 0.05). On the contrary sPRI and Fy760 correlated well with GPP during the whole measurement period. Results revealed that the relationship between GPP and Fy760 is not unique across treatments, but it is affected by N availability. Results from a cross-validation analysis showed that MM (AIC(cv) = 127, MEcv = 0.879) outperformed RSM (AIC(cv) = 140, MEcv = 0.8737) when soil moisture was used to constrain the seasonal dynamic of LUE. However, residual analyses demonstrated that GPP predictions with MM are inaccurate whenever no climatic variable explicitly reveals nutrient-related changes in the LUE parameter. These results suggest that RSM is a valuable means to diagnose nutrient-induced effects on the photosynthetic activity.

AB There are several software process models and methodologies such as waterfall, spiral and agile. Even so, the rate of successful software development projects is low. Since software is the major output of software processes, increasing software process management quality should increase the project's chances of success. Organizations have invested to adapt software processes to their environments and the characteristics of projects to improve the productivity and quality of the products. In this paper, we present a procedure to detect problems of processes in software development projects using Bayesian networks. The procedure was successfully applied to Scrum-based software development projects. The research results should encourage the usage of Bayesian networks to manage software processes and increase the rate of successful software development projects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Final ecosystem services (i.e. services that directly benefit humanity) depend fundamentally upon the various processes, regulated by organisms, which underpin ecosystem functioning and maintain ecosystem structures. Such processes include inter alia primary productivity, detritus decomposition, pollination, soil formation, and nutrient uptake and fixation. Insights into the abiotic, biotic, and spatial factors regulating these supporting ecosystem processes have arisen from within multiple fields of ecology which have not always been well integrated, including research on biodiversityecosystem functioning (B-EF) and biodiversityecosystem service (B-ES) relationships, meta-ecosystem ecology, and ecological resilience. Here, we draw together insights from these fields towards a framework suitable for addressing impacts of human disturbances on ecosystem processes and the services they support. We further discuss application of portfolio theory and a trait-based framework as unifying approaches in the assessment and management of ecosystem functioning and services, and identify a set of resilience attributes useful for assessing the resilience of ecosystem structure, functioning, and service delivery. Finally, we discuss future research challenges and opportunities, including uncertainties involved in linking species traits and interactions with ecosystem functioning and services. We conclude that the necessary theory and tools are already in place to begin the unification of B-EF, B-ES, meta-ecosystem, and resilience frameworks and to test their application in the assessment and management of ecosystem services.

AB Plant communities in abiotically stressful, or 'harsh', habitats have been reported to be less invaded by non-native species than those in more moderate habitats. Here, we synthesize descriptive and experimental evidence for low levels of invasion in habitats characterized by a variety of environmental stressors: low nitrogen; low phosphorus; saline, sodic or alkaline soils; serpentine soils; low soil moisture; shallow/rocky soils; temporary inundation; high shade; high elevation; and high latitude. We then discuss major categories of hypotheses to explain this pattern: the propagule limitation mechanism suggests invasion of harsh sites is limited by relatively low arrival rates of propagules compared with more moderate habitats, while invasion resistance mechanisms suggest that harsh habitats are inherently less invasible due to stressful abiotic conditions and/or increased effects of biotic resistance from resident organisms. Both propagule limitation and invasion resistance may simultaneously contribute to low invadedness of harsh sites, but the management implications of these mechanisms differ. If propagule limitation is more important, managers should focus on reducing the likelihood of propagule introductions. If invasion resistance mechanisms are in play, managers should focus on restoring or maintaining harsh conditions at a site to reduce invasibility.

AB Modern silviculture has led to a reduction in deadwood, especially that of large diameter, and thus the loss of an important habitat niche in most European forests. We analyzed the significance of deadwood for the total species diversity in three plant groups (bryophytes, lichens, and vascular plants) in one of Central Europe's few remnants of unmanaged old-growth forest. The site is a montane forest of Picea abies on Mt. Brocken, Harz Mountains, Germany, which has not been managed for at least several centuries, undergoes natural forest dynamics, and thus harbors large amounts of standing and downed deadwood. Epiphyte vegetation of live trees and the ground vegetation were studied for comparison. We did not find any obligate deadwood species. Nevertheless, 84 % (70 species) of the total species were found on standing or downed deadwood. One-third of these species, or 28 % of the total species in the forest, were only sampled on deadwood, whereas the remaining species were also found on live trees and/or the ground. Bryophytes were the largest group of species on deadwood (47 % of the deadwood-inhabiting species), followed by lichens (37 %) and vascular plants (16 %). Large-diameter deadwood in an advanced stage of decay harbored more species than smaller fragments in the early stages of decay. Despite the lack of obligate deadwood colonizers, deadwood apparently plays a key role for forest plant diversity, mainly by providing an environment with low competition and thus facilitating the establishment of species.

AB Since the 1980s, the Virunga mountain gorilla population has almost doubled, now reaching 480 individuals living in a 430-km(2) protected area. Analysis of the gorillas' ranging patterns can provide critical information on the extent and possible effects of competition for food and space. We analyzed 12 years of daily ranging data and inter-group encounter data collected on 11 gorilla groups monitored by the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda. During that period, the study population increased in size by almost 50% and the number of groups tripled. Groups had small yearly home ranges compared to other known gorilla populations, with an average 90% kernel density estimate of 8.07 km(2) and large between-group variations (3.17-23.59 km(2)). Most groups had consistent home range location over the course of the study but for some, we observed gradual range shifts of up to 4 km. Neighboring groups displayed high home range overlap, which increased dramatically after the formation of new groups. On average, each group used only 28.6% of its 90% kernel home range exclusively, and in some areas up to six different groups had overlapping home ranges with little or no exclusive areas. We found a significant intra-group positive relationship between the number of weaned individuals in a group and the home range size, but the fitted models only explained 17.5% and 13.7% of the variance in 50% and 90% kernel home range size estimates, respectively. This suggests that despite the increase in size, the study population is not yet experiencing marked effects of feeding competition. However, the increase in home range overlap resulting from the formation of new groups led to a sixfold increase in the frequency of inter-group encounters, which exposes the population to elevated risks of fight-related injuries and infanticide.

AB Comparison of the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and trait dimensions of beta diversity may uncover the mechanisms that generate and maintain biodiversity, such as geographic isolation, environmental filtering, and convergent adaptation. We developed an approach to predict the relationship between environmental and geographic distance and the dimensions of beta diversity. We tested these predictions using hummingbird assemblages in the northern Andes. We expected taxonomic beta diversity to result from recent geographic barriers limiting dispersal, and we found that cost distance, which includes barriers, was a better predictor than Euclidean distance. We expected phylogenetic beta diversity to result from historical connectivity and found that differences in elevation were the best predictors of phylogenetic beta diversity. We expected high trait beta diversity to result from local adaptation to differing environments and found that differences in elevation were correlated with trait beta diversity. When combining beta diversity dimensions, we observe that high beta diversity in all dimensions results from adaption to different environments between isolated assemblages. Comparisons with high taxonomic, low phylogenetic, and low trait beta diversity occurred among lowland assemblages separated by the Andes, suggesting that geographic barriers have recently isolated lineages in similar environments. We provide insight into mechanisms governing hummingbird biodiversity patterns and provide a framework that is broadly applicable to other taxonomic groups.

AB Testosterone is a key hormone for the development of secondary sexual characters and dimorphisms in behavior and morphology of male vertebrates. Because females often express detectable levels of testosterone, testosterone has been suggested to also play a role in the modulation of secondary sexual traits in females. Previous comparative analyses in birds and fish demonstrated a relationship between male-to-female testosterone ratios and the degree of sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, female maximum testosterone was related to mating system and coloniality. Here, we reevaluate these previous ideas using phylogenetic analyses and effect size measures for the relationship between birds' male-to-female maximum testosterone levels. Further, we investigate the seasonal androgen response of female birds (the difference from baseline to maximum testosterone), which in males is strongly related to mating system. We could not confirm a relationship between male-to-female testosterone, maximum female testosterone, or the seasonal androgen response of females with any life-history parameter. We conclude that the expectation that testosterone regulates traits in females in a similar manner as in males should be reconsidered. This expectation may be partially due to hormone manipulation studies using pharmacological doses of testosterone that had similar effects in females than in males but may be of limited importance for the physiological range of testosterone concentrations occurring within ecological and evolutionary contexts. Thus, the assumption that circulating testosterone should covary with ecologically relevant secondary sexual traits in females may be misleading: selection pressures on females differ from those on males and females may regulate behavior differently.

AB Species adapted to cold-climatic mountain environments are expected to face a high risk of range contractions, if not local extinctions under climate change. Yet, the populations of many endothermic species may not be primarily affected by physiological constraints, but indirectly by climate-induced changes of habitat characteristics. In mountain forests, where vertebrate species largely depend on vegetation composition and structure, deteriorating habitat suitability may thus be mitigated or even compensated by habitat management aiming at compositional and structural enhancement. We tested this possibility using four cold-adapted bird species with complementary habitat requirements as model organisms. Based on species data and environmental information collected in 300 1-km(2) grid cells distributed across four mountain ranges in central Europe, we investigated (1) how species' occurrence is explained by climate, landscape, and vegetation, (2) to what extent climate change and climate-induced vegetation changes will affect habitat suitability, and (3) whether these changes could be compensated by adaptive habitat management. Species presence was modelled as a function of climate, landscape and vegetation variables under current climate; moreover, vegetation-climate relationships were assessed. The models were extrapolated to the climatic conditions of 2050, assuming the moderate IPCC-scenario A1B, and changes in species' occurrence probability were quantified. Finally, we assessed the maximum increase in occurrence probability that could be achieved by modifying one or multiple vegetation variables under altered climate conditions. Climate variables contributed significantly to explaining species occurrence, and expected climatic changes, as well as climate-induced vegetation trends, decreased the occurrence probability of all four species, particularly at the low-altitudinal margins of their distribution. These effects could be partly compensated by modifying single vegetation factors, but full compensation would only be achieved if several factors were changed in concert. The results illustrate the possibilities and limitations of adaptive species conservation management under climate change.

AB Species distribution modelling has become a common approach in ecology in the last decades. As in any modelling exercise, evaluation of the predicted suitability surfaces is a key process, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) has become the most popular statistic for this purpose. A close covariation between the AUC and threshold-dependent discrimination measures (sensitivity Se and specificity Sp) raises into question the advantage of the threshold-independence of the AUC. In this study, the relationship between the AUC and several threshold-dependent discrimination measures is characterized in detail, and the sensitivity of the pattern to variations in the shape of the ROC curve is assessed. Hypothetical suitability values, coming from normal and skew-normal distributions, were simulated for both instances of presence and absence. The flexibility of the skew-normal distribution allowed for the simulation of a wide range of ROC curve configurations. The relationship between the AUC and threshold-dependent measures was graphically assessed; independently of the ROC curve shape, a nonlinear asymptotic relationship between the AUC and Se (and Sp) was obtained after applying the threshold that makes Se = Sp. A nonlinear asymptotic relationship between the AUC and the Youden index was also reported. These results imply that the AUC does not appropriately measure changes in the discrimination of models, and it is especially incapable of distinguishing between models with high discrimination capacity. Se or Sp derived from the application of the threshold that makes them equal is a preferred measure of discrimination power. Together with the rate of false positives and negatives, and with the prevalence of the species, these statistics provide more information about the discrimination capacity of the models than the AUC.

AB Macroinvertebrate assemblages of temporary ponds are ideal model systems to explore biodiversity patterns and metacommunity ecology. In addition, the study of the environmental variables driving such biodiversity patterns is essential in establishing proper guidelines for the conservation of the singular fauna of temporary ponds, especially since such ponds are vulnerable systems. We analysed the macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental characteristics of 80 ponds spread across the Donana National Park, SW Spain to (i) analyse macroinvertebrate -diversity and metacommunity structure; and (ii) discern the main environmental and spatial drivers of these patterns. The pond network was highly heterogeneous as temporary ponds were highly variable. Macroinvertebrate -diversity partitioning showed that species replacement made the greatest contribution to total -diversity while the contribution of nestedness was small. The macroinvertebrate community structure and -diversity were similarly driven by: electrical conductivity (and co-variables alkalinity, pH, and ion concentrations), plant richness (and the co-variable pond surface area), maximum depth, marsh, and coastal proximity as well as two spatial descriptors extracted from Moran's eigenvector maps. The spatial descriptors indicated that large interpond distances were involved, suggesting that species dispersal limitations only take place over long distances in the area. Those taxa that departed from the general nested pattern, termed idiosyncratic, significantly contributed to the maintenance of high pond network diversity through the species replacement and occurred within particular environmental conditions in the pond network. These results reveal that environmental heterogeneity and connectivity are key factors in the preservation of high macroinvertebrate diversity in nested pond networks with high numbers of idiosyncratic species.

AB Although plant growth in alpine steppes on the Tibetan Plateau has been suggested to be sensitive to nitrogen (N) addition, the N limitation conditions of alpine steppes remain uncertain.
   After 2 years of fertilization with NH4NO3 at six rates (0, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), the responses of plant and soil parameters as well as N2O fluxes were measured.
   At the vegetation level, N addition resulted in an increase in the aboveground N pool from 0.5 +/- 0.1 g m(-2) in the control plots to 1.9 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) in the plots at the highest N input rate. The aboveground C pool, biomass N concentration, foliar delta N-15, soil NO3 (-)-N and N2O flux were also increased by N addition. However, as the N fertilization rate increased from 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) to 160 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), the N-use efficiency decreased from 12.3 +/- 4.6 kg C kg N-1 to 1.6 +/- 0.2 kg C kg N-1, and the N-uptake efficiency decreased from 43.2 +/- 9.7 % to 9.1 +/- 1.1 %. Biomass N:P ratios increased from 14.4 +/- 2.6 in the control plots to 20.5 +/- 0.8 in the plots with the highest N input rate. Biomass N:P ratios, N-uptake efficiency and N-use efficiency flattened out at 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Above this level, soil NO3 (-)-N began to accumulate. The seasonal average N2O flux of growing season nonlinearly increased with increased N fertilization rate and linearly increased with the weighted average foliar delta N-15.
   At the species level, N uptake responses to relative N availability were species-specific. Biomass N concentration of seven out of the eight non-legume species increased significantly with N fertilization rates, while Kobresia macrantha and the one legume species (Oxytropics glacialis) remained stable. Both the non-legume and the legume species showed significant N-15 enrichment with increasing N fertilization rate. All non-legume species showed significant increased N:P ratios with increased N fertilization rate, but not the legume species.
   Our findings suggest that the Tibetan alpine steppes might be N-saturated above a critical N load of 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). For the entire Tibetan Plateau (ca. 2.57 million km(2)), a low N deposition rate (10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) could enhance plant growth, and stimulate aboveground N and C storage by at least 1.1 +/- 0.3 Tg N yr(-1) and 31.5 +/- 11.8 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. The non-legume species was N-limited, but the legume species was not limited by N.

AB Since the 19th Century, two regions have been recognized for North American mammals, which overlap in Mexico. The Nearctic region corresponds to the northern areas and the Neotropical region corresponds to the southern ones. There are no recent regionalizations for these regions under the criterion of endemism. In the present study, we integrate two methods to regionalize North America, using species distribution models of mammals: endemicity analysis (EA) and parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE). EA was used to obtain areas of endemism and PAE was used to hierarchize them. We found 76 consensus areas from 329 sets classified in 146 cladograms, and the strict consensus cladogram shows a basal polytomy with 14 areas and 16 clades. The final regionalization recognizes two regions (Nearctic and Neotropical) and a transition zone (Mexican Transition Zone), six subregions (Canadian, Alleghanian, Californian-Rocky Mountain, Pacific Central America, Mexican Gulf-Central America, and Central America), two dominions (Californian and Rocky Mountain), and 23 provinces. Our analysis show that North America is probably more complex than previously assumed.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 485-499.

AB In many countries, plantation forestry depends mostly on a small number of fast-growing exotic species (mainly eucalypts and pines). These species are highly productive but may also become invasive in the communities surrounding plantations. The spread of alien species depends on characteristics of the species itself (species invasiveness) and of the host community (community invasibility), so that some habitats are more vulnerable than others to the invasion of a given species. Our aim in this study is to assess the ability of Eucalyptus globulus to spread in the absence of fire from plantations into the three most common types of surrounding habitats in the study area (NW Spain; native forests, pine plantations and shrublands) and to make recommendations to minimize the risk of spread. We independently assessed propagule pressure and community invasibility by measuring (1) the amount of seeds of E. globulus reaching different distances from the edge of plantations, and (2) seedling emergence and survival in the three types of habitats mentioned. We then estimated the density of seedling and sapling recruitment at different distances from plantation edges by means of a stochastic model parameterized with field data. Seed dispersal distances up to 80 m were recorded, with the frequency distribution of dispersal distances being strongly leptokurtic. Most E. globulus seeds were recorded in the first 5 m from plantation edges (84.3%), and 98.6% in the first 15 m. Native forests were the most resistant to E. globulus spread, showing lower seedling emergence (0.9% vs. 3.3% and 2.2% in shrublands and pine plantations) and survival (3.7% vs. 17.5% and 19.9% up to 6 months). Despite relatively low establishment success ratio, high seed production leads to considerable seedling densities in surrounding habitats, especially in pine plantations and shrublands. In order to control E. globulus spread, we recommend eliminating all new recruits in a safety belt around plantations (e.g. a 15-m wide belt could reduce recruitment in c. 95%) while they can be easily uprooted (1-2 years) and have not reached sexual maturity. Given the resistance of native forests to eucalypt establishment, fostering this type of vegetation in those belts would facilitate their maintenance and increase their effectiveness.

AB Questions: How is the loss of plant species richness, associated with invasions, related to changes in functional diversity? What is the relationship between the traits of invasive species and those of invaded communities?
   Location: Different Central European vegetation types within the Czech Republic.
   Methods: Functional diversity was calculated for 260-paired releves, half non-invaded and half invaded by one of 13 widespread invasive species in Central Europe. Four traits (height, SLA, seed mass and clonal index) were considered as a way to understand the functional space occupied by native and alien species in the data set (410 species altogether).
   Results: Some of the functional diversity (FD) indices used (mean trait dissimilarity, mean nearest neighbour dissimilarity and SD of the mean nearest neighbour dissimilarity) revealed higher trait diversity for the invaded vegetation and negative relationship with species richness, while functional richness and evenness gave higher values for the uninvaded vegetation and positive relationship with species richness. Adding hypothetically the invader into the FD calculations for the uninvaded vegetation was found to increase most of the FD indices used, while excluding it from the FD calculations of the invaded vegetation decreased functional richness and also mean trait dissimilarity.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that invading aliens tend to be functionally different from native species and are therefore likely to occupy an empty niche in the invaded vegetation. Similarly, the resident species in the non-invaded communities are not likely to occupy the whole potential niche space, which could remain available for the invasive species with different traits. This study suggests that the probability of a successful invasion is related to functional dissimilarities between the alien invader and native species of the resident communities.

AB The mechanisms by which bivalve molluscs differentiate among particles are not clearly understood. Recent evidence suggests that particle selection by bivalves can be mediated by interactions between carbohydrates attached to a particle's surface and lectins present in the mucus covering the feeding organs. The physicochemical surface properties of particles have also been proposed as factors contributing to particle selection. In this study, we examined the effects of surface charge and wettability of 10-mu m spheres on particle selection by two species of suspension-feeding bivalves: eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). Microspheres were delivered to bivalves in particle-selection assays, and the proportions of spheres rejected as pseudofeces and egested as feces were determined using flow cytometry. Results suggest that when given a choice, both mussels and oysters rejected some types of microspheres (e.g., aluminum oxide) and ingested other types (e.g., polystyrene). In some assays, microspheres with very different surface charges or wettabilities were handled similarly, indicating that neither property alone was a qualifier for selection. The differences in surface properties between pairs of microspheres were also considered and used as variables in discriminant analyses. For oysters and mussels, the generated models explained ca. 25% and 72% of the variation in the data, respectively. In both models, wettability was more important than charge in classifying data into their correct group (rejected, preferentially ingested, or not selected). Results from this study support the idea that non-specific physicochemical interactions can play a role in mediating selection in suspension-feeding bivalves. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Human-carnivore conflicts are complex and are influenced by: the spatial distribution of the conflict species; the organisation and intensity of management measures such as zoning; historical experience with wildlife; land use patterns; and local cultural traditions. We have used a geographically stratified sampling of social values and attitudes to provide a novel perspective to the human - wildlife conflict. We have focused on acceptance by and disagreements between residents (measured as Potential Conflict Index; PCI) towards illegal hunting of four species of large carnivores (bear, lynx, wolf, wolverine). The study is based on surveys of residents in every municipality in Sweden and Norway who were asked their opinion on illegal hunting. Our results show how certain social values are associated with acceptance of poaching, and how these values differ geographically independent of carnivore abundance. Our approach differs from traditional survey designs, which are often biased towards urban areas. Although these traditional designs intend to be representative of a region (i.e. a random sample from a country), they tend to receive relatively few respondents from rural areas that experience the majority of conflict with carnivores. Acceptance of poaching differed significantly between Norway (12.7-15.7% of respondents) and Sweden (3.3-4.1% of respondents). We found the highest acceptance of illegal hunting in rural areas with free-ranging sheep and strong hunting traditions. Disagreements between residents (as measured by PCI) were highest in areas with intermediate population density. There was no correlation between carnivore density and either acceptance of illegal hunting or PCI. A strong positive correlation between acceptance of illegal hunting and PCI showed that areas with high acceptance of illegal hunting are areas with high potential conflict between people. Our results show that spatially-stratified surveys are required to reveal the large scale patterns in social dynamics of human-wildlife conflicts.

AB In plant ecophysiology, functional leaf traits are generally not assessed in relation to phenological phase of the canopy. Leaf traits measured in deciduous perennial species are known to vary between spring and summer seasons, but there is a knowledge gap relating to the late-summer phase marked by growth cessation and bud set occurring well before fall leaf senescence. The effects of phenology on canopy physiology were tested using a common garden of over 2,000 black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) individuals originating from a wide geographical range (44-60A(0)N). Annual phenological events and 12 leaf-based functional trait measurements were collected spanning the entire summer season prior to, and following, bud set. Patterns of seasonal trait change emerged by synchronizing trees using their date of bud set. In particular, photosynthetic, mass, and N-based traits increased substantially following bud set. Most traits were significantly different between pre-bud set and post-bud set phase trees, with many traits showing at least 25 % alteration in mean value. Post-bud set, both the significance and direction of trait-trait relationships could be modified, with many relating directly to changes in leaf mass. In Populus, these dynamics in leaf traits throughout the summer season reflected a shift in whole plant physiology, but occurred long before the onset of leaf senescence. The marked shifts in measured trait values following bud set underscores the necessity to include phenology in trait-based ecological studies or large-scale phenotyping efforts, both at the local level and larger geographical scale.

AB Increased night-time temperatures, through their influence on dark respiration, have been implicated as a reason behind decreasing growth rates in tropical trees in the face of contemporary climate change. Seedlings of two neo-tropical tree species (Ficus insipida and Ochroma pyramidale) were grown in controlled-environment chambers at a constant daytime temperature (33 degrees C) and a range of increasing night-time temperatures (22, 25, 28, 31 degrees C) for between 39d and 54d. Temperature regimes were selected to represent a realistic baseline condition for lowland Panama, and a rise in night-time temperatures far in excess of those predicted for Central America in the coming decades. Experiments were complemented by an outdoor open-top chamber study in which night-time temperatures were elevated by 2.4 degrees C above ambient. Increasing night-time temperatures resulted in >2-fold increase in biomass accumulation in growth-chamber studies despite an increase in leaf-level dark respiration. Similar trends were seen in open-top chambers, in which elevated night-time temperatures resulted in stimulation of growth. These findings challenge simplistic considerations of photosynthesis-directed growth, highlighting the role of temperature-dependent night-time processes, including respiration and leaf development as drivers of plant performance in the tropics.

AB In most species, males do not abandon offspring or reduce paternal care when they are cuckolded by other males. This apparent lack of adjustment of paternal investment with the likelihood of paternity presents a potential challenge to our understanding of what drives selection for paternal care. In a comparative analysis across birds, fish, mammals, and insects we identify key factors that explain why cuckolded males in many species do not reduce paternal care. Specifically, we show that cuckolded males only reduce paternal investment if both the costs of caring are relatively high and there is a high risk of cuckoldry. Under these circumstances, selection is expected to favour males that reduce paternal effort in response to cuckoldry. In many species, however, these conditions are not satisfied and tolerant males have outcompeted males that abandon young.

AB Temperate grassland ecosystems face a future of precipitation change, which can alter community composition and ecosystem functions through reduced soil moisture and waterlogging. There is evidence that functionally diverse plant communities contain a wider range of water use and resource capture strategies, resulting in greater resistance of ecosystem function to precipitation change. To investigate this interaction between composition and precipitation change we performed a field experiment for three years in successional grassland in southern England. This consisted of two treatments. The first, precipitation change, simulated end of century predictions, and consisted of a summer drought phase alongside winter rainfall addition. The second, functional group identity, divided the plant community into three groups based on their functional traits- broadly described as perennials, caespitose grasses and annuals- and removed these groups in a factorial design. Ecosystem functions related to C, N and water cycling were measured regularly. Effects of functional groupidentity were apparent, with the dominant trend being that process rates were higher under control conditions where a range of perennial species were present. E.g. litter decomposition rates were significantly higher in plots containing several perennial species, the group with the highest average leaf N content. Process rates were also very strongly affected by the precipitation change treatmentwhen perennial plant species were dominant, but not where the community contained a high abundance of annual species and caespitose grasses. This contrasting response could be attributable to differing rooting patterns (shallower structures under annual plants, and deeper roots under perennials) and faster nutrient uptake in annuals compared to perennials. Our results indicate that precipitation change will have a smaller effect on key process rates in grasslandscontaining a range of perennial and annual species, and that maintaining the presence of key functional groups should be a crucial consideration in future grassland management.

AB In the Baltic Sea, cyanobacterial community is mainly composed of filamentous nitrogen-fixing forms, including the toxic Nodularia spumigena, and single-celled picocyanobacteria (Pcy), represented by Synechococcus spp. The main aim of the work was to test the hypothesis that the picocyanobacteria dependend on the presence of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. In addition, the contamination of blue mussels and fish with nodularin (NOD), the N. spumigena toxin, was examined. In years 2008-2011, the samples for the study were collected in the Southern Baltic Proper using FerryBox system and, occasionally, during research cruises. The analyses showed no correlation between the growth of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and Synechococcus. Compared with the previously published data, a shift in the composition of Pcy phenotypes was observed. This shift might be an indication of the proceeding changes induced by the reduced nutrient loading and/or climate change. Analyses of NOD revealed differences in the cyanotoxin concentrations between mussels of different shell size. The highest concentration of NOD was detected in the liver of round goby. However, temporarily, also the fish muscles were significantly contaminated with the toxin.

AB The saber-toothed cat, Smilodon fatalis, and American lion, Panthera atrox, were among the largest terrestrial carnivores that lived during the Pleistocene, going extinct along with other megafauna,12,000 years ago. Previous work suggests that times were difficult at La Brea (California) during the late Pleistocene, as nearly all carnivores have greater incidences of tooth breakage (used to infer greater carcass utilization) compared to today. As Dental Microwear Texture Analysis (DMTA) can differentiate between levels of bone consumption in extant carnivores, we use DMTA to clarify the dietary niches of extinct carnivorans from La Brea. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that times were tough at La Brea with carnivorous taxa utilizing more of the carcasses. Our results show no evidence of bone crushing by P. atrox, with DMTA attributes most similar to the extant cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, which actively avoids bone. In contrast, S. fatalis has DMTA attributes most similar to the African lion Panthera leo, implying that S. fatalis did not avoid bone to the extent previously suggested by SEM microwear data. DMTA characters most indicative of bone consumption (i.e., complexity and textural fill volume) suggest that carcass utilization by the extinct carnivorans was not necessarily more complete during the Pleistocene at La Brea; thus, times may not have been "tougher" than the present. Additionally, minor to no significant differences in DMTA attributes from older (similar to 30-35 Ka) to younger (similar to 11.5 Ka) deposits offer little evidence that declining prey resources were a primary cause of extinction for these large cats.

AB Mangroves are one of the most carbon-rich tropical ecosystems. Two fast-growing mangrove species of the genus Sonneratia, the native S. caseolaris and non-native S. apetala, have been widely used for mangrove reforestation in China; however their ability to sequester carbon is still unclear. The present study aimed to estimate the growth, carbon accumulation in biomass and carbon sequestration in sediments of these two species, in both mixed (50% S. caseolaris: 50% S. apetala) and monoculture plantations, in the intertidal zones of Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong Province, China. Twenty-five months of observation showed strong competition between the two species in the mixed plantation, with the native S. caseolaris outcompeting the non-native S. apetala due to a faster growth rate. Although S. caseolaris in the mixed plantation had lower carbon storage in biomass than in monoculture, carbon accumulation in sediment was higher in the mixed plantation. Thus, the relative advantage of the mixed plantation was in sequestering more carbon in sediment, as opposed to high carbon accumulation to biomass. These results indicated that the mixed plantation could be a good option for mangrove restoration and carbon sequestration of sediment. However, the two and a half years of this study may not indicate long-term trends, so more research on long-term species performance is essential for successful mangrove reforestation.

AB Aim Because intertidal organisms often live close to their physiological tolerance limits, they are potentially sensitive indicators of climate-driven changes in the environment. The goals of this study were to assess the effect of climatic and non-climatic factors on the geographical distribution of intertidal macroalgae, and to predict future distributions under different climate-warming scenarios. Location North-western Iberian Peninsula, southern Europe. Methods We developed distribution models for six ecologically important intertidal seaweed species. Occurrence and microhabitat data were sampled at 1-km2 resolution and analysed with climate variables measured at larger spatial scales. We used generalized linear models and applied the deviance and Bayesian information criterion to model the relationship between environmental variables and the distribution of each target species. We also used hierarchical partitioning (HP) to identify predictor variables with higher independent explanatory power. Results The distributions of Himanthalia elongata and Bifurcaria bifurcata were correlated with measures of terrestrial and marine climate, although in opposite directions. Model projections under two warming scenarios indicated the extinction of the former at a faster rate in the Cantabrian Sea (northern Spain) than in the Atlantic (west). In contrast, these models predicted an increase in the occurrence of B. bifurcata in both areas. The occurrences of Ascophyllum nodosum and Pelvetia canaliculata, species showing rather static historical distributions, were related to specific non-climatic environmental conditions and locations, such as the location of sheltered sites. At the southernmost distributional limit, these habitats may present favourable microclimatic conditions or provide refuges from competitors or natural enemies. Model performances for Fucus vesiculosus and F. serratus were similar and poor, but several climatic variables influenced the occurrence of the latter in the HP analyses. Main conclusions The correlation between species distributions and climate was evident for two species, whereas the distributions of the others were associated with non-climatic predictors. We hypothesize that the distribution of F. serratus responds to diverse combinations of factors in different sections of the north-west Iberian Peninsula. Our study shows how the response of species distributions to climatic and non-climatic variables may be complex and vary geographically. Our analyses also highlight the difficulty of making predictions based solely on variation in climatic factors measured at coarse spatial scales.

AB This article performs an in-depth examination on whether indices of diversity and equitability among tree size classes are adequate for studying the structural complexity of forests. Diversity profiles and the intrinsic diversity ordering of several field plots were compared. Results demonstrated that even-sized stands are intrinsically non-comparable to uneven-sized stands with regard to their diversity of size classes. Indices describing the diversity of size classes are consequently inadequate, as they order forest structural types (FSTs) inconsistently. The concept of equitability, obtained when removing the richness component from entropy, seemed more adequate for this purpose. Indices of equitability among size classes provided more consistent measures, since the field plots had comparable intrinsic equitability ordering. Furthermore, ranking individual trees by their size is a better approach than ranking size classes, and therefore it is more correct to measure the inequality of tree sizes rather than equitability among size classes. A particular interpretation of Lorenz curves applies when they are used for the study of forest structures, as they should also be compared to a theoretical uniform distribution, and not just the diagonal line-of-absolute-equality. Advised indices are Gini coefficient (GC), De Camino homogeneity (CH), and structure index based on variance (STVI), as they all are consistent with the Lorenz ordering. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hormones regulate decision-making strategies, in particular by translating an individual's physiological state into decisions on major behavioural and life-history processes, such as reproduction. Corticosterone, a glucocorticoid hormone, has been gaining attention as a mediator of reproductive effort, and experimentally elevated corticosterone concentrations have been shown to disrupt reproduction in avian species. Here, we tested whether individual variation in corticosterone concentrations is related to the decision for brood abandonment in free-living great tits, Parus major. Because of harsh environmental conditions, many adults abandoned their first broods in 2010, enabling us to ask which physiological, environmental and individual characteristics increased the probability of nest desertion by both males and females. The best predictors of nest desertion were high stress-induced corticosterone levels in males and low average nestling mass. Furthermore, high stress-induced corticosterone levels in 2010 appeared to represent plastic responses to environmental conditions and reproductive investment: individual males that abandoned their nests in 2010 had higher stress-induced corticosterone concentrations and produced nestlings with lower average mass than in 2009, when nesting successfully. Females that abandoned their nests in 2010 had higher baseline corticosterone concentrations than in 2009, when nesting successfully. Also, males that renested after abandonment in 2010 had lower stress-induced corticosterone concentrations and nestlings with higher mass. Finally, pairs that abandoned but renested later in 2010 had similar fledgling success at the end of the season as those that did not abandon. These results indicate that an individual's reproductive decision is the result of a plastic modulation of the corticosterone stress response that influences reproductive decisions according to environmental conditions.

AB Cyclocarya paliurus has been used for drug formulations and ingredients in functional foods in China. Field studies were conducted to examine the relationships between environmental factors and flavonoid accumulation. A split-plot randomized design was used to establish three shading treatments and three fertilization levels, and growth parameters and flavonoid contents were detected. The greatest biomass production was achieved in intermediate shade and fertilization treatment, and leaf production per seedling increased by 139.5% compared to the treatment without shade and fertilization. Overall, shade and fertilization had a significantly negative effect on contents of total flavonoid, kaempferol, quercetin, and isoquercitrin in leaves of C. paliurus. However, the greatest accumulation of total flavonoid in the leaves was observed in intermediate shade and fertilization treatment, achieving 364.4 g/plant. The results suggest that manipulating the field growing conditions and optimizing the silvicultural system would be important for obtaining the greatest yield of targeted health-promoting substances.

AB Background: The Chilean shoreline, a nearly strait line of coast expanding across 35 latitudinal degrees, represents an interesting region to assess historical processes using phylogeographic analyses. Stretching along the temperate section of the East Pacific margin, the region is characterized by intense geologic activity and has experienced drastic geomorphological transformations linked to eustatic and isostatic changes during the Quaternary. In this study, we used two molecular markers to evaluate the existence of phylogeographic discontinuities and detect the genetic footprints of Pleistocene glaciations among Patagonian populations of Mazzaella laminarioides, a low-dispersal benthic intertidal red seaweed that inhabits along similar to 3,700 km of the Chilean coastal rocky shore.
   Results: Three main genetic lineages were found within M. laminarioides. They are distributed along the Chilean coast in strict parapatry. The deep divergence among lineages suggests that they could be considered putative genetic sibling species. Unexpectedly, genetic breaks were not strictly concordant with the biogeographic breaks described in the region. A Northern lineage was restricted to a broad transition zone located between 30 degrees S and 33 degrees S and showed signals of a recent bottleneck. The reduction of population size could be related to warm events linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation, which is known to cause massive seaweed mortality in this region. To the south, we propose that transient habitat discontinuities driven by episodic tectonic uplifting of the shoreline around the Arauco region (37 degrees S-38 degrees S); one of the most active forearc-basins in the South East Pacific; could be at the origin of the Central/South genetic break. The large beaches, located around 38 degrees S, are likely to contribute to the lineages' integrity by limiting present gene flow. Finally, the Southern lineage, occupies an area affected by ice-cover during the last glaciations. Phylogeny suggested it is a derived clade and demographic analyses showed the lineage has a typical signature of postglacial recolonization from a northern glacial refugium area.
   Conclusions: Even if environmental adaptation could have strengthened divergence among lineages in M. laminarioides, low dispersal capacity and small population size are sufficient to generate phylogeographic discontinuities determined by genetic drift alone. Interestingly, our results confirm that seaweed population connectivity over large geographic scales does not rely only on dispersal capacity but also seem to depend highly on substratum availability and population density of the receiving locality.

AB Relatively, few species have been able to colonize extremely cold alpine environments. We investigate the role played by the cushion life form in the evolution of climatic niches in the plant genus Androsace s.l., which spreads across the mountain ranges of the Northern Hemisphere. Using robust methods that account for phylogenetic uncertainty, intraspecific variability of climatic requirements and different life-history evolution scenarios, we show that climatic niches of Androsace s.l. exhibit low phylogenetic signal and that they evolved relatively recently and punctually. Models of niche evolution fitted onto phylogenies show that the cushion life form has been a key innovation providing the opportunity to occupy extremely cold environments, thus contributing to rapid climatic niche diversification in the genus Androsace s.l. We then propose a plausible scenario for the adaptation of plants to alpine habitats.

AB Refugial populations at the rear edge are predicted to contain higher genetic diversity than those resulting from expansion, such as in post-glacial recolonizations. However, peripheral populations are also predicted to have decreased diversity compared to the centre of a species distribution. We aim to test these predictions by comparing genetic diversity in populations at the limits of distribution of the seagrass Zostera marina, with populations in the species previously described central diversity hotspot. Zostera marina populations show decreased allelic richness, heterozygosity and genotypic richness in both the rear edge and the leading edge compared to the diversity hotspot in the North Sea/Baltic region. However, when populations are pooled, genetic diversity at the southern range is as high as in the North Sea/Baltic region while the leading edge remains low in genetic diversity. The decreased genetic diversity in these southern Iberian populations compared to more central populations is possibly the effect of drift because of small effective population size, as a result of reduced habitat, low sexual reproduction and low gene flow. However, when considering the whole southern edge of distribution rather than per population, diversity is as high as in the central hotspot in the North Sea/Baltic region. We conclude that diversity patterns assessed per population can mask the real regional richness that is typical of rear edge populations, which have played a key role in the species biogeographical history and as marginal diversity hotspots have very high conservation value.

AB Natural hybridization is widespread among coral reef fishes. However, the ecological promoters and evolutionary consequences of reef fish hybridization have not been thoroughly evaluated. Butterflyfishes form a high number of hybrids and represent an appropriate group to investigate hybridization in reef fishes. This study provides a rare test of terrestrially derived hybridization theory in the marine environment by examining hybridization between Chaetodon trifasciatus and C. lunulatus at Christmas Island. Overlapping spatial and dietary ecologies enable heterospecific encounters. Nonassortative mating and local rarity of both parent species appear to permit heterospecific breeding pair formation. Microsatellite loci and mtDNA confirmed the status of hybrids, which displayed the lowest genetic diversity in the sample and used a reduced suite of resources, suggesting decreased adaptability. Maternal contribution to hybridization was unidirectional, and no introgression was detected, suggesting limited, localized evolutionary consequences of hybridization. Comparisons to other reef fish hybridization studies revealed that different evolutionary consequences emerge, despite being promoted by similar factors, possibly due to the magnitude of genetic distance between hybridizing species. This study highlights the need for further enquiry aimed at evaluating the importance and long-term consequences of reef fish hybridization.

AB Wildlife monitoring surveys are prone to nondetection errors and false positives. To determine factors that affect the incidence of these errors, we built an Internet-based survey that simulated avian point counts, and measured error rates among volunteer observers. Using similar-sounding vocalizations from paired rare and common bird species, we measured the effects of species rarity and observer skill, and the influence of a reward system that explicitly encouraged the detection of rare species. Higher self-reported skill levels and common species independently predicted fewer nondetections (probability range: 0.11 [experts, common species] to 0.54 [moderates, rare species]). Overall proportions of detections that were false positives increased significantly as skill level declined (range: 0.06 [experts, common species] to 0.22 [moderates, rare species]). Moderately skilled observers were significantly more likely to report false-positive records of common species than of rare species, whereas experts were significantly more likely to report false-positives of rare species than of common species. The reward for correctly detecting rare species did not significantly affect these patterns. Because false positives can also result from observers overestimating their own abilities ("overconfidence"), we lastly tested whether observers' beliefs that they had recorded error-free data ("confidence") tended to be incorrect ("overconfident"), and whether this pattern varied with skill. Observer confidence increased significantly with observer skill, whereas overconfidence was uniformly high (overall mean proportion = 0.73). Our results emphasize the value of controlling for observer skill in data collection and modeling and do not support the use of opinion-based (i.e., subjective) indications of observer confidence.

AB The distribution and heritability of many traits depends on numerous loci in the genome. In general, the astronomical number of possible genotypes makes the system with large numbers of loci difficult to describe. Multilocus evolution, however, greatly simplifies in the limit of weak selection and frequent recombination. In this limit, populations rapidly reach quasilinkage equilibrium (QLE) in which the dynamics of the full genotype distribution, including correlations between alleles at different loci, can be parametrized by the allele frequencies. This review provides a simplified exposition of the concept and mathematics of QLE which is central to the statistical description of genotypes in sexual populations. Key results of quantitative genetics such as the generalized Fisher's "fundamental theorem," along with Wright's adaptive landscape, are shown to emerge within QLE from the dynamics of the genotype distribution. This is followed by a discussion under what circumstances QLE is applicable, and what the breakdown of QLE implies for the population structure and the dynamics of selection. Understanding the fundamental aspects of multilocus evolution obtained through simplified models may be helpful in providing conceptual and computational tools to address the challenges arising in the studies of complex quantitative phenotypes of practical interest.

AB In human-altered environments, organisms may preferentially settle in poor-quality habitats where fitness returns are lower relative to available higher-quality habitats. Such ecological trapping is due to a mismatch between the cues used during habitat selection and the habitat quality. Maladaptive settlement decisions may occur when organisms are time-constrained and have to rapidly evaluate habitat quality based on incomplete knowledge of the resources and conditions that will be available later in the season. During a three-year study, we examined settlement decision-making in the long-distance migratory, open-habitat bird, the Red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), as a response to recent land-use changes. In Northwest Europe, the shrikes typically breed in open areas under a management regime of extensive farming. In recent decades, Spruce forests have been increasingly managed with large-size cutblocks in even-aged plantations, thereby producing early-successional vegetation areas that are also colonised by the species. Farmland and open areas in forests create mosaics of two different types of habitats that are now occupied by the shrikes. We examined redundant measures of habitat preference (order of settlement after migration and distribution of dominant individuals) and several reproductive performance parameters in both habitat types to investigate whether habitat preference is in line with habitat quality. Territorial males exhibited a clear preference for the recently created open areas in forests with higher-quality males settling in this habitat type earlier. Reproductive performance was, however, higher in farmland, with higher nest success, offspring quantity, and quality compared to open areas in forests. The results showed strong among-year consistency and we can therefore exclude a transient situation. This study demonstrates a case of maladaptive habitat selection in a farmland bird expanding its breeding range to human-created open habitats in plantations. We discuss the reasons that could explain this decision-making and the possible consequences for the population dynamics and persistence.

AB Widespread species have the potential to reveal large-scale biogeographical patterns, as well as responses to environmental changes possibly unique to habitat generalists. This study presents a continental-scale phylogeographical analysis of Polyommatus icarus, one of the most common Palaearctic butterflies, and the morphologically and ecologically similar Polyommatus celina, a recently discovered cryptic species. By combining data from mitochondrial [cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)] and nuclear [internal transcribed spacer (ITS2)] molecular markers with geometric morphometrics, we document a complex phylogeographical history for the two species. Despite morphological similarities, the genetic divergence between these two species is high (more than 5% at COI) and they are not sister species. For the first time, we show that P. celina occurs not only in North Africa but also in Europe, where it inhabits several west Mediterranean islands, as well as large parts of Iberia, where it occurs in parapatry with P. icarus. The two species appear to completely exclude each other on islands, but we provide morphological and molecular evidence that introgression occurred in the Iberian Peninsula. We discovered strongly diverged lineages that seem to represent relict populations produced by past range expansions and contractions: Crete and Iberian isolates for P. icarus, Balearics-Sardinia and Sicily-Lipari for P. celina. This study shows that a combined genetic-morphometric approach can shed light on cryptic diversity while providing the necessary resolution to reconstruct a fine-scale phylogeographical history of species at both spatial and temporal levels.

AB Given the important role of parent-youth communication in adolescent well-being and quality of life, we sought to examine the relationship between specific communication variables and youth perceived quality of life in general and as a deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) individual. A convenience sample of 230 youth (mean age = 14.1, standard deviation = 2.2; 24% used sign only, 40% speech only, and 36% sign 1 speech) was surveyed on communication-related issues, generic and DHH-specific quality of life, and depression symptoms. Higher youth perception of their ability to understand parents' communication was significantly correlated with perceived quality of life as well as lower reported depressive symptoms and lower perceived stigma. Youth who use speech as their single mode of communication were more likely to report greater stigma associated with being DHH than youth who used both speech and sign. These findings demonstrate the importance of youths' perceptions of communication with their parents on generic and DHH-specific youth quality of life.
